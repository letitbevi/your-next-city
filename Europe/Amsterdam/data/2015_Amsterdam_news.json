The projects are part of a growing trend among academic researchers to seek funding for their work outside traditional government and industry-backed sources. Faced with the threat of budget cuts and intense competition for the money that remains, scientists around the world are instead turning directly to the public for the help they need. In the process, they are unlocking millions of pounds via crowdfunding websites, but there are fears that as the funding becomes more significant it will skew the type of research being done or give governments an excuse to pull back from funding science. A particularly eye-catching example was the announcement in November of an attempt to build the first crowdfunded moon lander, which will drill deep into the lunar surface to study the rock beneath. Lunar Mission One said it wants to transform the way space exploration is funded by raising \u00a3600,000 to start the project from millions of small payments by the public. In return for higher payments, supporters are promised space on the mission to send a strand of their hair.     Millions of small payments from the public could put Lunar Mission One on the moon.  Illustration: Lunar Missions    Many other scientists are turning to the crowd. Dr David Kipping, a British astronomer now based at Harvard, has raised funds to help his search to find the first exomoon \u2013 a moon that orbits a planet in another solar system. His ambitious project involves sifting through huge quantities of data gathered by the Kepler Space Telescope as it stares into space, looking for an almost imperceptible change in brightness from a star that might indicate a planet with a moon passing in front of it. In less than a month he was able to raise $12,000 (\u00a37,700) from public contributions through the crowdfunding site PetriDish, giving his team enough to buy a small supercomputer needed to crunch the numbers. It has allowed them to examine 57 planetary systems beyond our own solar system for signs that one might harbour a moon and has led to a $2m grant from Nasa to extend the search to look around hundreds of exoplanets. Dr Kipping said: \u201cWhen I first started on the project it was very difficult to get the funding we needed \u2013 we had just 64 desktop computers that were nowhere near powerful enough. \u201cOur project really seemed to strike a chord with the public \u2013 I think because everyone could understand what an exomoon was and how exciting it could be.\u201d Although many crowdfunding websites are cautious about revealing exactly how much money has been raised for science, money from this source is now estimated to contribute millions of pounds to the research community. SciFund Challenge, for example, has allowed nearly 200 researchers to raise an average of $2,000 (\u00a31,272) for 159 different projects. Hundreds of projects on RocketHub have raised up to half a million dollars each. But there are some who fear that using crowdfunding to support science could alter the balance of what research gets the green light. Certainly, the list of projects vying for money includes some unusual science, such as a US ecologist who has been trying to record the sounds that fish in the Amazon make, and as an enticement offers funders the opportunity to download the sound of a fish farting as a ringtone on their phone.     Some research proposals will have clear public appeal, such as a study to determine how much tranquilliser would have been needed to stop a T rex in its tracks. Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images    Another is a vet at Iowa State University who wants to work out how much tranquilliser would be needed to bring down a Tyrannosaurus rex by studying dinosaur DNA. There are fears that crowdfunding could skew what research gets done. Sarah Main, director of the UK\u2019s Campaign for Science and Engineering, said: \u201cThere is a real question about the quality of science that will get funding if there is more of a reliance on crowdfunding. Putting together a proposal that is attractive to the public does not have to be as scientifically robust as putting an application into a panel of experts. \u201cI would be concerned about the effect of having to ensure that proposals have public appeal. A different type of work would attract that kind of funding and many of the important areas, such as in medical research, would be overlooked.\u201d However, there are some who believe crowdfunding will complement the current research structure, allowing studies that are overlooked by traditional funding sources or considered too controversial to receive government money, to blossom.     A US ecologist is recording the sounds that fish in the Amazon make, and offers funders the opportunity to download the sound of a fish farting as a ringtone. Photograph: Alamy    Professor David Nutt, a neuropsychopharmacologist at Imperial College London who was controversially sacked from the UK government\u2019s Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs over his views on the dangers of ecstasy, is to launch a bid to raise funding for research into the effects of LSD on the brain through a British-based crowdfunding site called Walacea. This, according to Dr Didier Schmitt, a scientific adviser to the European commission \u2013 which itself is threatening cuts to its science budget \u2013 could be the real power of crowdfunding in the future. \u201cIn the case of projects competing for public funding, crowdfunding is a measure of citizen interest and could be used to help decision-makers and experts in their final choice,\u201d he said. Brian Meece, founder of RocketHub, argues that crowdfunding is empowering the public to choose: \u201cWe don\u2019t judge campaigns based on content, as long as the project is legal and tasteful, it has a shot. \u201cThese academic campaigns empower \u2018the people\u2019 to fund science \u2013 a paradigm shift, since science has been traditionally supported by governments, endowments or other institutions.\u201d Walacea was founded in October 2013 by Natalie Jonk, a 32-year-old former scientific adviser in the pharmaceutical industry, after she saw the difficulty young scientists were having getting funding for their work. \u201cScientific research really shapes our society and can really improve our lives,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the same time, getting funding is really difficult. Only about 10 to 20% of funding applications are successful and it is particularly difficult for scientists early in their career. \u201cThere has been a lot of focus on trying to encourage more young people into science, but actually that is not the problem. There are a lot of people who want to do research, it is getting funded that is the issue.\u201d There is still some way to go before crowdfunding can begin to replace the \u00a35bn the British government has set aside in the budget for 2015/2016 for scientific research or the \u00a3140bn the US government spent on science last year. Imran Khan, chief executive of the British Science Association, believes that while crowdfunding could lead to scientists dreaming up projects that are likely to capture the public imagination, it could ultimately help science. \u201cIf crowdfunding does become an appreciable part of the mix down the road then we might see more scientists deliberately thinking up projects that would have a direct public appeal,\u201d he said. \u201cBut equally it might change how the public sees science. Scientists might become better at explaining the value of research that\u2019s happening anyway, and non-scientists might become better at tuning in to it.\u201d     Crowdfunding paid for a supercomputer to search for exomoons in the vast quantities of data from the Kepler space telescope.

Dr David Kipping, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics How much does he want? $10,000 (target reached) What will he do with the money? The Kepler Space Telescope has now identified 996 exoplanets, with another 4,000 candidates still to be confirmed. Many of these are giant worlds, far bigger than our own and probably too hostile for life. Yet in orbit around some of these planets, there may be Earth-sized moons that could provide a refuge for alien life. There have already been hints that there may be exomoons out there, but none has yet been identified. Dr Kipping and his team have used the money to buy a small supercomputer that allowed them to analyse data from 57 planets by looking for tiny, periodic changes in the brightness of stars that may indicate the presence of the moon.

How much do they want? $8,000 What will they do with the money? After the species was wiped out by hungry sailors during the 17th century, the only information about what the dodo ate and what it\u2019s odd-shaped beak was for are a few sketchy accounts in ship records and diaries. Some say the one-metre-tall relatives of pigeons ate large fruit or hard nuts, others say they used their beaks as weapons. The scientists want to finally answer this question by conducting detailed biomechanical research on 3D models of the creature\u2019s head.     The psychedelic drug LSD could have therapeutic uses.

Professor David Nutt and Dr Robin Carhart-Harris, Imperial College London How much do they want? \u00a330,000 (yet to be launched) What will they do with the money? The researchers are hoping to use MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and magnetoencephalography to monitor the brain activity of people when they take the psychedelic drug LSD. They believe the drug could have therapeutic potential and that it is time to end the 50-year stigma surrounding its use. They hypothesise that it could \u201creset\u201d normal brain function in people struggling to cope with addiction and depression. The money raised through the crowdfunding site will be matched by the Beckley Foundation, a charity run by English aristocrat Amanda Feilding.

Some centipedes can deliver venom to instantly disable their prey. For a human the venom can cause severe pain, but recent research suggests that it also contains a cocktail of compounds that may be useful for medicine or as pesticides. The researchers hope to isolate and identify the toxins that will be most beneficial.     Andy Gersick wants to learn the language of the spotted hyena.

Andy Gersick, University of Pennsylvania How much do they want? $5,000 (target reached) What will they do with the money? The haunting call of the spotted hyena can be heard from several miles away, but scientists know very little about what these calls mean. To human ears, the whooping noises all sound the same, but these highly social animals will react in different ways to certain calls \u2013 some may be alarms while others appear to contain more complex information. The researchers want to use recordings of calls to investigate the associated behaviours. Gersick also hopes to test the hypothesis that hyenas choose acoustically favourable spots in their territories to broadcast some whoops far and wide. \u2022 This article was amended on 9 January 2015.

It\u2019s certainly delivered in terms of sales, but does the book live up to the hype? At the tender age of 18, aristocratic Petronella Oortman is delivered from sequestered country life to the smart Herengracht house of her wealthy merchant husband, Johannes Brandt. It is 1686, and Amsterdam is a thriving, prosperous port \u2013 as conservative and puritanical as a Daily Mail editorial. The household into which Nella (and her pet, a caged green parakeet by the name of Peebo) arrives is run by Marin, Johannes\u2019s prickly spinster sister. She eats one herring for breakfast, publicly, and scoffs candied walnuts in private. The house is staffed by orphan Cornelia and former slave Otto; Nella has never before seen a man of such dark skin. Johannes is absent, and when he isn\u2019t, he\u2019s elusive. Nella can\u2019t get near him and their marriage looks set never to be consummated. To amuse and divert Nella, Johannes presents her with an exquisitely made doll\u2019s house, to furnish as she wishes. It is the very image of the house in which she lives, stuffed with oil paintings, rich textiles and objets d\u2019art. Nella commissions a mysterious miniaturist, whose parcels contain finely crafted items \u2013 some unasked for \u2013 and dolls that reflect and sometimes predict the events in Nella\u2019s increasingly bizarre life. A dealer in sugar and spice, Johannes in fact prefers potatoes. Because of the city-wide ban on sugar, he hoards sugar loaves belonging to some complicated clients in a damp warehouse, a key part in his downfall. Burton uses sugar as a metaphor for the repressed greed and hypocrisy of Amsterdam; the shades of modern London also can\u2019t be ignored. When Johannes is discovered by Nella in the throes of passion with his lover, the unexpected thing is how remarkably worldly Nella is, considering her age and background. For the sensitive reader, this may be where the suspension of disbelief breaks down. This would be a shame, as Burton is evidently a talented writer of precise and exquisitely (sometimes too exquisitely) wrought prose. This, combined with a racy plot, makes The Miniaturist read like Downton Abbey as told by Hilary Mantel. The Miniaturist is published by Picador (\u00a37.99).

There\u2019s a whole sack of new sustainable development goals to sign-off as well. Intended to allow the whole human population to thrive within planetary boundaries, these 17 principal goals were meant to be concise, global, limited in number, action-oriented and easy to communicate. The big ones like \u2018end poverty in all its forms everywhere\u2019 are wonderful. But they are also hilariously out of alignment with the current direction of the economies that created the problems in the first place. Finance is still in the driving seat, with Goldman Sachs giving 121 of its UK traders and chief bankers an average pay packet of \u00a33m. The latest data showed inequality rising in the UK, median incomes down and the net wealth of financial corporations up by 373%.  Crucially, if just the climate boulder doesn\u2019t get up the hill of 2015, the impacts of irreversible global warming will kiss goodbye all the other sustainable development goals regardless, however great they sound. Memories of the failure of the 2009 Copenhagen climate talks create fears that the challenge is a doomed, repetitive, Sisyphean labour. Worse still, in real life rather than mythology, King Sisyphus himself gets to skip the original rock-rolling punishment for being crafty, cruel, and hubristic, very like the heedless financial markets. The endless heave is left to other, lowlier subjects. Pretty bleak, or is it? Smart policy makers could grab some unexpected opportunities to win two of the greatest prizes in green economics: to tackle the price of carbon and find the scale of resources needed to invest in transition. Both might set the scene positively to prevent the forthcoming drama of Paris from becoming a tragedy. Things keep happening which suggest that there is more room for manoeuvre than previously thought. Few, for example, foresaw the recent fall in the price of oil. When it was comfortably above $100 (\u00a365) per barrel, making the case for a carbon floor price \u2013 designed to raise the cost of pollution and make clean investment more attractive \u2013 was vulnerable to the argument that while the economy was still ticking over, the extra cost may be critically damaging. That\u2019s a much harder case to make with the oil price now below $60 per barrel. It\u2019s an ideal political moment now to set the tone for the year and implement a floor price. Industry has become accustomed to the higher price and should be able to adapt without missing a beat. The other opportunity emerges from the logical gap in the UK, and in varying degrees across Europe, between official commitment to austerity in the name of deficit reduction, and the return to political favour of public investment in infrastructure. This matters for several reasons. In the UK, austerity measures have failed to meet deficit reduction targets, while promoting labour policies that undermine the tax base, making meeting the targets even harder. Now, if there is to be spending on infrastructure, to support a modern economy it would have to be green and low carbon. This would solve several problems at once like creating good jobs, generating tax receipts, lowering energy bills, insulating the economy from the geopolitics and price volatility of fossil fuels, and boldly striding toward Paris by tackling climate change. Massively expanding the Green Collar sector, starting with the renovation of homes, could be funded by new, targeted quantitative easing \u2013 an innovative spending tool that avoids conventional government borrowing and holds no technical barriers to implementation according to Mark Carney, governor of the Bank of England. Wim Boonstra, chief economist of the huge Dutch Rabobank and professor of economic policy at VU University, Amsterdam, recently argued for a huge \u20ac1tn programme of public investment funded by \u2018monetary expansion\u2019 from the European Central Bank (ECB), in other words Europe-wide quantitative easing, to avoid deflation across Europe. Investment at this scale in the low carbon transition of Europe\u2019s infrastructure might finally send a global message that rich countries are serious about climate targets.  Of course, any such programme needs to be well-targeted \u2013 think of it being about \u2018lifeboat\u2019 rather than \u2018helicopter money\u2019, intended for making a more comfortable, well-employed and climate-proof economic boat, rather than just loading more random consumption onto the leaky, low-in-the-water one we already have. And it would need watching hawkishly to avoid unintended consequences, but the need is there and the potential is enormous.  Elsewhere, good news comes from recent research at the University of California-Berkeley. It gives welcome academic support to the season\u2019s enduring celebration of the possibility of new beginnings, and a really good excuse to stay in bed. Things that make us happy, it seems, also help us get off the treadmill of rising energy consumption.  Echoing other studies, it found a strong link between behaviour shifts that add to our life satisfaction and lower our consumption of energy. Activities like volunteering, sleeping more, spending more time with friends and exercising, have little to do with the classic vision of consumers buying more stuff to fuel an economic recovery, but they have a lot to do with the human recovery needed if we are to find a better way to be in the world. And it might just stop that big rock rolling down the hill again.", "sentences": ["Wim Boonstra, chief economist of the huge Dutch Rabobank and professor of economic policy at VU University, Amsterdam, recently argued for a huge \u20ac1tn programme of public investment funded by \u2018monetary expansion\u2019 from the European Central Bank (ECB), in other words Europe-wide quantitative easing, to avoid deflation across Europe."], "title": "Paris climate talks the most significant task ahead of us in 2015", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/05/paris-climate-talks-the-most-significant-task-ahead-of-us-in-2015", "tags": ["Global climate talks", "Environment", "Sustainable development", "Sustainable development goals", "Climate change"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-01-05T18:22:05Z", "article": "BBC News and RT, the Kremlin-backed news channel, have both been cleared by Ofcom after complaints their respective coverage of the shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17. The MH17 flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur was shot down over the conflict-hit region of eastern Ukraine in July last year, claiming the lives of 283 passengers, including 80 children, and 15 crew members. One viewer complained to the media regulator after the BBC News channel broadcast a picture of a passenger\u2019s passport photo page as part of a sequence of still images showing debris from the crashed plane on 17 July, during live coverage on the day MH17 was shot down. The image was on screen for five seconds. Ofcom ruled that although that the image was capable of causing offence \u2013 which on balance was not justified by the context \u2013 as the BBC had apologised and acknowledged that the picture was unsuitable for broadcast, it considered the matter resolved. The complaint against RT, which was investigated and found by the watchdog to not breach broadcasting rules, centred on the use of graphic imagery of bodies at the crash site, also on 17 July. An Ofcom spokesman said: \u201cHaving reviewed the evidence, Ofcom found the BBC took steps to limit any offence caused; including apologising and ensuring the image was not shown again in later reports. As a result we consider the matter resolved.\u201d The regulator found RT had taken \u201csufficient steps to limit the potential for offence\u201d, according to the Ofcom spokesman. \u201cThis included pixelating graphic imagery and only broadcasting it after the watershed,\u201d Ofcom said. London-based correspondent Sara Firth, who worked at RT for five years, resigned in protest over her employer\u2019s coverage of the immediate aftermath of the flight\u2019s shooting down. The offending BBC News channel image was aired at 5.40pm during a studio discussion concerning the number of casualties sustained by Ukrainian forces during the on-going conflict with separatist groups. During the discussion, the broadcaster started to show a sequence of still images labelled as: \u201cBreaking News: Ukraine Plane Crash. Eyewitnesses report seeing bodies next to plane.\u201d Ofcom\u2019s concerns focused on a still image in relative close-up of the photograph page of a victim\u2019s passport. The BBC noted in its submission to Ofcom that just before the broadcast it had learned that footage \u2013 including the passport grab \u2013 of the crash site, sourced \u201coff-air from a Russian TV station\u201d, was available. Because the material had already been edited and provided by a \u201ctrusted agency provider\u201d, the BBC decided to \u201ctake the material straight to air\u201d. The BBC said the images in the sequence were: not graphic; had \u201cclearly been prepared for broadcast\u201d; and, included \u201cone five-second shot of a passport in which the photograph of the person it belonged to was visible\u201d. It added that the presenter had \u201cmade it clear that the material was being shown for the first time\u201d. The BBC went on to tell Ofcom that it \u201cimmediately recognised that this image carried the potential for distress\u201d following transmission and told its staff to ensure the image was not shown again. In deciding the matter was resolved, Ofcom said although the BBC had strictly speaking breached rule 2.3 of the broadcasting code in airing potentially offensive material that was not justified by the context, it had taken into account that broadcasters and audiences have a right to freedom of expression. Ofcom also said the MH17 report was \u201cclearly a matter of significant public interest\u201d . Because the BBC apologised and took immediate steps to alert staff to the content to ensure it was not broadcast again, Ofcom said it considered this matter resolved. Sky News was criticised by Ofcom in October for causing \u201cconsiderable offence\u201d for broadcasting images of one of its presenters handling a passenger\u2019s belongings at the crash site. Ofcom received more than 200 complaints after Sky News presenter Colin Brazier was shown picking through an open suitcase in a live broadcast in July. As in the BBC News channel case, the regulator concluded that Sky News had strictly speaking breached rule 2.3 of the broadcasting code, but took into account factors including the apology by the broadcaster and Brazier and ruled that the matter was resolved. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian newsdesk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

Before being lured to the Met, he was at Tate Modern for six years, becoming curator of international modern art and working on exhibitions including Cy Twombly: Cycles and Seasons (2008) and Edvard Munch: The Modern Eye (2012). Educated at the Courtauld Institute of Art, he worked at the NPG as a visitor services assistant while he was a visiting teacher for his MA course. His duties included directing visitors around the gallery, giving talks about portraits and working on the information desk. Sir William Proby, the chair of trustees at the NPG, said of Cullinan: \u201cHe is an outstanding curator and art historian, and has wide-ranging international experience.

With Twitter and Facebook declining, political parties will expand their use of other platforms.\u201d At last, big data has a practical use Predictive analytics is the new buzz phrase. The practice allows marketers to use the vast amounts of real-time data they mine from consumers, along with customer insight, to predict future events. Data from loyalty programmes, for example, allows stores to analyse past buying behaviour and predict which coupons or promotions a customer is most likely to use. Predictive analytics could also be applied to website browsing behaviours to deliver a personalised online experience. But proceed with caution: consumers are wary of Big Brother watching. Everything will be Uberised \u201cThe Uber of\u201d is probably the world\u2019s most popular business concept. The pitch gets the point across. If you say \u201cthe Uber of bicycles\u201d or \u201cthe Uber of grocery delivery\u201d everyone knows what you\u2019re selling. Plus it sounds cool. Vice recently reported that British companies are in a race to become the Uber of something, with at least six recently launching in laundry alone. Small (business) is the new big We all know the narrative: entrepreneur comes up with hot idea, launches startup, works non-stop in the garage, gains traction, has an IPO, and pockets megabucks. And the counternarrative: there\u2019s simply more job security in working for someone else. In a Financial Times op-ed on the need for business schools to adapt to the UK\u2019s \u201cstartup surge\u201d, Michael Hayman wrote: \u201cRather than a nation of Goliaths, the UK has emerged as a home for legions of small-business Davids\u201d. Michael\u2019s point is supported by the fact that the UK was the 14th most entrepreneurial nation in the world on the Global Entrepreneurship Index for 2013, but for 2015 it climbed to number four. Borders disappear between business-to-business (B2B) and business-to-consumer (B2C) Rob van Beek, CEO of Havas Worldwide Amsterdam, pointed this one out. Now that we all see ourselves as brands, we\u2019re all in business, even as we\u2019re consumers. Stakeholders don\u2019t fit neatly into boxes. What\u2019s more important than the old distinctions is H2H: human-to-human. Media agencies will lead the way This hits home for me, since I see PR falling into media agencies in this age of created, earned and paid placements. Richard Dunmall in Media Week recently named agency role as a top trend for 2015, citing the fact that MediaCom, iProspect and MEC all joined the Content Marketing Association: \u201cIt\u2019s clear media agencies are blurring the once clear lines between themselves and advertising agencies.\u201d Agency search consultant Avi Dan, writing on Forbes.com, explains: \u201cToday creativity is the currency of an effective media placement. Media agencies will be moving from being media-facing to consumer-facing \u2026 They will become their clients\u2019 key strategic partner, even more so than creative agencies, as big data and technology make \u2018Math Men\u2019 the most important asset of marketers.\u201d Chief marketing officers (CMOs) will become chief simplifier officers Dan also argues that companies create needless complexity by reorganising themselves into \u201cendless new vertical silos\u201d. To increase connection with consumers, he says, CMOs need to think holistically about the value their brand will deliver to customers and integrating messages \u201cacross business units, geographies and functional groups\u201d. Chief financial officers (CFOs) will become chief frontier officers Virtual reality, augmented reality, new social sites, new technology platforms \u2013 it\u2019s tough to keep up. And consumers are getting increasingly fickle. James Wright, managing director of Red Agency Australia and Havas PR APAC, says CFOs must shake up their mindset, develop more innovative strategies, take risks and seek new paths to central growth.

The news coincides with warnings that \u201cbrilliant minds\u201d are being forced out of theatre, unable to make a decent living. A survey by the industry group Stage Directors UK found the average salary for directors in subsidised theatres was \u00a310,759, far below the average national wage of \u00a326,500. Some were being paid the equivalent of less than \u00a31 an hour. The figures have highlighted concerns that theatre is becoming the preserve of the wealthy and privileged, with low wages making it unaffordable for those without other income or financial support. The report says that \u201cat entry level and on the fringe, matters are even worse\u201d. \u201c\u00a31,500 is common [for several months\u2019 work], \u00a3200 is not unheard of, and many productions pay nothing at all, or sacrifice the director\u2019s fee the moment funding runs short. It is not surprising, then, that some talented people without alternative sources of income are forced to leave the profession at all stages.\u201d Matthew Xia, associate artistic director of the Manchester Royal Exchange, who comes from a low-income, single parent, east London background, said he had been consistently forced to subsidise his income by working as a DJ, besides relying on his higher-earning partner. \u201cI think, if you look at the sector and the people who are holding the top positions, running the major theatre organisations, you will find so few of them from a working-class background, and I think that\u2019s one of the biggest hindrances. \u201cIt\u2019s also the same with the number of women who are running organisations, because so often when they have children they are taken out of the workplace and then find it hard to re-enter on a salary that doesn\u2019t allow them to pay for the child care. Without a support network and some kind of financial background, it can be impossible.\u201d The survey of 346 directors showed the majority in London earned between \u00a32,000 and \u00a33,000 for each production, usually amounting to about two or three months\u2019 work, with more than a fifth earning under \u00a31,000. In regional theatres almost half the directors earned less than \u00a32,500 for each job. Nationwide, the report showed that directors were unpaid for half the time they worked on a production. In London, the highest paying subsidised theatre, excluding the National Theatre, was the Almeida, which was paying fees of \u00a36,750 for a production, while outside the capital the highest paying theatre was Chichester, paying \u00a36,993. The lowest paying London theatre was Soho, paying \u00a3670, and, regionally, Sherman Cymru, offering fees of \u00a32,183. Only 5% of directors were found to earn above \u00a37,000 for a directing job at a subsidised London theatre. Xia said that while theatres were under increasing pressure to diversify their audiences, the lack of those from varied social backgrounds directing in the theatre industry, often because of the low wages, made that a difficult challenge. Xia said: \u201cThe single most direct way you can diversify your audience is to change the content of your production on your stage. That content needs to be generated by someone, and if that person can\u2019t afford to generate that content, then it will never happen. \u201cIf I go back to freelance directing I would only be earning about \u00a39,000 a year, and that\u2019s me fitting in as many shows as is humanly possible, normally about three or four. \u201cWhat is increasingly apparent for me is that we are all being asked to diversify across the board organisationally \u2013 but how can we do that if the people from low income backgrounds, which often includes people from a diverse range of ethnic backgrounds as well, just can\u2019t sustain themselves working in the industry without financial support? \u201cI\u2019ve seen so many talented people forced to drop off directing, or step away from the creative side of theatre, because it became unaffordable, which is a shame because we are losing some brilliant minds and really interesting ways of thinking. It will be just [as] Peter Bazalgette said, \u2018We will end up with work that is male, pale and stale.\u2019\u201d The report found that even directors considered successful and established \u2013 say, directing four productions a year in prestigious theatres such as the Royal Court, Donmar, Young Vic, or Hampstead Theatre \u2013 were earning top salaries of only about \u00a322,000. This pay was found to be considerably lower than that paid to directors working at a similar level abroad; in Germany they earned about \u00a332,600, in Amsterdam \u00a329,900 and in Warsaw \u00a337,260. Jemma Gross, artistic director of the theatre company Epsilon Productions and a board member of Stage Directors UK, said the figures were depressing. She said she had subsidised her director\u2019s income with office work, drama teaching and time as a children\u2019s entertainer; even then she had required family assistance. \u201cI\u2019m still struggling up that directing ladder and there is this assumption that when you get to a certain level you will be able to live off what you do. So the shocking realisation that you can\u2019t \u2013 that\u2019s been a major revelation to me. \u201cOn a diversity level, it is absolutely a major problem. If I didn\u2019t have the help of my family I just wouldn\u2019t be able to contemplate directing. My biggest concern is that I meet lots of young students and passionate actors who later in life want to bring their wealth of knowledge and experience to directing but have no feasible way of sustaining themselves directing.\u201d Gross said last week she had seen an advert for an assistant directing job at an off-West End theatre offering only \u00a350 for a month\u2019s work. \u201cThat\u2019s just laughable,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I believe it\u2019s already had a negative effect on diversity in terms of the plays on stage \u2026 it will continue to have a negative effect because if the only voices really pushing through to mid-range level or higher in theatre are all from a wealthy, privileged background, it means our theatres become homogenous and [do not represent] all voices across society\u2026 It means a lot of wonderful potential voices are never going to get heard.\u201d In fringe theatre, where most directors begin their career and establish their names, 42% were found to be earning under \u00a3100. Robyn Winfield-Smith, assistant director of the arts centre Omnibus in Clapham, London, said she saved for four years before she could afford to pursue directing full time. She echoed concerns about the impact low pay had on diversity in the theatre. \u201cThese figures do substantiate the feeling \u2026 that there is a level of underpayment going on, in terms of not valuing amount of time spent. But to see the facts in black and white is shocking,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we continue the way we are, we are not only going to deter people who don\u2019t have the contacts or assets to get into the industry, but make it completely impossible for them to work. I think the pool of directors in this country will stagnate unless we can provide ways in for those at the bottom and give them a sustainable salary.\u201d David Lan, artistic director of the Young Vic, said: \u201cOf course it impacts on diversity. Even when we can\u2019t pay these directors properly many of those people will nonetheless be driven to make their work, and I respect that \u2026 on the other hand if you aren\u2019t paying people properly that is a real problem. We are trying to do a complicated thing on very limited resources.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 8 January 2015.

Recorded for a Boiler Room session in Germany sponsored by Ballantine\u2019s whisky (whose imagery you might well notice throughout) it comes as part of their Stay True Journeys series. Techno is naturally po-faced, so can seem awfully haughty when it actually tries to be serious and edge its way into the conservatoire. But whether its Villalobos and Loderbauer mining the ECM archives, or Craig and Moritz Von Oswald turning Ravel into dub techno, the worlds of classical music and techno can potentially dovetail beautifully. So it (mostly) proves here as Craig sends acid arpeggios on skewed axes, before Tristano returns with full-blooded house chords. Piano sounds are usually approximated in dance music, often beautifully and strangely, but it\u2019s satisfying to hear the grand piano put to use in the unbecoming business of a fist-pumping anthem. You see can more from the same Boiler Room series here.            Lena Willikens Another Guardian premiere here, from the debut EP of Cologne producer Lena Willikens, out next week on Matias Aguayo\u2019s Comeme label. Willikens made a name for herself as an artist with immaculate taste: She\u2019s hosted the likes of Hieroglyphic Being and Theo Parrish at her Dusseldorf club residency, and her brilliant podcast, Sentimental Flashback, showcases her crate-digging \u2013 one week will be her favourite bass guitar lines, the next, cold war-era German pop, the next a tour through global polyrhythms. All of this cosmopolitanism is poured into her tracks, which have the chilled jugular beat of minimal wave, the scrunched electronics of IDM, the wit of electroclash and the phantasmagoric camp of gothic pop. On lead track Howlin Lupus, Willikens breathes and howls like a wolf, tapping into the dark sexuality at the heart of werewolf myths, while the bassline scurries with maniacal intent. Club promoters \u2013 you have your first no-brainer booking of the year.      Galcher Lustwerk  While acknowledging his punkish credentials, part of me really wants underground producer Galcher Lustwerk to bring out an artist album and blow away the dance mainstream \u2013 one-offs like Chillin in the Booth have been as spectacular as his 2013 Blowing Up the Workshop mix, where he lays his steady enigmatic flow over peerless deep-house production. For now, we can happily make do with a new batch of re-edits, featuring lazy G-funk, ambient and the addictive riddim of Lumidee\u2019s Never Leave You flecked with workout sweat. Best of all is this rework of rap crew OGC\u2019s track Hurricane Strang, which has a gorgeous tension between the pert pulsations of Lustwerk\u2019s beat, and the vocal line dragging its heels just behind it.      Juju and Jordash Gal Aner and Jordan Czamanski are Israelis who moved to Amsterdam and immersed themselves in the playful, puckish house style of the city \u2013 and also added their own flavour, building their tracks from lengthy improvisations until a groove is smoothly carved. They ballsily use this technique when playing live in their trio with Move D, Magic Mountain High, but they\u2019re skilled arrangers too, using the studio without sucking away the serendipity of improv. Their new album, Clean-Cut, is their best yet. Ambitious in its clean mulch of krautrock and jacking house, and channelling high-gloss 80s weirdos like David Sylvian and Laurie Anderson, the pair manage to nail it, and the title track is as good a place as any to start. The strutting bedrock could have been made by Moderat or Todd Terje, but then the kitsch panpipe melody begins, and is joined by sounds seemingly from a cheap instructional cassette for ayurvedic medicine. Pristine, yes, but definitely perverted.            Sue\u00f1o Latino Finally, clearing away the January blues is the turquoise flourish of Sue\u00f1o Latino, reissued this week on vinyl following its original release in 1989. Perma-gurning crusties will insist that the second Summer of Love was ecstatic social emancipation on a par with the fall of apartheid, but when you hear tracks like this you can imagine the pharmacologically-assisted bliss must have been pretty significant. Built around Manuel G\u00f6ttsching\u2019s astral classic E2-E4 the Italian group fed a solid bass drum underneath, dotted tropical birdcalls and house pianos throughout, and added some almost comically sensual vocals from Carolina Damas. The canonical version is the Paradise Mix, but other remixes included here are equally strong. On Derrick May\u2019s revisit from 1992 he revs up the bpm, adds extra melodic lines, and sluices mild acid over it all. Equally beautiful, though in a much more elegant way, is the Agua Version, which mutes the bass kick to keep everything flitting around in the mid-range and Gottsching himself turns up on the pounding Winter Version. Buy it, turn the central heating up, and spin around your living room wearing a flower garland for late-80s Ibiza on the cheap.

There is no equivalent in any other field for the ostentatious extravagance of art collectors in a world that unapologetically confuses luxury and aesthetic appreciation. Literature, theatre and grand opera are ascetic practices compared with the art world, where the current record for the most expensive painting ever sold stands at $250,000,000. It\u2019s a world where money is increasingly hard to separate from \u201cserious\u201d values, as commercial events such as the Frieze art fair are treated like public institutions, and where David Hickey, a leading critical champion of what he once called \u201cthe big, beautiful art market\u201d, retired in disgust after finding that rampant greed is not so beautiful after all. No wonder Marlene Dumas, one of today\u2019s most imaginative and authentic artists, feels ambivalent about benefiting from this moneyed madness. At least, that\u2019s what she told an interviewer from Vogue. Dumas claims to be uneasy about the high prices her paintings fetch because \u201cif you know the history of art, the people whose work fetched the highest prices have often been terrible artists\u201d. It does sound a little bit like false modesty. Artists say all kinds of nonsense \u2013 no offence to Dumas \u2013 it is just a way of heading off daft questions: Pablo Picasso talked rubbish about his art all the time, often lying or contradicting himself. But this expression of discomfort with the big, ugly art market is not the first such confession of financial nausea by Dumas, since her work started attracting seven-figure prices. \u201cSometimes I think \u2026 blessed are they who have been spared the frenzy of the auction houses,\u201d she said in a prize acceptance speech in Amsterdam before donating the cash award to the college where she teaches. It must be genuinely troubling. Your art sells for hundreds of thousands, even millions of dollars. This is reported by the world\u2019s media as a marker of achievement \u2013 for we can\u2019t seem to stop seeing the price of art as an index of its true, inner, aesthetic and intellectual value. But what does any of it really mean? If you are nearly as expensive as Jeff Koons and Damien Hirst, does that mean you are nearly as good as they are? Is the feeding frenzy of a world of plutocratic collectors and hedge fund Maecenases really worth a damn, or does it mean you are as vacuous as the Dalis and Vettrianos who also attract stupid sums? And yet, there is no need for Dumas to worry about being a \u201cbad artist\u201d because she sells. It is the scale of art prices that is bonkers. By and large, the market\u2019s discrimination between the good, the bad and the ugly is surprisingly reliable. And this has been true throughout \u201cart history\u201d. The first time the art market went mad was in ancient Rome. The writer Pliny the Elder complained about the disgusting sums the rich Romans of his day were paying for art. Yet the most valued works were by artists who have been revered by critics down the ages, including the Greek painter Apelles. As it happens no paintings by Apelles survive \u2013 it would be funny if one surfaced and he turned out to be the Hellenistic Jack Vettriano. This seems unlikely. Every source says he was great \u2013 and expensive. The same equivalence of talent and financial worth held true in the Renaissance. Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo Buonarroti both got rich from their work. Raphael could afford a palace. Titian screwed the Habsburgs for big money and lived in style. No one has ever called them \u201cterrible artists\u201d. In the Baroque age, Caravaggio sold his paintings for excellent prices that riled envious contemporaries. Rubens was so wealthy that when he painted landscapes he could afford to do so on his own landed estate. Only in the 19th century did a gap open between apparent and real worth. Avant garde artists in Paris took risks and accepted that they might die poor. It was conservative painters like Lord Leighton in Britain who earned pots of money while Cezanne would have sunk into hopeless poverty were it not that he inherited his father\u2019s wealth. Dumas is expressing an anxiety about wealth that goes back to the courage of the original Modernist avant garde. Artists should be nursing absinthe in a humble cafe, not counting their millions. Yet as soon as the art market caught up with Modernism in the 1900s, the best artists once again became the biggest earners. Since their deaths, Cezanne and Van Gogh have become stupendously saleable, and it is Cezanne\u2019s The Card Players that holds the current world record for the most expensive painting ever sold. Picasso and Matisse enjoyed immense wealth in their lifetimes. In short, Marlene Dumas is in good company. She can\u2019t really think the richest artists have tended to be \u201cterrible\u201d. They tend to be the best \u2013 even allowing for the leavening of trash, the reality is that collectors have tended to fork out for stuff that\u2019s worth money, even if not as much money as gets spend nowadays. She herself is proof of that. This is because the art market is conservative and canny. It is looking for smart investments and so listens to the critics. Generally, it knows good from bad. Then it adds a few noughts.", "sentences": ["\u201cSometimes I think \u2026 blessed are they who have been spared the frenzy of the auction houses,\u201d she said in a prize acceptance speech in Amsterdam before donating the cash award to the college where she teaches."], "title": "The art market is disgustingly inflated, yes \u2013 but surprisingly meritocratic | Jonathan Jones", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/09/art-market-inflated-meritocratic-marlene-dumas", "tags": ["The art market", "Art", "Art and design", "Culture", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-01-11T00:01:01Z", "article": "Seven years ago, Marlene Dumas briefly became the world\u2019s most expensive living female artist, a dizzying upward move that was reported, somewhat breathlessly, in newspapers from New York to Tokyo (her 1995 painting The Visitor was sold by Sotheby\u2019s for \u00a33.1m; previously, her prices had stood at around the \u00a350,000 mark). Yet her name remains, here and elsewhere, relatively unknown. She is, you might say, the world\u2019s most un-famous famous artist, beloved of curators and collectors, but lacking any of the tinny razzmatazz \u2013 the self-publicity, the production lines \u2013 we\u2019ve grown accustomed to when it comes to 21st-century art. Thanks to this, the huge retrospective of her work at London\u2019s Tate Modern next month \u2013 it will include more than 100 of her provocative and intensely dark paintings, drawings and collages \u2013 is, at this point, a hot ticket only for those in the know.   Related: Bold, graphic and disturbing: the art of Marlene Dumas \u2013 in pictures    As I walk to her studio \u2013 she works on the ground floor of a tall, gabled house in an area of Amsterdam popular with both hipsters and immigrants from north Africa \u2013 I wonder about this. At first sight, it\u2019s confounding. Dumas\u2019s work is every bit as outrageous as that of, say, Tracey Emin, and about 50 times more interesting (unlike Emin, she looks outwards, her interest in the human body extending beyond her own to those of other people). But then I meet her, and it\u2019s suddenly less of a mystery. Two things about her are immediately apparent. The first is her prodigious energy, which comes at you like a gale force wind. She is, quite simply, unstoppable: garrulous, clever, curious, enthusiastic. The second \u2013 this is the important part \u2013 is her modesty, her uncertainty, her artistic humility. She takes her work very seriously indeed, but herself not at all, and the jokes and self- deprecation come thick and fast. \u201cWhen I start work on a painting, it\u2019s total kitsch!\u201d she wails at one point. \u201cWhen I painted myself pregnant, I couldn\u2019t do the legs, and the blond hair made it look like a bad Klimt!\u201d she cries at another. No other artist I have interviewed has ever come close to making statements like these. Their acceptance of their own brilliance was simply part of the deal. The office space in which we sit is airy, modern, very Dutch. Dumas\u2019s assistant, Rudolf Evenhuis, makes us tea \u2013 I turn down the first offer of a proper drink; it\u2019s only four o\u2019clock, after all \u2013 and then swiftly disappears, having reminded her that she has another appointment in two hours\u2019 time. She rolls her eyes at this \u2013 not at his bossiness, but at her schedule, which has been unrelenting since she began work on the retrospective (it is currently showing at the Stedelijk museum, where I saw it earlier, surrounded mostly by whispering, middle-aged Dutch women in elegant, minimalist outfits who seemed unable to get enough of Dumas\u2019s bottoms, breasts and, well, everything else).     Marlene Dumas: The Image as Burden, 1993. Photograph: Private collection, Belgium \u00a9 Marlene Dumas    \u201cIt has been exhausting,\u201d she says, of the process of putting the show together. \u201cI wasn\u2019t looking forward to seeing all the works again.\u201d She collapses, as she\u2019s apt to do, into wheezy laughter. \u201cBut then, if I hadn\u2019t done it now, maybe I\u2019ll be dead!\u201d (Her English is brilliant, but sort of scrambled; it makes perfect sense when you can see her face and flapping arms, but some of her best stories won\u2019t, alas, work at all when I come to transcribe them from my tape.) Are there paintings, then, that she has come to dislike? \u201cIt\u2019s not so much that. It\u2019s more that it\u2019s so big. You realise how long you\u2019ve been busy.\u201d She\u2019s proud of the retrospective, but size doesn\u2019t necessarily matter to her these days. \u201cWhen I had a show at Moma in New York, people said: there\u2019s nothing more you could ever want! And it\u2019s true that, at a different stage in my life, I might have thought that. But as you get older, sometimes it\u2019s the smaller spaces, the shows almost no one saw, that seem quite special.\u201d Working on this show, what astonished her most was to see her paintings again in their true colours: \u201cI\u2019d started to have the reproductions in my head instead of the painting, so when I finally saw them again, I was surprised.\u201d She pulls the catalogue for the show \u2013 it is called The Image As Burden \u2013 across the table towards us. On its cover is The Painter, an oil from 1994 of a small, naked child whose hands are covered in what is surely paint, but could just as easily be blood. \u201cEven after all these years, I\u2019m still surprised when I see it. I think: is it that cold? That bleak? The reproductions \u2013 even this one \u2013 are too pink, too cute.\u201d She stabs at the picture with a finger. \u201cAaah! I can\u2019t stand it! The real thing is more green.\u201d Isn\u2019t this, though, the magic of paint? The canvas, the light, the human eye; it\u2019s alchemy, and we should accept no substitutes. \u201cYes, of course. That is what is exciting.\u201d Her eye flicks back frustratedly to the catalogue. \u201cStill, it\u2019s strange the way colour is so hard to remember.\u201d     The Painter, 1994. The Museum of Modern Art, New York \u00a9 Marlene Dumas    Dumas is not a particularly prolific artist, but she paints quickly and her gestures are fast (she favours oil, which takes a while to dry, so she can smudge things later if necessary). When she first picks up her brush, she has to work through the kitsch feeling \u2013 the sheer ridiculousness and grandiosity involved in standing in front of a canvas \u2013 but once that has passed, she can produce a major work in a single night. \u201cThe biggest difficulty for me is to be able to concentrate properly,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery time I start up again, I think: I don\u2019t know if I know how to make a painting. I always imagine I\u2019m going to change my whole life, to start writing books instead. But the good thing now is I know I will feel all these things [in advance]. Otherwise I would be desperate.\u201d Does it matter what other people say? Yes. She\u2019s interested in critical responses to her work: she put the catalogue for the retrospective together herself, and it includes as much as she could squeeze in of what the critics have written about her down the years, irrespective of whether she agrees with their interpretations. Nor does she flinch from criticism in the studio. \u201cIf my assistant tells me I\u2019ve done a clown or something, I don\u2019t mind at all. I want to know.\u201d Admittedly, nerves do set in when she works on political paintings. Who could depict, as she has done, a group of Hasidim standing in front of the Israeli separation wall as they prepare to pray at Rachel\u2019s Tomb nearby, and not tremble inwardly at the likely reaction? (The provocation of this painting is the separation wall\u2019s similarity, in her rendering, to the Western Wall in Jerusalem.) But then she tells herself: \u201cWell, Picasso had his Guernica. I\u2019ve got something I want to express, and I must express it.\u201d She flashes me a mischievous look. The look says: yes, I just likened myself to Picasso. She knows this is outrageous, but some other, more determined and resolute part of her thinks: why not? Dumas was born in Cape Town in 1953, but grew up in Kuils River, a semi-rural area 15 miles outside the city, where her father ran the family winery. The family was Afrikaans-speaking, gregarious and loud. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to leave them at all,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen I moved to the Netherlands, I missed Sundays, which was when we would really argue and discuss things. We knew we cared for one another, so you could lose your temper and it didn\u2019t matter.\u201d She had two older brothers, Pieter and Cornelis, but three of her grandparents also lived at the farm, and so, too, did two cousins, Annatjie and Sandra, who were taken in by Dumas\u2019s mother after their father died.     Dumas: \u2018I still get accused of being a token woman.\u2019 Photograph: Merlijn Doomernik    Her own father died when she was 12, but not before he\u2019d noticed his daughter\u2019s interest in drawing. \u201cMy parents didn\u2019t think I was an artistic genius. It was more that they thought it was peculiar, the way that if we went to the Kruger [national park] I would not be looking at all the animals, I would be drawing, retreating into my own world. They weren\u2019t discouraging, but they didn\u2019t overdo it [praise-wise] either.\u201d She knew she was different. \u201cI was a bit of a tomboy. I didn\u2019t like to sew or to cook; I didn\u2019t feel affiliated to the womanly arts.\u201d At her boarding school in Stellenbosch, a rather strict establishment, she was sometimes punished for her unladylike behaviour, for walking barefoot and wearing her father\u2019s old dressing gown. \u201cOh, I hated it!\u201d she wails, comically. \u201cBut at least it was more academic than the local school. At least art was a subject.\u201d She chose an English-speaking university in Cape Town over an Afrikaans one, but the transition was hard. She knew very little of the world: television did not arrive in South Africa until 1976, the year she left for the Netherlands. In an essay she has written for the catalogue of The Image As Burden, she describes her student years as a period of firsts: \u201cI was 19, it was the year 1972, and I\u2019d never sat with a person of colour following the same classes before. Never had dinner with a Jewish or Muslim family before. Was introduced to the poetry of Allen Ginsburg... Was introduced to the films of Ingmar Bergman, Resnais, Godard\u2026 And the plays of Jean Genet, Tennessee Williams and Athol Fugard.\u201d How soon into her degree did she know she would be an artist? \u201cI took things step by step. At school, I didn\u2019t think the fact I liked to draw made me an artist. I never thought I was good enough. I thought about being an art therapist. But then at university I thought: Ooh, what is this? Jackson Pollock! Picasso! Lichtenstein! Intellectually, you wanted to be avant garde, even if you weren\u2019t sure you had the power to do it alone.\u201d At the end of her degree course, a single bursary was available for a two-year study period abroad. She won it. She chose the Netherlands \u2013 she was to teach at Ateliers \u201963 in Haarlem, an artist-led postgraduate programme \u2013 because of the link between Dutch and Afrikaans; New York seemed \u201ctoo big and ambitious\u201d, and Britain was a country loathed by her parents for being South Africa\u2019s former colonial power. In some ways, it was a relief to leave South Africa. The townships were burning; censorship was rife. Apartheid was the impossible subject but equally, what kind of artist could ignore it? \u201c[In the Netherlands] I read all the books that were banned,\u201d she says. \u201cAs a woman, I could also walk alone at night and not feel scared, and that was fantastic.\u201d But she was also desperately homesick, and though she could read Dutch and make herself understood, there were baffling gaps between the two idioms. \u201cAfrikaans is more rhythmic, more like slang, while Dutch is so prim and proper. I don\u2019t dislike Dutch, but I didn\u2019t understand the humour, and when I read art reviews, I was never quite sure if the critic liked the art, or not.\u201d Did she feel like an outsider?    'In South Africa, you weren\u2019t proud to be an artist: it felt egocentric. I was a bit ashamed'    It wasn\u2019t as simple as that. \u201cIn South Africa, I was Afrikaans, but as the politics developed, obviously you didn\u2019t like certain aspects of your culture. The South African culture they [the white minority] wanted to protect for me, I didn\u2019t really feel part of either.\u201d She smiles. \u201cAlso, in Cape Town, there was only one art gallery, and you had to pay to exhibit there, and no one ever bought anything, they just came for the cheese and wine.\u201d In a way, her status as an exile was helpful, a kind of protection against criticism and failure. \u201cI always thought: I\u2019m not going to stay anyway! If it all fails, I\u2019m going back to my mother.\u201d What language does she think in now? \u201cWith my partner [the painter Jan Andriesse, with whom she has a 25-year-old daughter, Helena], we flip between Dutch and English. But if I\u2019m writing about art, I think in English.\u201d Her career, once it began, built steadily if not spectacularly: \u201cMy generation is Julian Schnabel, and he got known so quickly, just like Cindy Sherman and Barbara Kruger. It took me longer.\u201d Early on, she worked in collage as well as paint: The Image As Burden includes several examples, perhaps the most significant of which is Love Versus Death (1980), in which two \u201cclue-strips\u201d consisting of various photographs and newspaper clippings (Steve Biko is among them, and so, too, is Peggy Guggenheim) suggest ways of reading the work\u2019s central panel of drawings. By the mid-80s, however, she\u2019d given herself over to paint, and in particular to portraits. These portraits, painted from photographs, often news clippings, rather than life, fall into two groups: the living and the dead, the anonymous and the famous. But her palette is consistently ghoulish, her subjects\u2019 bodies bruised and bent, their skin a liverish green or a gallows blue. Here are swollen pot-bellies and ribs that look like xylophones, wattled chins and twisted \u2013 even broken \u2013 necks. Some hold extremely graphic sexual poses. Others are blindfolded, or bound in duct tape. And every so often, there comes, transfixingly, a notorious face: Osama bin Laden, Naomi Campbell, Phil Spector with wig, and without. Dumas\u2019s portraits tend to be contextless, her subjects\u2019 faces and limbs floating disembodied, arranged for maximum drama on a washed-out backdrop.     The Wall, 2009, from the series Against the Wall.  Photograph: \u00a9 Marlene Dumas    More recently, though, she has produced bigger, more daring, explicitly political canvases in which context is all: a series of oils (Against the Wall, 2009) inspired largely by events in Israel and Palestine; two paintings, both called The Widow (2013), in which Pauline Lumumba can be seen walking bare-breasted through the streets of L\u00e9opoldville, in mourning for her dead husband, Patrice Lumumba, the former prime minister of Congo who was executed by firing squad in 1961 by Katangan forces. Her feelings about her sale prices are mixed. \u201cWhen people first started to buy work, it was wonderful that someone wanted something. But in the beginning, of course, there were no auctions. People only bought it if they really liked it. Then that all changed. When I was described as the highest-selling woman artist, it had a strange force. In South Africa, you weren\u2019t proud to be an artist: it felt egocentric. I was a bit ashamed. The attitude [there] was: that\u2019s just a drawing. So\u2026\u201d Her prices were a validation? \u201cYes, and it\u2019s unfair when people say the political paintings can\u2019t be taken seriously when they go for so much money. But still, I was happiest when I had enough money on which to live and no more\u2026\u201d She would rather her work went to institutions than collectors (in 2012, for instance, the National Portrait Gallery acquired her 2011 portrait of Amy Winehouse, Amy-Blue, for \u00a395,000). Does she feel that the female artist must defend her work (and perhaps her prices) in a way no man would ever be required to? \u201cIt [sexism] is like racism or homophobia. Progress is made, and you think: oh, this is going well. But then you remember: oh, shit. People like Georg Baselitz still say women can\u2019t paint. Male artists of a certain generation still have a way of speaking that says: I\u2019m the best. Women still accept smaller gallery spaces more readily than men. I\u2019m still accused of being the token woman.\u201d She falls into sarcasm. \u201cBut I\u2019ve never slept with any museum directors, honestly!\u201d     Amy-Blue 2011, Dumas\u2019s portrait of Amy Winehouse. National Portrait Gallery, London \u00a9 Marlene Dumas    She stands up. Her tea is untouched, and now freezing cold. \u201cSo let\u2019s have some wine, yes?\u201d She reaches into the office fridge for a bottle of white, pours, swigs, and then we talk for quite a long while about Oscar Pistorius and Shrien Dewani, both of whom, she agrees, seem like natural subjects for her. She\u2019s fascinated in particular by Dewani, whose trial in South Africa recently collapsed, and pumps me for information. \u201cThe Dutch don\u2019t have a Sunday newspaper!\u201d she says. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the sex page, or whatever you call it.\u201d This national failing has her shaking her head vigorously. After this, she takes me into her studio next door. There are three rooms, two in which she works, and one that contains her archive, its shallow drawers stuffed full of all the things she has torn out of magazines and newspapers through the decades. Tipsily, we shriek with laughter at a cartoon pinned on a wall. (A man says to a woman he has met at a party: \u201cYour work is surprisingly strong. Have you always been a woman?\u201d) \u201cYes, take a picture of it!\u201d she instructs. Earlier, she was insistent that she had not made any new work for a year, the retrospective having taken up so much time and energy. But now I see that this is not quite the case. On a wall are the latest drawings for her Great Men series, a collection of portraits of gay men (the Tate show will include drawings of Alan Turing, Tennessee Williams and Tchaikovsky). She looks at me looking at them \u2013 I\u2019m drawn especially to her young Auden and to her Francis Bacon, both of which seem to capture something of their very essence \u2013 and when I turn around, I can\u2019t help but notice that she is wearing quite a daffy smile. Dumas doesn\u2019t, unlike some artists, simply accept compliments as her due; it\u2019s clear that they still have the power to thrill, and on receiving a genuine one she radiates graciousness, relief and a kind of simmering excitement. You feel as though you could toast your hands on her. Her company is eight times as intoxicating as her wine, and when she finally tips me out into the foggy Amsterdam night, I find that I miss her, for all that our acquaintance is only two hours old.

But for consumers from Amsterdam to Athens, this is not a bumper Christmas sell-off: the falling cost of their weekly shop reflects a deep economic malaise. After Brussels statisticians announced last week that inflation had been negative in December, with prices falling at an annual rate of 0.2%, experts warned that without drastic action the eurozone may be sliding towards a Japanese-style deflationary slump. \u201cThis move in December is significant,\u201d said Janet Henry, European economist at HSBC, \u201cbecause it\u2019s the first time that inflation has been negative since 2009 \u2013 in the depths of the crisis \u2013 and it\u2019s going to turn further negative in the next few months.\u201d News that the long-predicted onset of deflation had arrived \u2013 aided by the recent sharp drop in oil prices \u2013 will intensify the pressure on Mario Draghi, president of the European Central Bank (ECB), to press on with quantitative easing \u2013 one of the few tactics available to central bankers hoping to reflate the economy when interest rates are already on the floor. But some experts have little confidence that even a large-scale intervention will do much good. \u201cI think they\u2019ve left it a bit too late to do anything about this,\u201d says Russell Jones, of Llewellyn Consulting. \u201cWhat took them so long? This has been building, and getting more and more embedded in people\u2019s expectations.\u201d Economists don\u2019t generally worry too much about short periods of deflation, particularly if they are caused by external factors \u2013such as the plunging oil price. Cheaper energy boosts demand by putting more money in the pockets of consumers in oil-importing countries. But there have long been concerns that in the eurozone, where growth is weak and a number of countries remain in recession, falling prices could become widespread and entrenched \u2013 and that\u2019s what really worries euro-watchers. Some countries, including bailed-out Greece and Portugal, have been living with falling prices \u2013 and wages \u2013 for some time. With exchange rates between member countries of the single currency fixed, this process of \u201cinternal devaluation\u201d was seen by many as a painful but necessary way for struggling countries to restore their competitiveness against more productive rivals such as Germany. Yet even in Germany, which narrowly avoided recession in 2014, inflation is running at just 0.2%. The ECB\u2019s official mandate is to keep inflation across the eurozone \u201cclose to 2%\u201d. Consumers who believe that prices are going to continue falling tend to sit on their hands, postponing spending in the belief that their money will go further in the future. This weak demand can cause businesses to cut back on investment and stint on wages and a vicious spiral sets in. This is particularly dangerous for heavily indebted countries, as deflation increases the real value of their debts. In Japan, policymakers have spent more than two decades trying to jolt the economy out of just this kind of deflationary trap: the country\u2019s debt-to-GDP ratio has rocketed to well over 200%. HSBC\u2019s Henry warns that some in the eurozone are already responding to the uncertain climate and the prospect of declining prices. \u201cFor companies in particular, there\u2019s already evidence of deflationary behaviour. Why are they going to invest if they think things are going to be even cheaper tomorrow?\u201d Peter Praet, the ECB\u2019s chief economist, said in an interview last month: \u201cWhat we are increasingly worried about \u2026 is the high risk that after seven years of crisis and poor economic performance in the euro area, businesses and households are reducing their long-term growth expectations and adapting to weak growth and low inflation. To some extent this risk is already materialising: companies are starting to adjust to a 1% growth/1% inflation economy.\u201d Behavioural changes like these are notoriously hard to forecast: the impact on workers\u2019 pay of their employers\u2019 chastened mood will depend partly on the specifics of wage-bargaining, for example. But if the onset of deflation adds to the downbeat mood, it may take a long time to shift. As Praet put it: \u201cBefore the crisis we probably had excessively high growth expectations. Now it is the opposite. The big risk is that this growth pessimism perpetuates the current situation.\u201d Danny Gabay of Fathom Consulting, warns that in some ways, the situation in the eurozone is worse than Japan\u2019s at the start of what used to be known as its \u201clost decade\u201d \u2013 before the 10-year stretch became 20 years and more. \u201cJapan didn\u2019t fall into deflation with debts of 100% of GDP, unemployment in double digits and recession,\u201d he said. \u201cIt started from a pretty good point compared with Europe.\u201d Average unemployment across the eurozone is 11.5%, more than twice Japan\u2019s historical maximum. The ECB\u2019s governing council will meet in Frankfurt on 22 January to decide whether to press ahead with quantitative easing. It has already been purchasing corporate bonds but full-blown QE \u2013 as undertaken in the US, UK and Japan in recent years \u2013 involves buying large volumes of sovereign bonds. However, unlike in those countries, it is unclear whether the ECB has the powers to embark on this controversial policy. On Wednesday, the European court of justice (ECJ) is due to issue a preliminary opinion on whether large-scale buying of crisis-hit countries\u2019 bonds, known as Outright Monetary Transactions (OMT), is allowed under European law. In relatively calm times, when the trigger on OMT looks unlikely to be pulled, that sounds like an academic legal niggle. Yet if the court delivers an adverse opinion, Draghi\u2019s hands could be tied. OMT is a firefighting measure, devised to fulfil his promise in July 2012, when many investors were betting on a euro breakup, to do \u201cwhatever it takes,\u201d to safeguard the single currency. If the ECJ echoes the reservations of Germany\u2019s constitutional court about direct buying of member countries\u2019 bonds, the argument would apply equally to purchases of sovereign bonds under any large-scale QE programme. The German court suggested that bond-buying was beyond the ECB\u2019s mandate \u2013 it impinges on economic policy, which is the remit of governments, and could amount to a back-door bailout \u2013 and asked the ECJ to examine the issue. Any sign that the court echoes these concerns would strengthen the hand of sceptics, including Germany\u2019s Bundesbank boss Jens Weidmann, who has repeatedly argued against QE and claimed last month that there was \u201ca whole row of economic reasons\u201d against the policy. Some analysts say the ECB could sidestep the constitutional difficulties, and placate QE\u2019s critics, by leaving individual central banks responsible for any eventual losses on the bonds the ECB buys; but that might dampen the impact of the policy, by encouraging investors to target more vulnerable member states if the risk of default appears to be rising. Much of the evidence on the effects of QE suggests it is most effective if central banks do it on a large scale. And while QE could buy the eurozone time, driving down long-term interest rates and giving exporters a boost by weakening the currency, it wouldn\u2019t solve the longer-term challenges of restoring growth and helping the banking sector work off the legacy of the credit crunch. \u201cI don\u2019t think QE\u2019s a panacea,\u201d says Jones at Llewellyn Consulting. Some experts now believe the eurozone will not be able to avoid a long period of lacklustre growth and high unemployment, which in turn is likely to fuel demands for an alternative to the doctrine of austerity. A recent report from Lombard Street Research said: \u201cThe main threat to the euro now comes from stubbornly high unemployment and the resulting appeal of populist politics. In fact, in a relatively short period of time new parties in Italy (the Five Star Movement and a transformed Lega Nord), Spain (Podemos), Greece (Syriza) and Germany (Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland) have emerged to challenge the mainstream incumbents.\u201d Greece\u2019s a general election is set for 25 January, just a few days after the ECB\u2019s meeting. The radical Syriza party, which wants to write off some of the country\u2019s hefty debt burden and repudiate many of the onerous conditions of its bailout, is expected to win the popular vote. Its charismatic leader, Alexis Tsipras, is promising not just to extricate Greece from the clutches of its creditors, but to set the entire eurozone on a new path. He described his party in a recent article for the Huffington Post as \u201cthe alarm clock which will lift Europe from its lethargy and sleepwalking\u201d. But it may take more than that to really jolt Europe\u2019s firms and consumers out of their deflationary funk.", "sentences": ["But for consumers from Amsterdam to Athens, this is not a bumper Christmas sell-off: the falling cost of their weekly shop reflects a deep economic malaise."], "title": "Anxiety rises over eurozone\u2019s falling prices, but Draghi\u2019s hands may be tied", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/jan/11/eurozone-deflation-crisis-quantitative-easing-draghi", "tags": ["Eurozone crisis", "Deflation", "Inflation", "European Union", "European monetary union", "Economics", "European banks", "Euro", "Europe", "Mario Draghi", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-01-11T14:00:17Z", "article": "There\u2019s no doubt humans are attracted to oceans. Globally, 44% of all people on Earth live within 150 km (93 miles) of the shore, and eight of the 10 largest cities in the world are near the coast. But global sea levels have risen about eight inches in the last century and are projected to rise another one to four feet this century. That growth comes at quite a cost. World Bank economist Stephane Hallegatte led a 2013 study, published in the Nature Climate Change journal, forecasting that average global flood losses would multiply from $6bn per year in 2005 to as much as $1tn a year by 2050 if large coastal cities don\u2019t take steps to adapt. All this means that buying a dream home on the beach could amount to throwing money into the sea. Luckily, a growing number of studies have measured the risk from rising oceans, taking into account how many people live in low-lying areas, the value of at-risk real estate and business operations, the levels of preparedness (including countermeasures, such as Amsterdam\u2019s dykes, to prevent flooding damage) in different areas \u2013 and predictions for how those factors may change in 2030, 2050 or 2070.  If you\u2019re looking for coastal property for your dream home \u2013 or just dreaming \u2013 here are 10 seaside metropolises where investments face high risks from climate change: Guangzhou, Guangdong province, China     The bright skyline of Guangzhou, China, could be at risk: one study forecasts billions of dollars in damage from sea level rise annually by 2050. Photograph: Manufish/flickr    Historically known to Westerners as Canton, Guanzhou is the third largest city in China, with a population of nearly 13 million. Located on the Pearl River Delta and the South China Sea, close to Macao and Hong Kong, Guangzhou is a center of car manufacturing, biotechnology and heavy industry. As Asian economies grow and urban populations boom, Asian cities, especially in China, Thailand and India, will leap to the head of the pack when it comes to risk. Guangzhou is already there, and it lacks strong protection against sea level rise. Even with savvy infrastructure upgrades for resilience, Guangzhou could see $13.2bn in annual losses by 2050, according to Nature Climate Change. New Orleans, US     Hurricane Katrina illustrated New Orleans\u2019 huge flooding risks. Photograph: brookcatherine53/flickr    In his prescient 2001 book Holding Back the Sea, Christopher Hallowell documents New Orleans\u2019 numerous flooding risks. It has a poor location that is historically prone to flooding. Oil and gas drilling has lowered the ground elevation while engineering on the Mississippi River has starved the area of rejuvenating alluvial deposits. Meanwhile, its marshes have been weakened by invasive species. Sea levels rise around it as extreme storms batter it. Over the last century, the sea has swallowed more than one-third of Louisiana\u2019s coastal plain. Hurricane Katrina brought that all home in 2005, when the resulting flood lasted for weeks and the recovery reconfigured the city. In general, wealthier cities have better protection against sea level rise than those in developing countries, but New Orleans, along with Miami and New York, lag behind. Post-Hurricane Katrina investments in New Orleans, however, including decisions to relinquish some areas to the ocean, are helping.

Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam     Ho Chi Minh City developed its climate adaptation strategy with learnings from Rotterdam in the Netherlands. Photograph: Aleksandr Zykov/flickr    Home to 7.4 million people, Ho Chi Minh City sits on the banks of the Saigon River, where the Mekong Delta empties out into the South China Sea. One-third of the city is already exposed to flooding, with much land just a meter or so (about three feet) above sea level. But with the economy and population booming, it is building out towards the coast, exposing new real estate to risk of flooding. Rising sea levels are already turning inland water saltier, making it unsuitable for growing rice. Rotterdam, another delta city in the Netherlands, is advising Ho Chi Mihn City on how best to adapt. The Vietnamese city launched a climate adaptation strategy in 2013 that would wield technologies and policies that have helped Rotterdam fend off the sea.

Major industries include a large oil refinery as well as food production, lumber and manufacturing, including cars, textiles, chemicals, and soap. An engineering project to turn the lagoon into a deepwater port, though, is causing erosion problems. Human activity is causing some places along the West African coastline to lose 23-30 meters (75-98 feet) a year, damaging valuable infrastructure such as roads and houses. Mumbai, India     The Queen\u2019s Necklace, or Marine Drive, rings the waterfront in Mumbia, India. Photograph: Nimish Gogri/flickr    Formerly known as Bombay, Mumbai is one of the world\u2019s true megacities, with a metro area population of nearly 21 million. The capital of Maharashtra state, Mumbai is also the financial, commercial and entertainment capital of India. Many of Bollywood\u2019s most famous stars own mansions there.  But all this is built upon seven islands, which were fishing colonies in another era. Coastal flooding wouldn\u2019t just make homes soggy, it would reduce the availability of freshwater due to seawater intrusion and flood submerged waste dumps, contaminating the limited water supply. Even with protection upgrades, Mumbai could see $6.4bn in annual losses by 2050, according to Nature Climate Change. Miami, US     Miami Beach skyline. Photograph: Chad Cooper/flickr    Located at the mouth of the Miami River, between the Everglades and Biscayne Bay, most of Miami is just six feet (1.8 meters) above sea level. The glitzy city, with a metro-area population of 5.5 million, is already seeing regular flooding of city streets at high tide (pdf).  A two-foot rise in sea levels is expected by 2060, according to the US Geological Survey. Miami has always flaunted its seaside locale, building $16bn of real estate below a two-foot (0.6 meter) elevation (pdf). Nevertheless, insurers and lenders continue to support the city\u2019s development.  New York City and Newark, US     New York, NY Photograph: /flickr    New York City needs no introduction as a global hub of finance, art, culture and education. But its location on the Atlantic Ocean, at the mouth of the Harlem River and in a tidal strait, isn\u2019t doing it any favors. And despite having a larger GDP than London, Tokyo and Amsterdam, it has lower levels of protection than they do, according to Nature Climate Change. Aside from sea level rise, NYC is threatened by regional changes in ocean currents. Together these factors are likely to increase loss of wetlands, coastal flooding, storm surge, erosion and property damage. Hurricane Sandy was an early warning of what could come, pushing floodwaters over barrier islands and into seaside communities, destroying or damaging 305,000 homes in New York and 72,000 homes and businesses in New Jersey.  Shenzhen, China     Shenzhen skyline. Photograph: Ged Carroll/flickr    Located just two hours\u2019 drive from Guangzhou, Shenzhen lies at the mouth of the Pearl River Delta. Shenzhen was the first of China\u2019s Special Economic Zones, attracting foreign investment, turning it from a small village into the 15 million-person city it is today. It is home to a stock exchange and high-tech companies and is one of the world\u2019s busiest container ports.  As a village, it perched on hills. But most of those hills have now been leveled for development. Migrants from inland are now flowing into the city, and nearby hills are also being leveled to make room for more development. All this increases its risk. Osaka, Japan     Osaka city view. Photograph: Martin Abegglen/flickr    Osaka is Japan\u2019s third largest city. For centuries, it has been an economic center of Japan, benefitting from its location at the mouth of the Yodo River on Osaka Bay. But now that location could make it vulnerable to coastal flooding (pdf). More than 10% of greater Osaka\u2019s 2.5 million population and more than US$200bn in economic assets are at risk, according to a report from OECD. As the city continues to expand, those losses could damage nearly US$1tn in assets by 2070.  This article was amended 12 January.

Russell \u201cCamel\u201d Wattie, who successfully lobbied the then-opposition LNP against criminal organisation laws for bikies before the party\u2019s dramatic about-turn on the issue, is running as an independent in the marginal seat of Maryborough. Wattie, who was vice-president of the Wangaratta Liberal party branch in Victoria in his youth before being jailed for drug trafficking in Amsterdam, said he was \u201can accidental politician\u201d with real life experience \u201cthat unfortunately in today\u2019s climate of career politicians is sadly lacking in our leaders\u201d. Wattie, who in recent years has been a public advocate for bikie gangs as spokesman for the United Motorcycle Council, is up against the LNP\u2019s Anne Maddern, who won the seat by just 0.3% over another local independent, a former pastor and Christian songwriter, Chris Foley. Wattie, who last month criticised as \u201cpropaganda\u201d mistaken reports that his former outlaw motorcycle club, the Outcasts, was broken up by the LNP\u2019s bikie laws, said if elected he would work to achieve a bill of rights \u201cto protect Queenslanders from governments who may choose to overrule them\u201d. Wattie ran for the federal Senate in 2007 but now enters the fray with outlaw motorcycle gangs \u2013 and the LNP\u2019s campaign to legislate them out of existence \u2013 having become a bona fide election issue. \u201cSomeone\u2019s got to throw the cat among the pigeons,\u201d Wattie told Guardian Australia. Wattie criticised the government\u2019s designation of 26 bikie clubs as declared criminal organisations \u2013 including the Outcasts, 14 months after they had dissolved \u2013 as overreach with \u201cno judicial process whatsoever\u201d. He accused the government of cherry-picking crime statistics from different regions around the state to justify its law and order crackdown. Wattie also urged the architect of the legislative crackdown, the attorney general, Jarrod Bleijie, to \u201cman up\u201d after a report Bleijie had received death threats from bikies. He said it was \u201cquite possible\u201d that Bleijie had been on the receiving end of abuse that he took as death threats. \u201cMany people make hollow threats,\u201d Wattie said. \u201cI\u2019ve been threatened. We\u2019ve all been threatened at some point in our life, Jarrod \u2013 man up.\u201d Wattie\u2019s platform of repealing the bikie laws and opposing the LNP\u2019s privatisation of assets broadly mirrors the positions of a loose coalition of other independents and minor parties, including Katter\u2019s Australia party, which might hold sway in a hung parliament. Wattie said it was \u201ceasy\u201d for him to be taking these positions as he was \u201cjust a normal Queenslander who is affected by the Newman government the same way everyone else is\u201d. He and the president of Hells Angels Queensland, Mark Nelms, met the then opposition leader, now the health minister, Lawrence Springborg, at parliament in November 2009 to lobby against the former Bligh government\u2019s criminal organisation laws. \u201cWe had a 10-minute meeting that went for an hour and 10 minutes,\u201d Wattie said. The LNP opposed those laws on civil liberties and freedom of association grounds, a position restated by Campbell Newman as premier months before his blanket crackdown on bikies when he said: \u201cThe team that I lead believe that you shouldn\u2019t be sort of penalised for wearing your footy team uniform or jersey. \u201cCrime is what you should be punished for.\u2019\u2019 The Newman government brought in a host of draconian laws in response to a mass brawl in a Gold Coast restaurant five months later, including banned public gatherings for all \u201cparticipants\u201d \u2013 including non-members \u2013 of bikie clubs.

It also keeps everybody on their toes.\u201d That was certainly apparent when Falcao could not even make the list of substitutes for United\u2019s latest ordeal, when a team including Van Persie, Wayne Rooney, \u00c1ngel di Mar\u00eda and Juan Mata could not even muster a shot on target against Southampton and the defeat exposed just what a nonsense it has been lately for Van Gaal to depict them as title challengers. Would Falcao\u2019s involvement have made a huge difference? Possibly not given there have been only scraps so far to authenticate his status as one of football\u2019s superstars (a wonderfully delivered nutmeg a couple of weekends back barely counts when the opponent is the Yeovil midfielder Joe Edwards) and the Colombian is straying dangerously close to the point where we are entitled to wonder if he will ever be the player he was before his knee ligaments snapped, or the player United hoped he would be.   Related: Southampton use disruption to good effect in beating Manchester United | Michael Cox    Van Gaal\u2019s explanation was, in short, that he knew Di Mar\u00eda, Luke Shaw and Daley Blind, all returning from injury, would probably have to be substituted. There was, in other words, only one place for a replacement attacker and \u2013 this does not say much for Falcao either \u2013 \u201cnormally I would change Di Mar\u00eda for Wilson because I want speed in attack.\u201d As it turned out, Van Persie twisted his ankle and had to go off, meaning Blind stayed on. \u201cI also had Rooney,\u201d Van Gaal pointed out, having moved his captain from midfield to take over from Van Persie. \u201cSo when you see the composition of my bench \u2013 and if I want to change the playing style with [Marouane] Fellaini \u2013 I didn\u2019t have a position for a second striker.\u201d To a follow-up question on the subject, Van Gaal reverted to his old trick of rebounding the question on the journalist, just as he did when prompted about the team\u2019s obvious issues in central defence and, on a more general theme, the state of progress bearing in mind 37 points from 21 games is precisely the same amount under the faltering David Moyes reign this time last year \u2013 but actually one goal down, with fewer shots, crosses and passes, and more long balls. That Van Gaal spent \u00a3153m last summer to improve that record makes it an even more relevant question and the diversionary tactics are both wearisome and a reminder why the Dutch football writers\u2019 association once wrote to him pointing out \u201chis aggressive approach perhaps guarantees success with young, docile players, but is inappropriate at a press conference at which adults are present\u201d. It is clear, too, why Van Gaal\u2019s biographer, Maarten Meijer, wrote that his subject\u2019s \u201chard shell and toughness in the public are quite extraordinary\u201d, even if it is still several notches below what it was like with Sir Alex Ferguson. Yet they are still legitimate questions, answered or not, and particularly when Moyes\u2019s record against the same teams is a point superior. The counterargument goes along the lines that Van Gaal is a much more natural fit in Ferguson\u2019s old dugout whereas Moyes, as his friend Sam Allardyce helpfully pointed out, looked like he had aged 10 years in the space of a few months. Moyes, like Van Gaal, had toyed with the idea of playing Rooney in midfield, albeit with reservations about the player\u2019s understanding of the simple and short give-and-go pass. Ultimately, though, one of the principal reasons he decided against it was because he feared a bad reaction in the media. Likewise, he resisted the temptation to remove more of Ferguson\u2019s fringe players because of the perception of him dismantling a title-winning squad. The top managers do not concern themselves with headlines and chatter; they just get on with it. Van Gaal is in that category, with extraordinarily thick skin, and that automatically makes him much better suited for a club of United\u2019s ambitions. Yet the point remains: how many times this season have the team of so-called Gaal\u00e1cticos excelled? Even when they have won it has usually been followed by a stern-faced Van Gaal complaining about the way they have misused the ball. The only real praise has come after the defeats of Hull City and Queens Park Rangers, maybe Newcastle United too, but not once away from Old Trafford has the manager been entitled to feel fully satisfied. Hull and QPR? They are 18th and 19th in the league. Van Gaal has been fortunate in one respect to have taken the job at a time when Liverpool, Arsenal, Tottenham and Everton have all, to varying degrees, fallen away and the Premier League is, in short, nothing special. He inherited a club that had finished seventh last season so their present position of fourth is at least an upward curve and \u2013 this is important for many Old Trafford match-goers \u2013 he looks and sounds like a Manchester United manager. There are other questions, though, that tell a different story about Van Gaal\u2019s first six months in the job. Where, for instance, would they be without David de Gea \u2013 and when was the last time this club were so heavily indebted to a goalkeeper? Why has Van Persie flickered only sporadically and is there any real evidence United are suited to the wing-back system and \u2013 a first at Old Trafford \u2013 the 3-3-2-2 formation used on Sunday?   Related: Southampton change tack to go past United and towards Champions League | Jamie Jackson    While all the focus is on Falcao it also seems to have been overlooked how Adnan Januzaj\u2019s brilliant promise has stalled under Van Gaal. Talk to Moyes about Januzaj and his eyes would light up. \u201cA young Cruyff,\u201d he called him behind the scenes. Gary Neville also expected this to be a spectacular season for the 19-year-old. \u201cI am convinced United have a youngster who will become one of the best in the world over the next five years,\u201d he said in August. \u201cA bold statement, I know. And some bold statements return to haunt you. Yet I see someone with temperament, ability, determination. Those eyes express fierce intent. Their message is: no one will stop me.\u201d Januzaj has started four games in the Van Gaal era and was also left off the bench against Southampton; it just hardly went noticed. Falcao\u2019s absence drew far more attention and the mind goes back to an audience with Van Gaal last September when he could be heard eulogising about the player\u2019s first day in training. \u201cHe had one ball and it was in the goal,\u201d the manager recounted. \u201cThis is one of the best strikers in the world. He confirmed it in his first training session with me.\u201d The awkward truth for United is that Falcao has not reaffirmed it since. With three goals in five injury-affected months, it would look almost reckless as it stands if they paid the \u00a343.2m to make his loan arrangement from Monaco a permanent one.

It was founded there, and grew to become the biggest employer. But when from the 1980s on Philips began to shift its operations out of Eindhoven, culminating with the move of its head office to Amsterdam in 1997, it left a void. Like a lover scorned, Eindhoven needed to go out and get itself a makeover. Technology and design sectors blossomed, and many of the old factories became homes to creative start-ups.As part of the effort to rebrand itself, it seemed apt that Eindhoven should turn to an aspect of design \u2013 namely, typeface.  The city\u2019s municipality and Eindhoven 365, its marketing department, embarked on a collaborative effort to commission a new city font. They created a virtual design agency, with designers from competing agencies working together. The results can now be seen all over the city.     Eindhoven\u2019s typeface is deliberately a little rough round the edges. Illustration: Virtual Design Agency    As the original sketches were made from sticky tape, the corners of the letters in the final design are missing. The result is a slightly rough-around-the-edges typeface. That fits this once-industrial city, says Remco van de Craats, co-owner of one of the city\u2019s design agencies tasked with coming up with Eindhoven\u2019s typeface. Eindhoven, he says, is a city \u201cvery much in transition.\u201d But can a typeface really represent what\u2019s unique about a city? Van de Craats, not surprisingly, thinks so. Type has a lot of effect on the atmosphere of a place, he says, calling it \u201cthe voice of the city\u201d: \u201cI think cities that don\u2019t have this very dynamic energy, they don\u2019t feel the need to change their identity.\u201d  That identity, for many of the world\u2019s largest cities, is intimately tied up with typeface. Johnston Sans and Gill Sans, which are used on the London Underground, say \u201cLondon\u201d even before you\u2019ve read the signs. In New York it\u2019s Gotham, or Helvetica (where once it was Standard) on the subways. The Legible Cities movement, which is creating a new Cyrillic alphabet for Moscow\u2019s transit system, is gaining momentum.  \u201cWhen typefaces get attached to cities,\u201d explains Dan Rhatigan, a New York-based type designer, \u201cit\u2019s because typefaces become part of people\u2019s everyday experience. People don\u2019t identify typeface necessarily; very few of us can look at something and say what it is, but it has an effect, it\u2019s a personality.\u201d Though much of this font personality stems from transit systems \u2013 Helvetica in New York, or Frutiger in Paris \u2013 fonts come from everywhere: Anandabazar Patrika (AKA Linotype Bengali and now effectively the typeface of the entirety of Bangladesh and West Bengal) grew out of a city newspaper in Kolkata. Because Sheffield was home to the type foundry Stephenson Blake &amp; Co, officials attempted to use the company\u2019s Granby Condensed as the city\u2019s official typeface \u2013 an attempt that proved difficult in practice and led to the creation of Wayfarer, still visible around the city today. And more are commissioned every year: Stockholm Type is hot off the presses. But it is small, post-industrial cities that seem particularly eager to, as it were, make a name for themselves. In Chattanooga, a city of 200,000 on a bend in the Tennessee river, typeface designers Jeremy Dooley and Robbie De Villiers set up a Kickstarter to raise funds for a new city font, securing more than $10,000 (\u00a36,600).  Chattanooga, Dooley believes, was the ideal city for such a project. Its small size made it easy for the design community to rally around the project. He also points out: \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a very diverse kind of a city that\u2019s a lot more fragmented, there\u2019s going to be a lot more difficulty in coming with one unifying [typeface].\u201d Where bigger cities have become associated with a typeface, it has tended to happen more organically, or via specific projects for transport networks or road signage, rather than through a city-wide project such as Chattanooga\u2019s.     A font for the twin cities of Minneapolis and St Paul Photograph: PR     \u201cRome feels different to London; there\u2019s a certain tangibility,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd now, as a typeface designer, I see part of it is the typefaces being used. In any city in the world \u2013 largely because the graphic designers doing the branding feed off one another \u2013 a vernacular develops ... in the same way as an accent, for example.\u201d  In designing the font for Chattanooga, Dooley looked to the city\u2019s Cherokee heritage \u2013 the written form of the Cherokee language is still used in the two nearby reserves \u2013 and its history as a major railway point. De Villiers, for his part, sought an equal emphasis on the future: \u201cChattanooga ambitiously wants to see itself as a kind of Silicon Valley alternate,\u201d he says. \u201cIn North America they were the first city to have their own gigabit internet. They\u2019ve really been investing in that [broadband] infrastructure and they want people to have that idea about what Chattanooga is and what it wants to be.\u201d  Chartype, the font the pair have created, aims to align all those themes. It is a chunky slab serif with \u201can 1880s kind of a feel,\u201d Dooley says. \u201cThey\u2019re really popular right now with graphic designers in the US, so it\u2019s still contemporary.\u201d The font is now visible all around town: because it\u2019s free, different companies have adopted it, as have the Chattanooga visitors\u2019 bureau and library. Paul Bailey, a brand consultant at London-based 1977 Design, says it\u2019s exactly by tapping into \u201cwhat makes this place this place\u201d that makes a typeface work. As one of the most important visual aspects of any brand, typography can be used to \u201creflect a certain kind of personality\u201d, he says \u2013 reflect, he stresses, not create. \u201cYou can\u2019t pick a nice, modern typeface if the city is actually really run down. People can quickly see through it. You can\u2019t rebrand something and then tell people \u2018This is what your city is like,\u2019 because if it\u2019s not, they\u2019ll just say \u2018That\u2019s rubbish, it\u2019s not like that at all.\u2019\u201d      The typeface created by Just Rossum and Erik Blokland for the Minneapolis and St Paul Photograph: Just Rossum and Erik Blokland    But you can, Bailey says, use fonts to signal \u201cwhere a city brand is moving to\u201d. That\u2019s what a team at the University of Missouri\u2013St Louis are hoping to achieve by raising funds to design a typeface called St Louis. According to Jennifer McKnight \u2013 an assistant professor and designer at the university who is running the project with Terry Suhre, the university\u2019s gallery director \u2013 the city of St Louis was one of the nation\u2019s top type-founding cities in the late 19th century, and played a key role in the industrialisation of type-founding. She and Suhre now want to tap into this heritage, via a competition to design a new typeface, but also to \u201csuggest a way that design might be the suggested way to solve our city\u2019s problems\u201d.  \u201cSome say the region lives in the past,\u201d McKnight says. Just like Eindhoven, St Louis has been hit hard by the loss of manufacturing \u2013 in this case the closing of the local Ford plant and big cuts at Anheuser-Busch. \u201cMany of us are wondering how to reframe or rename St Louis into a city on the rise, instead of a city whose time is past. With the rise of interactive design, design that doesn\u2019t need to be made in a hub city, we were hoping in this project that perhaps design could be a player in how we make our city grow.\u201d But while it\u2019s clear that typography, as one manifestation of design, can and has done a lot for these smaller cities, it cannot be the whole solution. \u201cA new typeface in itself isn\u2019t going to change a city,\u201d says Bailey. \u201cBut it might help change the mindset of the people in a city and inspire them to make the change themselves.\u201d  What are your favourite city fonts?

They are tragedies for the victims and for their families and friends, but they are not by any stretch of the imagination a serious threat to western civilisation.

Please take all of our communities seriously and engage in a discussion of their beliefs, whether you agree with them or not.David EdgeworthWoodford Green, Essex \u2022 After the great flood of journalistic output resulting from the horrendous acts in Paris last week, it was a great relief to finally read someone prepared to take a deeper, less emotive look at the perpetrators and their motivations (Gary Younge: This polarised debate won\u2019t help us move on from Charlie Hebdo, 12 January). That the many young men who go to Syria to fight for Islamic State or claim allegiance to various al-Qaida affiliates have, to them, justifiable motivations should not be denied by the use of reductive terms such as terrorism or criminality. What makes these young men so prey to Islamic radicalisation? Could the answer, as Younge goes some way to recognising, be found in a nexus where extreme versions of Islam are seen by some to act as a counter-balance to or even a refuge from the extreme form of capitalism increasingly dominating the globe, the marginalisation and sense of frustration this creates across whole swaths of society, and the diet of real and imagined victimisation of Muslims in countries from Iraq to India available via TV and the internet.

If ever an event demonstrated the power and solidarity of nations working together, rather than singly and individually, then the rallies of unity in France demonstrated this. Nations pulling together in this way, showing tolerance to all, give the lie to the arguments of those who trash this unique institution.

Another forgotten example that seems particularly apposite is that of Naji al-Ali, who was assassinated on the streets of London in 1987. Yet there appears to have been no recent mention of him or his work in any of the various media outlets. His reputation largely rested on the character Handala, depicted as an orphaned child who became a symbol for the poor and dispossessed, in particular the Palestinian people. His work often invoked or offended the sensibilities of both the Arab and Israeli leadership, in equal measure.

Kicking accuracy has increased by more than 20 percentage points in the last four decades, and a larger portion of field goal attempts are now taken from distances greater than 40 yards. This season, the 84% league average was the third-highest on record. As the New York Times reported, \u201cthe 11 seasons with the highest rates are the 11 most recent seasons.\u201d With copious amounts of summer camps for young teenagers alone, the market for kickers and punters has never been more challenging \u2013 which is why players are fired almost weekly, and it\u2019s for good reason: head coaches are willing to take more chances with the leg rather than the arm than ever before.  To watch Adam Vinatieri kick once is to watch him kick forever. Each time it\u2019s the same: the traditional two steps back, two steps left, not-so-subtle shoulder shimmy, head down, shoulders roll over, arms jut forward, snap, forearms open wide like he\u2019s waltzing with the air in front of him, contact. He\u2019s the ancient fresco in a league that rarely allows its players to dry to the canvas; his dowdy persona a counter to the loud-mouthed, media-crazed professional football player with a steroidal ego.  Vinatieri, the oldest player in the NFL, had the highest field goal percentage of any kicker with more than 15 attempts in a season since Mike Vanderjagt connected on all 37 tries in 2003. He, like Vinatieri, kicked for the Indianapolis Colts.  \u201cHe\u2019s like any California red. I mean, he gets better with time and age,\u201d the Colts head coach, Chuck Pagano, said in an interview with WISH-TV. Heading into the final game of the regular season, Vinatieri had kicked a perfect season: no missed field goals or extra points. The feat has only happened three times ever; while eight quarterbacks have thrown for 5,000 yards, seven running backs have rushed for 2,000 yards and 13 defensive players have had 12 or more interceptions in a single season. Records seemingly fall each and every season in the NFL, but perfect kicking seasons certainly don\u2019t.  In the Colts\u2019 last regular season game against the Tennessee Titans \u2013 played on Vinatieri\u2019s 42nd birthday against an opponent that was eliminated from playoff contention after Week 12 \u2013 he stepped in and missed his first kick of the season, a 46-yarder. Wide left. Perfect season over.  \u201cPerfect seasons are tough to come by and missing it by a kick \u2013 that\u2019s a bummer deal,\u201d Vinatieri tells the Guardian. \u201cBut I never saw that as an ultimate goal. I guess, for me, the ultimate goal is to help me team win games every time I step on the field.\u201d Yankton, South Dakota isn\u2019t recognized as a treasure trove of NFL talent nor is South Dakota Sate University. Vinatieri hails from both and hasn\u2019t forgotten either. He spends a lion\u2019s share of his free time hunting or being with family, always making sure to return home during the offseason and on available weekends. When he\u2019s not kicking in gladiatorial arenas before 65,000 face-painted fanatics, he treks to places where there are just a handful of people, relishing the stillness. Perhaps it\u2019s not surprising that he was one of the keynote speakers at the 2014 NRA Convention.  When he left the Jackrabbits as the all-time leading scoring leader in points, he didn\u2019t want to stop kicking. So he drove nearly 20 hours to hone his craft with Doug Blevins \u2013 a man born with cerebral palsy, who has used a wheelchair his entire life. He slept in the bed of his truck the first night. At the time, Blevins was a kicking consultant for the World League of American Football.   \u201cHe was a guy that was working with some of the other NFL kickers, and then he helped me get an opportunity to get drafted by the Amsterdam Admirals,\u201d Vinatieri says. \u201cFrom there, I kicked fairly well, and got an opportunity to play with the New England Patriots. The rest is history.\u201d What he doesn\u2019t tell you is that he came to New England as an unsigned free agent, and that then-head coach Bill Parcells approached him prior to the third preseason game and screamed, \u201cI want to see if you got what it takes, or you pack up your shit and go home.\u201d After successfully navigating three kicks through the uprights, the team canned veteran kicker Matt Bahr. Vinatieri had proven himself. In 19 NFL seasons, Vinatieri has played in and won four Super Bowl rings; he has kicked game-winning field goals in half of them, and ended too many games in the waning seconds to count. Once, he ran down world-class Olympic athlete Herschel Walker, who was returning one of his kickoffs for what seemed destined to be a touchdown.             Once \u2013 moving like a phantom in a blizzard \u2013 he kicked a line-drive, 45-yard game-tying field goal with four inches of snow on the field against the Oakland Raiders in the divisional round of the playoffs, only to turn around and kick the game-winning 23-yarder minutes later.   \u201cWhen you have an opportunity to help your team in crunch time \u2013 as a kicker \u2013 that\u2019s a dream come true,\u201d Vinatieri says. \u201cWhen you play 19 years, I guess there\u2019s lots of moments that stand out.\u201d ESPN\u2019s Mike Reiss named the Blizzard Kick the best play in the history of the New England Patriots, beating out the kick Vinatieri had to win Super Bowl XXXVI. Vinatieri earned the nickname \u201cAutomatic Adam\u201d at some point during his 10 seasons in New England, though he can\u2019t seem to remember when. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty fun nickname to have,\u201d Vinatieri says. \u201cI guess it means you\u2019re doing things right.\u201d  Through all of the accolades, the three Pro Bowl selections, the two Golden Toe Awards, this \u2013 his 19th season \u2013 has been his most accurate as a kicker. He had kicked at a rate higher than 90% just twice in the last decade, but drilled 30 of 31 field goals during the regular season to set a career-high 96.8% in 2014-15. He also hasn\u2019t missed an extra point in the regular season in more than five years.  Last week, the Colts defeated the Denver Broncos, advancing to the AFC Championship Game. Most focused on Andrew Luck\u2019s battle with Peyton Manning. But it was Vinatieri, who missed a kick earlier in the game, who virtually ended the Broncos\u2019 chances late in the fourth quarter with a 30-yard field goal. He\u2019ll tell you that there\u2019s a high degree of turnover in the NFL, and with it, there\u2019s rarely a matchup where he isn\u2019t facing one of, if not handfuls of former team-mates. This weekend will be no exception: Sunday, the Colts play the Patriots, with a trip to the Super Bowl on the line.   \u201cThe Patriots are an amazingly talented team with great players and great coaches,\u201d Vinatieri says. \u201cThere are only a handful of guys that are left from when I was there. But the memories are there. The emotions are there. I know how electric that stadium is and this will be a very special day for me.\u201d It\u2019s just that a man, who will be considered one of, if not the best kickers of all time when he decides to retire \u2013 he\u2019s signed through next season and says that decision is still years away \u2013 gets to be a part of the NFL\u2019s golden age of kicking.   \u201cEvery time you step on the field you have to reestablish and re-prove yourself,\u201d Vinatieri says. \u201cI don\u2019t think past experiences guarantee anything and I don\u2019t think you can rest on your morals.\u201d For now, the Indianapolis Colts have a man with huge experience on staff, someone who has every reason to be narcissistic and yet prepares like he\u2019s trying to be you out for a contract each day. When that\u2019s the path you took \u2013sleeping in a truck, joining a team undrafted \u2013 you don\u2019t forget it.   \u201cI\u2019m a guy that gets over to the stadium pretty early and I spend a long time getting loosened out, stretching out and getting my body ready to go,\u201d Vinatieri says. \u201cI walk the field, check the weather and make sure I know what all of the field conditions are.\u201d  He\u2019ll do just that on Sunday: walk the field of a former home, breathe the cold New England air and be one of the last to run onto the field. Both Vinatieri and Colts punter Pat McAfee were both named to this year\u2019s Pro Bowl, and will pace the sidelines, like they always do, waiting for their moment. There is perhaps no player as decorated in NFL postseason history as Adam Vinatieri. When he takes the field Sunday, he\u2019ll be breaking Jerry Rice\u2019s all-time record for career playoff games. He\u2019ll do everything he can to ensure the season doesn\u2019t end there.", "sentences": ["\u201cHe was a guy that was working with some of the other NFL kickers, and then he helped me get an opportunity to get drafted by the Amsterdam Admirals,\u201d Vinatieri says."], "title": "Adam Vinatieri and the golden age of NFL kickers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jan/17/adam-vinatieri-and-the-golden-age-of-nfl-kickers", "tags": ["Indianapolis Colts", "NFL", "US sports", "Sport", "New England Patriots"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-01-17T12:00:07Z", "article": "Off-grid escapes Looking for a place where you can enjoy your own digital detox and a break far from the madding crowd?

Photograph: Graeme Robertson    People say to me that fishing must be the ultimate slow activity, but in my experience, what they really want to say is how can I enjoy such a \u201cboring\u201d hobby. They usually go on to ask what I spend all my time by the river thinking about. In answer to the first question I\u2019ll bore on about being immersed in the landscape \u2013 stalking for trout, watching kingfishers and stumbling across fallow deer, mink, weasels and adders. My reply to the second question is that, after a short time, I don\u2019t think about anything \u2013 other than trying to accurately cast a fly to a rising fish. And that\u2019s the point. I go fishing to empty my head, and usually come back feeling energised, my senses \u2013 and often my skin from all the nettle stings \u2013 tingling. My trips usually involve a lot of walking, whether it\u2019s along a chalk stream trying to spot lurking fish \u2013 Fishing Breaks offers day tickets on 13 rivers from Derbyshire to Dorset \u2013 or slogging up to hill lochs in Sutherland, where I\u2019ve wild camped for two or three days. (The Rhiconich Hotel is a good base if you don\u2019t want to camp.) But I\u2019ve also lost myself for 12 hours on a river behind a housing estate in Northern Ireland and by a mill race off a main road in the Midlands. That mill race was where my fascination with the watery underworld started, when I was just nine. I moved on from that spot when I got my first racing bike at 11, and started cycling 20 or 30 miles with my gear to fish the rivers of Derbyshire. That\u2019s when I got a taste for long-distance road cycling, also good, like many activities, for clearing your mind. These days, I\u2019m a Mamil and enter sportives like Yorkshire\u2019s epic Etape du Dales (17 May). But my favourite is the new L\u2019Eroica Britannia (19-21 June) for which you have to ride vintage bikes, like the one I started on, through the rugged Derbyshire countryside.

Jini Reddy Slowed-down city breaks     Hire a bike and potter around Amsterdam like the locals do. Photograph: Yadid Levy/Alamy    A city break can be exhausting \u2013 if you\u2019re intent on ticking off the cultural must-sees, great restaurants and cool bars, pounding the pavements trying to cram a two-week itinerary into two days. So how to do it slowly? Pick a smaller city for a start \u2013 Amsterdam, say. Hire a bike and potter, and eat at Restaurant As, by Beatrixpark, where they cook seasonal food outside on a wood-fuelled oven. There\u2019s a whole Slow City movement, too, a spin-off from Italy\u2019s Slow Food concept. Levanto in Liguria is one of 33 such places in Italy. Cars are banned from the old town\u2019s narrow streets and shops are supplied by local artisans and farmers. Germany has four \u201cslow cities\u201d, including pretty Hersbruck, which runs \u201cregional weeks\u201d when restaurants showcase local produce. Its Fackelmann Therme spa has environment-friendly heating, and its herdsmen\u2019s museum offers a glimpse of a genuinely slow-paced life. There are ways to slow down in big cities, too. Linger in one museum \u2013 Madrid\u2019s Prado, perhaps \u2013 or join a slow-paced walking tour. Dotmaker Tours\u2019 \u201cLondon in Slow Motion\u201d ambles through the frenetic West End. And if you can get to your chosen city by train, so much the better.Jane Dunford Messing about in boats     Gulet cruises around the Turkish coast include sunrise meditations and yoga \u2013 though the scenery alone is relaxing enough.

The unhurried pace of most waterborne vessels makes them ideal for a spot of mindfulness. For instance, you could try a leisurely potter around the creeks and coves of Devon and Cornwall in a vintage sailing boat with Trinity Sailing (from \u00a3195-695pp for two to six nights). Or you might board a 1920s Thames sailing barge and glide past the remotest corners of the Essex coastline for the weekend.

Further afield, responsibletravel.com offers gulet cruises around the Turkish coast that include sunrise meditations and twice-daily yoga (from \u00a3625pp, 01273 823700). Next month a six-day Caribbean Zen Cruise (from $899pp) leaves Florida and calls at Jamaica and Haiti, promising a \u201cpowerful transformational journey\u201d through yoga, healing arts and ecstatic dance. Avoid the mania of airports on a cargo ship: Freighter Cruises Worldwide has several that each ferry just half a dozen or so passengers sedately across the oceans (typical daily rate \u00a390). Alternatively, grab some Scottish island-hopping joy \u2013 this year with Caledonian Macbrayne, which is offering a choice of 25 hopper tickets around the Inner and Outer Hebrides (from \u00a34.95, eight-day rovers from \u00a354).Dixie Wills Skiing: the laid-back way     The Peter Zumthor-designed Vals Thermal Baths, Switzerland. Photograph: Agencja Fotograficzna CaroAlamy    How can a ski trip be made to fit the slow travel mould? Do you just do one massive snowplough on a gentle green run? On unwaxed skis? In deep slush? In some ways, ski trips already tick quite a few slow travel boxes. You\u2019re staying in one place. And you\u2019re totally focused on an activity, which is great for clearing the mind. You do the same thing over and over again, perfecting it, then hit the sauna. But there is also a tendency to go at a ski holiday full-throttle, doing every run off every lift, racing your mates, making yourself do your first black run or 360. You spend evenings drinking stupidly, then beat yourself up for not making the first lift the next morning. So instead, give yourself a break. Choose a small, sleepy resort which still has good skiing, such as Sainte Foy in France, Zinal in Switzerland, or Saint-V\u00e9ran in France\u2019s Queyras national park. Somewhere that has thermal baths and spas will help. In Switzerland, the village of Schuol has 25 springs and the Bogn Engiadina spa, while Vals is home to the Peter Zumthor-designed Vals Thermal Baths. In Italy, the pretty Tyrolean town of Merano is home to the Terme Merano thermal baths, or there\u2019s Bagni di Bormio, close to the Swiss border. Germany\u2019s Bad Gastein resort has serious pampering at the Alpentherme spa. And you can find slower experiences even in the big resorts. My sister and I tend to get lost in woods when we\u2019re skiing off-piste, which I recommend. If you stay quiet and still you might spot wildlife. I\u2019ve seen marmots in France, deer in Japan and a porcupine in Colorado \u2013 all metres from the slopes. Importantly, have long lunches. Especially in Italy. In Courmayeur, I\u2019ve sat in the sun on the mountainside, with friends for hours, taking our time over platters of salami and cheese, pasta, roast meats, tiramisu, lots of wine and finally a grolla \u2013 the traditional wooden pot of hot coffee and liqueurs with several spouts, which must be passed around and not put down until it\u2019s empty. No one was going anywhere very fast after that. It\u2019s all about attitude. Have a lie-in. Take a morning off skiing to swim or go for a walk. And never, ever, try to catch the first lift of the day.Gemma Bowes Slow train coming Aareschlucht Ost is one of Europe\u2019s most extraordinary stations. It is inside a tunnel on the line between Meiringen and Innertkirchen, in Switzerland\u2019s Bernese Oberland. As the train comes to a halt inside the rock, its doors slide open, revealing a spectacular gorge. Travelling by train allows you to appreciate places like this. The billions of euros that have been spent on developing high-speed railway lines in Europe are leading to a renaissance in all kinds of rail travel, and the upsurge is not all about speed. Tour operators are increasingly running trips where the train journey itself is the holiday. Simply Sweden\u2019s Great Scandinavian Rail Journey, for example, is a new eight-night trip that includes three of Scandinavia\u2019s most scenic train rides: the Arctic Circle Train, the Northern Railway and the Dovre Railway (from \u00a31,525pp including flights, hotels, simplysweden.co.uk), while Tailor Made Rail\u2019s London to Istanbul seven-day rail trip takes in Germany, Austria, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria en route to Turkey (from \u00a3695pp one way, including hotels, tailormaderail.com). Of course, you don\u2019t have to join a group trip to experience life on the (slow) rails. Take one of the local, slower trains in rural France \u2013 say from Toulouse south to the Pyrenean spa town of Bagn\u00e8res-de-Luchon (a hub for French skiers in winter and mountain bikers in summer), or from Sarlat to Lalinde and Bergerac, criss-crossing the Dordogne and the villages that perch spectacularly on its high cliffs. You\u2019ll see the world a little differently.Richard Hammond", "sentences": ["Jini Reddy Slowed-down city breaks     Hire a bike and potter around Amsterdam like the locals do.", "Pick a smaller city for a start \u2013 Amsterdam, say."], "title": "Go slow: how to do less and take in more on holiday", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/jan/17/slow-travel-holidays-2015-wellbeing-health-skiing-rail-boats", "tags": ["Health and fitness holidays", "Rail travel", "Short breaks", "Boating holidays", "Food and drink", "Cruises", "Travel", "Food & drink", "Meditation", "Health & wellbeing", "Rest and relaxation", "Europe holidays"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-01-18T00:05:09Z", "article": "Choreographer Richard Alston was born in Sussex and educated at Eton before studying fine art and theatre design at Croydon School of Art.

Book: Nairn\u2019s London by Ian Nairn London is still the city I love most and long ago in the 1960s, when I dropped out of school and came up to town, I\u2019d walk every day sometimes for hours around the City and the docks clutching a well-thumbed copy of Nairn\u2019s London. Ian Nairn was a down-to-earth, beer-drinking journalist who wrote with vivid passion for his subject, a detailed and idiosyncratic description of the best buildings in London. I was so excited by his vaulting enthusiasms that I eagerly went exploring, seeking out the places he wrote about. To my utter delight they\u2019ve just recently republished Nairn\u2019s London and it\u2019s as eccentrically convincing as ever, still so exciting to read.          Place: Segesta, Sicily  At Segesta there\u2019s the shell of a perfect Doric Greek temple sitting alone in the midst of fields. It\u2019s extraordinary, so powerful and yet peaceful. The story goes that centuries ago the city of Segesta expected a Greek invasion, so to placate their unwelcome visitors they set about building this temple. Suddenly the expected invasion evaporated into thin air and they stopped building. As time went on the city of Segesta disappeared entirely, but still there in the middle of nowhere is this beautiful temple. There was nothing else in Segesta when I went \u2013 I hope it\u2019s still so.          Music: Tchaikovsky\u2019s Sleeping Beauty   At Christmas, I somehow have again a child\u2019s need of magic, so this year I found myself listening obsessively to Sleeping Beauty. It\u2019s a score I never tire of, so rich that I always find new things. Not just pretty and lyrical, it has wonderful darkness and barbaric sonorities in the music for Carabosse, the evil fairy. Stravinsky was\u00a0a devoted admirer, and indeed you can hear the beginnings of what became Firebird and even Rite of Spring.          Dance: Bayad\u00e8re \u2013 The Ninth Life This spring the brilliant Shobana Jeyasingh turns her astute intelligence and marvellously three-dimensional movement towards re-examining the story behind the 19th-century Petipa classic La Bayad\u00e8re. I can\u2019t wait to see it \u2013 Jeyasingh is one of\u00a0the few choreographers whose agility of language and clarity of rhythm\u00a0can totally engage my attention. Also she has a great cast for this project, dancers from such a variety of backgrounds, to see them move together should be fascinating.          Exhibition: Rembrandt \u2013 The Late Works This exhibition at the National Gallery is a truly once-in-a-lifetime show. It\u2019s worth begging, borrowing or stealing a ticket just to see The Batavian Conspiracy, a masterpiece in Britain for the very first time. It\u2019s not such a large show, but has at least two major late works in each room. How Rembrandt managed to express such overwhelming humanity in mere paint is a mystery to me and one I\u2019m happy to explore again and again. I\u2019ve been twice already and know I need to go again. If I can\u2019t get in before it closes I\u2019ll just have to go to Amsterdam in March \u2013 and I probably will!          Film: The Beat That My Heart Skipped This film has haunted\u00a0me ever since I first saw it. A young Parisian works for his gangster father as a violently racist hoodlum.

He starts to study again but the intolerable tension between the two sides of\u00a0his life ends in tragedy. The power of the film is the brutality of the violence juxtaposed with the serenity and purity of the Bach the young man plays.

He has more than 20 years\u2019 experience in marketing, digital and business development, having worked for global organisations as well as smaller agencies and startups. He joined Philips in 2012. In advance of his appearance at Changing Media Summit 2015, for which he\u2019ll take part in a panel debate on the collision between digital media, privacy and consumer trust, we caught up with Blake to discuss the role of digital in marketing, over-reliance on data, and Philips\u2019 international rebrand. You\u2019ve got experience in a variety of companies at different levels. What does your background bring to your current role, and what was the attraction of moving to Philips in 2012?  I worked in a variety of businesses, software companies, and ran a digital agency. I was a start-up guy for a while. I think it\u2019s unusual in this space to find someone with the experience of agency life. At this level it\u2019s not about understanding how Twitter works. It\u2019s getting a huge organisation to understand the value of Twitter. I think that\u2019s actually an advantage. You have to constantly be resourceful and to drive an agile culture in a typically non-agile larger corporation. A start-up background helps, but so does the ability to know how to navigate a global organisation. In terms of the attraction of a new role, Philips is a global brand. It\u2019s the 42nd most important brand in the Interbrand listings, and it ranks up there with Google and Apple. It\u2019s a really powerful brand. We\u2019re trying to drive a transformation, and I couldn\u2019t resist the opportunity to move to Amsterdam and help to lead the digital side of the transformation here. What did you feel about the existing marketing strategy? There were many, many digital strategies.They just didn\u2019t connect into one unified plan, with all our groups and markets involved. The biggest thing that\u2019s been accomplished since I arrived is that the plan, the programme and the different teams have all been brought into a one team, one plan, one digital transformation outlook. The biggest change is going from a scattered strategy to a more ambitious, focused approach. What role has digital played in the marketing strategy of Philips? And what role will it play in the international rebrand? Digital means a lot of things to a lot of people. We look at it in three buckets: product, service and innovation; marketing and customer experience; and supply chain. I\u2019m concerned with the middle pillar. Digital is very horizontal, and my colleagues and I work right next to each other in utilising digital across the company. For 123 years, Philips has been known for making things. As the world increasingly connects and digitises, we\u2019re focusing more on local innovation. We bring a lot of digital innovation through marketing, combining brand stories and personal stories. The rebrand has been to assert that the brand is relevant locally. Digital is a huge role in helping the campaign come to life and reinforcing the brand and personal stories. For a global brand like Philips, how do you go about creating a \u201ccatch-all\u201d marketing campaign? It\u2019s a global brand with a global tagline \u201cInnovation and you\u201d, but the content that brings that campaign to life in any area is highly localised, depending on the products, services and solutions for that market. We have a global theme for delivering a product, but the way a campaign is brought to life will be different in India compared to Africa. Each brings the tagline to life for it\u2019s own market. How are new technologies changing the role of marketers, and how is Philips adapting to this? The big shift has been companies creating digital marketeers. The marketeer needs to be digital. It\u2019s part of the DNA. With male grooming products, for example, in a highly digital ecosystem like the UK the whole customer journey could be 80%-90% digital. Another purchase for a different product might be far less digital, so we\u2019re trying to embed these necessary digital skills into all our marketeers. How do you utilise statistics? Is an over-reliance on data and analytics damaging creativity in marketing? To be able to look at a bunch of numbers and tell a story from it is actually quite a science. I think it\u2019s a relatively new skill set. The creativity now comes through the representation of the data and analytics, through data visualisations especially. Visualisation can take analytics and data to the next level, and involves some very creative people. I think that the world is shifting towards \u201ctrust capital\u201d in that people freely give up data in exchange for a benefit, for example a social platform. But the maturity and knowledge level of the consumer is increasing regarding the trade-off of what data they\u2019re exchanging. There is such a pursuit for analysis in order to understand consumers. Chasing data for the sake of data. You can get lost in it. How can brands navigate this value exchange? There\u2019s a ongoing area where we\u2019ll continue to see businesses having to differentiate. I think we\u2019ll get to the place where there is a higher exchange value between sharing personal data and what is received. The biggest piece there is \u201cDo I trust you with my data?\u201d We\u2019re very open on that value exchange. If you have the right value exchange, and you guard the data, you can continue to navigate the new space successfully. How big an opportunity is the internet of things for brands? What are the challenges? It\u2019s important for all businesses to focus on guarding the data. As the connected products and services become more complex more types of data could be exchanged, which will require more work. We\u2019re getting very much into the health sector, and lots of our connected devices will have applications for health. It\u2019s an interesting area for Philips, and we may have an announcement to make around the Changing Media Summit. What trends are going to dominate the media landscape over the next year? There will be a rise in new platforms and services that need to be adapted to. Part of this is keeping up with the modern, hyper-active customer. A lot of brands aren\u2019t using social platforms, they need to be more aware of where the consumers are. Bi-directional shift will become quite prominent \u2013 a completely online company creating an offline product, and offline companies moving online. It\u2019s all becoming omni-channel. Brands want to be everywhere, because the customer is everywhere. Blake Cahill will be speaking at the Changing Media Summit 2015. See the rest of the line-up here.

The Ajax manager is understood to be on the St James\u2019 Park shortlist to succeed Alan Pardew but has made it clear he would not countenance leaving Amsterdam before the end of the season. De Boer has suggested he could be available come June. Asked if he would consider relocating to Tyneside the 44-year-old former Holland captain appeared to drop Mike Ashley a hint. \u201cI have everything open,\u201d said the Ajax head coach. \u201cBut I will be ready that\u2019s for sure. I only said if they asked I don\u2019t go now because I am with Ajax and I don\u2019t want to go halfway through a season while also stepping into a team that are already halfway too. So, for me, if there will be a chance it is always in the new season.\u201d Lee Charnley, Newcastle\u2019s managing director and the man charged with leading the hunt for Pardew\u2019s replacement, has recently indicated that the club may wait until the summer until filling their vacancy. It is thought Charnley could shortly announce that John Carver, the caretaker manager, will continue on a temporary basis. Deferring a more permanent decision for a few months would have the added advantage of allowing Newcastle to select from a wider pool at a time when more candidates would be available. Others who could rival De Boer include Saint-\u00c9tienne\u2019s Christophe Galtier, who remains adamant he is not prepared to quite the Ligue 1 team before May, Derby County\u2019s Steve McClaren and Thomas Tuchel.

De Boer has previously come close to managing in the Premier League. \u201cTwo years ago, I was very honoured that Liverpool asked me if I was interested in the job,\u201d he told Sky Sports. \u201cThere was still other candidates also. But I just signed a new contract [at Ajax] and I said you are too early at this moment. \u201cAnd then Tottenham last year. I was one of the candidates and in the end they chose Pochettino and all respect to the choice.

Its a shame as the people are great and would love to work and don't see why they should move South to find work, especially as they cannot afford to live there.       I don\u2019t think the politicians in London have any idea how poor the transport system is in this area of the country ... The service I experience here is from a different century, and makes living and working in the area virtually impossible unless you have access to a car.   - caliandris   I come from the north but have lived in the south-east since leaving university \u2013 simply because of where the work is. The north/south divide is real, but not easy to fix ... The brutal truth is that the original reason to locate many northern towns has gone, and no new reason has been found. - stevegb      The Job Centre in Truro, Cornwall. \u2018I will be glad to report if down in Cornwall we see any glimmer of all this wealth sloshing round ...

Agreeing with the report\u2019s findings, many readers pointed out that the \u201cdivide\u201d of UK prosperity is not between north and south, but between the south-east and the rest of the UK:  The south-west is VERY different to the south-east with its own issues, seemingly higher cost of living than the north but much lower wages than the south-east presenting some massive affordability issues. - Adrian Lee              TheLibrarianApe    19 January 2015 8:47am  Southern cities or do you mean London and the southeast?

Regional governance required A number of readers felt that establishing regional political parties or powers as part of a federal government could help rebalance economic growth:  Just further makes the case for a federal UK. All power is concentrated in London and the biggest area naturally takes precedence. But what really cripples the north is lack of representation. - diddoit   This is all the result of centralisation of spending and planning in the metropolis and \u201cmarket forces\u201d being allowed to control everything ...

All the \u201ccaps\u201d on regional spending prevent regional growth, thus increasing the jobs and cost of living in the metropolis - PoductionWest   The only answer must be true regionalism. We have a golden opportunity with dev max in Scotland to do the same for Wales and the English regions; a sort of big bang. Assemblies should represent 4-8 million in population. These 10 or so regions should control: health, welfare, policing, local infrastructure and above all economic development.  - PLATO28   Time for centralisation to be reversed, and tax-raising powers enhanced in the regions. Add to that Council Tax reform, and maybe the chronic national imbalance can be addressed. - classman              padav    19 January 2015 1:32pm  There's a very easy way (given political will behind it) to solve that problem. It's called a &quot;UK-Wide Constitutional Convention&quot; - as committed to by Ed Miliband (immediately after the Scottish Independence Referendum), and advocated by the Greens and LibDems - a citizen driven forum (with involvement and endorsement of political parties) through which all elements of civic society can make representations about what constitutes their individual locality? City Regions, in some circumstances, might be one way forward but the point here is that citizen focused input is the driving force , not diktat from on high by political \u00e9lites. I don't support City Regions (outside London) because they don't really work - half (at least) of the population of Cheshire, either works or is directly linked to the Greater Manchester and Merseyside conurbations so why split them off from the cities they are inexorably interwoven with? Our local democratic renewal campaign group took various models, for effective devolved governance on to the street in Manchester - see graphical data prepared for &quot;Scotland Decides&quot; public meeting at this URL - the results were surprising and not what you might expect.      Others thought that relocating central government would be a step in the right direction:  Once again, we\u2019re reminded that the way to tackle the UK\u2019s problems is to move the government. In one stroke, London\u2019s housing and transport problems would be solved \u2013 and the country\u2019s economy rebalanced.   - OneAnotherName              Koninklijk    19 January 2015 8:39am   This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate Again, concentrating all the economic and political power in one city is a disastrous policy.

Necessary billions I might add; however, the rest of the UK needs much more investment too ... it\u2019s not an either/or, it should be both. - DJT1Million   It is not logical that the government invests the taxpayer\u2019s money in high-cost areas such as the south. It must start investing in low-cost areas, so that the taxpayer gets value from the tax paid. - namenottaken   Spreading the wealth outside the major cities, by improving transport within the regions and investing money to develop depressed towns would help.

Advertised as an \u201cengine for growth\u201d which will \u201crebalance\u201d Britain by more efficiently connecting the north of the UK to the south, the high-speed rail link HS2 is a huge focus of government investment in infrastructure which divides opinion:  If anyone thinks one new railway is going to \u201ctransform\u201d the north\u2019s economy, think again. We need a much more basic restructuring first; oh, and the introduction of some half-decent wages would be welcome. - teacuprider   Wait until the HS2 rail link is built.

It turns the midlands into a London suburb when what the rest of the country really needs is the ability to grow without reference to London.  Better transport links across the North would help that region grow a lot more than giving Londoners more places to commute from.                 theindyisbetter    19 January 2015 11:14am  Cutting the North off from the South is a radical solution, but I don't see it catching on. No one is seriously arguing that the M1, East coast line and west coastline should be dug up in order to help the North. But if we don't build HS2, that's effectively what we would be doing when the west coast main line can no longer cope. It is too full, and a Bypass is needed. There's no reason not to build the bypass to modern standards, is there? I don't remember the M40 being criticised as being likely to turn Birmingham into a suburb of London, or to send jobs south. And yet, the reason for building the M40 was for precisely the same reason as the need for HS2 - the existing route is chock full of traffic.

Did you see the pictures of Elton John and David Furnish\u2019s wedding? Can you remember the name of Mary Cheney\u2019s bride, or Jodie Foster\u2019s? Just a few years ago, such questions would have been nonsensical. For same sex marriage seems a quintessentially 21st\u2011century phenomenon. As the US supreme court justice Samuel Alito exclaimed in 2013, before voting against it, it was surely \u201cnewer than cellphones or the internet\u201d. He has a point. Even in the western world, most people have still never met a married homosexual couple. Its opponents decry the recent spread of gay marriage as political correctness gone mad. Its supporters, on the other hand, celebrate it as a sign of progress. Same-sex marriage was a very recent but welcome innovation, the American Historical Association has advised the supreme court. Equal marriage is unprecedented, the UK government agrees, but its introduction will make \u201cour society fairer and more inclusive\u201d. (Or, as Spencer\u2019s elderly former neighbour put it when doorstepped by the Daily Mail: \u201cLife is different now, you have to get with the times.\u201d) So, everyone presumes that gay marriage is a novelty. Its explicit legalisation is, of course, new. During the 1970s and 80s, some gay activists in the US sued for the right to marry, and a few same-sex couples even managed to obtain valid licences and to wed. But it was not until the 1990s that the modern movement towards marital equality began to make headway anywhere, and only in 2000 did the Netherlands become the first jurisdiction in the world to sanction same-sex weddings.     Stephen Fry and Elliott Spencer. Photograph: Rex    It\u2019s remarkable how quickly the tide is turning. The Irish government has decided that a national referendum to amend the constitution and permit same-sex marriage will take place in May. And last week, in a surprisingly rapid turnaround, the US supreme court announced that it, too, will revisit the issue. It is possible that, by June, same\u2011sex marriage will have become enshrined as a constitutional right. Even so, for now, it remains illegal in Northern Ireland, in several states in the US and across most of the world. The centuries-long stigmatisation and criminalisation of same-sex relations is far from over. Yet this does not mean we cannot speak of homosexual marriages before the 21st century. Marriage is not just a legal creation. Despite the perennial efforts of rulers and priests to control and define matrimony, countless couples in the past simply married themselves, without formalities. As early as the 12th century, the Christian church codified the principle that the only thing required for an unbreakable wedlock was that a man and woman exchanged vows. There was no need for any priest, witnesses or ceremony. It was the couple themselves who made the marriage. In 17th-century England, paupers were sometimes forcibly prevented from marrying: however, they often lived together as husband and wife. The same was true of enslaved men and women in the US before the civil war, who could not legally wed, and of interracial couples in many states until the later 20th century. Not until 1967 did the supreme court finally end such bigotry. It is easy to think of other governments and institutions in which discriminatory laws have prevented heterosexual couples from formalising their unions \u2013 Nazi Germany, apartheid South Africa \u2026 the Church of England, and, of course, the British royal family. In the 1780s, George, Prince of Wales fell passionately in love with Maria Fitzherbert. In December 1785 they were married by one of his own chaplains, in front of several witnesses and with a certificate in the prince\u2019s own hand to prove it. Yet though their union lasted many years, until after he became prince regent in 1811 (and long after his arranged marriage to Caroline of Brunswick in 1795), it was technically illegal \u2013 because he was the heir to the throne and she was a Catholic.     Marguerite Radclyffe Hall (left), whose book The Well of Loneliness was originally banned in Britain for its sympathetic approach to homosexuality, with her partner Una Troubridge. Photograph: Topical Press Agency/Getty Images    Even after the Marriage Act of 1753 invalidated it in England, self-marriage remained a powerful idea. (Until nonconformist and civil weddings were legalised in 1836, some religious dissenters, too, continued the practice.) As the composer Samuel Wesley wrote angrily to his nagging mother in 1792, about his unsolemnised relationship with Charlotte Martin, \u201cshe is truly and properly my wife by all the laws of God and Nature \u2026 she can never be made more so \u2026 by a million of ceremonies, repeated myriads of times\u201d. The future George IV took the same view when, ignoring his legal wife, he bequeathed everything he possessed to \u201cMaria Fitzherbert, my wife, the wife of my heart and soul \u2026 such she is in the eyes of Heaven; was, is, and ever will be such in mine\u201d. In the US, informal marriage was even more widespread and generally accepted. Throughout the 19th and into the 20th century, most states upheld their citizens\u2019 rights to nuptial freedom and privacy. If a man and woman lived together as husband and wife, that was enough \u2013 it was presumed that they were married. So what about same-sex couples? When did they start thinking of themselves as married? And how were such unions viewed by the people around them? It turns out that same-sex marriage has a rather longer history than is usually thought. *** Of course, it depends on what you mean by marriage. The history of many Native American, African and Asian cultures includes same-sex and transgender conjugal unions. But examples of formal religious ceremonies in which two men who love each other are solemnly wedded together for life can be found across Europe, throughout classical antiquity and until the end of the middle ages. Such unions of sworn kinship or ritual brotherhood were entered into by kings and aristocrats, by comrades in arms, and by men in all sorts of other social contexts \u2013 in the 14th century, Chaucer described sworn brotherhood between merchants, monks, clerks, and even peasant farmers. To \u201cwed\u201d another man in this way was to plight one\u2019s troth, to covenant for life, to express the highest form of love that one person could for another. In that sense, as the classicist James Davidson has pointed out, such \u201csame\u2011sex weddings are much closer to modern companionate marriages than the heir-centred, family-allying and often family-arranged marriages of former times\u201d. In any deeply patriarchal culture, it was easy to presume that love between men was the noblest and most exquisite kind. It was the passion of David and Jonathan, of Achilles and Patroclus, and of countless popular ballads. Yet beyond their testimony to centuries of publicly celebrated same-sex love, the precise meaning (and incidence) of such unions remains unclear. It seems most plausible to see them as a type of \u201cvoluntary kinship\u201d \u2013 an intense form of ritualised male friendship, rather than an exclusive or sexual partnership. Wed-brotherhood did not imply cohabitation or sex (though in some cases, such as Edward II and Piers Gaveston, it might have); nor did it preclude heterosexual marriage. The language used by King James I and his favourite, George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, was very similar. They addressed each other as loving father and son, and as men bound to each other as \u201cgossips\u201d (ie god-siblings, or godparents). Only once did James mix these metaphors of kinship with a conjugal ideal. \u201cMy only sweet and dear child,\u201d he wrote in 1623 to Villiers, \u201cI had rather live banished in any part of the Earth with you than live a sorrowful widow\u2019s life without you.\u201d He hoped \u201cthat we may make at Christmas a new marriage ever to be kept hereafter \u2026 God bless you, my sweet child and wife, and grant that ye may ever be a comfort to your dear dad and husband.\u201d     Eleanor Charlotte Butler and Sarah Ponsonby by an unknown artist c1810-23. Illustration: courtesy of the National Portrait Gallery London    For all its emotional intensity, this was not the language of gay marriage but of a patriarchal ruler. Like other monarchs, James spoke easily of himself as the benevolent husband and father of his people, his kingdom and his parliament. Buckingham\u2019s letters, on the other hand, invariably began \u201cMy dear dad and gossip\u201d, and ended \u201cYour majesty\u2019s most humble slave and dog\u201d. He loved James. He felt from him \u201cmore affection than between lovers in the best kind, man and wife\u201d. But he could not conceive of really being married to anyone but his own wife. This was easier to do in Renaissance Italy, where it was much more socially acceptable (though still illegal) for same-sex love to extend to sodomy. In 1497, the 22-year-old apothecary Carlo di Berardo d\u2019Antonio was fined and banished from Florence for living with the dyer Michele di Bruno da Prulli (also fined), who had \u201cfor many, many years kept him as his wife and in place of a wife\u201d, and had made him swear in church, on the Bible, \u201cto remain faithful to Michele in this sodomitical vice\u201d, using essentially the same ritual as a heterosexual wedding. Almost 100 years later, in Rome in 1578, a group of Portuguese men were burned at the stake for likewise \u201cmarrying each other and being joined together as husband and wife\u201d openly in church. More generally, though, and certainly in the English-speaking world, men did not tend to live together as conjugal couples. Passionate friendship and love between men took lots of different forms. But from James I to Oscar Wilde, and beyond, a man who loved other men was also quite likely to wed a woman and have children with her. If we conceive of marriage as the long-term, exclusive cohabitation and sexual union of two people, then, in the Christian west at least, few male couples would qualify before the dawn of the 20th century. In fact, for the last 400 years, the practice of same-sex marriage has been largely the preserve of women. *** To begin with, this was a secretive and punishable matter. In medieval and Renaissance Europe, it was often not even possible for two women to live together independently: households were supposed to be headed by men. Yet we know of a few 16th-century cases of women who disguised themselves as men and lived in marriage with other women. After 1600, as the Dutch scholars Rudolf Dekker and Lotte van de Pol discovered, examples of such \u201cfemale husbands\u201d become much easier to find, especially in England, Germany and Holland. In Amsterdam in 1641, the middle-aged widow Trijntje Barents fell in love with 27-year-old Hendrickje Lamberts. Some time into their affair, Hendrickje began to dress as a man. This improved their sex life, Barents later confessed \u2013 from then on, the younger woman \u201csometimes had carnal knowledge of her two or three times a night, just as her late husband had \u2013 yes, and sometimes more arduous than he\u201d. They were a settled couple, who wished they could legally marry. Other Dutch couples did just that. In the 1680s, Cornelia Gerritse van Breugel disguised herself as a man in order to wed her long-time lover, Elisabeth Boleyn, in an Amsterdam church. They were only found out years later, when Cornelia tired of wearing men\u2019s clothes. Such cases were even more common in 18th-century England. In the early 1730s, when both were in their late teens, Mary East and her girlfriend decided to move to London and make a life together as husband and wife. Mary put on male clothes and turned herself into \u201cJames How\u201d. The two of them became successful publicans and pillars of their East End community. Everyone presumed they were married. Over the years, James was elected to almost every parish office: s/he served as the foreman of juries, on the night watch, as overseer of the poor. For more than three decades, they kept their secret, and lived as a married couple.     Willa Cather. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis    It is impossible to tell how many other female husbands lived undetected with their wives. Quick, secret marriages were easy to contract in London until the 1753 act: there was a busy trade in no-questions-asked ceremonies in taverns, brothels, prisons and chapels. On 15 December 1734, a Soho couple calling themselves John Mountford and Mary Cooper decided to get hitched. The first clergyman they approached refused to do it. \u201cSuspected 2 women\u201d, he wrote in his notebook. But they would easily have been able to find another priest. A few years later, a London minister performed the wedding of Elizabeth Huthall and John Smith, \u201ca little, short, fair, thin man, not above 5 foot\u201d. Afterwards, he wrote \u201cmy clerk judged they were both women\u201d, but they left as a legally married couple. \u201cAfter marriage I almost could prove them both women,\u201d runs yet another laconic cleric\u2019s note, \u201cthe one was dressed as a man.\u201d That pair, too, departed happily married. (Bishops and legislators take note: same-sex marriages have already taken place within the Church of England.) Sometimes it seems that female husbands were what we would now call intersex or trans. Long before the modern transgender movement, individuals and communities grappled with the potential fluidity of sex and gender. After the Virginia settler Thomas Hall (who had grown up as Thomasine) was accused of fornication with a maid, a Jamestown court ordered in 1629 that he dress in a mixture of male and female clothing, because \u201che is a man and a woman\u201d. Maria van Antwerpen (1719-1781) dressed and lived as a man for much of her life, repeatedly married other women and argued that \u201cshe was in appearance a woman, but in nature a man\u201d, though anatomically she seems to have been entirely female. Even where we can speak more straightforwardly of a \u201csame-sex\u201d relationship, the phenomenon of female husbands (which continued into the 19th and 20th centuries) raises obvious questions about the knowledge and complicity of the wives, families, friends and communities with whom they lived. It is fitting that the most sensitive interpreter of this fragmentary and opaque evidence, Emma Donoghue, is a brilliant novelist as well as a scholar. For, as she explored in her first book, Passions Between Women (Scarlet), almost nothing about these cases is clear-cut \u2013 except the inescapable fact that, even three or four centuries ago, it was not unheard of for two women to cohabit in marriage. *** By the end of the 18th century, the world had changed. From this point on it became increasingly possible for women to live together openly in western society. The growth of cities, the expansion of domestic service, the development of textile trades and the spread of schooling for girls all created new opportunities for unmarried women to travel away from home, make a living and meet one another. The 18th century also saw a revolution in ideas about male and female sexuality, which created a new cult of female friendship. In poetry, fiction and real life, innocent love between women came to be celebrated on an unprecedented scale \u2013 as an elevated and enduring passion, and a crucial support to courtship and marriage. The cultivation of intense same-sex relations became as important to middle- and upper-class womanhood as being a daughter, wife or mother. This was the world into which Charity Bryant was born in 1777. She was the youngest child of a Massachusetts doctor \u2013 educated, spirited and constantly at odds with her crabby father and domineering stepmother. When she turned 20, they threw her out, and she became an itinerant schoolteacher. By the age of 23 she had decided she would never marry. \u201cSuch a thing will never take place,\u201d she wrote to her sister-in-law, \u201cthousands in the world may call me a fool but I do not feel that their different opinions would add to my internal felicity \u2026 I cannot form that connexion on the only principle which I think will be productive of happiness.\u201d Instead, she channelled her emotional energy into a succession of passionate attachments to other young women. For several years she kept up a secret correspondence, and spent as much time as possible, with Mercy Ford, who lived in a nearby village. \u201cComfort is alone with you,\u201d Mercy wrote, \u201cmy dear how much I want to see you I cannot tell you\u201d; \u201cI shall come if ever I can run away in the night\u201d; they should \u201ctake what we can git and be thankfull for it\u201d. In 1805 their parents became alarmed and put a stop to it. By that time, Charity had already met Lydia Richards, another peripatetic teacher, with whom she managed to cohabit intermittently at other people\u2019s houses. \u201cHow sweet is mutual love,\u201d Lydia exclaimed to Charity in 1802. \u201cOh that we might once more experience its sweets, clasped in each other\u2019s arms.\u201d Your head belongs \u201con my bosom, and at night you should repose in my arms!\u201d.     A double portrait of Charity Bryant and Sylvia Drake surrounded by locks of their hair, c1820. Photograph: courtesy of the collection of the Henry Sheldon Museum, Middlebury, Vermont    In 1807, on the eve of turning 30, Charity made a new start. She moved to the tiny frontier town of Weybridge, in western Vermont, and set up as a seamstress. Here, she met Sylvia Drake, seven years her junior, the sister of a friend. Within a few months, she had rented a room of her own, hired the younger woman as her apprentice and urged her to move in as soon as possible. \u201cI not only want you to come to assist me but I long to see you and enjoy your company and conversation,\u201d she stressed. The very next day, she recalled decades later, using some telling underlining and crossings-out, Sylvia \u201cconsented to be my help-meet and came to be my companion in  labor \u201d. The following year, the couple built themselves a single-roomed house and tailoring shop. Charity ordered a ring. They took the first of several trips back to Massachusetts, where Charity introduced her friends and relations to her new mate. \u201cI need be under no apprehensions concerning your welfare while so dear and faithful a friend as Miss Drake is your constant companion,\u201d her sister Anna wrote afterwards. Lydia Richards gave Sylvia her blessing as \u201cthe friend of your heart and partner of your cares \u2026 may you long be happy in each other\u201d. \u201cShe is everything I could wish,\u201d Sylvia wrote to her mother. Over the next 44 years, until Charity\u2019s death in 1851, they never spent a night apart. \u201cIn their youthful days, they took each other as companions for life,\u201d one of her nephews wrote in the New York Evening Post in 1843: their union was \u201cno less sacred to them than the tie of marriage\u201d. When Sylvia died in 1868, their families buried them together, under a joint headstone. *** The past is unalterable. But what we see in it depends on our present preoccupations. Once you begin to look, similar couples can be found all over the place. Go to the tiny village of Northrepps, on the Norfolk coast, and you\u2019ll see many public testaments to the union of Anna Gurney and Sarah Buxton, scholars, campaigners, educationists and philanthropists. From 1823 until Sarah\u2019s death in 1839, the \u201ccottage ladies\u201d lived as a couple. They referred to each other as \u201cmy faithful and beloved Partner\u201d, they were buried together in the family plot, and in their parish church they are commemorated forever as \u201cPartners and chosen sisters knit together in the love of God\u201d. Or consider such power couples as Sarah Robinson and Barbara Montagu, Frances Power Cobbe and Mary Lloyd, and Willa Cather and Edith Lewis. These were women at the heart of 18th-, 19th- and early-20th-century intellectual society, the friends and colleagues of many of its leading writers and thinkers. In the 1980s, the pioneering lesbian historian Lillian Faderman argued that such passionate female relationships should be called \u201cromantic friendships\u201d. Before the 20th century, she asserted, sex between women was largely unimaginable, even to those who lived and slept together. Like the \u201cLadies of Llangollen\u201d, Eleanor Butler and Sarah Ponsonby, who eloped together in 1778, shared a bed for more than 50 years, and referred to each other as \u201cMy sweet love\u201d and \u201cMy better half\u201d, female couples \u201cwere probably happy to be oblivious to their genitals\u201d. Yet more recent scholarship takes exactly the opposite view. Why should heterosexuality be presumed when a man and a woman share a bed, yet homosexual acts always have to be explicitly proven? Both in the past and the present, silence about sex can be willed or artificial: it doesn\u2019t always imply an absence of knowledge or action. The pathbreaking publication by Helena Whitbread and Jill Liddington of the private writings of Anne Lister, the Yorkshire gentlewoman and lesbian rake, proved that at least some contemporaries of Bryant and Drake in England, France and Italy did feel themselves to be part of a subculture of women who loved, and had sex, with one another. And, as is increasingly recognised, Georgian and Victorian culture was as full of female as of male homoeroticism. Now Bryant and Drake\u2019s story has been reinterpreted accordingly. In a new book, Charity and Sylvia (OUP), Rachel Hope Cleves draws on family papers, diaries, memoirs and poems to reconstruct their lives much more fully than ever before, and to weave them into the larger history of the early American frontier. It is a triumph of painstaking research, and a moving love story.     Anne Lister.

Whenever a female poet describes a vale in a landscape, she must be alluding to pudenda. When Charity mislays something private at Mercy\u2019s house, her biographer\u2019s first thought is of a homemade dildo (\u201cCharity could have used her sewing skills to construct one\u201d). When a devout Christian confesses to being \u201ca person of unclean lips\u201d, the discussion inevitably turns to cunnilingus. It is undoubtedly refreshing to have one\u2019s presumptions of heterosexuality turned on their head. Yet the problem remains that many cohabiting romantic friendships surely were sexless by our standards, and self-consciously so. Among high-minded women (and men), the sublimation of physical urges was a virtue to be proud of, a pleasure in itself. The American abolitionist and feminist Mary Grew argued that her lifelong companionship with Margaret Burleigh was both \u201ca closer union than that of most marriages\u201d, and entirely chaste: \u201clove is spiritual, only passion is sexual\u201d. \u201cI cannot help thinking that surely it was not platonic,\u201d mused Lister after visiting the Ladies of Llangollen in 1822, but even she, with her exquisitely tuned gaydar, was unsure. A more fruitful conclusion is that, just as there is more to love than sex, we ought to think of the sexual as encompassing more than genital intercourse. It is impossible not to notice the eroticism of intense same-sex friendships, or the many forms of bodily contact they legitimated, even between women (or men) who were not lovers: kisses, caresses, embraces, pressing heads against bosoms, lying and sleeping in each other\u2019s arms. For Butler and Ponsonby, Bryant and Drake, and other female couples, nursing each other through illness was an especially common way of expressing physical love and devotion. Instead of the old dichotomies between friends and lovers, innocents and lesbians, acts and identities, the history of sexuality is increasingly concerned to explore what role the erotic played in different kinds of physical intimacy, personal relationships and emotional cultures. How, then, should we describe Bryant and Drake\u2019s relationship? Cleves\u2019s argument is uncompromising. Even the family tree on her opening page baldly asserts that Charity and Sylvia\u2019s relationship was identical to that of all the husbands and wives around them. Seldom can the single letter \u201cm\u201d have stood for such a large claim. Contemporary examples of ritualised female marriage are not hard to find. Two of Lister\u2019s long-term flames fantasised about marrying her in male disguise. A third, Marianna Belcombe, wed a much older widower for money in 1816 \u2013 but not before first exchanging wedding rings with Lister, and taking the sacrament with her to solemnise their union. In their minds, this was the real marriage: \u201cshe is my wife in honour &amp; in love\u201d, Lister declared. In 1825 they renewed their vows, taking clippings of each other\u2019s pubic hair, kissing it and placing it in lockets \u201cfor us always to wear under our clothes in mutual remembrance\u201d. In the early 1830s, having moved on, Lister proposed to a neighbouring landowner, Ann Walker. To mark their union, the couple exchanged rings and took communion together in church on Easter Sunday. Then they revised their wills, merged the management of their estates, and set up house together. This caused some public consternation, but Anne\u2019s new wife was treated by her relations as \u201cone of the family\u201d. In Bryant and Drake\u2019s case, the evidence is more circumstantial and indirect. \u201cI consider you both one, as man and wife are one,\u201d Charity\u2019s sister-in-law wrote to them in 1843. They lived as a couple, and were treated as one \u2013 both by those who approved and by those (like many of Sylvia\u2019s relations) who did not. Is that enough? After all, marriage is as much a social as a sexual or legal creation. It is an arguable case, but also a potentially misleading one.

Photograph: Graham Turner/Guardian    For the biggest drawback in viewing this or any same-sex relationship in the past primarily as a marriage is that it marginalises other, now less familiar, ways that the couple and their friends thought of their union: as sisters in Christ, as intimate friends, as partners, as bosom companions. These were not lesser options, or mere euphemisms for marriage, but powerful, overlapping alternatives to it. Nineteenth-century female couples often used the language of \u201chusband\u201d and \u201cwife\u201d. But the mother-daughter metaphor was even more popular, and there were many others. Women drew on a great variety of familial, religious, scientific and literary models to describe their unions. Because it was a personal creation rather than an official status, same-sex marriage was always more tenuous but also more flexible than its heterosexual counterpart. It is striking how often same-sex couples eulogised their relationship as \u201cbetter\u201d or \u201cmore\u201d or \u201ccloser\u201d than ordinary marriage. The ability to see same-sex marriage in earlier centuries should not blind us to all the ways in which it was different from the heterosexual variety. *** Homosexual marriage in the past was, therefore, not the same as in the present. But that is, of course, equally true of male-female unions. \u201cThank God!\u201d exclaimed Sir Dudley Ryder, the attorney general, back in 1753, rejecting the idea that marriage was an immutable, divine institution, \u201cwe have in this age got the better of this, as well as of a great many other superstitious opinions.\u201d You\u2019d have thought that, by now, it would have been a dead and buried superstition. In fact, the only historical constant about the definition of marriage is that it has always been contested. Two hundred years ago, marriage reform was an even more central political and social issue than it is today. After years of agitation, fundamental changes were made to the laws of divorce, marital property and women\u2019s conjugal rights. Some radicals went further still, completely rejecting marriage as an oppressive, patriarchal institution: that, too, has always been a proud homosexual tradition. A final great question was whether to permit multiple marriage. On both sides of the Atlantic, polygamy was seriously discussed, and put into practice, by the Mormons and other groups. That was why, in the 1850s, the English-speaking world\u2019s leading philosopher of human rights, John Stuart Mill, chose to make it the culminating example of his great manifesto, On Liberty. To Mill it was evident that Mormonism was, like all religion, \u201cthe product of palpable imposture\u201d, and marriage in general was obviously unjust to women, so that, in fact, he himself abhorred polygamy. But that was irrelevant; it should be allowed. After all: \u201cas it is useful that while mankind are imperfect there should be different opinions, so it is that there should be different experiments of living; that free scope should be given to varieties of character, short of injury to others; and that the worth of different modes of life should be proved practically, when anyone thinks fit to try them\u201d. Human happiness and social progress depended on such freedom. It\u2019s not a bad parallel for our modern debates on same-sex marriage. And let\u2019s see how long it takes before polygamy is back on the agenda. \u2022 Faramerz Dabhoiwala\u2019s The Origins of Sex: A History of the First Sexual Revolution is out in paperback from Penguin. \u2022 This article was amended on 26 January 2015.

The Victoria and Albert museum has attempted to conceal its ownership of a devotional image of the prophet Muhammad, citing security concerns, in what is part of a wider pattern of apparent self-censorship by British institutions that scholars fear could undermine public understanding of Islamic art and the diversity of Muslim traditions. Similar images have been shown in exhibitions across Europe and America without prompting outrage, much less protests or a violent response. Made by Muslim artists for fellow Muslims, they come from a long but often overlooked tradition. British museums and libraries hold dozens of these images, mostly miniatures in manuscripts several centuries old, but they have been kept largely out of public view. Fear of displaying them is apparently driven by controversy about satirical or offensive portraits of Muhammad by non-Muslims, despite the huge difference in form and purpose. When the V&amp;A was asked if it held any images of Muhammad after the attack on the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo, it said there were none. A US expert later provided a link to a poster in its collection, with the inscription \u201cMohammad the Prophet of God\u201d. That page in the database was deleted last week, but can still be found in a cached version. A spokeswoman said their original response was \u201can honest error\u201d. \u201cUnfortunately we were incorrect to say there were no works depicting the prophet Muhammad in the V&amp;A\u2019s collection,\u201d a spokeswoman, Olivia Colling, said in an email, adding that the image had subsequently been taken down because of security concerns. \u201cAs the museum is a high-profile public building already on a severe security alert, our security team made the decision that it was best to remove the image from our online database (it remains within the collection).\u201d The museum has many items that are not on display but form an important part of its educational and cultural mission. Colling declined to say whether the museum had consulted Muslim communities about who might consider the image offensive, or whether it had received any threats directly related to the poster, created in Iran around 1990. There was not a single complaint when another contemporary Iranian image of Muhammad was included in a 2013 exhibition in the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, hung next to a Christian icon, as part of an exhibition on cross-cultural encounters. \u201cWe knew it might be controversial, but decided to take the risk because the story is important to tell,\u201d said Mirjam Shatanawi, an Islamic art specialist and the Tropenmuseum\u2019s curator for the Middle East and North Africa. \u201cThese images are a real eye-opener, a powerful example of Islam being different and more diverse than many imagine. \u201cIf Muslims feel offended by images made by other Muslims out of reverence for the prophet, I\u2019m not sure if the museum should decide not to show them. It seems like choosing one interpretation of Islam over the other. These images are not made to disrespect but \u2013 on the contrary \u2013 to honour the prophet.\u201d The Muslim Council of Britain declined to comment on whether it considered the images offensive, or whether it would object to their display. Other British institutions with images of Muhammad in their Islamic art collections show some on websites, but have shied away from exhibitions. Edinburgh University Library last year celebrated a manuscript that contains many images of Muhammad, but none was included in the display. The university declined to say why.     The poster owned by the V&amp;A shows an Iranian artist\u2019s view of Muhammad. Photograph: PR    \u201cThere is no artistic reason whatsoever why those folios should have been left out,\u201d said Christiane Gruber, an expert in images of the prophet at the University of Michigan. \u201cThe paintings of Muhammad are superb and form a significant part of the manuscript\u2019s pictorial programme. I worry that our institutions of culture and learning are muting these significant Islamic works of figural art due to a variety of fears. This is a real shame and a terrible loss for our shared global artistic heritage.\u201d The British Library included one image of Muhammad in its 2007 Sacred exhibition, but his face is veiled. None of the other UK libraries and museums that hold pictures of the prophet could provide details of any time they had been on public display. New York\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art features one in its Islamic art galleries, and several were shown in Paris at the Biblioth\u00e8que nationale de France in 2011 with no negative response. \u201cAs a historian of religion, I think it is very important to put such images on display. They provide valuable information about the richness of Muslim devotional life,\u201d said Ingvild Flaskerud, an expert on Shia devotional culture at the University of Oslo. \u201cBy not displaying the images, we give privilege to certain understandings of Islam and marginalise others. This is not simply a scholastic issue; it is also a democratic matter.\u201d", "sentences": ["There was not a single complaint when another contemporary Iranian image of Muhammad was included in a 2013 exhibition in the Tropenmuseum in Amsterdam, hung next to a Christian icon, as part of an exhibition on cross-cultural encounters."], "title": "V&A in row over self-censorship after Muhammad image is taken down", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/24/victoria-and-albert-museum-muhammad-image-website", "tags": ["Islam", "Censorship", "Religion", "UK news", "Museums", "Culture", "Art", "Art and design"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-01-26T23:54:00Z", "article": "The ocean conservation group Sea Shepherd has been awarded \u20ac8.3m (A$11.8m) at Amsterdam\u2019s annual Good Money Gala, saying it will use the funds to build a new ship and more effectively fight poaching.

I saw damaged dunes and other soft, natural infrastructure that had been washed away, leaving neighbourhoods completely unprotected ... I saw homes destroyed, neighbourhoods disrupted, people\u2019s lives destroyed.\u201d Rodin, who became president of US philanthropic organisation the Rockefeller Foundation in 2005, had already made building the resilience of cities and communities one of the foundation\u2019s key objectives. But Sandy confirmed to her that \u201cit was the most important work we could do\u201d. Hence, the emphasis on the foundation\u2019s 100 Resilient Cities programme, and now this book. \u201cIn a time as turbulent as ours,\u201d she writes, \u201cwe have no choice: we must all work to build greater resilience.\u201d The Rockefeller Foundation partners the Guardian Cities website, and to mark both the publication of her book in the UK and the site\u2019s first anniversary, Rodin recently paid a visit to the Guardian\u2019s London office. Time was short but she talks fast and shoots from the hip, and we covered a lot of storm-ravaged ground. Rodin defines resilience as \u201cthe capacity to bounce back from a crisis, learn from it, and achieve revitalisation\u201d. Her gameplan for building resilience is threefold \u2013 being prepared, responding to the immediate crisis, and then, perhaps most important of all, developing something better in its place. \u201cNever let a good crisis go to waste,\u201d she says, quoting Churchill. \u201cCrisis is becoming the new normal,\u201d she warns. \u201cGlobally, in 2011, we spent $320bn just on recovery from natural disasters. That\u2019s not sustainable given all the other types of disasters we have to confront.\u201d But hasn\u2019t the world always been faced with one crisis or another? \u201cThey are becoming far more expensive \u2013 the data show that.\u201d     The aftermath of Superstorm Sandy: \u2018New York viewed itself as quite resilient ... yet Sandy was catastrophic\u2019. Photograph: Julio Cortez/AP    Trained as a psychologist, with a first degree from the University of Pennsylvania in the mid-1960s and then a PhD from Columbia, she is very keen on data rather than guesswork. \u201cThere have always been challenges and crises, but they tended to be big events and then they ended. Now it\u2019s much less episodic. Disasters are much more frequent, and because we\u2019re so globally interconnected, their impact affects everything in the world. The Bangkok flooding [in 2011] took down a third of the global supply chain.\u201d At the root of much of this is climate change. \u201cIt has dramatically upped the stakes in terms of the number of crises,\u201d Rodin says. \u201cThen there\u2019s rapid urbanisation: it\u2019s estimated that at the rate at which urbanisation is occurring, particularly in the developing world, 40% of the infrastructure that will exist in 35 years is not yet built. We can get that right, or we can get it horribly wrong.\u201d  Rodin cites the example of Brazil, which is rapidly growing and urbanising: \u201cYou can simply build a city grid, or you can build one with smart-grid technology that allows you to sample from whatever source of energy is most available, thus reducing your dependence on fossil fuels \u2013 and with a smart switch that allows you to delink from a piece [of infrastructure] that\u2019s failing, so you don\u2019t get half a city being taken down.\u201d The eventual 100 \u201cresilient cities\u201d selected for Rockefeller\u2019s programme (to date, 67 have been announced) will be the most visible part of the initiative. But really, Rodin wants to change mindsets everywhere, and usher in \u201ca new way of thinking about how we invest our resources, whether it\u2019s a building or a city or a business\u201d.  Superstorm Sandy sharpened her approach because it made her realise how complacent cities could be. \u201cNew York has viewed itself as quite resilient, and there was a great deal of real and significant attention and investment after 9/11 to becoming more resilient \u2013 and yet Sandy was catastrophic.\u201d Unless resilience is built into the culture of cities, Rodin says, there is always the prospect of disruption turning into disaster. Disruptions, in her way of thinking, are inevitable; disasters aren\u2019t. Indeed, with an integrated approach to resilience, disruption can be turned to advantage. Every crisis is an opportunity. The Chinese were there way before Churchill. Rodin traces her interest in the idea of resilience back to her days as a psychology student. \u201cSome of my early work was in the question of why, when you have children who grow up in equally disadvantaged neighbourhoods, a few of them succeed while most of them catastrophically fail. When I came to the University of Pennsylvania [she was the first female president of an Ivy League university] we were situated in the midst of what had become a horrifically disadvantaged neighbourhood, and I realised that some of the capacity building and the thinking about resilience that I had done around individuals could also be applied to the community level.\u201d     Rodin pictured in 2013 with then New York mayor Michael Bloomberg and World Bank Group president Jim Yong Kim. Photograph: Ramin Talaie/Getty Images    Rodin worked to revitalise not just the university but the community in which it was situated, and wrote a book called The University and Urban Revival to demonstrate how elite institutions could galvanise wider society. \u201cThe important part of the book is summed up in the subtitle \u2013 Out of the Ivory Tower and Into the Streets,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s about the obligation of these elite institutions in terms of what they can and should be doing with their neighbourhoods.\u201d This was all by way of preparation for her current work: \u201cI came to Rockefeller in 2005. Then Katrina hit and 7/7 hit. We intervened heavily in Katrina, and I realised this was a much bigger issue and a much bigger domain, and that we could do something transformational if we invested heavily, worked in a really creative way, took some risks.\u201d This was when Rodin placed what one observer called her \u201cbig bet\u201d \u2013 adjusting the focus of a philanthropic organisation that had established its reputation in global public health programmes to this new-fangled idea of resilience. \u201cI hope it is paying off,\u201d she says, though she clearly isn\u2019t in much doubt that it is. \u201cMost of all it\u2019s paying off in lives around the world, which we have shown are really helped by those investments.\u201d But what does \u201cresilience\u201d actually mean? It covers so many different types of crisis \u2013 climate change, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, even the financial crash of 2007/8, which, she says, was the result of having a \u201cvery brittle and non-resilient economic system globally, so one piece took everything down\u201d. Is the term so broad as to be almost useless? \u201cThat\u2019s something my board ask me all the time,\u201d she admits. \u201cThey say, \u2018Convince us that you\u2019re not just trying to be all things to all people.\u2019 But I think it is quite specific, and that\u2019s why in the book I talk first about the five characteristics of resilience, because those anchor it.\u201d Those characteristics are awareness, diversity, integration, the capacity for self-regulation, and adaptiveness; a community needs all five to be resilient, Rodin says. While the number of threats against which she is trying to build resilience looks ludicrously numerous and varied, she believes the specificity of the rules laid down makes the programme manageable.     Floating houses near Amsterdam, built to combat sea-level rise; the Netherlands is painted in heroic terms in Rodin\u2019s book. Photograph: Ashley Cooper/Alamy    Most strikingly, Rodin rejects the idea of \u201cstability\u201d as an overriding ambition. \u201cI differentiate resilience from stability, because stability is the tendency \u2013 both in engineering terms and psychological terms \u2013 to try to get back to normal, to rebalance. This [book] is really saying, \u2018what made you vulnerable in the first place was that equilibrium\u2019, so you\u2019ve got to use this hit, if it does happen, to adapt and grow and revitalise. New Orleans has done that.\u201d Her idea of resilience is a dynamic condition: one is not so much resilient as forever working towards resilience, and the benefits of that striving are the \u201cdividend\u201d she believes will accrue regardless of whether the disaster actually hits. The Netherlands is painted in heroic terms in the book: in the face of the threat from the sea, the Dutch have created a resilient, integrated, socially inclusive society that can withstand not just potential inundation but lots of other things besides. And that\u2019s the dividend: a society that doesn\u2019t function properly can\u2019t be resilient; a society that isn\u2019t resilient doesn\u2019t function properly. Rodin and the foundation are also committed to encouraging fairer, more equitable societies \u2013 but she admits that is proving a tougher nut to crack. \u201cOut of our original strategic planning, our two pillars initially were building greater resilience and achieving more equitable growth; we saw them going together. But that was pre-2008. We were working on more equitable growth, but then the bottom fell out of the economy and there wasn\u2019t much growth. We had to reframe what this new period was going to be all about, and we have come to more shared prosperity, more inclusive economies.\u201d  On the day we met, Oxfam had just published a report showing that 1% of the world\u2019s population held half of all global wealth. Creating more equitable societies is going to be some task. \u201cClearly, there are forces that oppose this kind of narrative about the worry for the poor and vulnerable, but that\u2019s true in all of the things we do. We have always tried to focus attention on the people who often get forgotten by the policy-makers. We don\u2019t expect to be the people who solve these problems, but we use them as the lens to form the initiatives we launch on the ground.\u201d The Ebola outbreak in west Africa came too late for the book. She says it demonstrates a lack of resilience both in the region affected and among international health bodies, and also criticises the \u201cover-responsiveness\u201d of the authorities in the US, which reacted with near-panic and threatened to stop people from west Africa entering the country.     According to Rodin, Norway showed impressive resilience in the wake of the mass killings on Utoya island in 2011. Photograph: Lefteris Pitarakis/AP    While Rodin says it\u2019s too early to judge whether the French response to the attacks on Paris can be termed \u201cresilient\u201d, she draws a parallel with the Breivik killings in Norway in 2011, which are dealt with in great detail in her book. She admires the way the country responded to that horrific and unprecedented event: \u201cThe resilience narrative around that is that they didn\u2019t let the anti-Muslim and anti-immigration fervour of the killer divide them as a society.\u201d Despite the slaughter, Norway didn\u2019t become any less Norwegian. I suggest that, as philanthropists go, she is a pretty tough one, willing to cut off NGOs the foundation is funding if they are no longer deemed to be performing. \u201cThey have to be producing,\u201d Rodin says. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the business of only keeping civil society going. If they\u2019re not producing some impact, they may have gone past their time of productivity.\u201d She also says it\u2019s important that philanthropic organisations work with commercial firms and try to get them to adapt their behaviour. Capitalism will not be overturned but perhaps made more equitable \u2013 and more efficient too.  The US is a country with numerous multimillionaires and a great reputation for philanthropy, yet remains in many ways a dysfunctional society. Is philanthropy papering over the cracks and making up for political failures? \u201cPhilanthropy is not charity,\u201d she insists. \u201cCharity assists until we can get it right. The role of philanthropy is to change the model so that [the underlying problem] doesn\u2019t occur.\u201d She argues that because philanthropic organisations get tax breaks, their money should be considered as risk capital and be used to innovate and challenge. Hence her big bet on resilience. Rodin clocks up 10 years at the Rockefeller Foundation this year. Most past presidents have done a decade, so is she eyeing the exit? \u201cI\u2019m loving what I\u2019m doing,\u201d she says. Then she returns to the gambling theme: \u201cWhen you take on real change in the organisation you lead, you get a stack of chips and you start using them up \u2013 and when they\u2019re gone you gotta go. So you have to determine when that is.\u201d She says it in such a way that you expect her to be at the table for a while yet.

As the Dutch FA president, Michael van Praag, outlined his credentials in Amsterdam, Figo unveiled his candidature and said he had the requisite five nominations from among Fifa\u2019s 209 members. \u201cI look at the reputation of Fifa right now and I don\u2019t like it. Football deserves better,\u201d said the former Barcelona and Real Madrid player. \u201cFootball has given me so much during my life and I want to give something back to the game.\u201d Figo, who is funding his own campaign, said the tipping point had been the chaos surrounding the suppression of Michael Garcia\u2019s full report into the controversial bidding races for the 2018 World Cup in Russia and the 2022 tournament in Qatar. \u201cThroughout my career I have worked at all levels of the game,\u201d said Figo. \u201cThis has given me a unique insight and understanding that I feel can enhance the discussion about the future of Fifa and the future of football.\u201d The former Portuguese international was immediately backed by his compatriot Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, who said: \u201cLu\u00eds Figo\u2019s candidacy is a great step forward for football. His career over many years grants a better future for Fifa. \u201cI believe in his character and determination, as well as his passion for the game. He will be a president focused on football and its general improvement, acting closely with all federations.\u201d Figo and Van Praag have joined Prince Ali of Jordan, who will be nominated by the English FA at a board meeting today, in emerging as contenders who will have gained the requisite nominations by Thursday\u2019s deadline. The former Fifa executive J\u00e9r\u00f4me Champagne, a one-time Blatter ally who has been campaigning for nearly a year, is still hoping to make it over the threshold. The former France international David Ginola is also campaigning as part of a publicity stunt by a bookmaking firm. Meanwhile, the football agent Mino Raiola said he had pulled out, while Harold Mayne-Nicholls, the former head of Fifa\u2019s technical committee who had suggested he might run, said he had changed his mind. The emergence of at least three credible opponents to Blatter will be seen as part of a \u201cmulti-ball\u201d strategy that has been discussed by those who want to see the 78-year old Swiss unseated after 40 years at Fifa and 17 as president. The Uefa president, Michel Platini, who decided against standing last year, hopes the strategy will help foment opposition to Blatter. It is likely that support will eventually coalesce behind one opponent to Blatter before the vote on 29 May. \u201cCredible candidates with new ideas will hopefully add to an open debate in the campaign,\u201d said a Uefa spokesman. \u201cIt is good for Fifa and it is good for football to have valid candidates with extensive experience in the sport and from different parts of the world.\u201d Van Praag kicked off his campaign by dangling a carrot to those confederations that have formed the bedrock of Blatter\u2019s support in Africa, South America, Oceania, Asia and the Concacaf region by promising to enlarge the World Cup to include more countries from outside Europe. The uphill challenge faced by all pretenders to the presidency is in convincing those confederations, who have each benefited down the years from Blatter\u2019s Goal programme to redistribute the World Cup bounty, to turn their backs on him. Van Praag said he had nothing against Blatter personally. \u201cIn fact, I like him a lot as a person,\u201d he said. \u201cBut someone who has led an organisation for so many years and has become the personification of its image can\u2019t be the face of its modernisation operation or a new Fifa.\u201d Blatter, whose tenure has been marked by endless controversy and crises, has been president since 1998 and backtracked on a previous promise to make his current term his last. Candidates need two-thirds of the votes for victory in a first round of secret balloting of the 209 members in Zurich at Fifa\u2019s Congress in May, or a simple majority in subsequent rounds. Van Praag, who announced he would serve only one term if he won, said he had told Blatter that he should step aside and take up a position as an adviser. He called for greater transparency of Fifa\u2019s finances, including the president\u2019s salary, and a \u201cnormalisation\u201d programme to repair its battered reputation. He denied there was any co-ordination with other anti-Blatter candidates. \u201cI don\u2019t know Prince Ali, I never met him. I don\u2019t know Mr Figo either. I am happy to welcome other candidates. There is no co-ordination, I am doing it myself,\u201d he said.

After years in which the servicing of debts has been pursued to the exclusion of every other objective, it has plainly not worked. A quarter of the economy has disappeared and half of young citizens are workless. To cap it all, the debt burden itself did not fall but instead grew to reach 175% of GDP. If that doesn\u2019t constitute failure, then what would? To have kept doing the same thing, while expecting different results, would have been madness. But in Amsterdam, Berlin or Helsinki, the demands of Alexis Tsipras for a \u201cviable, fair, mutually beneficial\u201d way out of the debt crisis may also seem to express delusional disregard for experience. Greece has already received two big bailouts. If its new prime minister is now to be allowed to wriggle free of commitments given by his country, then what reason will it ever have to learn to live without the begging bowl? And why should other indebted states do anything other than demand similar favourable terms, or themselves elect populists promising to make unpleasant obligations go away? Writedowns for Greece might be affordable because of its small size, but the sums would soon change if accommodations had to be reached with Sinn F\u00e9in in Ireland and Podemos in Spain. These are rational arguments, but they are also dangerous. They potentially close off the room for the compromise that Europe needs. They will be forcefully pursued by a new wave of conservative populists in the creditor countries, which could make it tempting for Angela Merkel, in particular, to calculate that cutting Greece loose from the euro would be the more manageable evil than kowtowing to Athens. She has talked tough throughout the single currency\u2019s crisis, but on the substance \u2013 from the bailouts to the banking union, and most recently QE \u2013 she has repeatedly been forced to make concessions. The electorate has responded to a chancellor that has looked in command, but she won\u2019t win waverers back from Alternative f\u00fcr Deutschland by lofty appeals to European solidarity. Whatever the technical merits of Mark Carney\u2019s suggestion on Wednesday night that Europe must now bind its fiscal fortunes more closely, the reality is that diverging perspectives on debt risk promoting a nationalism that only widens the gap between north and south. The one thing that might save the looming negotiations is a careful consideration of where self-interest lies \u2013 less on the part of Greece than on the creditor countries. Most Greeks, including the supposedly firebrand new finance minister, Yanis Varoufakis, want to stay in a single currency which is, however perversely, regarded as a badge of economic modernity by a people it has impoverished. If they were kicked out, the ejection would be effected by cutting off liquidity for the banks. That would mean an instant scramble to withdraw savings, followed first by devaluation and then by inflation, with attendant effects on all sorts of contracts. In sum, there would be chaos. But how long it would last, and how much worse it could be than the social catastrophe that has already ensued, is not at all clear. The relatively happy experience of Iceland, after it responded to a dire credit crunch with heterodox defiance, might encourage hopes that the worst may be over quickly. For the rest of the single currency club, by contrast, the damage would last for ever. Investors would wonder who would be next, and begin pulling funds out, potentially spreading the debt crisis. Day-one losses on Greek debt, newly denominated in devalued drachmas, would be followed by costly new\u00a0arrangements to insure against future exits for the rest of time. The great bailouts for Greece have overwhelmingly being spent on servicing Greek debt. The creditor countries have thus, almost literally, been giving with the one hand and taking with the other. It is this confusing conjuring that has left different parts of Europe seeing the crisis in entirely different ways. It may be that another conjuring trick is now required to deal with the consequences of that, such as delayed repayment schedules which maintain the illusion of a fixed debt but reduce its real worth. But however it is done, done it must be. Greece\u2019s debt is too big to be paid. Much of it will have to be magicked away.", "sentences": ["But in Amsterdam, Berlin or Helsinki, the demands of Alexis Tsipras for a \u201cviable, fair, mutually beneficial\u201d way out of the debt crisis may also seem to express delusional disregard for experience."], "title": "The Guardian view on Greece\u2019s debt relief: compromise is the way to go | Editorial", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/28/guardian-view-greece-debt-relief-compromise", "tags": ["Greece", "Syriza", "Europe", "World news", "European Central Bank", "European Union", "European monetary union", "Economics", "Business", "Eurozone crisis", "Banking", "European banks", "Financial crisis", "Financial sector", "Euro"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-01-29T11:08:34Z", "article": "Fonts can play a powerful role in shaping the aesthetic identity of a city \u2013 and some places wishing to update their image turn to typeface design as a revitalising tool.

I am totally beating the system!\u201d Now that I\u2019m in a slightly stronger fiscal position, and can afford to occasionally leave the country, I have a new obsession: airmiles. In The Pursuit of Love, Radlett sister Jassy is obsessed with building her running away fund. Similarly I work out whether a flight is good value by the number of airmiles it will give me and thus subsequent escapes it can facilitate. A return to New York will get me to Milan, but not home again. Is it worth going all the way to Delhi if I can also go to Amsterdam? If I have nearly enough miles to get to Mexico, how much more money do I have to pay to stop myself being dropped in the ocean en route?   Related: BA airmiles now offer a worse deal for economy class passengers    If I book after the end of April, I shall be swimming most of the way. BA have just changed the points system, so if you\u2019re flying economy, you earn far fewer points and you\u2019re charged many more. If you fly first or business \u2013 so if you\u2019re extraordinary wealthy or someone else is paying for your flight \u2013 you will be earning more points than you previously would have done. Given it\u2019s supposed to be a loyalty reward scheme, I don\u2019t think my loyalty is being rewarded at all. In fact, I\u2019m fairly sure that someone at head office is looking at my account on a screen and laughing right now, while muttering \u201cIdiot! She could fly with us every week and we still wouldn\u2019t let her in the lounge.\u201d Because I would fly every week if I thought it would help. I\u2019ve seen the points structure and tried to work out strategies to improve my lot. I\u2019ve even looked into moving banks and taking out new credit cards because some offer miles and points as a signing-up bonus. I\u2019ve wondered whether I could max out these credit cards by buying flights to far flung places, cashing in the miles and then cancelling (you can\u2019t). One acquaintance has admitted to the potentially illegal practice of buying all the seats in business class months in advance and then stopping the transaction at the last possible second in order to secure a cheap upgrade on the one economy seat he also bought. (Even I think he\u2019s an idiot, but an idiot with nerves of steel.) We\u2019re all convinced that we can somehow make a capitalist David-and-Goliath-inspired dream come true. One day we will get one over these corporations. Yes, they might have all the money, but we have time. Surely there must be a way to wiggle through the loopholes and profit from airmiles, Nectar points and Tiger tokens? Well, not as long as we\u2019re captive customers. As long as there\u2019s a system in place that might offer us a paltry reward, we\u2019ll keep coming back. The idea that we have any power or control in this corporate climate is the greatest con of all.  However, there\u2019s something strangely sexy about airmiles. Air travel has an emotive pull, and as long as there\u2019s a chance that my loyalty could take me to a distant land, I\u2019ll keep typing in my credit card number \u2013 the one that earns me extra frequent flier points.

Four young Norwegian women who met at music school, they are all impressive singers and multi-instrumentalists who write songs in English. They mix good-time pop and Americana, but throw in influences that include Celtic and Balkan styles. Most importantly, they have an enormous sense of fun. They\u2019ve played arenas and festivals, but tonight they are in the upstairs room of a London pub to preview songs from their new album, Rockland, which is dominated by an acoustic fusion of country and blues. Sweden\u2019s First Aid Kit and our own Ward Thomas have shown that there is a place for non-American female pop-country bands, and on this showing Katzenjammer fit easily into that market.            They opened with Curvaceous Needs, a cheerful and stomping country-rocker on which they showed off their four-part harmonies and played acoustic guitar, banjo, drums and an enormous bass balalaika. Then they moved on to a slinky new blues, and began to switch instruments, as bass guitar replaced balalaika and the banjo player moved to keyboards. And so it continued. All four provided lead vocals while constantly swapping instruments, which soon included accordion, mandolin and glockenspiel.

In 1999, the World Bank\u2019s International Finance Corporation (IFC) proposed a vast expansion of the city\u2019s water supply, raising real hope that a British or French company would lay pipes to the sprawling Ajegunle slum.  The IFC plan was rejected as \u201cappalling\u201d by the head of the Lagos Water Corporation, who said it was unworkable and too expensive for the city. But in the following years, donor governments, banks and a succession of European and American business consortia all went to Africa\u2019s largest metropolis with plans to take water to people such as Orogobeni.  Like the IFC, most proposed awarding a single giant water company a long concession in return for providing technical expertise and millions of water connections. But the companies, banks and donors all left, unable to agree with the federal or local authorities how to satisfy corporate demands, raise the billions of pounds inevitably needed, and convince the Nigerian public that international companies would fulfil their contracts and not make unreasonable profits from the sale of what was widely seen as a public resource. For Orogobeni, his family, and more than 15 million other Lagosians, the impasse means continuing to pay local water suppliers a hefty premium for unsafe water. About 80% of Lagos\u2019s piped water supplies are thought to be stolen, only 5% of people receive it in their houses, taps are often dry, sanitation is non-existent across much of the metropolis and the hospitals are full of people suffering diarrheal and other water-borne diseases. All that has changed since the IFC\u2019s abortive 1999 plan is that the demand for water has grown due to the arrival of millions more people in the city.      Running water \u2026 a man pushes a cart carrying water in the Nigerian city Lagos. Photograph: Sunday Alamba/AP    The latest organisation to have failed to negotiate a Lagos water agreement is the IFC \u2013 again. The private arm of the World Bank, which has lent more than $75bn for water and sanitation projects around the world since 1995, has been in secret talks for more than a year with the city\u2019s private water company about funding another possible private-public partnership (PPP) scheme. But this week it categorically stated that negotiations had broken down and were unlikely to resume for years. \u201cContrary to recent reports, IFC has not signed any agreement with the Lagos Water Corporation (LWC),\u201d said an IFC statement. \u201cLWC expressed interest in working with IFC and we had a number of discussions on how we might be able to assist the company. In the end, IFC decided not to advise LWC. We continue to support the government and people of Nigeria in achieving their development goals.\u201d A spokesman added: \u201cIt is unequivocal. We did talk to Lagos for about 18 months and we have now decided not to continue these discussions.\u201d    Where near-universal access to water has been achieved, it has virtually always been through a public commitment    The rebuff is a blow to the IFC, which has long been the world\u2019s largest funder of global water projects, providing advice for governments and loans for companies to take over and invest in under-resourced water and sanitation systems in developing countries, often as part of a broader set of privatisation policies. According to the IFC\u2019s data, it completed 847 water projects between 1993 and 2013, nearly half of which were in Latin America. But water privatisation has been politically hot since Britain became the first and only country to sell off its entire water industry in the 1980s. Many IFC projects have been opposed by coalitions of political and environmental groups amid fears that market water prices would increase way above what the poorest could pay.  Since the early 2000s, political anger has mounted with the result that far fewer water projects have been proposed, and many fewer people have been connected to clean water than the World Bank and G8 countries might have expected when the the millennium development goals were signed in 2000. According to the latest IFC figures, about 768 million people still lack access to clean drinking water, 2.5 billion people are without safe sanitation and roughly 3.5 million people die annually from water-related diseases.  The tide has turned on privatisation Research shows that the tide of water privatisation has now turned. Many cities that rushed to sign 20-year or longer concessions with water companies in expectation of clean water at a socially acceptable cost have chosen to terminate agreements and return urban water provision to public control.  A report by the Transnational Institute (TNI), Public Services International Research Unit and the Multinational Observatory suggests that 180 cities and communities in 35 countries, including Buenos Aires, Johannesburg, Paris, Accra, Berlin, La Paz, Maputo and Kuala Lumpur, have all \u201cre-municipalised\u201d their water systems in the past decade. More than 100 of the \u201creturnees\u201d were in the US and France, 14 in Africa and 12 in Latin America. Those in developing countries tended to be bigger cities than those in richer countries.        \u201cDirect experience with common problems of private water management \u2013 from lack of infrastructure investments, to tariff hikes to environmental hazards \u2013 has persuaded communities and policymakers that the public sector is better placed to provide quality services to citizens and promote the human right to water,\u201d said the report\u2019s author, Satoko Kishimoto, water coordinator with the Transnational Institute in Brussels.   \u201cA growing number of water utilities that have gone through a re-municipalisation process are increasingly ready, along with other institutions, to share experiences and provide practical support. Cooperation between public services is the most efficient way to improve water services and promote the human right to water,\u201d she said.  This week, the IFC said it had no ongoing water concession projects in Africa, and was working on very few in developing countries generally. From a high of 85 major projects in 2007, only 22 were recorded as starting in 2013. Moreover, 63 projects, representing 28% of the IFC\u2019s total water investments over the past 20 years, have failed or are in difficulty, according to the bank.     The World Bank can still fund major projects like Lagos, but it must drop its ideological commitm\u200bent to privatisation    \u201cIn the last five years the failure rate of water and sewerage privatisations has increased to 34%, compared with a failure rate of just 6% for energy, 3% for telecommunications and 7% for transportation, during the same period\u201d, said Anna Lapp\u00e9, director of the Small Planet Institute. With the IFC also reporting that nearly 40% of all its complaints in 2013 were about water, even though water projects are a small fraction of what it funds, the organisation has been put on the back foot. But it insists that cities and governments are learning from one another\u2019s experiences and that failure happens mostly when water projects are not set up properly. \u201cProperly structured PPPs [public-private partnerships] can play a key role in addressing the global water issues of today. Long-term evaluations of its projects prove that concessions can have a positive impact on levels of access and quality of services for the population,\u201d said a spokesman.      Supply on demand \u2026 a man drinks water from a roadside tap in Allahabad, India. The UN estimates more than one in six people worldwide do not have access to enough safe water a day to meet basic needs. Photograph: Rajesh Kumar Singh/AP    But this is disputed by some water activists. \u201cIt is clear that PPPs in the water sector boost corporate profits at the expense of people. Privatisation, including PPPs, just doesn\u2019t work. Where near-universal access to water has been achieved, it has virtually always been through a public commitment to build and maintain infrastructure, which represents 75% of the cost of delivering water to residents. It invariably results in raised prices, water shutoffs for those unable to pay and drastic workforce reductions, says Corporate Accountability International\u2019s water senior organiser, Nathaniel Meyer.  \u201cPublic officials often claim that due to government budget constraints they are being forced to pursue \u2018partnerships\u2019 with the private sector. But this justification is dangerously misleading, since the private sector consistently relies on the government or taxpayers to fund infrastructure, while extracting a profit, the margin of which can even be guaranteed in concession contracts,\u201d he said. Successes and failures The jury is out on whether privatisation is a worldwide failure, with academics citing cities like Guayaquil in Ecuador, Bucharest in Romania, and some in Colombia, Morocco and Senegal as successes. Opponents say privatisation in Bolivia, Tanzania, Indonesia and in parts of Europe has failed.  But both \u201csides\u201d point to cities like Manila, where the IFC designed a 25-year, $2.7bn concession in 1997, giving it part-ownership alongside other companies. The IFC claims the project is a success story because it has provided an extra 1.7 million people with clean water, reduced diarrhoea cases by 51%, and offered customers significant savings: 20 times less than per-cubic-metre rates previously charged by water vendors. But others claim that Manila\u2019s water privatisation has led to continual price hikes, legal challenges, investigations, failures to provide certain districts with water, and has given the companies unfair returns for their work. Last week the price of water was set to rise nearly 10% in many districts.  Several recent PPP projects are also hotly contested. A massive private water project in central India\u2019s largest city, Nagpur, has raised concerns among local residents. Worries range from high prices and project delays to unequal water distribution and service shutdowns. Allegations of corruption and illegal activity have led residents to protest, and city officials have called for investigations of contract violations.

Photograph: Rolex Dela Pena/EPA    Back in Lagos, the IFC\u2019s second failure to negotiate a PPP project with the city could finally persuade the government to explore alternatives known as a \u201cpublic-public partnership\u201d. These involve cities partnering with non-profit organisations to keep prices low by taking advantage of the economies of scale and sidestepping many of the legal and corporate hurdles that accompany PPPs. That way, says Kishimoto, public water projects can be much cheaper, much more accountable and just as efficient as anything promised by privatisation. Kishimoto also proposed that cities like Lagos partner with others to exchange technologies and experiences. Amsterdam, she says, works with many cities in Morocco, Indonesia and southern Africa to increase water accessibility. \u201cIt is easier and cheaper for partnerships to develop, compared with the costly and cumbersome takeover processes used by the private sector. \u201cIt is quite common in Europe for towns and cities to merge their water operations through inter-municipal associations. There is no reason why rich cities should not link with cities in developing countries to provide advice and expertise where needed.\u201d PUP partnerships have often been seen as threatening by financial markets but their numbers are growing and they have been found to work well in more than 130 cities in 70 countries, including Yokohama. \u201cThe goal must be to improve cities\u2019 water supplies. The World Bank can still fund major projects like Lagos, but it must drop its ideological commitment to privatisation. Investment in water supplies is desperately needed and governments must now seek new ways to pay for the improvements needed,\u201d says Kishimoto.

The preceding five years had been ones of tragedy, he said. And after hubris, he warned, invoking Aristotle\u2019s famous but flawed analysis of ancient drama, come nemesis and catharsis. The election, he added, was a battle between two approaches \u2013 on the one hand, the execution of austerity measures to the letter, whether or not those measures were working; on the other, a pragmatic notion \u2013 advanced by Mario Draghi, the head of the of European Central Bank \u2013 of \u201cwhatever it takes\u201d to save the euro. The latter view would prevail, said Mr Tsipras, and for an extra reason too: \u201cBecause Greece is the country of Sophocles, who taught us with his Antigone that there are moments in which the supreme law is justice.\u201d Mr Tsipras was echoing the language of Antigone\u2019s refusal to abide by her uncle the king\u2019s edict that her dead brother be left unburied. In the drama she contrasts manmade laws, nomoi, with an ineffable, divine justice, Dike. Moral authority trumps mortal authority. Exceptional times call for exceptional terms in which to describe them, and it is not surprising that Mr Tsipras should delve into the rich archive of Greek tragedy. Especially over the past decade, Greek literature has provided a way in Britain too of addressing questions that can be difficult to tackle head-on. Productions of Greek tragedy have abounded, almost shadowing the course of military actions in Iraq and Afghanistan. They have ranged from Katie Mitchell\u2019s 2004 production of Euripides\u2019s Iphigenia at Aulis, which tells of an army\u2019s preparations for war, to Timberlake Wertenbaker\u2019s 2013 version of Sophocles\u2019s Ajax, a play that plunges the viewer into the madness of a soldier overwhelmed by the stress and trauma of combat. A new production of Antigone, starring Juliette Binoche and directed by Ivo van Hove, one of our day\u2019s greatest directors, is soon to be premiered in Luxembourg, before playing in London, various cities in mainland Europe, including Antwerp, Amsterdam and Paris, and at the Edinburgh international festival and BAM in New York. It is another tragedy that is set amid the grief and devastation of recent conflict. Why do we keep returning to these ancient texts? It is not because we are particularly like the ancient Greeks. As the poet and classicist Anne Carson has put it, the ancient Greeks give us only \u201clittle glimpses, little latches of similarity, embedded in unbelievable otherness\u201d. Hegel had an answer. The essential quality of Bildung, he argued \u2013 the German word that expresses the idea of the cultivation and formation of the self \u2013 was the act of keeping oneself open to that which is other. The study of classics had a particular role to play in this, he said. It offers a world that is remote enough from our own that it provides a space in which difficult ideas can be played out at, as it were, one remove. On the other hand, the classical world is sufficiently familiar to us that it contains \u201call the exit points and threads of the return to oneself\u201d. Thinking with the Greeks, in short, offers a dynamic means of trying to understand the other \u2013 a duty that, in today\u2019s world, has never seemed more pressing.", "sentences": ["A new production of Antigone, starring Juliette Binoche and directed by Ivo van Hove, one of our day\u2019s greatest directors, is soon to be premiered in Luxembourg, before playing in London, various cities in mainland Europe, including Antwerp, Amsterdam and Paris, and at the Edinburgh international festival and BAM in New York."], "title": "The Guardian view on Greek tragedy: something old, something new", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/jan/30/guardian-view-greek-tragedy-someting-old-new", "tags": ["Greece", "Europe", "World news", "Syriza", "Alexis Tsipras", "Theatre", "Sophocles", "Stage", "Classics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-02-02T18:49:42Z", "article": "A wall of faces greets you in the opening room. Dozens of ink and graphite images look back at us, wonky and misproportioned, but also weirdly right. They\u2019re called Rejects \u2013 do their sometimes wild imperfections signal failure, or something else? This is a good way to begin. Should we reject them, too? The series is ongoing, and Marlene Dumas keeps them close \u2013 a family full of flaws. It\u2019s their faults that make them human. There are faces everywhere in these rooms of sex and death. Even when she is painting the dead, Dumas\u2019s work is full of life. Near the end of Tate Modern\u2019s Dumas retrospective are her large, oil-painted heads of Saint Lucy, leftwing German militant Ulrike Meinhof and an anonymous young woman shot by Russia\u2019s Alpha anti-terrorism forces in the 2002 Dubrovka theatre siege in Moscow. The heads remind me of sexual rapture as much as death. I wrote about these paintings 10 years ago, and they\u2019re even more alive to me now.     For Whom the Bell Tolls (2008)    Born in South Africa, Dumas deals in the paradoxes and ambiguities of both painting and life. Who knows, when they begin a painting, how things will end up? If you want to make God laugh, tell him your plans. Among these heads is a picture of the skull of Charlotte Corday, who murdered the French revolutionary Jean-Paul Marat in his bath. It\u2019s like a cratered moon. Corday went to the guillotine \u201cwithout rage\u201d, Dumas observes. As well as the dead, there are the crazy, the guilty, the lascivious, the doomed, the misguided, the famous and \u2013 in the case of Osama bin Laden \u2013 the notorious. Bin Laden looks like an ordinary man in Dumas\u2019s portrait which, like most of her work, is painted from secondhand images. Even though they are made from thinned-down paint \u2013 their colour and pallor from the palette or the dirty turps she washed her brushes in \u2013 they have a presence that is entirely different from a photograph. A series of drawings, made last year for the Manifesta biennial in St Petersburg in the wake of Russia\u2019s anti-LGBT laws, is a roll call of great men, all of them homosexual and many, like Alan Turing, who suffered or died because of it. They are a kind of commemoration. Dumas told me she cannot paint anyone without sympathy. She has also said that she prefers to work from photographs so that she is distanced from her subjects, and can paint with an \u201camoral\u201d brush. When she painted her daughter, Helena, naked and covered in smears of paint, her hands dripping red and blue, she gave the child\u2019s face a brooding, accusatory expression, a knowing look. An ageing South African woman with pale blue eyes, in a painting called The White Disease, is based on a medical photograph. What is her disease? Is it the infection of apartheid and a belief in white superiority? You never know what anyone is thinking. And these are paintings after all.              \u201cArt doesn\u2019t speak unless it\u2019s spoken to,\u201d Dumas says, in one of the wise little texts she has written about her work. What is Lady Di, derived from Lord Snowdon\u2019s Gainsborough-esque photographic portrait, thinking as she gives one of her patented sideways looks at Naomi Campbell, full-frontal on an adjacent canvas? This, and a nearby portrait of Amy Winehouse, strikes a false note \u2013 the low point of a show that takes us from rural Afrikaans-speaking South Africa (there is an interesting vitrine of Dumas\u2019s juvenilia), to sex clubs in Amsterdam, and looks at the miseries of war and death. On the way, we meet Ingrid Bergman bloated and crying in For Whom the Bells Tolls, Sigmund Freud\u2019s wife, film-maker Pier Paolo Pasolini and his mother, record producer Phil Spector mad in his wig and then sick and bald in jail, and Dumas herself looking over her shoulder in a painting whose title, Evil is Banal, nods to Hannah Arendt and her book about Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann.     Evil Is Banal (1984)    Looking at Dumas\u2019s paintings, I am often struck by how little there seems to be on the canvas. The images coalesce out of almost nothing. She somehow cajoles her medium into forming a face, a body, an expression \u2013 a sense of being. Wiping paint off as often as painting positive emphatic marks, she gives us cheekbones or a forehead, a proffered anus and balls or a vulva using hardly anything. Going from extreme vagueness to almost crude and snaggly brushstrokes to make an ear or to describe hair, Dumas runs the gamut of painterly effects. The frankness with which she paints draws us in. It can at first all seem haphazard and a bit chaotic, but that\u2019s life, and that\u2019s the marvellous thing when Dumas\u2019s work comes together. One of the pleasures of this exhibition is seeing how she constantly rediscovers herself and develops her artistic language over the decades. You get a real sense of the artist thinking through action, through all the mistakes and the backtracking. Dumas\u2019s work is affecting not just because of her subjects or her mastery (with all its masculine associations), but because of its apparent drive and vulnerability, its repeated journeys of discovery and surprise, its plainspokenness. In any case, risk is better than mastery. I first encountered her work almost 30 years ago, and I have got to know Dumas well (oddly enough, we were born on the same day in 1953). Yet still she surprises me, even when I come across a work I have known for a long time. Each time I look, it seems new again. This is to do with more than freshness of touch, although the fact that her work is as much a kind of wet drawing, even if it is painted, has something to do with this. Drawings can seem timeless and immediate in a way paintings often don\u2019t. Drawing wet ink into wet watercolour allows few revisions. Over-painting doesn\u2019t work. The real mystery is that there is no mystery. Dumas can be magnificently awkward, and is at her darkest when her touch is at its lightest, her candour most apparent. \u2022 Marlene Dumas: The Image As Burden is at Tate Modern, London, 5 Feburary to 10 May.\u2022 The daring art of Marlene Dumas: duct-tape, pot bellies and Bin Laden\u2022 Bold, graphic and disturbing: the art of Marlene Dumas \u2013 in pictures", "sentences": ["This, and a nearby portrait of Amy Winehouse, strikes a false note \u2013 the low point of a show that takes us from rural Afrikaans-speaking South Africa (there is an interesting vitrine of Dumas\u2019s juvenilia), to sex clubs in Amsterdam, and looks at the miseries of war and death."], "title": "Rapture and rejects: the beautiful, flawed world of Marlene Dumas", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/feb/02/rapture-and-rejects-marlene-dumas-tate-modern", "tags": ["Painting", "Culture", "Art", "Art and design"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-02-03T18:05:16Z", "article": "As if club culture in London wasn\u2019t already constricted by the powers-that-be, along comes more legislation to chip away at our nightlife. Just last week it was announced that London\u2019s Metropolitan Police are launching a pilot scheme that will enable doormen to breath test clubbers before they are allowed to enter as a means to prevent \u201cpre-loading\u201d.  Just before Christmas, the Met suggested a raft of specific measures for one of the city\u2019s most influential venues, Fabric. Among one proposal - although not yet in use - was the recommendation to have sniffer dogs in place in an attempt to clamp down on drug use at the venue. In the aftermath of these newly proposed procedures, I spoke to several friends who had almost given up on London\u2019s ever-decreasing number of quality clubbing spaces, suggesting that European destinations would provide a far better, more permissive and liberal setting.    Related: Fabric nightclub holds on to licence \u2013 but must pay for sniffer dogs    It goes without saying that irresponsible drug use and excessive drinking is dangerous, and has a negative impact on the nightlife industry. It\u2019s understandable that the authorities want to crack down on anything that can lead to harm. However, the measures that are being taken are typically excessive and draconian \u2013 and, once again, highlight how British authorities can often favour short-term fixes for issues that require far greater attention and consideration.  For instance, if one club turns away someone who is over their breathalyser limit, what\u2019s to stop them going elsewhere, or remaining on the streets where they may end up still getting into a confrontation? Using dogs as a deterrent to those who want to indulge in recreational drug taking at a dance music venue is hardly going to stop them taking those drugs elsewhere.  Perhaps rather than trying to quash drink and drug culture, procedures should be in place to educate people in the risks and promote a responsible attitude. After all, more education, and a more liberal attitude in respect of free testing of drugs for club and festival goers, may have helped to avoid recent deaths from a lethal batch of Superman pills, which contained dangerous PMMA. Amsterdam\u2019s Night Mayor, Mirik Milan, who is opposed to the drug policies of UK clubs, echoed this sentiment recently.  \u201cIf you look at drugs as being a problem just for dance music or for nightclub owners then you\u2019re looking at it wrong,\u201d Milan said. \u201cDrug use is something which sits in society, and which you will not take out by having sniffer dogs at the door.\u201d  He also advocated Switzerland\u2019s liberal approach to drug testing: \u201cIn Switzerland, you can test on location at festivals, and the last person to die in Switzerland due to taking drugs at an event was seven years ago. It\u2019s not like they\u2019re just drinking schnapps in the hills in Switzerland, so if you look at it from a damage limitation perspective, it works.\u201d As it stands, European destinations such as Berlin have benefited from an open-minded, intelligent approach to club culture. Besides the city\u2019s most famous club space, Berghain, there are numerous other venues which promote an inclusive, liberal atmosphere and stay open from Friday night until Monday morning. In doing this, they give the club-going public a level of respect and freedom that can only result in a more responsible attitude to drink and drug use. It\u2019s no wonder the UK has such a big problem with binge drinking, with our opening hours and the high cost of alcohol in most bars and clubs.

The company aims to launch the pilot in April, according to Greenpeace India campaigner Neha Saigal, but it\u2019s not clear when Tata \u2013 the second largest tea company in the world (hit in recent years with reports that female workers had been trafficked into domestic slavery from a plantation in Assam) \u2013 plans to kick off its program, which also has a goal to achieve sustainable sourcing by 2020.  More details about the pilots aren\u2019t clear, as the companies have remained tight-lipped. (Both declined to comment). But when the largest players in any industry take their first steps towards sustainability, it raises the question: could this pave the way for smaller producers to shift to organic cultivation too?     Ramesh Babu\u2019s tea plantation in India. Photograph: Ramesh Babu/EcoTeas/Guardian    There\u2019s a huge need to bring down barriers that make it harder for growers to go organic, according to Saigal, whose organization pushed for the pesticide-free commitment, and is now keeping an eye on the companies to implement the pilots. India\u2019s regulations for pesticide use in tea aren\u2019t straightforward or consistent from one jurisdiction to another, nor comprehensive, she says. \u201cPesticide regulation in India is in shambles,\u201d Saigal said. \u201cWhat this shows is that you need a policy level change.\u201d \u201cGrowers aren\u2019t aware of what they are using and what they aren\u2019t using,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s the government\u2019s job to make these small growers aware of what\u2019s toxic and what\u2019s not. It\u2019s their job to create those support systems creating a knowledge base and having a system to transform that knowledge to use ecological alternatives.\u201d Greenpeace India is in talks with the Tea Board of India \u2013 the government-run body with the authority to crack down on these regulatory problems \u2013 about setting up a support system for small tea growers so they can move away from pesticides. In September, the Tea Board (which did not respond to interview requests) issued the second version of its Plant Protection Code that listed the approximately three dozen pesticides approved for use in tea. Yet maximum residue levels had been set for just 10 of them, according to the document. Government support is needed for organic tea production to thrive in India, Babu says.  \u201cThe government of India and the Tea Board have got to come up with a very supportive package for small tea growers,\u201d he said. \u201cThis would mean giving subsidies to help small tea growers convert to organic.\u201d Babu has his own plan to jumpstart a new generation of organic tea growers in India. He expects his factory to be fully up and running in the next few months, which he believes will improve his financial position, since he\u2019ll be able to produce up to 30 times more tea. Once that happens, he wants to teach other growers how convert to organic growing so he can process their leaves in his factory and start an organic growers association that could foster mutual support and push for higher payments for their leaves. But Hope Lee, a business analyst who specializes in the hot beverages market for intelligence research firm Euromonitor International, says that small tea growers in India and other developing markets \u2013 such as Argentina, the Middle East, China and Kenya \u2013 face other challenges beyond their borders.     Ramesh Babu has been battling to produce organic tea leaves since 2006. Photograph: Ramesh Babu/EcoTeas/Guardian    \u201cThey find it hard to export their product to developed markets because they don\u2019t meet strict standards in developed countries,\u201d she said. \u201cSome companies in developing countries don\u2019t have money to hire these expensive services [to test for pesticide levels] and they don\u2019t see the short-term profit from it if they pay a lot of money for testing.\u201d But it also depends on how serious the national government is in promoting their tea exporting business and how they set their standards, she added. \u201cSo this issue comes to the question [of] if Unilever or Tata have the resources to solve this problem,\u201d Lee said. \u201cBig companies like Twinings or Unilever or Tata \u2013 they can influence the government and they have the resources to train their suppliers and make their tea grow in a more sustainable way, but they need the cooperation of the local government,\u201d she said. Fair-trade and certification programs are used as additional strategies to move industries towards more sustainable practices. Yet Daan de Vries, the markets director at UTZ Certified, an Amsterdam-based organization, says that certification alone is not enough.  \u201cIn some places there\u2019s value but it\u2019s not the way to go to change markets,\u201d he said. \u201cConsistently, you\u2019ll see no more than maybe 5% of people who would want to change their buying behavior based on sustainability claims or labels.\u201d Tea 2030 is an initiative that appears to be taking on a more comprehensive approach. Organized by UK-based nonprofit Forum for the Future, industry heavyweights like Unilever, Tata and Twinings have joined with the Ethical Tea Partnership, Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance to identify challenges facing the tea industry, such as competition for land, climate change, natural resource constraints and living wage issues. (Starbucks also joined late last year).  A report released by the initiative last year lays out these challenges, along with principles for a sustainable value chain, which the alliance would like to see in action by 2030.  \u201cOf course the individual companies are pursuing their own sustainability [initiatives], such as Unilever and Tata on pesticides,\u201d said Ann-Marie Brouder, Tea 2030\u2019s coordinator. \u201cBut there are some problems too big for individual companies to tackle\u2026. We believe that if we\u2019re going to make change, it needs to be owned by the tea sector.\u201d In the meantime, Babu continues to quietly push forward, all the while tending his tea plants and the trees he\u2019s allowed to intersperse among the crop in direct opposition to the monoculture plantation standard. \u201cIt\u2019s something that cannot be approached in terms of a business,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a change of the mindset.\u201d The role of business in development hub is funded by Business Call to Action.

Last week he was at the Sundance film festival, the month before, he was at the European Film awards, before that he was simply ubiquitous. His first feature, \u201971, a visceral study of a British soldier caught in the chaos of peak-Troubles Belfast, took him to every prestigious film event on the calendar bar Cannes, and the 38-year-old is presently a good bet to win outstanding debut at the imminent Baftas. The journey started almost exactly a year ago, when the film premiered at the 2014 Berlin film festival. \u201cWe had no idea what we had,\u201d admits Demange. \u201cI was still in the thick of making it \u2013 I\u2019d only finished the sound mix two weeks before the premiere. I was incredibly nervous. Just shitting myself. There were 1,500 people in the cinema and I was overwhelmed \u2013 and scared.\u201d He vividly remembers those final moments. \u201cWhile we making the film we were always being told that it wouldn\u2019t travel, that no one would care. My producer and I were slightly broken, and at one point we looked at each other as if to say, \u2018Is anyone even going to fucking watch this thing?\u2019\u201d It so happened they were.           \u201871: watch Jack O\u2019Connell in the world exclusive trailer for the Belfast-set thriller    Before that, Demange was best known for TV shows Dead Set and Top Boy, and his first press conference was unnerving. \u201cIt\u2019s the part of the game that no one prepares you for,\u201d he says, \u201cand you don\u2019t really understand that it\u2019s part of the game until you\u2019ve made a film. When I was in television I was anonymous.\u201d The French were especially curious \u2013 Demange is a French passport holder. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t wrap their heads around the fact that I\u2019m half-French, half-Algerian \u2013 legally French \u2013 but raised in London. No one did a hatchet job on me, but some of them tried to lead me to say that I wouldn\u2019t have had the same chances in France, that I went to the UK because I\u2019m Algerian.

Then I applied to the NFTS and got a place but I couldn\u2019t afford it, so the school helped me out \u2013 they got me a full scholarship from Disney, of all things.

Afterwards, he says: \u201cI went to Amsterdam for nine months to write what I thought would be my first film. Funnily enough, it was about civil war in Algeria, and a lot of the themes exist in \u201971. The script I wrote wasn\u2019t good enough to make, but I put a lot of what I wanted to talk about into \u201971 \u2013 or it was already there. I only came back to London because I was offered Dead Set.\u201d After Dead Set, Charlie Brooker\u2019s violent zombie satire, there were a couple of big-screen projects on the horizon, including one with Working Title about the Iranian embassy siege. \u201cBut they weren\u2019t really popping,\u201d he says. So he went for Channel 4\u2019s Top Boy, a Hackney-set gang drama starring Ashley Walters. \u201cAs a Londoner it was almost like a personal thing. I cared about the kids\u2019 stories \u2013 not so much the drug dealers.

It\u2019s one of the axioms of orchestral life that great orchestras need great halls in order to develop as an ensemble, and it\u2019s something that today\u2019s finest conductors have as a defining mission statement. Mariss Jansons has campaigned for a new hall in Munich for his Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra for over a decade - a project that is now in jeopardy, thanks to the latest machination of Munich-based politics (as Jens F. Laurson reports here). On these shores, rumours suggest that were Simon Rattle to be thinking about possibly running the London Symphony Orchestra, he would, hypothetically, in an ideal world where everything\u2019s putatively perfect, demand, or rather catalyse, the construction of a new concert hall somewhere, somehow, in all probability in the City of London. Perhaps... The evidence is hard to dispute: it\u2019s not-quite-but-almost a truism that the best orchestras have the best halls - think of, say, the Concertgebouw (\u201cconcert building\u201d) in Amsterdam and the orchestra with which it is synonymous, the Vienna Philharmonic and the Musikverein, the Berliner Philharmoniker and the Philharmonie in Berlin, the Cleveland Orchestra and Severance Hall, the Boston Symphony and their Symphony Hall. (The LSO would rightly dispute that; nobody claims that the Barbican Hall is the finest of the world\u2019s acoustics - although it has, I think, real presence and power if you\u2019re sitting in a lucky seat - yet the LSO remains near the top of the world-orchestra-tree - a rather Wagnerian locution I might have to copyright). The issue, of course, is whether all this maestro-power will work its magic on the politicians, the planners, and the business sponsors of their respective cities. In Geneva, they\u2019re at an early stage, in Munich, after years of debate, the politicians have apparently opted for a terrible bodge, and in London\u2026 Well: I have the sense that although nothing has been publicly announced, there are some possibly positive noises off at the moment; but whether that will turn into the churn of diggers, earth-movers, and pile-drivers remains to be seen.

At age three, she lost both her parents and was sent to an orphanage where she was mistreated by staff who believed she was the \u201cdevil\u2019s child\u201d due to her pigmented skin (caused by vitiligo). She and her best friend were adopted by an American couple when they were four. In 2011 DePrince starred in the ballet documentary First Position, and she is now a professional ballerina with the Dutch National Ballet. She has just published her memoir. You co-wrote your memoir with your mother [Elaine DePrince], who kept notes of all the traumatic memories you told her of Sierra Leone when you were growing up. How did you find reliving those experiences? The first time I ever talked about my story, it was very difficult to recover\u2026 I\u2019m so happy my mum was involved \u2013 she was smart to write it all down when I was little. If I\u2019d had to relive everything for the book it would have been a lot harder. Why did you write your memoir? It was a therapeutic outlet and a way for me to reach out to other people. When I went to South Africa [to perform with the South African Ballet Theatre], I shared my story with a few high-school kids and realised it could really have an impact. It inspired me to think differently about myself \u2013 I always wanted to be a role model and to let people know that it\u2019s OK to dream and to live for something. You must be thrilled with the response the book has had. I\u2019ve had adults emailing me, kids emailing me\u2026 It means so much that my book helped them in some way. Laverne Cox, the actress in Orange Is the New Black, tweeted me saying how inspirational I was to her. Of course, you have to act really casual, even though I was thinking \u2018Oh my God I love you so much!\u2019 She\u2019s a transgender person, and some people don\u2019t support that, so she\u2019s the inspiration \u2013 I feel like I haven\u2019t really done anything. Are you a fan of Orange Is the New Black? I love that show. I love TV and movies \u2013 anything that can help me stop thinking about dancing for a bit, because it can really take over your mind. It\u2019s mentally and physically exhausting. You moved to Amsterdam in 2013 to join the Dutch National Ballet. I read that you\u2019re learning Dutch\u2026 Kind of \u2013 it\u2019s very hard. I can count to 10, I know the alphabet, how to say hello and order coffee, and that\u2019s about it. Right now I\u2019m focusing more on dancing. What are you working on at the moment?  Right now we\u2019re working on Jewels. After that we\u2019re going to be doing Swan Lake, Back to Bach, Cinderella, and travelling to St Petersburg, London, Hong Kong, and touring Holland \u2013 it\u2019s a busy year. They\u2019re giving me amazing opportunities here. What is the main difference between living in Europe and the US? Europe is great, especially for dance. It\u2019s a lot more accepting than the US \u2013 there I struggled with the fact that I was black and there weren\u2019t a lot of black dancers at the studio with me. Although in the US, at least I could look up to [other black ballerinas] Misty Copeland or Lauren Anderson. Is there any sign of the racial bias in ballet changing? I\u2019m hoping it is, but I don\u2019t see it happening. There\u2019s a dancer [Precious Adams] who was at the Bolshoi Ballet Academy in Moscow \u2013 they told her to bleach her skin. She\u2019s now doing very well at the English National Ballet, but often you look around, and there are no black dancers. Classical ballet is beautiful, but it\u2019s very old. What, in your opinion, needs to be done to change that? When I was a child, I overheard one of my directors saying \u2018we don\u2019t put a lot of effort into the black girls, because they end up getting fat\u2019. I want people [in ballet] to realise that not everybody is the same \u2013 you don\u2019t know how our bodies are going to turn out. Do you ever get bored answering questions about being a black ballerina? No. There are practically no black people in ballet, so I need to speak out. In your memoir, you and your sister Mia [DePrince\u2019s best friend from the orphanage] talk about not feeling ready to return to Sierra Leone. Do you still feel like that? There are little scars still, and those need to heal before I can go, so that I don\u2019t have to worry that when I go back to the US or to Amsterdam I\u2019ll have nightmares. You have to make sure that you\u2019re 100% ready to deal with something that you\u2019ve always been terrified of. You wrote in the book \u2018when I\u2019m older I\u2019d like to start a free arts school in Sierra Leone, and teach ballet there\u2019. That would be amazing \u2013 I\u2019d like to use the money we earn from this book to open the school. It\u2019ll have to be when I retire from dancing. The arts can change you as a person. Dancing helped me share my emotions and connect to my family, it helped me feel like I was special and not the \u201cdevil\u2019s child\u201d. Those kids won\u2019t have the same opportunities I had, and I don\u2019t think they deserve that. Your parents have had 11 children, nine of whom they adopted. Would you ever consider adoption? I\u2019d love kids of my own, but if that\u2019s not possible I\u2019d definitely adopt. The fact that it\u2019s becoming so hard to adopt kids from all over the world is so sad. I wouldn\u2019t be alive today if I hadn\u2019t been adopted. I met Angelina Jolie at Women in the World in 2013; she\u2019s adopted so many kids and I think that\u2019s wonderful \u2013 it\u2019s horrible that people were so negative about it. You\u2019ve become a poster girl for many things: international adoption, black women in classical ballet, the American dream\u2026 Is that a lot of responsibility? It is. Sometimes I think, what happens if I never become the dancer I\u2019ve always wanted to be, and people are disappointed? But at the same time I like being a role model, and when I see that I\u2019ve inspired young people to dance, especially young black dancers, that\u2019s amazing for me.

You know, apart from the algebra, the trigonometry, the optics, the astronomy and the many other scientific advances and inventions of the Islamic Golden Age. Well, if you like art and interiors, there\u2019s always the stunning patterns that grace mosques, madrasas and palaces around the world. Islamic craftsmen and artists \u2013 who were prohibited from making representations of people in holy sites \u2013 developed an instantly recognizable aesthetic based on repeated geometrical shapes. The mathematical elegance of these designs is that no matter how elaborate they are, they are always based on grids constructed using only a ruler and a pair of compasses.  Islamic design is based on Greek geometry, which teaches us that starting with very basic assumptions, we can build up a remarkable number of proofs about shapes. Islamic patterns provide a visual confirmation of the complexity that can be achieved with such simple tools. Dust off your old geometry set, and let\u2019s see how.       The template has a circle in a square, divided into 12 equal sections. (We could have got this using a compass, but let\u2019s assume you know how to do this). Put the compass point on each corner of the square to draw the first four quarter-circles.      Follow the steps: add a small circle then eight line segments.      When it gets tricky it can help to mark the intersections before you draw the line.      Beginning to take shape now. I tried this at home and it was really fun but quite fiddly - and made me respect the skills of the craftsmen of a thousand years ago, who didn\u2019t have retractible pencils, endless sheets of high quality paper or computer printers.      You are now allowed to use the red Sharpie.      It\u2019s looking good. And here we are.      The step by step guide above was made by Eric Broug, one of the most active practitioners of Islamic geometric design working today. Eric is a Dutchman who lives in Halifax, West Yorkshire.  \u201cGeometry is really a universal language, everyone can \u2013 and does \u2013 relate to it instinctively,\u201d he says. \u201cThere is a joy to be had in starting with a blank piece of paper and to draw lines and circles and end up with a pattern that is recognizable and beautiful. This process connects you very directly to a design heritage.\u201d     The basic principle behind Islamic design: you draw a grid using ruler and compass, draw the pattern on top and then remove the grid.     Islamic geometric design mixes elements of maths, art and history. Trying to decipher the steps that led to finished patterns is like a mathematical puzzle. Constructing new pieces involves creativity mixed with an understanding of the various styles and embellishments the ancients used. So how did a Christian Dutchman end up an international ambassador for Islamic design? Eric, aged 48, was in his 20s studying Middle Eastern politics at university in Amsterdam when, by chance, he found a book on the subject in a local bookstore. He was hooked. In 2000 he moved to London to study Islamic design at the Prince\u2019s School for Traditional Arts. He later took an MA in the History of Islamic Art and Architecture at the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS). Eric has a full-time job at an academic publisher, but in his spare time writes books, gives talks and workshops and runs an atelier in Halifax that designs bespoke screens, logos and other work for clients around the world.     Eric Broug takes a selfie at the Bou Inania Madrasa in Fez, Morocco.     About half of his clients are Muslim. Do they find it odd that he isn\u2019t? \u201cIn the 20 years I have been practising Islamic geometric design, I have been asked maybe once or twice whether I was a Muslim. It\u2019s a non-issue. Human beings like beautiful things. I want to engage with people and show them the beauty and design techniques involved in making these patterns.\u201d \u201cMy desire is to popularize this tradition \u2013 to make it accessible to anyone who can draw a line and a circle,\u201d he says.     A screen hand-made from oak, installed in a house in the US.     Eric\u2019s screens are made from steel, wood or Perspex. \u201cThe first screen I ever manufactured was for an American lady in Nebraska. I don\u2019t treat Islamic geometric patterns as universal or generic. So, for example, a client who wants screens for a Turkish restaurant, will be best served with geometric patterns from the Seljuk or Ottoman era. It wouldn\u2019t make sense to use Moroccan patterns in the decor of a Turkish restaurant, after all!\u201d Absolutely. It might put you off your kebab.      The view from Eric\u2019s study. The pattern in the screen is taken from the al-Mustansariyya madrasa in Baghdad, dating from 1227. Beyond is the Calder valley. Photograph: Eric Broug    Eric hopes that his research and outreach work will breath life into future of Islamic geometric design. \u201cIf we can identify and define what is excellent in the past eight to ten centuries, we can start to come up with an educational strategy to revitalize it in the 21st century so that it once again is a creative realm where innovation pervades. Currently, there is almost only replication of patterns, very little innovation.\u201d     Guess which garage is Eric\u2019s? The design is a detail from a minbar in the 15th century funerary complex of Sultan Barsbay in Cairo. Photograph: Eric Broug    The following patterns show how a pattern of overlapping hexagons can become a dodecagons.      \u201cWhat I love about these four patterns is that they show the creative thought process of a craftsman,\u201d he says. \u201cHe might have asked himself: \u2018What if I change these hexagons into dodecagons, I wonder what pattern I might create?\u2019\u201d      The most interesting patterns mathematically are those based around pentagons, such as the one below, since pentagons cannot be tiled repeatedly to fill the plain in the way that hexagons, squares and triangles can.      A fivefold pattern.    Here\u2019s a watercolour Eric made with heptagons, a variation on a detail from a Mamluk minbar in Cairo. \u201cI love this design because it looks so contemporary and bold even though it was designed in the 15th century.\u201d If Eric started to offer a tattoo service, I\u2019m sure this design would do well.     isl Photograph: Eric Broug     For more information on Eric, check out his website www.broug.com and his Facebook page.

London-based alternative education group The School of Life (founded by Alain de Botton) seem to think so, and have made a video that, they claim, explains just how to do it.  According to their manifesto, there are six fundamental things a city needs to \u201cget right\u201d if it is to be deemed beautiful. First up is order. Order is the reason we love Paris and New York, we\u2019re told. But we must avoid too much of it. Excessive regularity can be \u201csoul-destroying, relentless and harsh,\u201d so what we want is organised complexity. Humans simply \u201cadore\u201d cities midway between chaos and boringness. Apparently. Next we have \u201cvisible life\u201d: streets need to be full of people and activity in order to be beautiful instead of bleak. The third principle is ensuring that our cities are compact, not sprawling. Think Barcelona, not Phoenix, Arizona. The next rule of attractive cities is \u201corientation and mystery\u201d: the ability to both get lost and to not get lost (you\u2019ve lost me), which is achieved by a balance between small streets and big ones. This leads to the fifth principle, which is scale. Our urban skylines have become dominated by tall buildings dedicated to banking and commerce. Instead, we should be building at an ideal height of five stories, resulting in dense and medium-rise cities, like Berlin and Amsterdam. If there are tall buildings in a city they should be dedicated to something \u201call of humanity can love.\u201d I\u2019ve never seen a building unite all of humanity, but I\u2019m interested to find out. Finally, the sixth key to making a city attractive is to \u201cmake it local\u201d. Which is to say, cities should embrace their unique characters of place and avoid sameness.  So what\u2019s stopping us from making our cities attractive? An intellectual confusion around beauty and a lack of political will, says The School of Life. We\u2019d love to hear your thoughts though. While there are certainly other things more important in a city than how it looks, what do you think about these guidelines for beauty?

Jeffry van der Goot, a 28-year-old web developer who created the account, received a visit from the police in short order. The only problem was that Van der Goot \u2013 who is non-binary and goes by \u201cthey\u201d \u2013 hadn\u2019t written the tweet. Instead, Van der Goot had handed the Twitter account over to \u201cjeff_ebooks\u201d, a bot they created which could automatically send tweets and hold conversations as an eerie simulacrum of themselves. It was jeff_ebooks who had sent the threat, and it was its creator who was being held liable. Van der Goot told the Guardian that it makes no sense that they would be hauled in for questioning over a fairly mild claim made by an automatic Twitter account. \u201cI told [the police] that I can technically see that it would be my responsibility since I started the bot and it is basically tweeting under my \u2018name\u2019,\u201d they said. \u201cHowever, it is a random generator, so yes it is possible that something bad can come out of it, but to treat it as if I made that threat does not make sense to me. I feel very conflicted about it, I can see their point but it does not feel right to me that the random output of a program can be considered something I said.\u201d The bot is what\u2019s known as a markov chain generator, which uses a simple algorithm to create vaguely coherent sentences from a corpus of text. In this case, it uses a collection Van der Goot\u2019s tweets as the basis for its own. \u201cWhat it does is it takes fragments from the entire archive and creates new coherent sentences from the formerly unrelated sentence fragments,\u201d they explain. To make matters even more confusing, the bot was engaged in a conversation with another bot, each having been programmed to reply to messages from strangers. \u201cSo they were just spamming random stuff at each other. I tried to clarify, but people seem to be under the misconception that the death threat was aimed AT the other bot, which is not the case.\u201d At the police\u2019s request, jeff_ebooks has been lain to rest, leaving Jeffry shaken by the whole thing. \u201cBeing interviewed by detectives is incredibly stressful, terrifying and intimidating,\u201d they said. Wxcafe, the creator of the framework jeff_ebooks was based on, also expressed alarm, tweeting that they were \u201cvery sorry this happened\u201d.

Sent via GuardianWitness    By  Rachael Norrish   10 February 2015, 23:15        London is the most attractive city. My paternal Grandfather grew up in the very characterful and typically east London area of Brick Lane, and incessantly recounted that London was the only \u201cfree city\u201d, unique because you could spend a full day enjoying the delights of museums and galleries littered on \u201cMuseum Street\u201d and further afield, with absolutely no financial expenditure necessary. The landmarks and the appearance of a major capital city\u2019s skyline help us identify and characterise a city. For people like me who hold the map upside-down, these landmarks are not only attractive but also practical in the sense that they will help us to navigate our way around the city. If a city is to please us, it needs to maintain the opposite of everything defined as \u201cboring\u201d although let\u2019s hope that doesn\u2019t entail anything too dangerous! The School of Life recommends avoiding \u201csameness\u201d and I agree completely. Most major cities distinguish the nature of different parts of the city itself in terms of cardinal points (north, east, south, and west) or using other categories and it makes sense to do so. It is important that a city cares for and protects its history and London has definitely succeeded in this case. History is everywhere in London: Victorian and Tudor architecture is everywhere for people to see as is the protected remains of the London Wall and the replica of the gate to this in Aldgate ... When my grandfather reminisced on his time in London, I was young and couldn\u2019t place the areas that he was referring to. There is such a strong focus on preserving the history of London and because of this I feel that I can trace his footsteps as he recounted rushing to a a piano performance during World War Two. - ID2958729            Inclusiveness   Rome is the epicentre of ancient masterpieces and to see cyclists riding along spells out its harmony between antiquity, modernity, amiability, vibrancy and tranquility.

According to the latest eurozone GDP figures, Germany enjoyed strong GDP growth in the last three months of the year and helped push expansion across the currency bloc to 0.3% for the quarter and 0.9% for the year. In Portugal and Spain, the headline growth figures improved. Even Italy beat analysts\u2019 expectations after it avoided a decline. So the recovery is real. In fact, say the eurozone\u2019s top policymakers, it\u2019s all going so well the new Greek government should open its eyes and see the warm, golden glow of sunshine appearing on the horizon. Jens Weidmann, the head of the German central bank, was in London on Thursday evening and joined the chorus of top officials bemoaning those who believe the eurozone is entering a long period of Japan-like stagnation. He urged the Greeks to stop opposing the austerity measures imposed by Brussels and accept wage cuts that have already brought an increase in competitiveness. No doubt the 0.2% fall in Greek GDP in the fourth quarter will be cast as a temporary blip and a lesson that political uncertainty has unhelpful economic consequences. Investors also believe the upbeat story, hence the soaring Frankfurt stock market. The promise of a huge stimulus package from the European Central Bank (which Weidmann believes is unnecessary, such is his confidence) and the fall in value of the euro it has precipitated, when combined with the vast European bailouts funds now available, have convinced global investment funds that Europe is a one-way bet. Look beyond the figures and the chatter of ivory tower policymakers and you will find the story is radically different. Yes, Spain is growing. But its GDP growth in 2014 has made up only around half of its losses in 2013. It is still an economy in need of major investment to get back on its feet. Unemployment remains at disturbingly high levels and the state is held in contempt in many quarters. Why else would the radical anti-austerity Podemos party be polling ahead of all the established parties at the moment, and its leader be writing in praise of Tsipras (and the Catalonia independence movement still be in full swing)? Weidmann said the policies of austerity he supported would work slowly but staying the course was important. To him, a lost generation of young workers, who were denied skilled training and out of work for several years, is a matter for individual countries. He cannot see that sovereign states under the current arrangements are denied the funds to invest and improve productivity over the longer term. He cannot see that austerity, if only for this reason, is self-defeating.  Even the Americans, who suffer long-term unemployment at all age levels, worry about Europe\u2019s lost youth. President Obama has made it clear he favours a more lenient attitude to southern Europe from Germany and its supporters in Amsterdam and Helsinki. Weidmann, like so many policymakers lobbying to keep austerity measures in place, has a version of growth that satisfies investors (or shall we call them German savers) and leaves workers to pick up crumbs from the table. That is the point made by Greek finance minister Yanis Varoufakis, who is arguing for the kind of stable, long-term investment that keeps both investors and workers happy.

After seven years in a polygamous relationship, my \u201csister wife\u201d and I suddenly found ourselves husbandless. As marriages go, ours wasn\u2019t ideal, but it worked. Together we ran a tight ship. I was always the dull wife, the staid one \u2013 with just a dash of mother-in-law thrown in. The one who asked, \u201cAre you all right?\u201d and put the kettle on; the fixer, the planner, the practical one who unblocked the loo and remembered all the passwords and the family birthdays. My sister wife was newer and younger than I. Thinner too. And more senior. But she and I were tight; good friends rather than rivals. She called me Moneypenny and I called her Bond. We collaborated. And then, poof, just like that, we were widowed. The husband left and, after a suitable period of time had elapsed, we got a new one. But this wasn\u2019t some free-thinking, new age, kind-of-kinky, open Book of Mormon marriage. Actually, it was work. The other family. It\u2019s hard work being in a work-place m\u00e9nage \u00e0 trois with your boss. Thankfully, from 8am to 6pm I do also have my own mutually supportive, symbiotic relationship \u2013 with my work wife, Vanessa. We\u2019ve been sitting opposite each other for three years now, and been in the Dukan diet camp together for two of them. We\u2019ve also been through health scares, breakups, traumas and cats. We\u2019ve dyed our hair, lost weight and bought leather dresses; then put the weight back on again and returned the S&amp;M frocks to River Island. I talk about my lover and kids, and hear about her daughter, her mother and her \u201creal\u201d husband. Then at the end of the day, we put our coats on and go home \u2013 to them. But I spend 40 hours a week talking and working alongside Vanessa \u2013 more than anyone else in my life. I see my lover for 48 hours, and for about 20 of those he\u2019s asleep and watching football for another four. For my birthday, my work wife organised a lunch for 28 of my colleagues. My lover, bless him, for our five-year anniversary, which conveniently falls on Valentine\u2019s Day, offered me a ticket for the League Cup\u00a0final. Vanessa and I have the world of the workplace in common: the personalities of our sibling colleagues, the ups and down of our profession, the daily intrigue of office life \u2013 the drama, the dullness, the cups of tea, the carbophobia, and the biscuits. We lend each other pots and swap recipes. These people are not just my colleagues, but part of my personality: competitive, smart, savvy, stubborn, optimistic, driven and talented. When I was in hospital a few years ago, it was my work husband who visited me and my work family who sent me flowers. Both my work wives turned up at the house when I was discharged bearing chocolate and cake, and many of the other sisters checked in on me with daily texts. It was touching but alarming to see how much of my life revolved around the office \u2013 but hardly surprising. When one lives in a huge city, often separated from friends (and colleagues) by several postcodes, two tube lines and an overland, it\u2019s difficult to maintain relationships in the scant hours between leaving the office and falling into bed. Some of my best friends I see less than four times a year, and they live in the same city. Others I merely \u201clike\u201d on Facebook, and only manage to meet at Christmas \u2013 though my most active Facebook friends are colleagues who sit 10 yards away away in the office. So work becomes an important constant in a life that is often fragmented into hard-to-schedule activities \u2013 dinners months in advance, trying to juggle seeing wildly disparate friends who don\u2019t know each other and wouldn\u2019t want to, and others who only \u201cpass through\u201d when in town. I recently saw my best friend (who only lives a mile away) for a cup of coffee in an airport in Amsterdam where we both happened to be at the same time. At work, however, you\u2019re guaranteed companionship. At a time when my children were bolshie teenagers and referred to me as Queen Psycho Bitch, it was enormously comforting to come into the office and be greeted with a friendly hello from a girl not much older than my daughter, who actually seemed to like me. And when she confided she\u2019d been vile to her own mother when she was a teenager, it gave me hope that things would change. When told by a former colleague who had a cancer scare, \u201cIf you were my mum, I\u2019d want to be with you every second\u201d, I felt honoured. However, we all know that doesn\u2019t work with your own offspring, who are just that \u2013 sprung and off, and bemused that other people might find you fun. It gave me so much confidence when I seemed to be failing at motherhood and marriage to find that I could chat happily with 20-year-olds and fortysomethings. It was empowering to feel capable in the office at a time when I seemed incapable of doing anything right in my personal life; to be funny, witty, outrageous Marion when the home me was mad, sad and dangerously bad-tempered to know. Of course, not everyone has the luck to work somewhere convivial. And for all the sustaining social contact it provides, it\u2019s important to remind oneself that work is still just a job; and jobs exist to make money, not to provide day care for shut-in adults. When you drop out of office life, it goes on happily without you. Some people you miss only with the relief their absence brings, others change the daily landscape of your life and leave it scarred with loss. But work is the context that holds us together and the glue doesn\u2019t always stick when they have gone. I found out how superfluous I was when I took a month off sick. The gap I left healed over almost seamlessly. Someone else took my meetings, my sister wives bonded in my absence, dramas unfolded without me playing even a supporting role, and my role was ever so slightly sidelined to surplus stock rather than essential kit. Then the work husband decamped \u2013 the second man after my home husband to walk out on me in five years. Worse, my work wife decided to have a baby with someone else and went off on maternity leave. For a whole year. So in the midst of the arranged marriage that is a new boss, I am bereft of the all-important woman in my life. That\u2019s the difference between a job and a family \u2013 you can only take one of them for granted. Your real family is stuck with you.

We asked students whether social media was indeed a campaigner\u2019s best friend, or whether greater focus on grassroots activism was required. Below are five of our favourite responses.   Related: Students Speak: are there too many development goals? | Carla Kweifio-Okai    Don\u2019t underestimate face-to-face campaigning Campaigners increasingly embrace online tools to get their messages across. Blogging sites, online personal or group profiles, and cyberspace are used to spread awareness about a campaign, interact with and motivate supporters to follow the campaign, and coordinate events. Tweets and likes make it easy for the campaigners to track their followers\u2019 interaction and engagement, while flexibility in social networking gives a behind-the-scenes view of the campaign and consequently a sense of accessibility. But campaigns also involve a degree of mobilisation and a deeper level of participation that requires relational ties of some kind (as well as individual agency and ability). Thus, campaigning demands an element of fellowship \u2013 solidarity and companionship that characterise a more personal form of contact. For me, one of the best strategies is meeting and pressurising decision-makers to commit to change; it adds a more relational perspective to the campaign and ensures devotion to the cause. Voula Kyprianou, University of Sheffield, UK Campaigners can\u2019t afford to ignore social media  Social media has changed the way we campaign. It is the ultimate equaliser \u2013 giving people the chance to have their voices heard on the same stage as the world\u2019s most powerful leaders. In the past decade we\u2019ve seen online campaigning help bring down dictators, hold big business to account, elect presidents and encourage a whole new generation of young people to get involved in issues that matter. Of course, this is not to say that social media does not have its downsides, and the same tools that can be used for good can also be used to bully and oppress. But for campaigners to ignore this new platform would be equivalent to ignoring the rise of print media so many years ago. This is simply the way we communicate today, and I believe it\u2019s still possible to maintain \u201cgrassroots\u201d elements of campaigning in this new world. Campaigning on the streets is important, but there really is no comparison to the amount of people activists can reach online. So yes, social media is still a campaigner\u2019s best friend. Annabelle Smith, University of Melbourne, Australia  Social media campaigns still require a spark The encompassing force of globalisation is facilitating a movement towards an online world, characterised by the rapid sharing of social media information, which has the power to transcend traditional boundaries. However, is it possible to create significant change from an online platform? How can politicians be appropriately engaged? These are questions that cloud the effectiveness of such far-reaching campaigning. Undoubtedly, social media can be used as an effective tool for advocating change, but quality grassroots campaigning should be used as a catalyst for mobilising the vast quantity of \u201ckeyboard warriors\u201d.  Take the poignant UN speech by Emma Watson regarding gender equality, which inspired 19m hits for he4she.org in the four days following. Social media requires a spark to become effective; lazy keyboard warriors need a real-life catalyst to inspire their virtual campaign. A further prominent example is the public self-immolation of Mohamed Bouazizi in Tunisia, which created a wave of revolutionary unrest throughout the Arab world in 2011, mobilising 2 million Egyptians in occupying Tahrir Square [and] overthrowing Mubarak\u2019s government. It began with Bouazizi and was spread thanks to the sharing of a multitude of accessible information, photos, videos and locations of imminent protests.  Clearly, social media can be employed as a significant tool for empowerment and liberation, yet the online world is a gullible and impatient one; mistakes will doubtless be made. Nonetheless, social media represents the future of campaigning, so long as the sparks that mobilise the clicktivists continue. James Laycock, University of Amsterdam, the Netherlands A successful campaign relies on online and offline action As a means of communication, advertisement, and expression, social media has become the norm. Many young people, in the developed and developing world alike, often have an arguably unhealthy attachment to their mobile device, as opportunities to socialise, research, and express oneself to the world through written word, recorded video, and carefully cropped pictures are a mere swipe of the finger away. Therefore, social media is pivotal to a grassroots campaign in regard to organisation, promotion, recruitment, policy and strategy briefing, and indoctrination of specific goals and beliefs. Without the use of a variety of user friendly and informative social media applications, a grassroots movement has little chance of making significant strides towards achieving its desired change. However, although this is an increasingly technological age, where some young people would consider it unfathomable to go without their smartphone, social media campaigns must also coincide with more old-fashioned techniques of campaigning such as going door to door, handing out information pamphlets in public places, campus demonstrations, and conducting town hall meetings. There simply is no substitute for direct human contact if one truly wishes to convey a message that is supposed to be convincing, inspiring, and motivating. Social media contributes substantially to spreading awareness and coordinating logistical movement, but face-to-face interaction is irreplaceable. Also, many older people do not use social media and it would be foolish to attempt to form a grassroots campaign without utilising every possible method of making the campaign stronger. Patrick Rulong, University of Waterloo in Ontario, Canada Supporters should add their money, not just clicks to campaigns  Social media has enabled organisations to crowdfund projects, organise Occupy events, support or boycott organisations, offer unbiased coverage of events and hold public officers accountable for their actions. It has enabled public sharing of views without fear of victimisation or rejection. However, people have replaced picketing with likes or retweets, leading to the rise of slacktivism. This is also known as armchair activism.  This gives a false sense of fulfilment of moral obligations by encouraging people to provide their minimum support. Social media support does not always equate to tangible contributions. Campaigners may get a million retweets about a particular cause but only a small fraction of people actually give monetary contributions or show up. In light of this, Unicef Sweden recently launched the campaign Likes don\u2019t save lives, which addresses the issue of slacktivism by emphasising the need to give donations in monetary value and not in social media currency in order to have a greater impact. We may argue that we need to embrace technology, but can we imagine if Dr [Martin Luther] King lived in our age of social media and decided only to blog about his American dream and thereafter shared links on various platforms? There is a need to differentiate between the social media enthusiasts and campaigners. Activism leads to action. Show your support by donating your resources. Go beyond clicking share.

It is not surprising that housing affordability is a hot political topic in the UK.But Londoners are not alone.    Related: Rent rises, evictions and homelessness: why I'm joining the march for homes    Some of the biggest challenges facing cities across Europe cities include rising housing and utility prices, a shortage of social housing and a rise in the number of homeless people. A 2012 EU survey of 79 European cities revealed that more than half of those surveyed felt it was difficult to find affordable housing, especially in capital cities, while three-quarters of those living in Paris, Munich, Hamburg, Geneva and Amsterdam were unhappy about their city\u2019s housing. Affordability is a problem even in smaller capitals like Bratislava in Slovakia, where 50% the city\u2019s residents have expressed some form of concern about housing prices. Scandinavian capitals are not immune either. Stockholm, a city with 2 million people, has a shortage of more than 100,000 homes, according to the Swedish Chamber of Commerce and the shortage will get worse with an estimated increase of 600,000 residents by 2030. Eastern and central Europe face similar issues. Many homeowners still haven\u2019t recovered from the 2008 mortgage market collapse and economic downturn. In 2008, more than 150,000 Hungarian families could not afford repayments and only a massive and very controversial government intervention stopped mass evictions. Today, these problems linger in the region. Almost 3% of Poles report problems repaying their housing loans.  But monthly mortgage payments aren\u2019t the only problem. Increasing energy costs and utility payments are hitting pockets. More than 12% of EU households claim they cannot pay their energy bills, spending more than 40% of income on heating and electricity.  Homelessness is also on the rise. Our most recent annual survey of housing poverty in Hungary shows that 25% of people who became homeless in 2013 lost their dwelling due to affordability. Over the past four years, the number of homeless people has increased in 15 countries across Europe, with the steepest rise in evictions recorded in Paris, Madrid, Rome and Dublin. There are now estimated to be about 4 million homeless people in Europe.    Related: Scandal of Europe's 11m empty homes    Social housing could help, but European governments have cut down the number of social housing projects. Social housing across the EU accounts for only 11% of all housing and is a mere 2%-5% of housing in the EU\u2019s eastern and central member countries.  This has led to longer waiting lists for social housing. Last year, for instance, Dublin city council saw its waiting list jump by 3,000 from the previous year. The council has more than 20,000 applications on its waiting list.  But the irony is that while there is a lack of social housing, there is no dearth of vacant private housing across the region. More than 11m homes stand empty across Europe, according to data collated by the Guardian and the EU. That\u2019s a bitter pill for those middle- and lower-income families who are finding it harder and harder to afford a decent home.  The EU has a stated goal of getting 20 million people out of poverty by 2020 by investing \u2013 among other things \u2013 into social housing and combating homelessness.  This is the time to firmly set and meet goals that will provide citizens with decent, safe places to live and work. Otherwise, Europe will be seeing many more protest marches.

Lewis should realise that it was not Obama\u2019s loss, since Democratic candidates asked him not to campaign with them, fearful of being contaminated by his low popularity. But without a charismatic standard bearer, the voters who had rallied to give Obama his two victories stayed home in the mid-term election and let the Republicans take the field. A forceful statement of the goals and proposals that Obama campaigned on, providing a clear alternative to Republican stands, might just be what is needed for electoral victory. Lewis should also remember that Obama spent his first term \u201ccourting\u201d the Republicans. When he modified his deficit-cutting plans to accede to Republican demands for a lowered ratio of tax increases to spending cuts, they moved the goalposts to demand yet more cuts and lower taxes. Obama put forward, and Congress passed, the Affordable Care Act, a design based on the successful Republican healthcare plan for Massachusetts. The House Republicans have voted more than 50 times to gut or repeal the law, oblivious to their 50+ failures to pass any such legislation in the Senate. Their desire to thwart the president overwhelms any desire to actually govern. These experiences suggest that there is no collegiality to be had with this lot, and governing the country will require that Obama act alone and with his allies, not beg for compromise that will never come.Mary A BissonBuffalo, New York, US House of Saud In your editorial comment on 30\u00a0January, you list all the \u201cterrible things\u201d that happen to the subjects of the House of Saud. All of these are reasons why the leaders of other more democratic countries, who attended the king\u2019s funeral, can be accused of cynicism and, in some cases, an arrogant disdain for the moral values that some of us still\u00a0have. What I miss in your essay is any mention of the role that Saudi Arabia has played, and still plays, in financing and encouraging Islamic terrorism. Some of us also know that American owners of fossil-fuel companies, such as the Bush and Koch families, have been on kissing terms with the Saudi princes for years. Wahhabism, the religion that dominates Saudi Arabia, is the most vicious version of what is in many other countries a peaceful religion. It demands obedience to sharia law, the law that Isis, the Taliban and the last followers of Bin Laden want to impose on the world. The House of Saud will do everything it can to support that policy, and those who make their millions from buying and selling its oil will ignore the murder, torture, rape and starvation it causes as long as it\u2019s confined to the Middle East until the last barrel is shipped.Bryna HellmannAmsterdam, The Netherlands Importance of a mayor Having lived in urban places for many years, I have found that even if a city has a high reputation for culture or for just having fun, if there is no mayor \u2013 as mentioned in Sharing the lessons of safer cities (6\u00a0February) \u2013 who encourages open communication with constituents regarding everything from gang violence to quality of life, there will be no changes to the status quo. People who live in cities want to know that someone with some strength and savvy is in charge, and who openly and decisively makes his or\u00a0her presence felt when\u00a0troubling events occur that affect them.

Kierkegaard was criticising the misleading description in a funeral oration of a bishop of the Danish state church as \u201cone of the genuine witnesses to the truth\u201d \u2013 despite the comfortable and unchallenging living that the late Bishop Mynster had enjoyed. If Labour is elected in May in the UK, perhaps the first stage in the dismantling of \u201cChristendom\u201d \u2013 as an essential early stage of House of Lords reform \u2013 should be the disestablishment of the Church of England and the consequent removal of the two archbishops and 24 diocesan bishops from the Lords. Should it be felt that some religious representation should remain in the Lords, then all religious bodies should be invited to nominate representatives, to be elected by their members on a proportional basis \u2013 the number to be limited to perhaps 15 in each parliament.Alaisdair RaynhamTruro, UK \u2022 A debate on the credibility of the Church of England was proposed by the English master at my grammar school in the 60s. Known by my peers as a stalwart chorister at the parish church, I obligingly, though without conviction, volunteered to support the church, being up against an absolute rationalist (who, be it said, went on to read politics at Cambridge). Needless to say, in front of a bemused class I failed miserably in convincing that belief in a deity was a worthwhile prospect, and am relieved to say did not suffer any indignity.

I was a member of the Royal Geographical Society expedition of 1967, which investigated the flora, fauna, climate, soils and human inhabitants of a section of the Mato Grosso in central Brazil. It was hoped that the base camp would become a research station to guide the development that would come, but this did not happen. Near the end of the book describing the expedition, Mato Grosso by Anthony Smith, there is a photograph of the litter strewn about the base camp at the close of the expedition.

The research, in which almost 1,500 GPs, geriatric care doctors and clinical specialists answered a detailed, anonymous survey, also found that 2% of them said they had taken part in such euthanasia or assisted suicide without medical grounds for a patient who was suffering, even though this is prohibited under Dutch law. The paper, published in the Journal of Medical Ethics, also found that 40% of the doctors said it was conceivable they would help someone in the early stages of dementia to die, while 3% had done so. Just over a third said they might also be willing to assist people with a psychiatric disease who wished to end their life. The Netherlands has one of the world\u2019s more liberal approaches to euthanasia and assisted dying. The practice was in effect decriminalised when doctors were permitted to plead a defence of necessity, arguing that their duty to relieve suffering superseded that to preserve life. This was codified in a 2002 law which lays down six preconditions, crucially that the patient faces \u201cunbearable suffering without prospect of improvement\u201d.  The law does not specify that this suffering must involve a physical illness or condition. However, a subsequent case in the supreme court ruled that in order for a doctor to properly assess the extent of suffering the main cause of this must be medical. Nonetheless, the study found that 18% of the Dutch doctors would consider helping someone to die without them having any physical affliction if they were \u201ctired of living\u201d. Also, 27%, said they would possibly assist in a death of someone who had a medical condition but not a serious one. The authors concede that the self-selecting nature of the respondents \u2013 about 800 doctors were sent the questionnaire but did not return it \u2013 could skew the results slightly. Eva Bolt, at VU University in Amsterdam, who led the study, said doctors seeking to help end the life of someone free from physical problems would be breaking the law. However, she added, this did not mean the 2% who admitted doing so had committed a crime: \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say \u2013 it\u2019s possible that these are physicians that performed euthanasia years ago, when there was no law, so we can\u2019t say they didn\u2019t abide by the law.\u201d    If you\u2019re a doctor and you have to provide euthanasia, emotionally that\u2019s very taxing  Prof Penney Lewis     The issue is also muddied by the fact that most elderly patients who wish to die will have some physical ailment or other, even if this is not the primary cause of their suffering. A 2011 position paper by the Royal Dutch Medical Association, the KNMG, noted that multimorbidity \u2013 a decline in several areas of health at once \u2013 can combine to be seen as unbearable, and that such factors, along with loneliness and loss of autonomy, should be \u201cpart of the equation physicians use to assess requests for euthanasia\u201d. The number of Dutch people taking advantage of assisted dying has increased considerably since 2002. In 2013, the last year for which data has been compiled, 4,829 people chose to get assistance from a doctor in end their lives. Dementia is among the medical conditions seen as legitimately providing grounds for people to seek help in dying, even if it is at an early stage, though this is rare. In 2013, 97 people in the Netherlands with dementia died through euthanasia or assisted suicide. Virtually all these cases involved the early stages of the condition.  Patients can lodge a request for their life to end when their dementia advances, but this can be a difficult request to fulfil, according to Prof Penney Lewis, an expert on law and medical ethics at King\u2019s College London, who has assisted other governments over assisted dying laws.  \u201cIf you\u2019re a doctor and you have to provide euthanasia, emotionally that\u2019s very taxing,\u201d she said. \u201cImagine doing that for someone when you\u2019re not able to say to them at the last minute, \u2018Are you sure that this is what you want?\u2019 Doctors don\u2019t like doing that. They want to check, to be 100% sure.\u201d Such dilemmas are only a small part of assisted dying in the Netherlands. The study notes that 72% of such requests to doctors are from people with cancer. More than 80% of the doctors questioned said they would be willing to help in cases of cancer or other physical diseases. Of those saying they would refuse any request to help someone die, two-thirds were religious, according to Bolt. But even among these, she added, the vast majority said they would be happy to refer the patient to a doctor who might be willing to help, and hardly any wanted the law repealed. The high response rate to the questionnaire indicated the level of medical interest in the issue, Lewis said: \u201cA lot of physicians think this is something we should talk about and they really want to get their opinion out there.\u201d", "sentences": ["Eva Bolt, at VU University in Amsterdam, who led the study, said doctors seeking to help end the life of someone free from physical problems would be breaking the law."], "title": "One in five Dutch doctors would help physically healthy patients die", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/feb/17/assisted-dying-dutch-doctors-patient-law-netherlands", "tags": ["Assisted dying", "Suicide rates", "Law", "Doctors", "Hospitals", "Health", "Mental health", "Health & wellbeing", "Dementia", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-02-18T18:35:02Z", "article": "Patrick O\u2019Kane, the actor who is playing Creon in Ivo van Hove\u2019s production of Sophocles\u2019s Antigone, is waiting for the working day to begin in a London rehearsal room, watching Andy Murray on his phone in the Australian Open. How do you find Van Hove, I ask. \u201cImpish,\u201d he returns. Indeed, across the room Van Hove and Juliette Binoche lark about, two slender slips of people erupting in laughter. Van Hove is trim and be-cardiganed, Binoche is in jeans and high-heel boots and a sweatshirt that looks incredibly casual but is in fact by Isabel Marant, reminding me that not 48 hours ago she was in the front row at the Armani show at the Palais de Tokyo and is an Oscar-winning star (in 1996 for The English Patient) with a film career spanning from the Three Colours trilogy of the early 1990s through work with Haneke, Cronenberg and Kiarostami. Two and a half years ago, Binoche and Van Hove met at a restaurant at the Gare de Lyon to discuss working together. Van Hove is hugely admired for his ability to excavate psychology and bring plays to the stage with a fresh, breakneck force. A regular visitor to the Barbican with his company Toneelgroep Amsterdam with such productions as The Roman Tragedies in 2009, he cemented his British reputation with last year\u2019s production of Arthur Miller\u2019s A View From the Bridge at the Young Vic in London, which is now playing in the West End (as well as in cinemas on 26 March). One director described Van Hove\u2019s work to me this way: \u201cOften in British theatre, the director and actors have decided that John Proctor is a good man, Abigail Williams is a bad woman [to take the example of Miller\u2019s The Crucible]. But when you watch a Van Hove production, it is clear that Eddie Carbone [in a View from the Bridge] knows he is right. The Sicilians know they are right. There isn\u2019t this sense of the play having been agreed on.\u201d Binoche, for her part, was keen to return to the theatre after Mademoiselle Julie, a version of the Strindberg play that she brought to the Barbican in 2012. The pair\u2019s immediate idea was to investigate Greek tragedy. \u201cIt\u2019s the myths, it\u2019s the archetypes, it\u2019s what we\u2019re made of \u2013 it\u2019s the big and simple questions that we all go through,\u201d says Binoche, slapping the table in her enthusiasm. There is perhaps also the fact that there are some great roles for women \u2013 Medea, Clytemnestra, Electra, for example. \u201cI insisted a little bit on Antigone,\u201d says Binoche of Sophocles\u2019s heroine, who propels the tragedy through her insistence on burying the body of her brother Polynices, in defiance of the edict of her uncle Creon, the new king of Thebes.   Related: A View from the Bridge five-star review \u2013 Ivo van Hove reinvents Arthur Miller    They persuaded the Canadian poet-classicist Anne Carson to create a text for them, and her deft and elegant new translation promises to be one of the real pleasures of the show, which opens at the Barbican in London before a 10-month tour with stops at the Edinburgh international festival and at BAM in New York. It is pared back, \u201cbones and skin\u201d, in Binoche\u2019s words, yet palpably produced by someone with a lifetime\u2019s marination in the text (in 2012, she also published a more personal version of the play, called Antigonick). At one point Carson produces the memorable line \u201carchives of grief I see falling on this house\u201d. The original Greek refers to \u201cancient calamities that are heaped upon the calamities of the dead\u201d. The \u201carchive\u201d metaphor \u2013 original yet absolutely fitting \u2013 perhaps suggested itself to Carson because of its similarity to the word Sophocles uses for ancient, \u201carchaia\u201d. And this is indeed a play that dives into \u201carchives of grief\u201d. Antigone\u2019s storyline continues that of Sophocles\u2019s plays concerning Oedipus, her father. Oedipus the King (c430 BC) ends with the revelation that he killed his father and married his mother. Jocasta, his wife-mother, kills herself; he puts out his eyes. Oedipus at Colonus (in fact the last of the plays to be premiered, in 401 BC) concerns Oedipus\u2019s death in exile, accompanied by his daughters Antigone and Ismene, just as his two sons, Eteocles and Polynices are on the brink of war for possession of Thebes. At the start of Antigone (c441 BC), the brothers have, the previous night, slaughtered each other during Polynices\u2019 siege of Thebes, leaving Creon, Jocasta\u2019s brother, as ruler. Van Hove and Binoche found themselves drawn to rereading Oedipus at Colonus, and, says Van Hove of Antigone, \u201cIt was for me very obvious that this woman was in deep mourning. She has lost her mother, she lost her father, and now she lost her two brothers. That\u2019s for me the starting point.\u201d The play has, in its time, come to represent a rather binary interaction: that of state authoritarianism, represented by Creon, versus personal resistance, embodied by Antigone. In fact the drama \u2013 especially as illuminated by Carson\u2019s translation \u2013 offers up more complex readings, not least Creon and Antigone\u2019s entanglement in their own family relationship. Creon himself, points out Van Hove, has lost a son, Megareus, in the siege. \u201cYou see two people reacting totally differently to death.\u201d Creon\u2019s impulse is to look to the rule of law: \u201cAfter all these years of atrocities and civil wars, he says that citizenship should now be the first priority.\u201d He is saying, according to Van Hove, \u201cthat we have to go on somehow, but in a better way. That\u2019s how I see him. I don\u2019t see him as a tyrant at all.\u201d (\u201cYou bastard!\u201d interjects Binoche, in mock fury, at this point. \u201cYou see, she became like Antigone almost immediately,\u201d Van Hove returns.) Van Hove\u2019s production of A View From the Bridge had something of the feel of a Greek tragedy about it, in its starkness and feeling of onrush towards disaster. \u201cYes,\u201d says Van Hove. \u201cThat play, which is a domestic drama, I turned into a Greek tragedy. Now, with a Greek tragedy, I am trying to humanise it.\u201d   Related: 'My aim is the ultimate production': Ivo van Hove on directing Arthur Miller    Both actor and director, meantime, have found a fresh and harsh significance in the burial of the dead: Binoche has been considering the agonies that accompanied the burials of the Paris terrorists, interred in unmarked graves. For Van Hove, the resonance is deeply personal: one of the members of Toneelgroep was aboard the Malaysian Airlines flight shot down over eastern Ukraine in summer 2014. One week his colleague was DJing at a party to celebrate the company\u2019s adaptation of Ayn Rand\u2019s The Fountainhead. The next he was \u201cjust laying somewhere in a field ... for over a week, in summer, in sun, rotting. The Dutch did something beautiful which Antigone does here. After two weeks, they brought the bodies to Eindhoven. There was a hearse for everybody, and they were driven through the whole country. The highways were lined with people. It was a huge showing of humanity: that you show respect to the dead. For me it suddenly became totally real.\u201d For all the attractions of directing Greek plays, they present problems for directors attempting to make them speak to a modern audience. The first problem: what to do about the chorus? The second: what to do about the gods? Sometimes this is solved by essentially ignoring these aspects of the plays and focusing on the conflicts between the principal characters. Van Hove, however, takes a different view. Although his chorus will not be of \u201cthe old men of Thebes\u201d as prescribed in the text, \u201cthey are at the core of my production, and for me almost like the subconscious of the society.\u201d He is fascinated by their reactiveness, the way they change their views in the light of events. \u201cIf you are not interested in the chorus as a director, better take your hands off a Greek tragedy. Better not do it,\u201d he says. What of the gods? No actual deity treads the stage, but the uncanny and the divine are strong forces in the play. As Binoche points out, from the start there is the feeling that Antigone\u2019s \u201crelationship with the invisible world is already strong. Somehow she already has an inside contact, as if she is already living with the dead, has a strong relationship with the gods. For her there is no boundary: the visible and invisible worlds are almost the same.\u201d The morning we spoke, Van Hove was about to start working on O\u2019Kane\u2019s scene with the seer Tiresias, in which the beyond-human aspects of the play are made palpable. Van Hove is still wrestling with it, he says. \u201cThere is so much to think about in this play. We have to make it into something gripping and moving and frightening and, also, hopeful. It\u2019s for me full of unanswerable questions: that\u2019s what mesmerises me. And that\u2019s what my task is, to make sense of this, so you come out and think: \u2018Wow, what did I just see?\u2019\u201d \u2022 Antigone is at Barbican, London EC2, 4-28 March.

As a child, I thought streetcars were the coolest way to get around the city, especially the older \u201cred rocket\u201d cars the Toronto Transit Commission (TTC) operated into the 1980s. The streetcars served the city\u2019s most interesting neighbourhoods, adding a quiet rumble as they glided along its streets. Even the mazes of tracks and webs of overhead wires were visually striking.  After finishing school, however, I moved downtown and found myself relying on those streetcars that I loved as a child. At that point, the novelty soon wore out. Toronto\u2019s streetcar system, originally designed for a much smaller, pre-automobile city, quickly became a nuisance to ride. In rush-hour traffic, streetcars are slow, crowded, unreliable and prone to the dreaded \u201cshort-turn\u201d \u2013 where they turn back before reaching their destination, in an attempt to stick to the schedule. What seemed unique and exciting as a child quickly became a hassle for the regular user. And yet, Toronto\u2019s streetcars \u2013 better known as trams in Europe \u2013 are an integral part of city life here. Nearly 300,000 daily passengers are served by the 250-strong fleet, with some routes scheduled to run at two-minute intervals during peak times. In Toronto, as in Amsterdam, Melbourne and Prague, trams are an essential part of the urban transport system \u2013 but why exactly? To tackle my long-held skepticism of America\u2019s streetcar projects, I determined to take a road trip from Toronto to Miami to visit four streetcar cities: Detroit, Cincinnati, Atlanta and Tampa.    Toronto's streetcars are equivalent to New York\u2019s yellow taxicabs or the gondolas of Venice, a symbol of the city    Clearly, streetcars do offer some advantages over buses. They provide a smoother ride, can carry more passengers (the TTC would require three buses to provide the same capacity as the one new, low-floor streetcar currently being added to the fleet), and run on clean electricity. They aren\u2019t any slower than comparable bus routes on other streets \u2013 and, of course, they\u2019re charming. Arguably, the streetcars of Toronto are equivalent to New York\u2019s yellow cabs or the gondolas of Venice, an internationally recognised symbol of the city. After the second world war, however, most North American cities abandoned their streetcar networks as ridership declined, car ownership soared, and the cost to renew streetcar infrastructure \u2013 footed mostly by cash-strapped private transit operators \u2013 proved too steep. In 1947 the cars were immortalised in Tennessee Williams\u2019s play A Streetcar Named Desire, sneered at by Blanche DuBois as \u201crattle-trap street-cars that bang through the [French] Quarter\u201d. By 1965, only Toronto and a handful of US cities still operated these apparently outmoded means of urban transport.     A streetcar on Spring Street, Melbourne. Photograph: David Wall/Alamy    Yet by the late 1980s, streetcar lines were once again popping up in cities across the country. Originally, many of these new lines were short, \u201cvintage\u201d streetcar routes, mimicking New Orleans\u2019 famous St Charles Streetcar line. These heritage streetcars use antique or replica equipment and were mainly intended to cater to tourists, or to support downtown commerce or redevelopment. Portland\u2019s streetcar, opened in 2001, was the first new, modern streetcar system built in North America, and the operation \u2013 separate from the older Tri-Met light rail system \u2013 features sleek low-floor trams running on downtown streets. The Portland service was not designed so much to appeal to tourists, but part of a strategy to foster redevelopment of its central core and inner city neighbourhoods. The streetcar\u2019s first phase connected the Pearl District, a declining industrial area north of Portland\u2019s downtown core, to the city centre, the light rail system, and Portland State University. Today, the Pearl District is a vibrant residential and commercial area, with new condominiums and loft conversions replacing factories and disused rail yards. Nearly all streetcar systems in the US that opened after Portland\u2019s followed the same model of a modern circulatory streetcar.    Walker\u2019s prediction \u2013 that it would be faster to walk to the other end of the line \u2013 rang true    Today, the Portland system serves 20,000 riders daily. In 2007, it was credited in the New York Times for spurring $2.4bn in new commercial and residential projects in the Pearl District and South Waterfront, though some critics claim that innovative zoning regulations and local demand should take most of the credit . Seattle soon followed Portland\u2019s lead and at the time of writing, Tacoma, Washington, Salt Lake City, Tuscon and Atlanta have also opened new modern streetcar lines, while Washington DC, Kansas City, Cincinnati, Detroit, St Louis, Milwaukee, and Charlotte, North Carolina are building or planning their own. So why are American cities now rushing to build streetcars? According to prominent transit advocate Jarrett Walker, a Portland native, streetcars attract more riders than buses. They\u2019re fun to ride, and quieter and cleaner than diesel buses. According to Walker, politicians and planners in these cities hope that the \u201cpleasant experience of riding the streetcar will make people value transit as a whole, as well as making downtown a more attractive place to live, shop, work and play.\u201d But he also argues that streetcars are not fulfilling the role of providing quality transit.     Streetcar construction in Detroit, Michigan. Photograph: Benjamin Beytekin/Corbis    When I arrived in Atlanta, the third stop on my road trip, the new streetcar had been open for only a week. I waited 15 minutes for the next car to arrive after just missing it on its 3.7 kilometre one-way loop, which is too short to be of much practical use. Walker\u2019s prediction \u2013 that it would be faster to walk to the other end of the line \u2013 rang true. There are long-term plans to expand Atlanta\u2019s streetcar system, although after costing nearly $100m to build, its future phases are yet to be funded. Right now, the system does little more than connect several of Atlanta\u2019s top tourist attractions. Of the four cities I visited, it\u2019s Motor City\u2019s line that holds the most promise. Unlike Atlanta or Cincinnati, the Detroit M-1 Rail Line runs in a straight 5.3-kilometre corridor, connecting Detroit\u2019s financial, cultural, entertainment, and educational hubs that line Woodward Avenue. The backers of the Detroit project hope it will generate over $3bn in economic development over 10 years, promoting new residential and commercial construction along the corridor. The route is expected to cost $140m to build, and about $5.5m a year to operate.    Streetcars have an emotional appeal, and despite my frustrations I will always have a soft spot for Toronto\u2019s trams    Despite my scepticism, I can see why such streetcar projects are popular. They possess an emotional and aesthetic allure that most other forms of city transport just don\u2019t have. Crucially for civic leaders, they also represent a highly visible investment in urban development. Perhaps that is why, despite there being more than a whiff of vanity about some of these projects, the streetcar remains a feature of many American cities. First and foremost, though, transit should be about moving people. The operating streetcar systems I visited in Tampa and Atlanta don\u2019t do this job particularly well, and I don\u2019t have high hopes for Cincinnati\u2019s new project either.  In most US cities, meanwhile, the bus services offered are infrequent and unattractive. Ultimately, it is surely far more effective to serve existing transit riders with more frequent buses, than chase new ones by investing in fancy streetcar lines.", "sentences": ["In Toronto, as in Amsterdam, Melbourne and Prague, trams are an essential part of the urban transport system \u2013 but why exactly?"], "title": "Streetcars of desire: why are American cities obsessed with building trams?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/feb/20/streetcars-of-desire-why-are-americans-obsessed-with-building-trams", "tags": ["Cities", "Toronto holidays", "Travel", "Atlanta holidays", "Tampa", "United States holidays", "Portland", "Urbanisation"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-02-20T08:15:05Z", "article": "Prior to the 2010 general election, David Cameron said: \u201cNo ifs, no buts, there\u2019ll be no third runway at Heathrow.\u201d Ed Miliband publicly opposed the idea during both his stint as environment secretary and his bid for Labour leadership. And in October last year Liberal Democrat members defied attempts by leaders to amend the party\u2019s policy of \u201cno net increase in runways across the UK\u201d and give it the option of supporting a new runway at Gatwick. But with the Airports Commission expected to recommend either a new runway at Heathrow, a new runway at Gatwick or an extension of the northern runway at Heathrow when it delivers its final report in June, the clamour of the general election may be swiftly followed by the screech of a political U-turn. The Department for Transport forecasts [pdf] that passenger numbers will rise from 219 million in 2011 to 445 million by 2050, though market maturity and an expected end to the long-term decline in average fares means growth will slow to between 1% and 3% a year compared to 5% a year over the past 40 years. Much of the increased demand is expected to occur in London and the South-east: airports there will be under substantial pressure by 2030, according to the Airports Commission [pdf]. Heathrow is already operating at 98% capacity, which leads to delays and cancellations during bad weather. However, those who oppose a new runway believe the UK could relieve this pressure by making smarter use of its existing overall airport capacity. Lobbyists for a third runway at Heathrow, which is expected to cost \u00a318.6bn and will be funded mainly by private investment, claim extra capacity is needed to maintain its hub status in the face of increased competition from the likes of Amsterdam Schiphol, Frankfurt, Paris Charles de Gaulle and Dubai \u2013 which recently surpassed Heathrow to become the world\u2019s busiest airport in terms of international travellers. They also say the increase in connections to emerging economies would benefit UK business.  Opponents of the third runway claim demand for point-to-point flights is increasingly making the hub model \u2013 airports that airlines use as a transfer point for passengers \u2013 irrelevant, and point to the fact that only a third of Heathrow passengers are actually in transit. Analysis carried out by the WWF also found that business flights have been steadily declining for almost a decade. An extra runway at Heathrow would also have a big impact on air quality and noise pollution in West London, and affect roads and rail services in and around the capital. \u201cHeathrow already subjects more people to unhealthy levels of noise pollution than any other airport, anywhere,\u201d says Zac Goldsmith, Conservative MP for Richmond Park &amp; North Kingston. \u201cExpansion would bring at least 300,000 more people into its noise footprint, and shockingly, none of them has been made aware at any stage of the process.\u201d A second runway at Gatwick would cost investors an estimated \u00a39.3bn. While it would come with its own set of environmental and infrastructure issues, many believe it would be easier to push through politically. However, the fact that the Airports Commission\u2019s final decision won\u2019t be published until after the election is evidence of a \u201ccosy collusion\u201d between the three main parties to deprive people of any choice in the matter, says Goldsmith. \u201cSir Howard Davies [chair of the Airports Commission] himself has admitted he could have reported before the election, and it is a democratic scandal that he hasn\u2019t been asked to.\u201d   Related: The road ahead: how will the election result affect UK drivers?    David Metz, visiting professor in the Centre for Transport Studies at UCL, and former chief scientist at the Department for Transport, says there is a lot of uncertainty about forecasts of future airline passenger numbers. He makes the point that as London\u2019s public transport infrastructure has benefited from constrained road capacity, a constraint on new runway capacity might force the aviation industry to be similarly creative about how it manages demand. Business travellers, he says, might be willing to pay a premium for access to a centrally located airport like Heathrow, shifting leisure travellers \u2013 who are more likely to put up with extra travel time to save money \u2013 to other airports like Stansted and Gatwick. Crucial environmental questions also remain unanswered, according to the Aviation Environment Federation (AEF). The environmental analysis the Airports Commission committed to undertaking has not been finished in time, it says, which means there are holes in its analysis of airport expansion \u2013 especially in terms of local air quality modelling and meeting the UK\u2019s commitment to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050.  It claims the Airports Commission\u2019s own work has shown that building a new runway would be inconsistent with UK climate change commitments unless new, unspecified action was taken by government to cap aviation emissions. Cait Hewitt, deputy director of the AEF, says analysis of how any carbon cap on airline emissions would be delivered has been a policy gap for some time. \u201cIt\u2019s just not anything that anyone wants to talk about, because the only things are measures like big increases in air passenger duty \u2013 which is obviously going to be politically unpopular. And constraints on growth at regional airports, which would also be extremely unpalatable.\u201d   Related: Heathrow proposes big extension of noise insulation scheme    The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) says that the airline industry will need to do more in future to address the concerns of those opposed to new runway capacity, including using the most quiet aircraft possible, operating them in a more noise efficient way, such as using steeper landing approaches, and mitigating noise through compensatory schemes. Gatwick recently announced that a \u00a31,000-a-year payment would be available for those most affected by noise from a second runway, while Heathrow has proposed a \u00a3700m expansion of its noise insulation scheme should a third runway be developed. Nic Stevenson, senior policy analyst for the CAA, says these approaches are best debated through a community engagement forum that brings together local communities, the aviation industry and policymakers, and that the Airports Commission should recommend that one is established when they deliver their final report. \u201cWe\u2019ve not been very successful when it comes to developing new runway capacities, despite having a thriving \u2013 world-beating if you like \u2013 aviation sector,\u201d he says, which is in part due to the industry\u2019s \u201cfailure to effectively engage and compensate communities, and develop community trust.\u201d More in the series on transport policy post May 2015:\u2022 The road ahead: how will the election result affect UK drivers?\u2022 Full steam ahead: how will the election result affect UK rail passengers?

Ugly saves the day Gentrification follows attractive architecture around like a shadow. Rene Boer\u2019s new photo essay in Failed Architecture, however, explores the \u201cresilience\u201d of ugliness in Amsterdam, a city experiencing high levels of problematic gentrification. Known for its historic architecture, the buildings that went up in the 1970s and 1980s were often criticised as \u201cugly\u201d and ruining the city\u2019s image.  Most of these relatively modern buildings contain social housing apartments; what\u2019s more, they are proving resistant to the transformations currently impacting the city \u2013 transformations that include the sale of much of Amsterdam\u2019s social housing stock still in its celebrated historic buildings.  \u201cIn times when the rest of the city is rapidly becoming extremely expensive,\u201d writes Boer, \u201cAmsterdam\u2019s ugly light grey and pink-yellow housing blocks are staying affordable \u2026 their continued presence in the city is becoming a memorial for a once-existing Amsterdam, in which almost all space in the city was equally distributed.\u201d Iran\u2019s oil city \u201cThe forgotten story of a city in Iran reminds us that oil can also be the stuff of imagination, bringing life to a place, making people dream and remember,\u201d Rasmus Christian Elling writes for Ajam Media Collective. This article tells the story of the southwestern Iranian city of Abadan, once home to the world\u2019s biggest oil refinery but now long past its time as a hub of development. Elling, in conversation with Abadan\u2019s citizens, explores the city\u2019s complex past and the nostalgia surrounding it. Detroit burning Detroit, as we know, is a city of two narratives: decay and regeneration. It is also home to what Detroit News calls an \u201cepidemic\u201d of arson. In 2014, the city suffered 3,839 suspicious fires and spent $3.5 million to demolish at least 247 homes that have caught fire since 2010; this suspected arson, the article explains, is proving an obstacle to renewal efforts. \u201cNothing burns like Detroit,\u201d said Lt Joe Crandall, a Detroit Fire Department arson investigator. The city\u2019s new arson chief now has a five-year plan to halve the number of suspicious fires. Beijing: ghost town This week saw the largest annual human migration: Chinese residents returning to their hometowns for Chinese new year. Millions of people left Beijing, rendering the city bizarrely \u2013 and eerily \u2013 empty. CityLab\u2019s gallery shows pictures of the vacant urban landscape taken by those left behind. (Port)land of hipsters We return again to the topic of gentrification: this time, with the news from Fusion that Portland has been named the \u201cmost gentrified\u201d American city of the century so far. Data compiled by Governing Magazine shows the city experienced more gentrification than any other in America between 2000 and 2013. Some 58% of Portland\u2019s lower-priced neighbourhoods gentrified in this time; Washington DC came in second, with 52% of its neighbourhoods experiencing gentrification since 2000.

And while the murders of John F Kennedy, Martin Luther King Jr, and Emmett Till have all been re-examined through federal intervention, Malcolm X\u2019s assassination remains a blindspot in US jurisprudence and historical memory.  Malcolm X was a dangerous man. Not dangerous as the widely circulated image of him holding a rifle and peeking through the curtains in his home would suggest. Nor because he disagreed with the nonviolent wing of the civil rights movement and its assertion that racial integration was the primary objective of the black freedom struggle. By challenging integration as a primary goal, Malcolm X threatened to undermine the tenuous support that mainstream civil rights leaders were receiving from the government and white liberals. For many white people, Malcolm and the Nation of Islam embodied their greatest fears.  As the public face of the National of Islam, he confronted racism well beyond the confines of southern segregation. He worked tirelessly to denounce America as a damaging imperialist and neo-colonialist system. \u201cJust as a chicken cannot produce a duck egg\u201d, he charged, \u201cthe system in this country cannot produce freedom for an Afro-American.\u201d And with his characteristic wit, he added that if it did, \u201cyou would say it was certainly a revolutionary chicken.\u201d By 1963, Malcolm had been suspended from the NOI for calling President Kennedy\u2019s assassination a case of \u201cchickens coming home to roost.\u201d The rift deepened after Malcolm revealed that the group\u2019s leader, Elijah Muhammad, had fathered children out-of-wedlock with NOI secretaries. This public feud combined with competing political visions to cause deep divisions within the Muslim community. Malcolm formed two independent groups in 1964: the Organization of Afro-American Unity (OAAU) and Muslim Mosque, Inc. (MMI). A year later, he prepared to release a new political program which would have likely included voter registration drives, local organizing against police brutality, and a call for the United Nations to denounce American racial practices as human rights violations. He was gunned down on the very day he was set to unveil it. A cast of co-conspirators When Malcolm X was killed at the Audubon Ballroom on 21 February 1965, a man named Talmadge Hayer (now named Mujahid Abdul Halim) was pulled from the scene of the crime. Yet some witnesses claimed a second figure was also taken into custody by the police. The late Herman Ferguson, a founding member of the Organization of Afro-American Unity (the OAAU, founded by Malcolm X after he left the Nation of Islam), recalled a police car which pulled up alongside the ballroom and brought out a man with an \u201colive complexion ... obviously in great pain.\u201d Ferguson, thinking that the injured man was one of \u201cour guys,\u201d watched as the squad car sped away and over the Hudson River. The Associated Press also reported the day after the assassination that \u201ctwo men were taken into custody.\u201d In the following days, the NYPD also arrested two other members of the Nation of Islam\u2019s Mosque 7 in Harlem: Norman 3X Butler (Muhammad Abd Al-Aziz) and Thomas 15X Johnson (Khalil Islam). Both men, as well as key witnesses who knew them, denied they were at the ballroom that day. Hayer also testified at the end of the 1966 trial that the two men had not been involved. But he refused to name any other accomplices, and all three received life sentences.  A decade into his incarceration, Hayer came forward with new information, identifying four co-conspirators. He signed an affidavit offering the names and addresses of these men, along with a detailed timeline of their plot. With the help of the self-described \u201cradical attorney\u201d William Kunstler, Butler and Johnson appealed their convictions.  Hayer named William Bradley, a NOI member called Willie X, as the man who fired the fatal shotgun blast, adding that Bradley was \u201cknown as a stick-up man.\u201d The petition noted that Bradley was \u201cupon information and belief presently incarcerated in the Essex County Jail, Caldwell, New Jersey.\u201d Kunstler added that he did not know of \u201cany comparable case in American jurisprudential history\u201d in which an accomplice had described a crime in such detail without a thorough reinvestigation. Yet, judge Harold Rothwax rejected a motion to reopen the case.  Bradley (who now goes by Al-Mustafa Shabazz) is living in Newark. Earlier this week, The New York Daily News published an interview with him in which he rejected the claims. \u201cIt\u2019s an accusation,\u201d he said. \u201cThey never spoke to me. They just accused me of something I didn\u2019t do.\u201d  \u2018The investigation was botched\u2019 In the weeks following Malcolm\u2019s assassination, the organizations he created after his falling out with the Nation of Islam struggled without his leadership, and his friends and comrades attempted to make sense of their loss. Most of his followers had witnessed the murder, and the dangerous climate and mistrust of the aftermath drove some underground for decades.  On 6 March 1965, members gathered for the weekly Saturday class at the OAAU\u2019s Liberation School. That meeting had been lost to history until recently, when a detailed account reveal its contents. In 2011, the personal papers of James Campbell, housed at the College of Charleston\u2019s Avery Research Center for African American History and Culture, were made available to the general public.  Campbell is an educator and civil rights activist who founded the Liberation School along with OAAU member Herman Ferguson in 1964. His papers include handwritten notes taken by the late Japanese American activist Yuri Kochiyama. The meeting, the notes explain, was held \u201cto establish stability from this crisis.\u201d And the notes contain an unexpected piece of information. Kochiyama\u2019s scrawl at the bottom of the 6 March meeting reads:     \u2018Ray Woods is said to have been seen also running out of Audubon; was one of two picked up by police. Was the second person running out.\u2019    The notes appear to substantiate the accounts of Herman Ferguson and the AP of a \u201csecond man\u201d taken into police custody. That a name should resurface 50 years later is remarkable. But more significant is that the \u201cRay Woods\u201d named in the note was likely Raymond A Wood, an undercover New York City police officer with the Bureau of Special Services and Investigation (BOSSI).  Wood began his career by infiltrating the Bronx Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) chapter under the name Ray Woodall in 1964. There, he posed as a 27 year-old graduate of Manhattan College studying law at Fordham. He was soon named CORE\u2019s housing chairman and oversaw a voter registration project.  Wood earned his activist bonafides by getting arrested with two others at city hall while attempting a citizen\u2019s arrest of mayor Wagner for allowing racial discrimination on a public construction project. Feminist Susan Brownmiller, a fellow CORE activist at the time, recalled that if \u201cCORE had placed an advertisement in the Amsterdam News describing what it was looking for, Woodall would have fit the bill.\u201d By 1965, \u201cWoodall\u201d had been reassigned under his real name to infiltrate a group calling itself the Black Liberation Movement (BLM). He was credited with foiling a bomb plot by the BLM that allegedly targeted the Statue of Liberty and other national monuments, just a week before Malcolm X\u2019s assassination. One of the four arrested in the plot was Walter Bowe, who also co-chaired the cultural committee in Malcolm\u2019s OAAU. Wood\u2019s close association with an OAAU member makes it likely that others within the organization would also have known and recognized him.  Wood was promoted to detective second grade for making the arrests in the BLM case. And although his name and a photo of the back of his head circulated throughout the press in the week leading up to Malcolm X\u2019s assassination, the NYPD reported that he was put back to work because his \u201cface is still a secret.\u201d     Agent Wood hides face from photographer. Photograph: Star.    There is no question that the police were keeping close tabs on Malcolm X in the period prior to his assassination. Tony Bouza, a former BOSSI detective and lieutenant from 1957 to 1965, explains that the NYPD, and not the FBI, was the primary agency conducting this surveillance. Gene Roberts \u2013 a man known affectionately within the OAAU as \u201cBrother Gene\u201d and photographed trying in vain to resuscitate Malcolm X at the assassination \u2013 was later confirmed as an undercover agent.  Bouza argues that the NYPD failed to take basic and minimal steps to protect a prominent public figure from a threat that was widely believed to be imminent. And he is harshly critical of its subsequent failure to disclose all that it knew about the assassination of Malcolm X. \u201cThe investigation was botched,\u201d he said, and a \u201cparallel tragedy lies in the NYPD\u2019s obvious stonewalling of any release of records.\u201d But Bouza also insists that Wood had nothing to do with the case, and there are other reasons to doubt this latest eyewitness account placing Ray Wood at the Audubon. Such reports are unreliable, even those recorded shortly after the assassination. Accounts of what happened at the Audubon Ballroom that day are also conflicting. One OAAU member named Willie Harris was interviewed by the NYPD while being treated at a medical center after a stray bullet hit him at the ballroom. Harris claims he sought help from a police officer who then took him to the hospital. Is it possible that the unnamed witness mistook Harris for Ray Wood? Finally, there is the question of why BOSSI would send an undercover agent back into a place where he might be recognized after his name had been in the press. The simplest way to resolve these questions would be for the NYPD to release its surveillance files and disclose what Ray Wood, Gene Roberts, and its other undercover officers reported in the years surrounding the assassination. But the department has repeatedly refused to release them.  My attempts with professor Manning Marable and the Malcolm X Project at Columbia University in 2008-2009 to access BOSSI files through the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) ended in a full denial. In denying the requests, the department\u2019s legal bureau cited a number of Public Officers Laws, claiming that the files would endanger the safety of officers and constitute unwarranted invasions of privacy. A more recent FOIA request this year produced some materials relating to the assassination case, but only documents that were already publicly available at the New York Municipal Archives. The release did not include any files related to BOSSI\u2019s surveillance.  \u2018Failed promise to families\u2019 The most obvious avenue for reopening the investigation into Malcolm X\u2019s assassination is the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. In 2011, the Justice Department responded to calls to reopen the case with the statement that \u201cthe matter does not implicate federal interests sufficient to necessitate the use of scarce federal investigative resources into a matter for which there can be no federal criminal prosecution.\u201d The Till Act, however, was specifically crafted to render these objections moot. It allocates $10m annually for such investigations, and requires the Justice Department to work in concert with local law enforcement to implement state law.  Janis McDonald, who co-directs the Cold Case Justice Initiative at Syracuse University College of Law, told me that rulings such as this ignore \u201cthe intent of Congress when the Emmett Till Act was enacted.\u201d Its implementation, she said, \u201chas been a failed promise to the families of those who were killed and a disregard of the congressional intent to preserve the integrity of the law for everyone. This Act has never been a priority for the Department of Justice.\u201d It is set to expire in 2017 if not renewed by Congress.  According to Paula Johnson, co-director of the Syracuse Cold Case Justice Initiative, the \u201cpurpose of the Emmett Till Act is to fully investigate and resolve just such killings.\u201d The account placing Ray Wood at the scene, she said, \u201cwarrants further investigation into the knowledge or role of law enforcement in Malcolm X\u2019s death.\u201d  Until Malcolm X\u2019s assassination case is reopened and surveillance files are made fully available, the injustice to one of America\u2019s boldest civil rights figure continues, while one or more of his killers may roam free.  As the case turns 50 this week, the NYPD and other surveillance agencies must make their records public.

The following year, an outstanding Cambridge crew brought an end to Oxford\u2019s winning streak, the longest in the club\u2019s history, achieved by crews that Dan nurtured, toughened and inspired. By then, losing had been erased from Oxford\u2019s memory, and in 1987 the club was rocked by a mutiny when most of the oarsmen, including five American internationals, fell out with Dan and the Oxford University Boat Club president, Donald Macdonald, over selection and training. With the aid of freak weather conditions, Oxford\u2019s unhappy crew, minus its American rowers, won the race, but the mutiny resulted in years of schism, reform of the club\u2019s constitution and the introduction of professional coaches. It was the worst year of Dan\u2019s rowing life, but also brought about his highly readable if highly slanted account, True Blue (1989), which in 1996 became a film of the same name. In 1988 he turned down the offer extended by the new president, Chris Penney, who had refused to row in 1987, of joining the coaching team under Mike Spracklen. But in 1995 Dan became a coaching consultant to Oxford, a post he held until his death. Son of the artist and chronicler of the 20th century Feliks Topolski, and his wife, the actor Marion Everall, Dan learned to row on Regent\u2019s Park lake, opposite the family home in central London. After attending the Lyc\u00e9e Fran\u00e7ais, he went on to Westminster school, where he became captain of boats and encountered the professional sculler Ted Phelps and Oxford\u2019s famous coach Hugh \u201cJumbo\u201d Edwards, both of whom occasionally coached the school. Dan was immersed in rowing, mostly on the Boat Race course, for the rest of his life, with Oxford, London Rowing Club, Tideway Scullers School (TSS) and the GB team. At New College, Oxford, Dan studied geography and majored in partying alongside rowing. He won the reserves race with Isis in 1966, and the 1967 Boat Race, only to lose the 1968 race. That was the first of a Cambridge run of six wins while Oxford spun into almost terminal decline. But it was also the year that Dan began occasional coaching.     True Blue: The Oxford Boat Race Mutiny by Daniel Topolski with Patrick Robinson    In 1973 he was Oxford\u2019s chief coach for the first time. His hand was held by George Harris, boatbuilder and Christ Church boatman for almost 50 years, whose garden gate fronted on the river. \u201cHe knew what good rowing was, he was a good waterman,\u201d Harris said, \u201cbut the biggest thing about him was that he could tear a strip off any man in the crew and I could guarantee that five minutes after insulting a man right down to the ground there would be no bad feeling.\u201d That year Dan sent what he described as a fantastic crew to their doom by failing to fit aerofoil outriggers suitable for rough water. The boat filled up in minutes and lost by 13 lengths. \u201cI have kept a photograph of their half-submerged despair as they struggled bravely but vainly under Hammersmith bridge, to remind me never to underestimate the powers of the tideway in belligerent mood,\u201d Dan wrote years later. Despite being a seat-of-the-pants operator who set out before making a travel plan, Dan never again lost his grip on detail, or experimented without proven result. In Dan\u2019s day, Boat Race crews were coached by a succession of amateurs invited to do so by the incoming president. The Oxford mutiny of 1987 buried this system, but until then Dan was an able ringmaster, recruiting a stable of assistants who covered technique, tactics, combativeness and refinement. Dan\u2019s talents included an analytical eye for faults and strengths, an understanding of crew psychology, a hunger for winning and the ability to role-play where a crucial ingredient was lacking. Graeme Hall, a Cambridge oarsman who beat him and coached against him \u2013 and rowed with him in GB crews \u2013 observed that Dan did not recognise training. \u201cHe didn\u2019t train. He only raced,\u201d Hall said. Dan won a silver medal in Britain\u2019s lightweight four at the world championships in 1975, a Henley medal with TSS in 1976, and a gold medal in Britain\u2019s lightweight eight in Amsterdam in 1977, by a margin of seven-hundredths of a second. He returned to the scene of his triumph to present the medals for this event at last year\u2019s world championships. From 1978 until 1980 he was chief coach of Britain\u2019s women for the Moscow Olympics. The cox Susan Brown was a member of that team and in 1981 became the first woman to steer in the Boat Race. Off the water, Dan turned his hand to journalism. After graduation he became an assistant producer on Late Night Line-Up at the BBC and undertook travel expeditions, including six months in Africa and a visit to South America where he was jailed briefly in a clampdown on foreigners when the president of Nicaragua was assassinated. In 1990 Dan joined the BBC\u2019s commentary team and gave viewers a calm, articulate analysis of racing while Garry Herbert looked after the superlatives in a great partnership. Dan also wrote about rowing for the Evening Standard and from 1991 until 2012 for the Observer. He was elected a steward of Henley Royal Regatta in 1991, was the British Association of Rowing Journalists\u2019 journalist of the year in 2012, and was made an honorary fellow of New College in 2013. He is survived by his wife, Suzy (nee Gilmore), whom he married in 1998, their children, Emma, Tamsin and Luke, and his sister, Teresa. \u2022 Daniel Topolski, rower, coach and broadcaster, born 4 June 1945; died 21 February 2015", "sentences": ["Dan won a silver medal in Britain\u2019s lightweight four at the world championships in 1975, a Henley medal with TSS in 1976, and a gold medal in Britain\u2019s lightweight eight in Amsterdam in 1977, by a margin of seven-hundredths of a second."], "title": "Daniel Topolski obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/feb/22/daniel-topolski", "tags": ["Rowing", "The Boat Race", "Sport", "UK news", "University of Oxford"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-02-23T13:04:23Z", "article": "Honda: \u201cKeep Up\u201d (Starts at 00:06) \u2013 UK This playful advert for Honda offers a direct challenge to viewers to keep up with the fast-moving text that passes across the screen.

Haitham al-Haddad, who is alleged to have described homosexuality as \u201ca scourge\u201d and \u201ca criminal act\u201d, has been invited to talk to students at Westminster University on Thursday at an event entitled \u201cWho is Muhammad?\u201d Members of the university\u2019s lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex (LGBTI) society have launched a petition, which has attracted nearly 2,500 signatures, in an attempt to block the visit and stop him from \u201cpreaching hate on our campus\u201d. Students are particularly concerned because on Friday, the university will host the 10th National Student Pride event, which will be attended by hundreds of students from up to 130 different universities. Speakers include Evan Davis of BBC\u2019s Newsnight and Bethany Black, a transgender comedian and star of Channel 4\u2019s Cucumber. The petition, which also accuses the Saudi-born Haddad of making controversial comments about the \u201cproper\u201d way to perform female genital mutilation, says: \u201cThe event is taking place just one day before the University of Westminster welcomes National Student Pride for the second year. How is it possible to create a safe space for thousands of LGBT students if an anti-gay preacher is allowed on campus a day before?\u201d The University of Westminster students\u2019 union (UWSU) said Haddad, who was invited by the Islamic Society, had undergone the external speaker-vetting process. A statement said: \u201cUWSU wishes to reflect the diversity of our students and enable our student leaders to deliver events which are important to them.\u201d Haddad serves as a judge for the Islamic Sharia Council and is chairman of the Muslim Research and Development Foundation, which says it is \u201cdevoted to the articulation of classical Islamic principles in a manner that provides a platform for Islam to be the cure for all of humanities ills.\u201d  He has spoken previously at a number of London universities, including Westminster and the School of Oriental and African Studies where he studied for his PhD.  However, in 2012 Amsterdam\u2019s VU University cancelled a debate he was due to participate in and an invitation last year to speak at London Metropolitan University was cancelled.  A London Metropolitan spokesman said there had been concerns about the invitation to speak on campus. A statement at the time said: \u201cFollowing a positive discussion with the talk\u2019s organisers, the students themselves decided not to proceed with the event.\u201d Universities currently find themselves at the heart of the debate surrounding freedom of speech and the government\u2019s crackdown on extremism, with attention focused on the threat posed by visiting speakers invited on to campuses. At Westminster University, meetings are being held between representatives from the LGBTI society, the students\u2019 union and the university to discuss concerns. A spokesperson for the LGBTI society said: \u201cAs students we should never be met with the possibility of facing hate in the hands of our own student union. \u201cSheikh Haitham al-Haddad has previously referred to homosexuality as evil and also promoted the \u2018proper\u2019 way of performing female genital mutilation. University should be a safe space for all and it should not be given a platform for hate of any kind \u2013 all students should be provided with a safe learning environment. \u201cUniversity is not the place to welcome controversial attacks on specific parts of our community and we will not stand for it. The SU have so far refused to listen to our petition. We will continue to fight this and welcome the huge amount of support we have already received.\u201d The university, in response, highlighted its commitment to freedom of speech and promised the event would be monitored carefully. A spokesman said: \u201cThe University of Westminster is committed to maintaining freedom of speech and a range of views as set out in the Education Act 1986. \u201cAs a diverse community of local and international students of many faiths, respect and tolerance is our foremost concern and we will be monitoring the event carefully and any student concerns.  \u201cThe university has a strict speaker policy, which means that all speakers are required to give their agreement to abide by a code of practice. Speakers who do not comply with this policy while on campus will not be permitted to speak at the university in the future.\u201d A spokesperson for National Student Pride said: \u201cConsidering Westminster is a Stonewall diversity champion and is such an advocate of our event, it is disappointing that on the eve of our 10th anniversary such an anti-gay speaker has been allowed to speak on campus. \u201cHomosexuality is not a scourge, and Student Pride has been fighting views like this from its foundation It\u2019s clear and unfortunate news that there is clearly much work to do. \u201cWe are going ahead with the event at Westminster, because we need to highlight homophobia and transphobia on campus.\u201d Haddad, who last year took part in a video to appeal to Islamic State to spare the life of the British hostage Alan Henning, has vigorously defended himself against some of the allegations levelled against him, including that of antisemitism, but he remains a controversial figure. He could not be contacted for comment. On the issue of homosexuality, in a post on the website Islam21C.com, Haddad denied being a hate preacher and claimed his views were \u201clegitimately-held religious views\u201d that were shared by millions of other people of all faiths in Britain. \u201cThere are many who have objected in the recent past to the government\u2019s rush to legislate on same-sex marriages, are all these \u2018hate preachers\u2019 too; the members of parliament, the Catholic church and the Tory party faithful?

But it\u2019s more like the UK\u2019s cross-country scene, and doesn\u2019t translate to international events. For many east Africans, running represents a way to escape their home town and go to Europe and the US to compete. This, coupled with the reality of a struggle with poor education, Aids and basic sanitation in some regions, means setting up slick sporting events is far from a priority. And slick is something that \u2013 let\u2019s be honest \u2013 us runners have come to expect from a race.  But despite these difficulties, there are a growing number of international distance-running events in east Africa, and I would argue that it is the precise lack of \u201cslick\u201d that makes running in east Africa such a fantastic experience. Set up a race in the UK, follow a set of guidelines and throw in some marketing prowess, and voila, you\u2019ve got yourself a marathon.

But run in east Africa, and you\u2019ll get quite a lot more. The scenery will be truly excellent, no question.

Yes, you lose the smooth, Starbucks-like running courses and handy chains in which to carb-load. But this is the home of distance running.

My boyfriend and I jumped on an old tram (\u20ac5 return) at Haarlemmermeerstation and took it to the suburb of Amstelveen. You can hire bicycles there and cycle into the forest. Renting helped me feel more like a local, that\u2019s for sure. The owner of an apartment I rented on the Herengracht through CityMundo was a traveller and an adventurer.

Plans for Boston \u2013 submerged Boston may have been inundated by snow recently, but that\u2019s not all it will need to cope with in future. By 2100, it\u2019s predicted that water levels will have risen by five to six feet in Boston\u2019s Harbour area, meaning that 30% of the city could be under water. Cue the competition Boston Living With Water, organised by the city authority, to encourage creative solutions to this anticipated environmental transformation. As Fast Co Exist discusses, designs include floating parks, inlets waterways and \u201chydrokinetic canals\u201d that generate electricity when the water flows in and out. Tidal marshes, \u201cliving levees\u201d and \u201cfloodable spaces\u201d are also proposed.  Finding space in Tokyo 32 million: that\u2019s the size of the Tokyo metropolitan region. It\u2019s also the title of photographer Andreas Meichsner\u2019s project documenting the city. \u201cWhen I came to Japan in 2002, I was shocked by the narrowness and the endlessness of the built space,\u201d he recalls in Uncube magazine.  \u201cMy first train ride from Osaka airport to Hiroshima went through an endless sea of houses without any noticeable interruption between the cities \u2026 it [later] became apparent that I needed to address these spaces since they are representative not only of this kind of agglomeration, but also for the worldwide process of urbanisation.\u201d From homes under railways to overcrowded public transport, his images explore the tightness of space in Tokyo and its impact on the people who live there. Airport buzz City airports around the world are harbouring some very unusual communities: hives of bees. As the New York Times explains, beehives in an empty field of Montreal\u2019s Mirabel airport are the latest in what is becoming a common undertaking among urban airports \u2013 including Hamburg and Chicago. When Copenhagen\u2019s plans to expand its airport fell flat, bees found a new home in the newly purchased land.  \u201cFor airports, beehives can be an easy way to flaunt green credentials while putting space to work in fields that legally cannot be built on. The relationship is a symbiotic one: urban beekeepers need more space, and airports have space to spare.\u201d Islands for bikes It\u2019s official: Amsterdam has too many bikes. Despite the city providing 2,500 cycle parking spaces, it is still not enough \u2013 and space has run out to build more. CityLab reports that as a result, Amsterdam is coming up with a plan to create more parking for bikes in some unexpected places: under \u2013 and over \u2013 water. The proposals involve excavating a 7,000-space bicycle garage under the city\u2019s IJ lake, as well as creating two new floating islands with space for 2,000 bikes each.  In other Dutch cycling news over on Next City, plans are being explored to provide a 30km-long intercity cycling \u201chighway\u201d between the cities of Assen and Groningen, to become a fast commuting route for cyclists.

More mischief was preferred. \u201cThis cup final is the most important of my career,\u201d he said. \u201cMore important than the Champions League finals. More important than all the other cups I\u2019ve ever played before.\u201d Cue a pause, challenging the room to protest. \u201cDo I look stupid? It\u2019s just because it\u2019s the next one. The others are in the club museum. My medals are somewhere at home, I don\u2019t know where \u2026 But the most important game of my career is always the next\u00a0one.\u201d He sat back sporting his familiar satisfied smile, even having resorted to cliche, with the focus wrenched momentarily from recollections of the showpiece against Liverpool that yielded the first silverware of Roman Abramovich\u2019s ownership, and back upon collision with Tottenham Hotspur. Mourinho the manager has never had to wait so long between major trophies, memories fading of the Spanish league title and Supercopa de Espa\u00f1a claimed in 2012 with Real Madrid. Last year\u2019s first campaign back at Chelsea had promised much but ended barren. Spurs are the club in this t\u00eate-\u00e0-t\u00eate for whom silverware feels a modern\u2011day novelty, yet the significance of the Premier League leaders claiming success at Wembley is less about the man in the dugout reimposing his reputation and far more about this team breaking through a psychological barrier. Chelsea\u2019s new crop must prove to themselves they can fulfil undoubted potential and prosper. Mourinho\u2019s message has been consistent all season when addressing what this squad could achieve. They have the required talent, skill, industry and even spikiness to dominate but, until they accumulate trophies, they cannot be favourably compared with the team that won five big ones in three seasons during his first spell in charge, a group whose core effectively drove on after his departure in 2007 to claim another five significant titles culminating in the 2012 Champions\u00a0League. That show of resilience, and almost fateful success, in Munich felt like a last hurrah. It certainly prompted a change in club policy in terms of recruitment and strategy, with players such as Oscar, Eden Hazard and C\u00e9sar Azpilicueta all fresh faces after the European Cup had been raised. The season that followed was chaotic, with Roberto di Matteo\u2019s air-brushing from history \u2013 the supporters\u2019 regular 16th-minute applause was a show of defiance \u2013 and Rafael Ben\u00edtez\u2019s controversial recruitment as interim manager reinforcing the sense of transition, much of it traumatic. They still won the Europa League, a competition they had hoped to avoid, but of the side that started against Benfica in Amsterdam only Petr Cech, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic, Azpilicueta, Ramires and Oscar remain at the club. Paulo Ferreira, currently undertaking his coaching badges at Cobham, was on the bench that night. As was Ross Turnbull, now of Barnsley in League One, and the regular loanees Victor Moses and Marko Marin. Hazard was hamstrung and absent. Throw in Yossi Benayoun and that feels like a team from a bygone era with the new, thrilling blend that has been assembled since Mourinho\u2019s return eager to make their own mark. Cesc F\u00e0bregas has not won a trophy in England since the 2005 FA Cup. In the context of English football and Chelsea\u2019s expectations, Diego Costa, Willian, Thibaut Courtois, Filipe Lu\u00eds and Kurt Zouma are new to all this. The theory goes that the first step is always the hardest to take. In that case, this team can take a giant stride against\u00a0Spurs. There are still some in their number who have experienced this before and, unlike the manager, are willing to acknowledge the significance of 2005. Didier Drogba, a scorer at the Millennium Stadium who returned last summer, claimed the victory in Cardiff \u201cgave us a big boost, knowing we could win something together if we all pushed in the same direction\u201d. \u201cIt set us on the way,\u201d said John Terry, recalling the 3-2 success in extra time that first stoked the rivalry between Mourinho and Ben\u00edtez. \u201cIt made a big impact through all the squad, gave us a taste of what we wanted, and we wanted more. It brought the squad closer together. With that in mind, this could be the first one for all of us this time round. The manager is right: we have to go out and win trophies to put us right up there. \u201cLike everyone, I felt something different when the manager came in back in 2004. It was a different mentality. Everything was about winning. He made that clear from day one. That rippled through the whole squad, through the academy, through the whole club really, and he has continued that. He has brought that back again this time. \u201cA lot of clubs write off this competition but, when we look back at 2005, it had a huge impact on our confidence and momentum. Now, for lads like Eden, it\u2019s a chance for a first trophy. There are a few new players like that because it\u2019s been a couple of years since we won anything. So it is an important competition for us. It means a lot to this club.\u201d Terry had featured under Avram Grant in the Carling Cup final of 2008, the last time Chelsea graced this stage in this competition, when Juande Ramos\u2019s Tottenham won in extra time. \u201cSometimes setbacks like that can have a positive impact, and we have moved on since then and won major trophies in the meantime,\u201d said the centre\u2011half. As has Mourinho, in Italy, Spain and European competition, though the manager\u2019s focus is remaining matter\u2011of\u2011fact. His team are top of the Premier League and are the best placed of the English sides to progress into the quarter-finals of the Champions League. Victory at Wembley will be a fillip ahead of the run-in. Defeat must not derail a promising campaign. \u201cEven if we had lost that final 10 years ago, I still think we would have won the league that year,\u201d Mourinho said. \u201cI don\u2019t see a relation between now and then. \u201cWith our schedule now we can only think about what is directly ahead of us. We have no time for stupid celebrations if we win \u2013 I mean like celebrating for a week \u2013 and we can\u2019t be crying for a week, also, if we lose. I will go home on Sunday evening and have dinner with my family, that is all. I can\u2019t control the players, but they will be back for training on Monday, for sure, looking at West Ham in the Premier League on\u00a0Wednesday. \u201cThis is the first time since I came back in July 2013 where I haven\u2019t been thinking about the future of this club. I just think about the moment, not the consequences. We have a new team full of people who have not been in dozens of finals at Wembley, and we will try and help this new generation of players and this new team make Wembley something normal for us. Normal in the sense that we get to play there year after year. But the bottom line is we have a final to win on Sunday. And nothing else matters.\u201d Victory may come to be seen as a statement of Chelsea\u2019s intent. A new generation senses an opportunity awaits.", "sentences": ["They still won the Europa League, a competition they had hoped to avoid, but of the side that started against Benfica in Amsterdam only Petr Cech, Gary Cahill, Branislav Ivanovic, Azpilicueta, Ramires and Oscar remain at the club."], "title": "New Chelsea have to prove they can win trophies by beating Tottenham | Dominic Fifield", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/feb/27/new-chelsea-win-trophies-tottenham-capital-one-cup-final", "tags": ["Chelsea", "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho", "Tottenham Hotspur", "Capital One Cup", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-02-27T22:30:10Z", "article": "Christian Eriksen is used to pressure. The man who carries Tottenham\u2019s hopes of a first trophy in seven years has been the darling of Danish football since a teenager, played in four finals with Ajax where he signed at 16 and used to lock his bedroom door after a bad game to avoid speaking with his father. He grew up shouldering the weight of a nation\u2019s expectation, proclaimed as the next Michael Laudrup, and has become accustomed to ever-present, hyperbolic epithets during a career that remains in its infancy. Eriksen, still only 23, has had to deal with such hype for many years. This season, though, he has certainly justified it. \u201cI always had it, so I\u2019ve learned to live with it,\u201d he says. \u201cEvery player has a different style of play, has a different talent, so people look differently at you. But in the position I play, you need to have a bit of pressure. A lot of players who start young always get the comparison from other people, a bit older. Or the Danish newspapers with Laudrup \u2026 but I\u2019ve been used to it from early on.\u201d Perhaps it is little surprise, then, that the midfielder was a model of calmness in a seminal week in Tottenham\u2019s season, one that has included a Europa League defeat in Florence and will end with a trip to Wembley, where the club\u2019s first silverware since Juande Ramos guided Spurs to a surprise League Cup success \u2013 against Chelsea, in 2008 \u2013 is in sight. Tottenham will need cool heads on Sunday. Their campaign took a major hit on Thursday in Italy following a performance littered with errors \u2013 in front of goal and in defence \u2013 as Mauricio Pochettino made seven changes to his side and paid the price in a 2-0 loss that will be remembered most of all for Roberto Soldado\u2019s howler. Eriksen played 90 minutes in that game and trained at Coverciano on Friday with the rest of the squad before returning to London, as thoughts turned to a season\u2011defining meeting with Chelsea. Eriksen has scored 11 goals this season, including crucial late efforts that have proved pivotal in the Premier League and Capital One Cup. He played in Spurs\u2019 rampant 5-3 victory over Chelsea on New Year\u2019s Day, a result that exposed the vulnerabilities of the league leaders and one that provided the title race with a much-needed shot in the arm. Eriksen turned down the opportunity to sign for Chelsea as a teenager, at a time when Frank Arnesen, a fellow Dane, was the sporting director at Stamford Bridge. He had two separate trials at the club aged 14 and 15 \u2013 playing in youth matches against Millwall and West Ham \u2013 but eventually opted for Amsterdam, regarding it as a more gentle step up after three years with Odense. \u201cIn England you can\u2019t enter the training ground without permission whereas in Denmark you are free to go in,\u201d he says when explaining the thought-process behind his decision. It was a move that paid off and Eriksen will renew acquaintances with Chelsea knowing that Tottenham\u2019s season is on the line. There remains the chance of a top-four finish in the Premier League but after their collapse against Fiorentina, the stakes at Wembley have been raised. Spurs can, though, take comfort from their remarkable success against Chelsea earlier in the campaign. \u201cPeople just had happier faces,\u201d Eriksen says of that victory. \u201cThere was more smiling and everyone was just excited that we won. Maybe they [Chelsea] got a knock on their confidence because they had a lot of games when they were unbeaten. \u201cThe confidence we take from that game is the most important thing. We showed that we can play against them and beat them. We played a few games before where we tried and did not succeed, but we showed now that we can and that gives us a lot of confidence.\u201d Eriksen\u2019s nine league goals from midfield have accounted for 13 points this season. His late strikes against Hull City, Swansea City and Sunderland secured wins and, along with Harry Kane, he has been the man Pochettino has relied upon when the chips are down. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019ve become a better player, I think I\u2019ve just been more stable,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you\u2019re young \u2013 I probably still am at 23, though I don\u2019t feel so young any more \u2013 you have your ups and downs. Luckily, there haven\u2019t been that many, of course there are still a few, but if you get those out I think I am still on the right path.\u201d With praise and superlatives, though, also comes criticism, a significant dose of which he received from Morten Olsen \u2013 the Denmark coach \u2013 last autumn following a Euro 2016 qualifier. In October, Olsen, presumably in an attempt to motivate Eriksen, said the midfielder was not making a sufficient impact at international level and that he had not progressed at Spurs, saying: \u201cIt is not Ajax any more, this is not development.\u201d Olsen\u2019s words had the intended effect. Since then Eriksen has been a revelation, producing excellent displays either centrally or out wide, and prompting the usual big-move speculation that comes with such form. \u201cIt didn\u2019t hurt,\u201d he says of Olsen\u2019s criticism. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up with that. We are a bit aggressive in that way, so I\u2019ve heard it before. I think he made the point a bit more for myself. He took it to the outside and also told me personally. I\u2019ve been used to that for a long time, that players want more because they think I can do better. Sometimes it helps, sometimes it doesn\u2019t. The game after, I think it helped. It\u2019s the national manager, so I trust what he says. \u201c[My dad] was a coach for me when I was seven to 13. He stayed as a coach on the sideline until I moved to Ajax. He was a footballer as well, so he knew a lot of things and he knew what he wanted. There were some times when I had a bad game, he would tell me to do better. Of course I have learned. \u201cI\u2019ve never thought about quitting. I\u2019ve been closing my door pretty hard after I spoke to him, locking the door to my room. But nothing else. So we have the discussion or he has the discussion with me, and I\u2019m listening. And then the day after, it\u2019s a new day and nothing happens. It\u2019s football.\u201d Eriksen has not scored in February, a month that started with a memorable victory over Arsenal but has gradually declined since \u2013 as Spurs dropped back out of the top four. A win on Sunday, though, would vindicate Pochettino\u2019s selection in Florence and, says Eriksen, provide Tottenham with a winning mentality going forward. \u201cIt is a few years ago [since] they won something here,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is what we want to do. \u201cWe have a really young team and everyone wants to show off and win something. You get a few chances but this is probably the biggest chance you get. If you get the feeling of winning, you want to have the feeling again. Everyone wants to have that.\u201d Christian Eriksen was speaking at a Tottenham Hotspur Foundation event highlighting the Education and Football Development Centre programme, which provides Academy-standard coaching alongside BTEC and FA level qualifications to create life changing opportunities to young people aged 16-18 not in education, employment or training.

The billboard announced the release of the 24-year-old singer-songwriter\u2019s debut album,  Chaos and the Calm, on 23 March. But the timing and the placement of the ad must also have been strategic: it was pasted up a couple of days before his gig down the road at Koko, the biggest show of his life so far.

A break of sorts came when Lana Del Rey was a no-show for Fearne Cotton\u2019s Live Lounge on Radio 1 last September; Bay stepped in, played his 2014 single \u201cLet It Go\u201d and began trending on Twitter. He was runner-up in the BBC\u2019s Sound of 2015 and then went one better, winning the 2015 Brits Critics\u2019 Choice award. Few prizes are such a dependable guarantee of future megastardom: Adele, Florence &amp; the Machine, Ellie Goulding, Jessie J, Emeli Sand\u00e9, Tom Odell and Sam Smith are all past winners. Bay seems to have admirers in high places, from the fashion designer Christopher Bailey, who asked him to play live at the Burberry Prorsum show in last autumn\u2019s London Fashion Week, to Taylor Swift, who has seen him perform twice. After the first gig in Nashville, Swift launched into a detailed dissection of \u201cLet It Go\u201d, a tiny bit awkward since Bay didn\u2019t know any of her songs to return the compliment. (He\u2019s more of a Feist man.) \u201cShe\u2019s not one of my favourites, but God, that\u2019s OK,\u201d he says. \u201cI think it\u2019s all right that I don\u2019t know her back catalogue.\u201d     \u2018If you want it, you\u2019ve got to want it more than the next guy, even if he\u2019s your best friend\u2019: James Bay. Photograph: Alex Bramall/Observer    On the second occasion, an industry showcase in Los Angeles before last month\u2019s Grammy Awards, Swift suggested that Bay open for her during her European tour this summer. \u201cI\u2019m hugely grateful for the invite,\u201d says Bay. \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019d be coming at me if she didn\u2019t like the music. And those are going to be enormous venues, so it gives me a taste of that scale. Why not be young and naive and hope that I\u2019ll get to that level at some stage?\u201d Much of Bay\u2019s life right now is glamorous \u2013 but not today. We are sitting in a pub in High Barnet, perusing a never-ending menu while builders down a lunchtime pint. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go beef burger and chips, cheese, no bacon,\u201d declares Bay, with an endearing enthusiasm he might not have had if he\u2019d seen, as I had, the chef standing catatonic alone in the kitchen. \u201cOr should it be fish and chips? Oh my God, scampi!\u201d And to drink? \u201cApple juice or orange juice. Apple juice first then orange juice.\u201d Looking out of the window, while \u201cGolden Brown\u201d by the Stranglers warbles out of tinny speakers, Bay knows this kind of establishment and its environs well. \u201cMid-level,\u201d he says. \u201cAll right. Livable. Not the most exciting thing in the world, but great. Easy to grow up in, which is what Hitchin was. Comfortable.\u201d Chaos and the Calm \u2013 as the title hints \u2013 deals with the dramatic life changes that Bay has been dealing with in recent times. But even though he is now in the rarefied position of being sent by his label to write in LA, and the album was recorded in Nashville\u2019s storied Blackbird Studio, Bay isn\u2019t keen to ditch his upbringing entirely. The guitarist in his band, Tom, has been his best friend since primary school; he\u2019s been with his girlfriend since they were teenagers in Hitchin. His biggest hit to date, \u201cHold Back the River\u201d, laments gradually losing touch with loved ones. \u201cYou hear all these stories about pop stars who say, \u2018I grew up in this small town and I had to break out and find the big city.\u2019 I wasn\u2019t like that as a little kid. I\u2019m very close in age to my older brother and we had a field at the end of the road where we could run around, climb trees, play football. I couldn\u2019t stand London.\u201d In fact, when Bay was sent to Los Angeles to finish working on the album, he found he couldn\u2019t write a line. Back home, the final tracks came easily. \u201cI\u2019ll always get dragged back to places like this,\u201d says Bay, as our lunch arrives, suspiciously quickly. \u201cIt\u2019s part of that age-old thing: never forget your roots. Well, I don\u2019t want to.\u201d He picks up a piece of scampi and pops it in his mouth.     \u2018We had a field at the end of the road where we could climb trees, play football. I couldn\u2019t stand London\u2019: James Bay. Photograph: Alex Bramall/Observer    A month before, in mid-January, I\u2019d met Bay at ITV\u2019s South Bank studios as he prepared to record a song for a show called The Brits Are Coming!, broadcast later the same night. His award, voted for by music journalists and \u201cindustry experts\u201d, was announced ahead of time and he was a couple of hours from playing in front of a television audience of millions. Arriving at the studios, he was confronted for the first time by a wall of paparazzi. Someone from the label called ahead and instructed him to get out of the left-hand side of the car. Bay smiled, \u201cIt\u2019s all very new still. For a second every time, it\u2019s a bit like, \u2018This is fun!\u2019\u201d He appeared unfazed, but bristled when I said as much. \u201cPlease don\u2019t make it seem like that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not Mr Fucking Big Balls. I\u2019m really not. I\u2019m not all confidence.\u201d The point he was making was that this wasn\u2019t some overnight success. After school, Bay went to the Brighton Institute of Modern Music (Bimm) partly because his girlfriend was already studying in the city but mostly because he looked on the website and liked a photograph of a wall covered in guitars. He\u2019d started playing his uncle\u2019s classic Spanish guitar with nylon strings when he was 11 and had been in bands through his teens, often in some configuration with his brother and Tom. At Bimm, Bay was in the same intake as the singer-songwriter Tom Odell. His course mostly taught him how cutthroat the music industry would be: \u201cIt\u2019s dog eat dog. If you want it, you\u2019ve got to want it more than the next guy, even if he\u2019s your best friend.\u201d Bay developed his sound at local open mics. Growing up, he was obsessed with Bruce Springsteen and Michael Jackson, and even now his tunes oscillate between growly anthems and delicate ballads that soar up into the falsetto register. Perhaps Bay\u2019s greatest discovery in Brighton, however, was Mad Hatters, a headwear emporium in North Laine. He\u2019d been listening to the American bluesman Eric Bibb, who is rarely seen without a panama, and Bay thinks there might be some entrenched memories of Bob Dylan and Robbie Robertson from the Band. Aged 20, he put on a dark fedora, decided he liked how it looked, and it has pretty much stayed there since. He\u2019s on to his second one now, bought in Nashville, and is seriously considering investing in a hat box with all the transatlantic travelling he\u2019s doing these days. The hat remains staunchly in place during our two meetings, but Bay plans to take it off one day. \u201cI might shave my head,\u201d he says. \u201cI hope to have a long career and I don\u2019t want to be defined by things that aren\u2019t the music.\u201d For now, though, it feels like a uniform: he puts it on and he\u2019s ready for work. \u201cIt\u2019s my suit. There should be an element of mystique between the fans and the artist. That bit between the stage and the audience. I think that\u2019s necessary. I used to dress up like Michael Jackson. I didn\u2019t have the glove, but I had a red jacket like in Thriller.\u201d     At the Brixton Academy, London, last March. Photograph: Justin Ng/Rex    Bay has to GO. A car is picking him up at the pub, off to Dublin via Heathrow. After that: Amsterdam, home, New York for a sold-out show at the Bowery Ballroom, home, the South by Southwest festival in Texas, then home again for the album release and two weeks of UK dates. Bay is an easy target for some critics: too handsome, too palatable, too much like the posse of soulful British and Irish male balladeers such as George Ezra and Hozier, who\u2019ve already made it. His response is to work relentlessly, as though he can silence the doubters one live show at a time. \u201cIs it that they go, \u2018He\u2019s got a look and that\u2019s why he\u2019s where he\u2019s at?\u2019\u201d Bay clicks his tongue, shakes his head. \u201cThat\u2019s a shame. I understand that, because it\u2019s the world we live in, but I\u2019m more than pleased to show them I can play.

His most recent production was Lehman Trilogy, Stefano Massini\u2019s account of the founders of the Lehman Brothers bank, realised in two parts, Tre Fratelli (Three Brothers) and Padri e Figli (Fathers and Sons), at the Piccolo Teatro in Milan. He had been artistic director there since 1999. Ronconi\u2019s most revolutionary production, and the one which brought him international renown, was in 1969, a stage adaptation of Ariosto\u2019s mammoth epic poem Orlando Furioso. It was first staged in a small deconsecrated church in Spoleto, at Gian Carlo Menotti\u2019s summer Festival of Two Worlds. Only a small number of people could squeeze into that space, but it was enthusiastically received. It moved out to a more appropriate venue \u2013 the piazza. I saw it and reviewed it from the main square of Bologna, where thousands were able to choose which of Ariosto\u2019s stories interested them and enjoy avoiding the trolleys from which the actors were declaiming the poet\u2019s verses about the warmongering and amorous adventures of Charlemagne\u2019s paladins and their Moorish opponents. The production triumphed in several other European venues, including Amsterdam and Madrid, and took the 1970 Edinburgh festival by storm, staged in an ice rink, with hippogriffs and sea monsters hurtling around on trucks. Then it moved to New York, where the mistake was made of presenting it in a \u201cbubble\u201d erected in a garden off 42nd Street, where the sophisticated Broadway first-nighters, on a rainy November evening, were angry at being obliged to stand, without a cloakroom to leave their raincoats and umbrellas, and listen to Ariosto\u2019s verses in Italian. Their negative reaction was reflected in the New York Times review the next morning. But the minority who had adored the show spread the word, and younger audiences began to flock to the bubble \u2013 too late, however, to permit the show to run beyond the scheduled run. If the bubble had been set up in a garden in Greenwich Village, the story might have been different. Ronconi\u2019s Orlando reached television in the mid-70s, when a five-part miniseries was filmed under the guidance of the Oscar-winning cinematographer Vittorio Storaro, partly in fantastical reconstructed Renaissance venues designed by Pier Luigi Pizzi at Cinecitt\u00e0 studios in Rome, and partly in authentic historical settings. Ronconi was born in Sousse, Tunisia. His parents had come from Rome, and after the family went back there, his father left his mother, Fernanda, who settled in Aquila, in the mountains east of the capital, where she worked as a teacher. She soon returned to Rome and would sometimes take Luca to the theatre, but often left him alone at home, where he devoured theatrical classics from her bookshelves. As he was not doing very well at school and the second world war had started, she sent him at the age of 10 to a school in Switzerland, where he felt isolated and only learned a little French and German. Back in Rome after the war, he managed to get into the academy of dramatic art and graduated after only two years of the three-year acting course. One of the teachers at the academy, the director Luigi Squarzina, gave him a small role in 1953 in his play about the antifascist resistance in Genoa, Tre Quarti di Luna (Three Quarters of the Moon). During the next decade, Ronconi appeared with several important companies but realised that he found acting boring and that he wanted to direct. He succeeded in 1963 in convincing some actor friends to form a company with him. Their first production was of two short plays, La Puta Onorata and La Buona Moglie (The Honest Maid and The Good Wife), by the Venetian dramatist Carlo Goldoni. I remember enjoying it enormously. So did the critics, and famous Italian actors began to seek him out. The first was Sergio Fantoni, who appeared in Ronconi\u2019s 1966 production of The Changeling. Ronconi gave it a \u201ctheatre of cruelty\u201d treatment, setting the play in a lunatic asylum. It startled but excited the audience. In 1967, Ronconi directed Measure for Measure in the Royal Palace in Turin. In the same city, in 1968, he directed Vittorio Gassman as Richard III. At first Gassman was bewildered by the type of acting Ronconi demanded, and, while he agreed to adapt his usual histrionic style, he refused to wear the exotic costume designed for him. After a perhaps too esoteric production, premiered at the Venice Biennale theatre festival, of Giordano Bruno\u2019s complex Renaissance drama Candelaio, a play Ronconi would return to more convincingly at the Milan Piccolo, came his feted Orlando Furioso at Spoleto. In opera, too, Ronconi had many successes (and a few flops). One of his most praised productions was of the Rossini opera Il Viaggio a Reims, the composer\u2019s last in Italian, with Riccardo Muti as conductor, at the Rossini opera festival in Pesaro in 1984. Ronconi started the performance in the streets of the city, where a group of travellers of different nationalities set off on their way to Reims for the coronation of Charles X, which the spectators then watched with them on the stage of the Teatro Rossini. In 1975, the first night of Utopia at the Edinburgh festival, staged in the same ice rink as Orlando in 1970, had to be postponed for 24 hours when props and costumes were held up. Furthermore, the audience was not happy to sit on wooden planks for more than four hours, but the critics stuck it out to the end of this adaptation of six plays by Aristophanes into one philosophic utopian dream. It received surprisingly rave reviews. For the Guardian, Cordelia Oliver wrote: \u201cThe parody and low comedy were easily accessible because brilliantly visual and metaphoric.\u201d     A scene from the Oresteia by Aeschylus, directed by Luca Ronconi in Venice (1972). Photograph: Mondadori/Getty Images    In 1991, the Teatro Stabile di Torino, where Ronconi was artistic director from 1989 to 1994, achieved an Orlando-like success in the Lingotto, a former Fiat factory, with The Last Days of Mankind by Karl Kraus, generally considered \u201cunperformable\u201d. Ronconi found mostly eager and enthusiastic audiences when artistic director of the Rome civic theatre (1994-98). In 2002, at the Greek theatre in the Sicilian city of Syracuse, his production of Aristophanes\u2019 The Frogs caused some controversy because there were caricatures of Silvio Berlusconi in the set design. Ronconi reluctantly agreed to remove them when the management reminded him that Berlusconi\u2019s government had provided financial support for the organisation. Ronconi never married, and considered his actors to be his \u201cspiritual heirs\u201d. Above all, this meant Massimo Popolizio, leading actor in most of his productions in recent years. When Ronconi\u2019s death was announced to the audience after the curtain calls for Tre Fratelli, Popolizio, who played one of the Lehman brothers, was seen to be weeping. \u2022 Luca Ronconi, actor and director, born 8 March 1933; died 21 February 2015 \u2022 This article was amended on 8 March 2015 to make it clear that Ronconi lived in Rome before going to school in Switzerland, and to make the location of Aquila more specific.

The combination of this with the gritty urbanism of the city sees it frequently (perhaps lazily) compared with Berlin - Belgrade is intriguing in its own unique way. Savamala, the neighbourhood on the river below the old town, is the current focal point for the city\u2019s creatives. Here you\u2019ll find KC Grad and Mikser House, two arts and performance spaces as well as lots of bars and restaurants. The city\u2019s clubbing scene is vibrant, and feaures legendary floating club 20/44 and brand new \u201ctechno cathedral\u201d Drugstore, in a former slaughterhouse. When to go? Summer is super hot in Belgrade, but it\u2019s also when the string of nightclubs on boats on the riverside are in full swing (most of these, apart from 20/44, close during winter). The best times to visit, according to locals, is spring or autumn, avoiding the particularly dreary spell winter can cast over the place.

When Denmark\u2019s King Christian V launched a bloody conquest of Sk\u00e5ne, Sweden\u2019s southernmost province and fertile breadbasket, he could hardly have foreseen that Copenhagen might one day find a more civilised way of spreading its influence. Swedes are now facing a landgrab of a different sort: Denmark wants to rebrand Sk\u00e5ne as \u201cGreater Copenhagen\u201d to better compete with other city destinations. \u201cSize matters,\u201d says Frank Jensen, mayor of Copenhagen and a champion of the project. Copenhagen is a small capital city but with a well known name internationally, he says. \u201cAs Greater Copenhagen we can show it is something special \u2013 it is about creating a common identity that the entire region can get behind, and the Sk\u00e5ne region will also strengthen its position by profiling itself in this way.\u201d The Danes call it a collaboration and are counting on Swedish support. Growth in east Denmark and south Sweden is significantly lower than in competing cities such as Stockholm, Amsterdam or Hamburg, notes an official Danish document setting out a vision of Greater Copenhagen as a European metropolis, with the \u201cinternational clout\u201d to become a magnet for investment and innovation.       \u201cTogether we will have 3.8 million people, 11 universities with 150,000 students and many PhDs, so we will come up as an interesting place to locate your European or Scandinavian HQ,\u201d says Jensen. \u201cThat is what it\u2019s all about.\u201d The geographical area in question already has a name \u2013 \u00d6resund if you are Swedish, or \u00d8resund if you\u2019re a Dane \u2013 encompassing Sk\u00e5ne and the Danish island of Zealand, on which Copenhagen is built. The official title of the famous bridge that joins the two countries is the \u00d8resund (or \u00d6resund) bridge. The region accounts for over a quarter of the combined GDP of Sweden and Denmark. The trouble is nobody outside this bustling part of Scandinavia has ever heard of it. \u201cThe investment in the \u00d8resund bridge and tunnel was always supposed to create an integrated region between east Denmark and south Sweden \u2013 the difference now is that it has become clear the region needs a name that is not simply \u00d8resund,\u201d said Greg Clark, international cities expert and advisor to megacities including London, S\u00e3o Paulo, Singapore, New York and Hong Kong.    [This] will take some time for the south Swedes to accept \u2026 But they will  Greg Clark     Although examples of coordination across national borders are rare, the rebranding makes sense, he believes \u2013 global competition is real and fierce, and if two smaller cities become one big region they can mobilise their assets, populations and amenities.  \u201cCities in general, and Copenhagen in particular, have become more recognised and regarded as the primary territorial brands,\u201d Clark says. \u201cCopenhagen\u2019s leadership on the climate change and liveability agendas has made it a recognised international brand.\u201d The two sides make a good fit. Denmark\u2019s capital is overcrowded, corporate and expensive, while Malm\u00f6, Sweden\u2019s third city across the water, has spare capacity, is relatively cheap, and has more of an enterprise economy. But Swedes feel somewhat ambiguous about being nominally subsumed by their Danish neighbours. \u201cI do not feel in the current situation that we are prepared to leave Malm\u00f6 behind,\u201d the city\u2019s social democratic mayor, Katrin Stjernfeldt Jammeh, said last year. \u201cI think it would cause problems on the Swedish side.\u201d Instead of Greater Copenhagen, Stefan Johansson, head of the Invest in Sk\u00e5ne business lobby, would prefer to rebrand the \u00d8resund region the \u201cScandinavia Bay Area\u201d, alluding to the west coast of the US.  \u201cSk\u00e5ne is comparable to San Francisco\u2019s Bay Area in terms of its food, wine, creative industries and science,\u201d Johansson says, \u201cand the Scandinavia Bay Area has the advantage of being a more neutral name, and more easily accepted in southern Sweden.\u201d     Copenhagen wants to become a metropolis with international clout. Photograph: Kateryna Negoda/Getty Images/Flickr RF    The government in Stockholm says the debate is a regional matter but this could mean Sk\u00e5ne would be overlooked for future investment if it starts to be seen as \u201csemi-foreign\u201d, according to Per Tryding, vice-president of the South Sweden Chamber of Commerce. A metropolis needs 4 \u2013 5 million people to be \u201csomebody\u201d on the world stage, Tryding admits, and Copenhagen is the only city in the region whose name has international recognition. Many southern Swedes already treat Copenhagen as their cultural capital, he says, with all the attractions of a big city that is much more accessible than Stockholm. \u201cAt least we have the \u2018greater\u2019 part of Greater Copenhagen,\u201d he consoles himself. \u201cWithout us they are only Copenhagen.\u201d Sweden\u2019s main business newspaper, Dagens Industri, recently came out in support of the rebranding, noting southern Sweden\u2019s economic weakness and declaring that Copenhagen could become \u201cSk\u00e5ne\u2019s bridge to the world\u201d. But it also struck a note of caution about the potential loss of regional identity. Using Copenhagen to describe parts of Sweden, even if just for promotional purposes, is a big step, Clark says. \u201cThat will take some time for the south Swedes to accept and use. But they will.

Yet for many, the Liverpool sound came into being on 12 March 1840, when a group of music lovers assembled at a dancing academy in Everton known as Mr Lassell\u2019s Saloon, forming the oldest symphony orchestra in the country. The Royal Liverpool Philharmonic\u2019s claim to seniority has not been without dispute. A disagreement with its great Mancunian rival, the Hall\u00e9, over which came first had to be settled in 2009 by the Advertising Standards Authority, which eventually arbitrated in Liverpool\u2019s favour. What is less open to doubt is that the RLPO celebrates its 175th anniversary next week with a performance of Beethoven\u2019s Choral symphony, having reached an artistic and commercial peak unparalleled in its history. The RLPO has a storied roll of chief conductors. From 1880 to 1883, Max Bruch \u2013 composer of the G minor Violin Concerto \u2013 was in charge, though he fell out with the choir and accused the timpanists of being drunk. During the second world war, Malcolm Sargent introduced a series of industrial concerts, in which tickets were distributed by ballot among the city\u2019s manufacturing firms. In the 60s, Charles Groves oversaw the first complete Mahler cycle in Britain. Yet none have had quite the transformative effect as the discovery, in 2004, of a brilliantly talented young maestro from St Petersburg.   Related: RLPO/Petrenko review \u2013 the Tchaikovsky was a triumph    Vasily Petrenko\u2019s first impressions of Liverpool were not altogether promising. \u201cThey needed someone to come, at very short notice, to conduct Prokofiev\u2019s choral cantata, Alexander Nevsky,\u201d he remembers. \u201cThe hotel was cold, the bed was too short and we had to rehearse in Bootle town hall, alongside some workmen who refused to stop hammering. They could at least have done it in tempo.\u201d A decade on, you could be forgiven for thinking that conditions have become only a little more salubrious. We meet at the Friary, the orchestra\u2019s rehearsal base in a deconsecrated Catholic basilica full of kitsch, 19th-century statuary and overflowing mousetraps. Yet this rather bleak corner of Everton is barely a stone\u2019s throw from the saloon (since demolished) where the first concerts of the Philharmonic society took place. Down the road is the primary school in which the orchestra runs the In Harmony scheme, a programme based on the Venezuelan El Sistema method, which enables every child to learn a musical instrument in one of the most deprived wards in Europe.     Vasily Petrenko conducting the RLPO at the Proms in 2012. Photograph: Chris Christodoulou/Lebrecht Music &amp; Arts/Corbis    \u201cWhen I first came here, the orchestra was perhaps a little demoralised,\u201d says Petrenko. \u201cBut I could see there was the talent and desire to reach the premier league.\u201d Since 2006 \u2013 when Petrenko, at 29, became the orchestra\u2019s youngest ever principal conductor \u2013 box office revenue has increased by 74%, and more than a quarter of those who saw the orchestra last year were under 25. It\u2019s a long way from the turbulence of the 1980s, which the RLPO only survived by the skin of its teeth. The Toxteth riots were in such close proximity to the hall \u2013 a curvaceous chunk of Chicago modernism transplanted to the fringes of the trouble spot \u2013 that the players banded together to give unpaid lunchtime performances and ran shuttle services for nervous concert-goers. It was a risky time to join the band, but the RLPO\u2019s principal percussionist, Graham Johns, swapped the prestige of playing with the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam for a far less certain future on Merseyside.     Heading out on tour, circa 1960 Photograph: RLPO    \u201cPeople said to me: \u2018The city\u2019s bankrupt, the hall is in a war-zone, what on earth do you want to go there for?\u2019\u201d Johns remembers. \u201cBut I could see it was a great ensemble with real potential. We played on motor scooters in evening dress, did concerts on open-top buses \u2013 anything to raise our profile. The people of Liverpool are proud of their orchestra. It\u2019s as much a symbol of the city as the football clubs and the cathedrals. They wanted us to survive.\u201d The corner was turned when the distinguished Czech conductor, and former jazz trombonist, Libor Pe\u0161ek spent a decade on Merseyside starting in 1987. Pe\u0161ek - who remains the orchestra\u2019s conductor laureate - immediately clicked with the RLPO as it was the first British orchestra prepared to take a gamble on the gargantuan and little-heard Asrael Symphony of his countryman Josef Suk. Urbane and charming, Pe\u0161ek became hugely loved among the players both for his languid, seemingly effortless conducting style and his legendary generosity. \u201cPe\u0161ek led us in a performance of Strauss\u2019s Also Sprach Zarasthustra at the holy of holies, the Musikverein in Vienna,\u201d Johns remembers. \u201cAt the end of that piece there are 12 strokes of a giant church bell, and we didn\u2019t have one. No orchestra in the country did. So I went to the foundry that cast the bells of Liverpool Cathedral and they said, \u2018We can do you a low E natural, it\u2019ll be \u00a35,000, plus \u00a3500 for the case\u2019. There was no way the orchestra\u2019s funds would stretch to that, so I did a rather foolhardy thing: I bought it myself. But when Libor heard of this he said: \u2018Graham, you cannot possibly pay all this. I will pay half\u2019.\u201d (As a postscript, the bell has been hired out so many times to other orchestras it has paid for itself several times over.)     Graham Johns with his (and Libor Pesek\u2019s) bell Photograph: RLPO    Over the course of 175 years, the RLPO has grown to incorporate a number of sister organisations: the Philharmonic Choir (whose origins are even older, dating back to 1755); a contemporary music offshoot known as Ensemble 10/10; and an acclaimed youth orchestra that had to lower its age requirement in the mid-60s to accommodate an exceptional 10-year-old percussionist named Simon Rattle. Petrenko, inevitably, is now in huge demand around the world. He took on the artistic leadership of the Oslo Philharmonic last year, though he still lives on the Wirral. Unusually for a chief conductor, his contract with the RLPO has no fixed term but seems unlikely to lapse in the foreseeable future. \u201cIt\u2019s like any good marriage,\u201d he says. \u201cIt should last as long as the romance is still there.\u201d But it\u2019s clear he is waiting for the next generation of wonder-kids to emerge. \u201cYou know what would enable me to say that we\u2019ve really achieved something here? It would be to see one of the In Harmony primary-school kids graduate to become a full member of the orchestra. We started the programme six years ago, the oldest are now on the verge of joining the youth orchestra; so give it another eight or 10 years and it could happen. And I would love to be around for that.\u201d \u2022 The RLPO\u2019s 175th anniversary concert is on 12 March (repeated on 14 March).", "sentences": ["It was a risky time to join the band, but the RLPO\u2019s principal percussionist, Graham Johns, swapped the prestige of playing with the Royal Concertgebouw in Amsterdam for a far less certain future on Merseyside."], "title": "The RLPO at 175: Vasily and the pacemakers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/mar/05/royal-liverpool-philharmonic-175-vasily-petrenko-rlpo", "tags": ["Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra", "Classical music", "Music", "Culture", "Liverpool"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-03-06T12:20:55Z", "article": "BBC4 will screen Antigone, the already-acclaimed production of Sophocles\u2019s play beginning at London\u2019s Barbican this week.

Yet graphic design is almost entirely absent from public discourse. It\u2019s everywhere, but hidden in plain sight. Graphic design has always been the poor relation to its more lordly cousins. Architecture has a Royal Institute, an Architecture Foundation, an Architectural Association and almost more awards lavished on the profession than there are buildings completed each year. Fashion has its own museum, its own special weeks and its attendant tomes of glossy magazines, while products and furniture take up the bulk of the Design Museum\u2019s collection and enjoy annual festivals where chairs are put on pedestals. But graphic designers? If they\u2019re lucky, they can pay through the nose for the chance to win a novelty yellow pencil. \u201cWe thought it was ridiculous that although their work is seen by millions of people, all the time, the man in the street probably couldn\u2019t name a single graphic designer,\u201d says Graham McCallum, co-founder of east London\u2019s Kemistry Gallery, which opened 10 years ago, driven by this very frustration. Operating on a shoestring, the small space has held exhibitions every six weeks since then, showcasing the work of established stars and unknown young designers, building up an avid fan club along the way. Just before Christmas, they were forced out of their Shoreditch home by rising rents. Now they\u2019re back, with more ambitious plans than ever before.

Related: Dylan to Doctor Who: 100 years of eye-popping graphic design \u2013 in pictures    \u201cWe can\u2019t get there in one leap, but the Photographers\u2019 Gallery is the model we\u2019re thinking of,\u201d says McCallum, describing a centre with space for a standing exhibition as well as temporary shows, a place for lectures and of course a shop, where graphics fetishists might drool over the latest bindings and fondle foiled covers. Keen to stay in east London, they are currently working with Hackney council to identify a space. This may be further east in Hackney Wick, on the edge of the imminent Olympicopolis cultural quarter, making use of residential developments\u2019 requirements to be seen to be \u201cgiving back\u201d to the area. A temporary snapshot of what such a space might look like opens this weekend at Protein Studios, with an exhibition ambitiously titled 100 Years of Graphic Design. Essentially a best-of retrospective of designers McCallum and Churchill have showed over the last decade, it brings together unlikely bedfellows in one big room for the first time. There is the original hand-painted version of Max Gill\u2019s fantastical Wonderground map, produced for the London Underground in 1914, alongside Ken Garland\u2019s CND protest posters from the 1962 Aldermaston march, its ban-the-bomb symbol layered like a marching line of placards. There is David Pearson\u2019s recent Penguin cover of Nineteen Eighty-Four, its title dramatically blacked-out like redacted NSA files, beside a map of the New York Subway emblazoned on a big red heart, hand-drawn by young South Korean studio Zero per Zero.     Max Gill\u2019s Wonderground, 1914    \u201cWe found Zero per Zero on the internet one day,\u201d says McCallum. \u201cThat\u2019s where we bump into new talent now. But it needs physical space, too. It\u2019s nice to bring this work to people, and show graphic design as something that has a value \u2013 not just a commercial enterprise.\u201d It is an eclectic mix, ranging from a Saul Bass film poster (mass-produced in the 1960s, but now worth up to \u00a33,000), to the street-art letterforms of Ben Eine, known for plastering the alphabet across roller shutters in the East End. In a slightly different moment of commodification, his work has gone from being thrown-up by night to a presidential trophy: one of his canvases was recently presented as a gift from David Cameron to Barack Obama. It\u2019s an impressive feat to have rallied all this stuff together, much of it donated from the designers themselves, including pieces from New York duo Milton Glaser (creator of the original I \u2665 NY) and Seymour Chwast, both now in their 80s and still practising. But it is even more shocking that such a show should be a rarity \u2013 indeed, McCallum can\u2019t remember anything like this in his lifetime. \u201cThere\u2019s an increasing awareness of graphic design, but it\u2019s only grown recently,\u201d he says. \u201cIt used to be quite an arcane profession: you used scalpels and cardboard and cow-gum and prepared artwork. What has changed is the digital revolution, which has really democratised design. Anyone can do it now,\u201d he grins, \u201cand unfortunately they do.\u201d But with the digital shift, hasn\u2019t the way design should be exhibited also transformed? Is the future of a National Centre for Graphic Design really about hanging prints on walls?     Eine\u2019s Extortion, 2014    \u201cThere is a danger it could all be very nostalgic,\u201d says Neville Brody, dean of the school of communication at the Royal College of Art, who defined the radical look of The Face in the 1980s. \u201cGraphic design is undergoing massive changes. The old model of print and branding has almost disappeared. Brands are using social media to connect directly with their audience and packaging is just the thing something comes in off the internet, it\u2019s not what you pick off the shelf.\u201d To stay relevant, he thinks the centre must engage with other disciplines and tackle bigger issues like sustainability and social engagement, not fetishise the work of a bygone era. \u201cI would hate to see a celebratory museum,\u201d he adds. \u201cBut I would love to see a great British crafts institution helping to define the future.\u201d Others see an urgent need for a more thorough appreciation of graphic history, as well looking forward. \u201cThere is a difference between nostalgia and understanding history,\u201d says John Morgan, whose own work for clients from the BBC to Tate Britain draws on a masterly understanding of what has gone before. \u201cStudents just aren\u2019t taught history any more and it really shows.\u201d He thinks the issue stems partly from graphic design\u2019s relative youth. \u201cWe had commercial artists, but the first practising design groups weren\u2019t until the 1950s and 60s,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s still such a young discipline that no one knows what the hell it is. There\u2019s no critical backstory. Anything that helps graphic design to stop being the poor relation of architecture should be encouraged.\u201d Adrian Shaughnessy, founder of Unit Editions publishers and senior tutor at the RCA, sees the problem as a British affliction. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the same graphic tradition as Switzerland, Holland or even the US,\u201d he says. \u201cIf you evaluate graphics in fine art terms, it\u2019s always been seen as a low-grade activity here, denigrated as a commercial endeavour. It wasn\u2019t until the 80s that we took these people seriously. But it really is changing now.\u201d Thousands of international students apply to study graphic design in London every year, he says, ahead of New York and Amsterdam. And they\u2019re more keen on print than ever before.     Ken Garland\u2019s poster for the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, 1962    \u201cThe digital revolution? A few years ago I would have said so. But now all of our students want to work in print. The digital thing is obviously huge, but there\u2019s a whole new culture being built around printed artefacts. The letterpress workshop has never been so busy.\u201d There are few models elsewhere in the world for what a national graphic design centre might look like, leaving the Kemistry duo starting from scratch. Tokyo has the excellent Ginza Graphic Gallery, while the French town of Chaumont has an annual poster festival that has spawned a centre for graphic design. But there is precious little else, bar the collections of major museums. \u201cChaumont is an interesting example,\u201d says Benjamin Reichen, of London-based design studio \u00c5b\u00e4ke. \u201cThey\u2019re planning a mini-Tate of graphic design in the French countryside. What a weird, brave thing to do.\u201d He thinks such an institution hasn\u2019t existed before partly because the work can be problematic to exhibit. It doesn\u2019t really fit in. \u201cGraphic design is a form of support structure,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s always attached to a context or client. How do you focus a programme around something that is not really a standalone thing?\u201d This existential angst is precisely what can be hammered out in the new forum: a place for print nerds to debate with virtual futurists, for bookbinding to be interrogated with the same critical rigour as a new cat meme, for the rich and ragged melee of visual culture to be celebrated and disputed on a public stage. Whatever the National Centre for Graphic Design becomes, it can be sure to have an eager audience champing at the bit.

It faded. People voted with their wallets and their feet and swapped two wheels for four. The Netherlands, famously, was able to reduce the monochrome encroachment of car culture by also building for people on bicycles. It helped that the Netherlands was already the top cycling nation in the world by 1911 \u2013 the Dutch simply never lost their love for the bicycle. The installation of the exemplary infrastructure from the mid-1970s onwards was enabled thanks to this national identification with a form of transportation that, for the Dutch, has always been egalitarian and normal but became maligned \u2013 and ignored \u2013 in much of the rest of the world.     1950: In the university city of Oxford everybody cycles to work. Photograph: George Pickow/Getty Images    In car-centric Britain planners assumed that cycling was teetering on the edge of extinction, and by omission they would do all they could to hasten this demise. Civil engineer and planner Professor Colin Buchanan wrote a highly-influential 1963 transport report for the government which recommended that nothing be done at all to encourage urban cycling. Buchanan\u2019s Traffic in Towns was used by town planners to bulldoze motorways through British cities.  Leeds, Birmingham, Newcastle and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 London were brutalised by planners who cherrypicked from Traffic in Towns to build only for motorists. \u201cThere [should be] an allocation of movements to pedal cycles,\u201d wrote Professor Buchanan, projecting 47 years in the future, \u201cbut it must be admitted that it is a moot point how many cyclists there will be in 2010.\u201d For Buchanan, providing infrastructure for cyclists was unthinkable: \u201c \u2026 cyclists should not be admitted to primary networks, for obvious reasons of safety and the free flow of vehicular traffic. It would make the design of these roads far too complicated to build \u2018cycle tracks\u2019 into them ... It would be very expensive, and probably impracticable, to build a completely separate system of tracks for cyclists.\u201d To be fair to Buchanan and his ilk they were going with the flow. Sales of new cycles had been dropping since the 1950s and reached an all-time low of less than 200,000 by the end of the 1960s (today, 2.5m bicycles are sold each year).      Made for cars: the Old Market Roundabout in Bristol, England. Photograph: Alamy    Yet something strange happened in 1970 \u2013 bicycling bounced back, first in America and then in Britain. Sales of bicycles in America in 1970 doubled almost overnight. Sales in Britain quadrupled in just a few short years. Between 1970 and 1973 there was a blossoming of bicycle culture in America and Britain. The much-loved Richard\u2019s Bicycle Book by the late Richard Ballantine was first published in 1972, joining other pedal-popularising books that seemed to herald bicycling\u2019s new dawn.  Traffic in Towns had been a Penguin bestseller in 1964, selling hundreds of thousands; Richard\u2019s Bicycle Book sold in its millions. Over in the Netherlands the Opec oil crisis of 1973 fuelled a renewed demand for people-powered transport. For a few short months in America and Britain the calls to cull motor car journeys were taken very seriously. After the lifting of the oil embargo the Netherlands carried on designing for bicycles, but car-curbing plans were dropped in America and Britain.      A woman talks on phone while cycling in Amsterdam, a city known for its dedicated bike lanes and the best cycling infrastructure in the world.  Photograph: Alamy    The rest, as they say is history, and the divergence between the Netherlands and the rest of the world has led to a gap that will take many years to bridge, if ever the political will could be found. But this ignores the fact that some major global cities outside of the Netherlands did design for bicycles, even in the Dark Ages of Car Culture. Montreal, for instance. Montreal may only be 11th in the Copenhagenize Report\u2019s index of best cycling cities but it\u2019s one of just four non-European cities to make it into the top 20. It\u2019s also where bike share schemes really took off. The city-owned Bixi bike share scheme was the model for Velib in Paris and Santander Cycles in London. In fact, London\u2019s \u201cBoris\u201d bikes were supplied by Bixi and they are exact facsimiles of the muscular machines first used in Montreal. Montreal became bicycle-friendly because of people power. A bicycle advocacy group was founded in April 1975 and many of the campaign tactics it employed are still used by advocacy groups around the world today. The first cyclist lie down protest (a leaflet, using black humour, urged \u201cCome die-in with me\u201d) was first used by Montreal\u2019s Le Monde \u00e0 Bicyclette. This middle-class anarchist-leaning advocacy group was successful in persuading the left-leaning politicians of Montreal to provide for bicycles.  Today, Montreal has 373 miles of bicycle paths, including a two-mile kerb-protected cycle path on De Maisonneuve Boulevard through downtown Montreal. This was built in 2007, replacing a car lane, and was named for Claire Morissette who died in the same year. She was one of the co-founders of Le Monde \u00e0 Bicyclette (MAB). She was the creative brains of the organisation, said co-founder Robert Silverman. \u201cBicycle Bob\u201d is now 82, partially blind so not able to cycle any more but he\u2019s still passionate about what he and Morissette were able to achieve as the leaders of MAB. Despite being salaried workers for the organisation they wound it up in 1998. \u201cWe\u2019d achieved all our aims,\u201d Silverman told me, \u201cthere was nothing else to campaign for.\u201d (It has since been revived.)      Bicycle path in Montreal, Canada. Photograph: Alamy    I was interviewing Silverman for a book I\u2019m writing. Bike Boom is raising funds \u2013 and offering first edition rewards \u2013 on Kickstarter right now. I\u2019m interviewing as many of the 1970s cycle advocates as possible. They kept the flame alive and we should recognise that these early cycle advocates didn\u2019t fail. It\u2019s not their fault today we don\u2019t have wall-to-wall Dutch-style cycle infrastructure, that\u2019s the fault of car-centrism. I\u2019m not just interviewing Canadian, American and British cycle advocates, I\u2019m also spending time with Dutch cycle advocates, trying to work out how their campaigns of the 1970s \u2013 such as Stop de Kindermoord, \u201cStop the child murder, and the free-to-use \u201cwhite bicycles\u201d of the Provo anarchist movement, precursors to the Bixi bike share bikes \u2013 were so successful. Yes, a strong and historic bicycle culture played a part but there were other factors at work, too, and I want to drill down into these to see how much of the gloriously successful history of Dutch cycle infrastructure provision can be used to inform and inspire us here in the very un-Dutch present.", "sentences": ["A woman talks on phone while cycling in Amsterdam, a city known for its dedicated bike lanes and the best cycling infrastructure in the world."], "title": "The demise and rebirth of cycling in Britain", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2015/mar/10/the-demise-and-rebirth-of-cyling-in-britain", "tags": ["Environment", "Transport", "Cycling", "Netherlands", "Europe", "Life and style", "UK news", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-03-11T07:00:05Z", "article": "The dream of every aspiring young mathematician is to compete at the annual International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO), where the best pre-university maths minds from around the world are faced with subtle, challenging and imaginative problems.  As a competition it is brutal and intense. I speak from experience; I was in the UK team in 2011. So it was with great expectation that I went to see X+Y, a star-studded British film about the travails of a British IMO hopeful who is struggling against the challenges of romance, Asperger\u2019s and really tough maths. Obviously, there were a few oversimplifications and departures from reality necessary for a coherent storyline. There were other problems too, but we\u2019ll get to them later. In order to get chosen for the UK IMO team, you must sit the first round test of the British Mathematical Olympiad (BMO1). About 1200 candidates take this test around the country. I sat BMO1 on a cold December day at my sixth form, Netherthorpe School in Chesterfield. Apart from the invigilator and me, the room was completely empty, although the surroundings became irrelevant as soon as I was captivated by the problems. The test comprises six questions over the course of three and a half hours. As is the case with all Olympiad problems, there are often many distinct ways to solve them, and correct complete solutions are maximally rewarded irrespective of the elegance or complexity of the proof. Here\u2019s a typical BMO1 problem (from 2006): Find four prime numbers less than 100 which divide 332 \u2013 232. There are many ways to solve this, including using Fermat\u2019s Little Theorem, modular arithmetic, and factorising the polynomial p32 \u2013 q32. A less efficient approach was taken by one student who attempted to manually evaluate 332 \u2013 232 and perform a brute-force search of all primes below 100. It is difficult to imagine a more cumbersome method, short of using Roman numerals! The knowledge required to solve this problem does not transcend A-level, but it demands thinking more laterally than is required in any conventional exam. A few weeks later this is followed by a second and more challenging round, the BMO2, which consists of four considerably more difficult problems. Here\u2019s a typical BMO2 question taken from last year: We say that two integer points (a, b) and (c, d) in the plane can \u2018see\u2019 each other if the line segment joining them passes through no other integer points. A \u2018loop\u2019 is an irreducible non-empty set of integer points such that each element can see precisely two other elements of the set. Does there exist a loop of size 100? The solution is quite involved and generalises to any bipartite graph. The idea is to put alternate vertices on the x- and y-axes, and to appeal to the Chinese Remainder Theorem in addition to Dirichlet\u2019s Theorem in order to guarantee that this can be done in such a way as to ensure that the only lines of visibility are those that we specifically want. The highest twenty scorers are invited to another training camp at Trinity College, Cambridge, and the top six are selected to represent the UK at an annual competition in Romania. I was chosen for this. It was my first experience of an international maths competition, and indeed my first time abroad. Upon arriving at Luton airport, I was confronted with a scene of people wielding Rubik\u2019s cubes and playing word games, not completely dissimilar from the airport scene in X+Y. The main difference was that my compatriots were far more friendly and agreeable than their arrogant and pretentious film counterparts. Instead, we had an immediate mutual respect.     The British IMO team (together with the team leader and two other helpers) in 2011. Adam, then aged 17, is fifth on the left. Photograph: Joseph Myers.    In Romania, there was much maths, but we also enjoyed a snowball fight against the Italian delegation and sampled the delights of Romanian rum-endowed chocolate. Since I was teetotal at this point in time, the rum content was sufficient to alter my perception in such a way that I decided to attack a problem using Cartesian coordinates (considered by many to be barbaric and masochistic). Luckily my recklessness paid off, enabling me to scrape a much-coveted gold medal by the narrowest of margins. In X+Y, the British team has a joint training camp with the Chinese delegation. The closest analogue is the Anglo-Hungarian training camp that is held near a picturesque but secluded lake thirty miles west of Budapest. From my experience in December 2011, this was the most enjoyable of the maths camps. The connection between the UK and Eastern Europe is rather complicated to explain, being intimately entangled with the history of the IMO. The inaugural Olympiad was held in Romania in 1959, with the competition being only open to countries under the Soviet bloc. A Hungarian mathematician, B\u00e9la Bollob\u00e1s, competed in the first three Olympiads, seizing a perfect score on the third. After his PhD, Bollob\u00e1s moved to Trinity College, Cambridge, to continue his research, where he fertilised Cambridge with his contributions in probabilistic and extremal combinatorics (becoming a Fellow of the Royal Society in the process). Consequently, there is a close relationship between Hungarian and Cantabrigian mathematics. Nathan (the protagonist of X+Y) receives a seated ovation when he presents a solution immediately after being asked a question involving playing cards by their team leader:    \u00a0 Can you also solve this question in the time it takes to say it?   This was highly unrealistic, as the question is entirely trivial in comparison with problems encountered at international level. That Nathan and I both solved it in a split-second is indicative of this \u2013 IMO-level problems typically take many minutes or even hours to solve. In the film, the IMO is held at Cambridge. In 2011 it was in Amsterdam. I was impressed that the film managed to accurately capture the atmosphere of the exam, even in the detail of having exactly the same colour-coded cards for requesting assistance. Conversely, the overgrown lollipops bearing the mantra \u2018Can I Help?\u2019 were much less believable! Rafe Spall\u2019s character was very convincing, and his eccentricities injected some much-needed humour into the film. Similarly, Asa Butterfield\u2019s portrayal of a \u201ctypical mathmo\u201d was realistic. On the other hand, certain characters such as Richard (the team leader) were unnatural and exaggerated. In particular, I was disappointed that all of the competitors were portrayed as being borderline-autistic, when in reality there is a much more diverse mixture of individuals. X+Y is also a love story, and one based on a true story covered in Morgan Matthews\u2019 earlier work, the documentary Beautiful Young Minds. This followed the 2006 IMO, in China, where one of the members of the UK team fell in love and married the receptionist of the hotel the team were staying at. They have since separated, although his enamourment with China persisted \u2013 he switched from studying Mathematics to Chinese Studies. It is common for relationships to develop during maths Olympiads. Indeed after a member of our team enjoyed a m\u00e9nage-a-trois at an IMO in the 1980s, the committee increased the security and prohibited boys and girls from entering each others\u2019 rooms. I did not find the love story in X+Y convincing. But what was even more absurd was that a climactic moment was illustrated by a majestic, CGI rainbow that was optically inconsistent! The colours appeared in the same order in the inner and outer rainbows, which does not reflect (no pun intended!) actual double rainbows, where the colours appear in reversed order. What happens to IMO veterans? More than half of UK team members since we joined the competition in 1966 have become (like me) undergraduates at Trinity College, Cambridge.     Isaac Newton said that if he saw further it was by standing on the shoulder of giants. Here his statue stands at Trinity, by the shoulder of Adam P Goucher.    Trinity is something of a mathematical paradise, being the ancestral home of Isaac Newton, G.H Hardy, Srinivasa Ramanujan and many others. The community of Trinity undergraduates also help the effort by giving maths camp lectures, marking selection tests and (most importantly!) making tea. I myself assisted in founding the European Girls\u2019 Mathematical Olympiad, which is now in its fourth year, and actively mark the corresponding UK selection paper. Even though it wasn\u2019t a faithful representation of Olympiad life, I hope that \u2018X+Y\u2019 inspires and encourages aspiring young mathematicians to pursue their interest to the highest level possible.

Small teams of coders and designers will be given a selection of recent stories from the newspaper, and will then have 48 hours to create games based around the article they choose. The best entries will be made available via the Guardian site. The idea of a \u201cnews game\u201d is not, in fact, new. Since the mid-nineties, when web plug-ins like Flash made it possible to produce quick, cheap games then distribute them online, developers have been creating interactive news experiments. Italian studio Molleindustria was a pioneer, launching the fast food satire McDonald\u2019s Game and oil business expose Oiligarchy, while US developer Persuasive Games has tackled subjects like mass food production (Bacteria Salad) and airport customs (Airport Insecurity).  Charities, museums and galleries have all explored the potential of games as a potent medium for engagement and instruction. The Wellcome Trust has been working with game developers for years, developing titles to explore bioscience issues, while Cancer Research is the latest organisation to use gamers as a resource via its title Reverse the Odds, which tasks players with analysing real-life cancer cells.  In the mainstream press, however, we\u2019re yet to see the concept of \u201cinteractive journalism\u201d develop beyond the provision of quizzes and polls, explorable data apps, and big multimedia experiments like the Guardian\u2019s own Firestorm. Games as a news delivery mechanism hardly figure.    Related: Firestorm: The story of the bushfire at Dunalley    Partly of course, there are huge ethical concerns. Although the medium has matured greatly over the past five years, there is still a cognitive backlash against the idea of \u201cplaying\u201d with real-life stories in which people may have been killed or injured. Speaking about this issue in a Guardian feature two years ago, Persuasive Games co-founder Ian Bogost said, \u201cWithout a set of examples that move players to be affected by non-fiction games, and without more widely published and read criticism about why such games are useful, its no wonder [newspaper readers] find themselves unsure and afraid. That may change over time, but we need more games to make it happen.\u201d But so far there haven\u2019t been many more games, and that\u2019s maybe as much to do with cost and development resources as it is to do with ethics. Even low-budget games, built using cheap tools like Unity3D or Game Maker can take a long time to plan, implement and develop \u2013 if they are treated as high-end, high-polish interactive projects. Slowly that is happening: Al Jazeera has its AJ+ mobile app which treats story media as a selection of cards which can be \u201cstacked\u201d by the user into their own custom-built stories; and last November, the Dutch newspaper Volkskrant released its own simulation game Refugee Republic, exploring the realities of life in a refugee camp.            \u201cWe\u2019re really starting to see momentum in this area now, and it\u2019s very exciting,\u201d says Tomas Rawlings, whose Bristol studio Auroch Digital has produced news games like NarcoGuerra and Endgame: Syria. \u201cI was pleased to the see The Guardian publishing a newsgame on immigration, plus BuzzFeed says they are going to be investing $50m into casual games \u2013 I hope we\u2019ll see some of that going into news games. The new rise in VR technology has also [led to] projects that try to bring a far-way conflict to life in front of you.\u201d   Related: The refugee challenge: can you break into Fortress Europe? - interactive    These are major endeavours though. Instead, inspiration for the future growth of the news game concept may well come from the game jam or hackday scene, where small teams compete to build playable prototypes over a weekend. They\u2019re rough, they\u2019re buggy, but they often provide the basis for interesting interactive experiences that can be iterated on later. Which is why we\u2019re running the experiment at Rezzed. There\u2019s already a burgeoning news game hack scene. Last year in Cologne, development studio The Good Evil ran Europe\u2019s first news game hackathon, where representatives from several major media companies, including the Guardian and Germany\u2019s Deutsche Welle and The Suddeutsche Zeitung, took part making small games based around topical issues.    Related: Newsgame hackathon: can we make a game with no coding experience?    In February, Dutch workshop and hackspace organiser Hackastory ran a similar event in Amsterdam, again drawing in major European media companies to produce quick news game concepts. The results included Be The President Today, which gives players in control of Azerbaijan and News Bricks which, like AJ+, reduces stories into separate searchable components which can be structured and unlocked by readers. \u201cThe internet, social media, mobile and wearable technology are changing the way we tell stories,\u201d says Hackastory co-founder Albertine Piels. \u201cDigital storytelling doesn\u2019t have a tradition yet compared to film making and newspapers, so we need to work together with different skills: developers, gamers and designers. We also believe in learning by making. We shouldn\u2019t talk as much about it, but just start doing it. In our accelerating world, we need to experiment more.\u201d According to Hackastory\u2019s Nienke Huitenga, it\u2019s likely interactive journalism will evolve to consist of two streams: fast, reactive games, and longer form experiences. \u201cWe like big, feature film-like stories like Serial, because we recognise them from other media like film, tv and radio,\u201d she says. \u201cTherefore we understand how to \u2018love it\u2019\u201d. Hackastory is already working on its next jam, with the Interactive Factual Lab in Leuven, Belgium, which runs from 2-3 May.

I wasn\u2019t sure what kind, but conducting was not something I even considered. Growing up in a small village on the east coast of Canada in the 70s and 80s, I thought women could only conduct choirs or, at best, school orchestras. I didn\u2019t know what sexism meant \u2013 that was just the way it was. Besides, I loved singing and soon realised this was to be my place.  I\u2019ve spent much of my career focusing on contemporary classical music, working with composers on new creations, and exploring the works of the 20th century. One of my favourite roles is Alban Berg\u2019s Lulu. For me, she is not a femme fatale, a sex kitten, or even the victim she\u2019s all too often played as. She\u2019s an endlessly fascinating, deliciously contradictory woman who might defy labels, but is always true to herself. Whether she wears high heels and a sexy red dress or gym clothes, she is comfortable in her own skin, right up until the end of the opera when, forced into prostitution, she orchestrates her own murder to escape a future she cannot bear. She\u2019s an enormously powerful woman. Incorporating her into my life had a huge impact on me. Turning 40 was painful for me. I had ideas about my worth and place as a performer \u2013 perhaps also outside performing \u2013 that were related to my age. I started to avoid myself in the mirror. I wanted to keep my age a secret. I spent way too much money on useless face creams. In part, it had to do with my shelf life as a singer. Many of us feel we have a best-before date stamped on our foreheads. Once we pass 50, voices, especially the higher lighter ones, lose elasticity, flexibility and beauty of tone. I was feeling the pressure of time.     \u2018Incorporating Lulu into my life had a huge impact\u2019. As Lulu at La Monnaie, Brussels. Photograph: PP Hofmann/.    But Lulu helped me grow older. I sang her at 41. She made me realise that I could never have been ready to sing her until exactly that age \u2013 my years of investment, experience, the 10-20,000 hours of practice really paid off. I had needed all that time. And because Lulu is so at home with herself, she encouraged me to be the same. Once the production was over, once I had survived the experience of becoming her, I kept those qualities and felt a different kind of confidence. As I neared my 40s, I had also started to conduct, and made my debut at the Ch\u00e2telet in Paris with Stravinsky\u2019s chamber opera Renard and Ligeti\u2019s Mysteries of the Macabre (which I sang and conducted). It was an overwhelming experience, a humbling realisation that the conductor is part servant, part leader and, most of the time, just trying to stay out the way. Offers to conduct and sing with major orchestras started to come. Simon Rattle asked me to perform William Walton\u2019s Fa\u00e7ade with him and members of the Berlin Philharmonic in 2012, splitting the conducting and narrator duties between us. Being a soprano is, of course, a women-only field. With conducting I was expanding into a field dominated by men. I didn\u2019t think of it like that though \u2013 it was simply something I needed to explore as a musician. But as time went on, I noticed that \u201cfemale\u201d was now attached to the \u201cconductor\u201d label, where it had never been attached to the singer label.            For Fa\u00e7ade, I wore something appropriate to the theatricality of the piece \u2013 a strapless evening gown. A friend commented on the expressivity of my arms, and it struck me that this was part of my strength as a conductor. When I\u2019d made my debut at the Ch\u00e2telet, I\u2019d worn a suit: many women conductors wear either gender-neutral outfits or something resembling a man\u2019s suit. I thought trousers and jacket were the \u201ccostume\u201d I had to put on. However, to cover my arms in a jacket might serve convention, but not the music \u2013 and I never wear suits in real life! Ever since, I\u2019ve worn a sleeveless dress to conduct. It\u2019s something I can move in that doesn\u2019t distract me or the orchestra \u2013 and it fits the music on the programme. I don\u2019t tie my hair back, either, because I never do unless I\u2019m having a bad hair day. I\u2019ve had nothing but positive feedback about this from orchestras and audiences. None find it a problem that I\u2019m not soberly clad in a dark suit. Critics do invariably always remark on my attire, though, which isn\u2019t something they regularly do with male conductors. Public discussion of gender issues is so loaded. Sticky. I even hesitate here and begin to censor myself. Vasily Petrenko, the conductor of the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic, and Bruno Mantovani, head of the Paris Conservatory, have set the bar high regarding the top 10 lame comments on women conductors; even my own teacher, Jorma Panula, made disparaging comments on TV a day or two a day or two before I was to conduct at the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam. Even though his comments weren\u2019t personal, I felt terribly hurt. We\u2019d been working intensely together on Stravinsky, Sch\u00f6enberg and Ligeti, and here he was criticising musicianship and skill based on gender, claiming that women should only conduct \u201cwomen\u2019s music\u201d, such as Debussy and Faur\u00e9. \u201cIt\u2019s not a problem,\u201d he said, \u201cif [women conductors] choose more feminine music. Bruckner or Stravinsky will not do, but Debussy is OK. This is purely an issue of biology.\u201d I wonder if he regrets what he said. We spoke about it the following day, but he didn\u2019t take it back, even though he must have known how much it hurt me and many other people, men and women alike. Some friends suggested maybe it was a \u201ctrick\u201d \u2013 that he said it to spur on women conductors who had studied with him. Who knows? Wishful thinking, probably. Whenever I was asked about the issue in interviews, I used to dismiss it. But as time has gone on, I realise it is important. Earlier this year, en route to a concert, I read in the New York Times that two free climbers in Yosemite had finally reached the top of the Dawn Wall. \u201cI hope [our achievement] inspires people to find their own Dawn Wall,\u201d said one. I went on stage that evening energised by that quote, and I\u2019ve carried it with me since: conducting has become my own not so secret Dawn Wall. Conducting is one of those few final frontiers in which there is a dearth of women. For me, though, the issue is much more complicated than a call of \u201cWe need more women conductors!\u201d It is musicianship, psychology and technical skill all bound together in a rare type of leadership that is elusive. It is neither male nor female. Convention has kept the field dominated by men. Convention and, of course, some everyday sexism \u2013 because before a woman gets on the podium, she needs to get into a conducting class at university, and before that even, she needs to see the career as a viable option, something I didn\u2019t as a child. A friend\u2019s young daughter saw me conducting on TV the other day, and said: \u201cMommy, I didn\u2019t know women were allowed to be conductors.\u201d \u2022 Barbara Hannigan conducts the Britten Sinfonia in Birmingham on 5 May, in London on 6 May, in Saffron Walden on 9 May and at the Brighton festival on 12 May.

Not only do I hugely admire Longinotto\u2019s work, such as the inspirational Sisters in Law: Stories from a Cameroon Court, I am also a big fan of the main protagonist in Dreamcatcher, Brenda Myers-Powell. Myers-Powell, a survivor of prostitution in Chicago, gives support and advocacy to other women in similar situations. One of the main aims of her project is to stop girls and women being coerced and abused into the sex trade, and to help those in prostitution to escape its clutches. And who knows better than Myers-Powell? Not only did she experience the horrors of prostitution for 24 years, she also was a researcher on a study of the prostitution of girls in the Chicago area and, with the same research team, on pimps. As well as that, she has direct contact with women from similar backgrounds and circumstances to herself on a regular basis. Those who view prostitution as inherently abusive, and a cause and consequence of women\u2019s oppression (as I do) wish to see an end to the global sex trade. We do not believe it is \u201cwork\u201d or \u201clabour\u201d, or see sex as a human right. Then there are the \u201csex workers\u2019 rights\u201d advocates, who believe that most women make a choice to sell sex and that state intervention should consist only of harm minimisation and protecting their rights to sell sex. Sex workers\u2019 rights advocates actively campaign against criminalising, or even deterring the sex buyers, and are against the types of exit programmes run by Myers-Powell because, it is argued, such programmes entice women out of the sex trade against their will, and that those running them are part of a \u201crescue industry\u201d that removes their \u201cagency\u201d and right to choose to be involved in sex work. So who is right? I was part of the research team on the largest UK-based study on exiting prostitution. It was based on in-depth interviews with 114 women who were or had been involved in street, brothel and escort prostitution, as well as other experts in the field. As with various studies on women in prostitution, it was clear from our interviewees that the vast majority are desperate to get out of the sex trade, but find a number of significant barriers that prevent them doing so. Some of the women told us they had never even been asked by support workers in health-funded harm-reduction projects whether or not they wished to exit \u2013 rather they were supplied with a cup of tea, condoms and a friendly chat. One paper published in 2011, written by a number of academics who take the sex workers\u2019 rights approach, quoted a worker from a harm reduction service who argued that promoting exiting was moralistic and an \u201caffront to human dignity\u201d. Some have spoken of \u201cforced exiting\u201d, as though assisting women out of an abusive trade is the human rights violation, rather than the prostitution. While survivors such as Myers-Powell argue that the buyers should be made accountable, and the pimps arrested, the sex workers\u2019 rights campaigners claim that legalisation, or its close relative decriminalisation, is the best way to keep women safe. But there is a growing mountain of evidence that suggests the opposite. Take the mega-brothel named Paradise in Stuttgart, Germany. In a recent documentary about Paradise, the women spoke of violent punters, and of the physical pain of being penetrated several times a day by men to whom they are not sexually attracted. I have visited legal brothels in Amsterdam, Nevada and Berlin, and they are appalling places. The women are simply a commodity, and the pimps and buyers legitimised as customers and managers. There is sound evidence that legalisation makes trafficking worse, and that it has a negative effect on gender equality. Many survivor organisations, such as Space International argue that women are worse off under legalisation, and that the only solution is to assist women out of the sex trade, criminalise the buyers in order to send the message that the men, not the women, are the problem, and ultimately shut down the international sex industry. It will be interesting to see how the debate after Dreamcatcher goes. I am sure we will all agree that whatever else happens legislatively, those selling sex should never be criminalised. But beyond that, who knows? It is unlikely that there will be a person in the room without a strong opinion. Let\u2019s hope we are all able to listen and learn. A Guardian Live screening of Dreamcatcher will take place at the Rio Cinema in Dalston, London on 22 March. The film will be followed by a Q&amp;A with Julie Bindel, Kim Longinotto and, via Skype, Brenda Myers-Powell.

Chaffetz and Cummings suggested such incidents were signs of a \u201cbroader cultural problem\u201d in the service. Last year an independent panel found the service was \u201cstarved for leadership\u201d and a separate report found one in 10 agents are aware of colleagues who drink to the point of becoming \u201ca security concern\u201d.  Spokesman Robert Hoback told the Guardian that secret service director Joseph Clancy had asked the inspector general of the Department of Homeland Security to investigate the alleged 4 March incident. Officials made no public statement about the case until more than a week after it allegedly occurred, after it had been reported by the press. \u201cIf misconduct is identified, appropriate action will be taken based on established rules and regulations,\u201d Hoback said in a statement. The agency said the two agents \u2013 who unnamed officials have named to news outlets as Mark Connolly and George Ogilvie, respectively the second-in-command of the president\u2019s security detail and a senior supervisor in Washington \u2013 had been reassigned to \u201cnon-supervisory, non-operational\u201d duties but not placed on administrative leave. Clancy has begun reforms of the service, including firing several senior officials last year. But Chaffetz and Cummings said: \u201cThis incident begs the question of whether that is enough.\u201d  Chaffetz told CNN he had heard the agents were \u201cpartying in Georgetown\u201d and officials have told the New York Times they were celebrating the retirement of a colleague at a Washington bar. \u201cDrinking on the job isn\u2019t good at McDonald\u2019s and it certainly isn\u2019t good if you work for the secret service,\u201d Chaffetz said. Chaffetz also spoke on NBC, noting allegations that a senior secret service official overruled agents who wanted to administer sobriety tests and make arrests on the spot.  \u201cIf somebody was indeed suspected of being under the influence,\u201d he said, \u201cthat should have been dealt with right there on the spot, and I\u2019m concerned that it wasn\u2019t.\u201d \u201cThis is supposed to be our elite service, and they cannot ever make these kinds of mistakes,\u201d he added. In February, Barack Obama named Clancy, a 27-year veteran of the secret service, as its new permanent director, after he served as interim chief to oversee reforms. A DHS report had found systemic problems within the agency, and encouraged the president to appoint an outsider. Last year, three agents were sent back to the US from a trip to Amsterdam, after having fallen drunkenly asleep in a hotel hallway. Also last year, the service was lambasted for allowing a man with a knife to enter the White House after scaling the perimeter fence and sprinting across the lawn.  In 2012, after being caught drinking and consorting with prostitutes in Cartagena, Colombia, in the days before Obama arrived in the city, nearly all of a dozen agents involved were dismissed from the service.  According to the Washington Post, which first reported the latest incident, at about 10.30pm on 4 March, Connolly and Ogilvie drove up to a White House that had been taped off due to to investigation of a suspicious package. Barred from passing through the tape, despite showing their badges, the agents drove their car with lights flashing through the tape, hitting temporary barricades behind it. A supervisor then overruled officers on the scene who wanted to arrest the agents, according to an official cited by the Post, telling them to let the agents go home.

They get restored, are preserved in perfect environments by conscientious museums, and yet there is still no way to freeze a masterpiece for ever. Even the comparatively recent paintings of Vincent van Gogh were reported this week to be losing their original colour. Here are five works of art that have seen better days. Van Gogh, Sunflowers (1888) Van Gogh\u2019s use of red lead is causing his paintings to grow dull, reports say. I suspect that few people look at Van Gogh\u2019s gold and earthen sunflowers and think them colourless, however. The truth is that the artist\u2019s techniques have been studied in unusual depth by the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. His art is not more at risk than most paintings \u2013 we just know more about its chemical structure. That kind of knowledge is always distressing, like knowing your own medical statistics.   Damien Hirst, The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living (1991) If the supposed deterioration of Van Gogh\u2019s art is invisible to the naked eye, the flabby white wrinkled decay of the tiger shark Damien Hirst pickled to create his most famous work is impossible to ignore. Hirst seems to have overestimated the preserving power of formaldehyde. When his toothy vitrine was first revealed at the Saatchi Gallery almost a quarter of a century ago, the perfectly preserved shark created a menacing illusion. Today, it is a lumpen relic, a curiosity, a very dead shark.     Damien Hirst with The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living.

Now an alliance of eight Mexican media outlets and civil society groups is courting potential whistleblowers with a new digital platform that promises to protect the anonymity of sources with the help of sophisticated encryption software. Mexicoleaks describes its mission as the construction of a \u201cTransparent Mexico\u201d, and participants say they hope it will help them document political corruption, human rights abuses and other misuses of institutional and economic power. \u201cIt is a tool we hope will facilitate independent journalism that is critical of institutional and de facto powers,\u201d said Homero Campa of the leading investigative weekly magazine Proceso. \u201cLots of sources are frightened of reprisals.\u201d Campa said that within a day of the website\u2019s launch on 10 March, his magazine had received 10 tips, which were waiting to be evaluated with the help of a code of ethics designed to ensure only information that is in the public interest is used, and any investigations triggered are carried out with particular rigour. But the launch of Mexicoleaks has already highlighted the daily challenges facing even the country\u2019s most high-profile journalists. Leading radio presenter Carmen Aristegui, whose reporting team has helped expose a string of alleged abuses of power, was fired from her morning news show on Sunday after executives from the MVS radio station objected to her team\u2019s participation in the Mexicoleaks alliance without its authorisation. The project began as an initiative of the Amsterdam-based group Free Press Unlimited. It relies on software provided by a group called Global Leaks that is partially based on Tor encryption technology, and promises that uploaded information cannot be traced back to its source, even by participants in the alliance. Albana Shala, of Free Press Unlimited, says the Mexican members of the project have received training in how to avoid inadvertent revelations that could lead to the identification of contributors, once they have the information in their possession. The project also urges sources not to make themselves vulnerable by, for example, using a computer that can be traced to them in any investigation launched to identify where leaks originated, or making an indiscreet comment to a colleague or friend. \u201cThe system might be foolproof, but people are not,\u201d Shala said. \u201cWhat is at risk is the life and trust of the whistleblower.\u201d It is not only sources who are potentially at risk: the Committee to Protect Journalists has documented the murder of at least 25 journalists and the disappearance of 13 since 2000. The death toll is closer to 100 if laxer criteria are used that do not require confirmation that the journalists were targeted because of their work. Luc\u00eda Vergara, of the press freedom group Article 19, said that the number of murders has reduced in recent years. But, she added, other kinds of attacks such as threats and harassment have grown dramatically to reach a total of 326 in 2014.   Related: Twitter feeds and blogs tell hidden story of Mexico's drug wars    \u201cThis means the zones of silence are growing,\u201d said Vergara, referring to the areas of the country where local media regularly self-censor. \u201cIt means people are increasingly turning to anonymous posts on websites.\u201d But even these are not always secure. In late 2011, the Anonymous hacker collective posted a YouTube video threatening to release hacked information about taxi drivers, police officers and journalists working for the Zetas cartel, unless a kidnapped hacker was released. Within days, Anonymous called off the project \u2013 dubbed #OpCartel \u2013 out of concerns that it could result in the murder of any participants. The aborted operation came shortly after the dismembered body of journalist Elizabeth Mac\u00edas was dumped in the state of Tamaulipas, where local media long ago stopped publishing even basic information about shootouts for fear of reprisals. A message left with her body said she had been killed for social media posts she had made under an assumed name. The newspaper where she worked as an editor did not report her death. Three years laters, in the same state, gunmen kidnapped Rosario Fuentes, a doctor and citizen journalist who contributed to a local blog warning of cartel activity. Hours later, photographs of what appeared to Fuentes\u2019s dead body were posted on her own Twitter account.  Though Mexico\u2019s many brutal drug gangs are regularly blamed for the terror that muzzles traditional and citizen journalism in many parts of Mexico, Article 19 says that organised crime has only been directly involved in around 10% of all the attacks on journalists. Public officials, meanwhile, account for about 40%. The national organisations involved in Mexicoleaks are less vulnerable to physical attacks than journalists in the provinces, but they can still come under intense pressure apparently designed to curb criticism of entrenched interests. That kind of pressure was illustrated last Thursday, two days after the Mexicoleaks launch, when MVS Radio fired two reporters from the popular morning news show presented by Aristegui. The station said the inclusion of MVS\u2019s name within Mexicoleaks without express authorisation was \u201can affront and an offence\u201d. Arestegui has won large audiences thanks to her dogged interview style, critical monologues and a string of high-profile investigations, including the revelation that a favoured government contractor had paid for a multimillion-dollar modernist white mansion that was built to measure for the family of President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto.  The \u201cwhite house scandal\u201d remains unresolved, feeding a deep credibility crisis neither the president nor the government appear willing to seriously address. The use of an apparently minor violation of trademark protocol to launch an attack on Aristegui\u2019s team prompted a protest outside the station\u2019s offices denouncing censorship on Thursday night. It also triggered an online petition that obtained over 100,000 signatures by the time Aristegui described the situation as \u201ca battle for our freedom\u201d during her show on Friday. MVS responded by firing Aristegui herself on Sunday, in a move described by the station\u2019s ombudsman as \u201ca sad night for journalism\u201d. By Monday morning, the hashtag #IndefenceofAristegui was within the top worldwide trending topics.

The building is scheduled to be converted into a luxury hotel and spa complex as part of an international chain of private members\u2019 clubs called Soho House. Only 11 days earlier dozens of students had occupied the Bungehuis in response to a programme of sweeping changes that the university\u2019s administration was apparently unwilling to discuss.  The students\u2019 demands for a \u201cnew university\u201d included greater democratisation of university governance, greater transparency of the university\u2019s finances, halting plans to restructure and cut a number of departments, a referendum on plans for departmental mergers with other universities, better conditions and protections for temporary staff, and an end to risky financial and property speculation with university funds. The pretext for the cuts and structural changes being opposed is an unprecedented crisis in the university\u2019s finances \u2013 including a deficit rumoured to be up to \u20ac12m or \u20ac13m, according to an internal letter sent by a professor.      David Graeber speaking to students occupying the Maagdenhuis, the University of Amsterdam\u2019s main administrative building. Photograph: Guido van Nispen    The university board of directors responded to the Bungehuis protest by initiating a lawsuit against the occupying student seeking a fine of \u20ac100,000 per student per day. This prompted an open letter from hundreds of academic staff and a petition signed by over 7,000 people \u2013 including internationally renowned scholars such as Judith Butler, Noam Chomsky, David Graeber, David Harvey, Axel Honneth and Saskia Sassen. The scholars urged the board to reconsider their legal and financial threats and expressed sympathy for the students\u2019 demands for democratic accountability and their challenge to the \u201congoing financialisation and managerialism that is increasingly coming to dominate academic life\u201d. The day after the police successfully evicted several dozen protesters from the Bungehuis, a mass rally of students took place in the heart of Amsterdam, challenging the university board\u2019s assertion that it was only small and unrepresentative minority of the student population who opposed the plans.  The rally culminated in the reappropriation of the Maagdenhuis, the university\u2019s main administrative building, which is still occupied now. In a live televised discussion with Amsterdam\u2019s mayor Eberhard van der Laan on the evening of the occupation, students urged him to use his influence to ask the university board to take concrete steps to listen to them. They called to increase the transparency and accountability of the university decision-making processes and to pause and reconsider their programme of restructuring, cuts and sell-offs.  The mayor, however, failed to convince them to vacate the premises. Public support for the protest and the nascent new university movement appears to be high. The Dutch education minister says the protesters \u201chave a point\u201d. National newspapers and broadcasters across the political spectrum have given them sympathetic columns and coverage. Numerous political parties and trade unions have expressed their support. City residents and local organisations have contributed food and blankets for those who are remaining in the building overnight.  No doubt part of the reason the occupation is eliciting such a widespread positive response is due to the lasting memory of student protests in the same building in 1969, which led to legislative changes giving students and staff a much greater say in how their universities were run. Professor Rob Hagendijk, a social scientist who recently retired from the University of Amsterdam, argued that there are many parallels between protests in the 1960s and today:   The year before the occupation in 1969 there were several reports about the reform of universities, arguing that they should follow a more business-like model with stronger centralised management and that universities should be more functionalised for the economy. If you look at universities now, all of these years later, you can see that this way of structuring universities has effectively been introduced. At the time these reports came out the students were very concerned and demanded greater democratisation and participation for the students in decision-making in the university as a counter to the plans the government had.  Student protests in Amsterdam and other Dutch universities in 1969 gave rise to the 1970 University Governance Reorganisation Act which established a much stronger level of student and staff representation in university governance as well as greater democratic oversight and control of university finances.  In Hagendijk\u2019s view these democratic safeguards helped to stave off some of the excesses of new public management style reforms driven by increasing efficiency, marketisation and stronger top-down management until the mid-1990s, when the Act was scrapped.     The new university movement looks like it could become a national phenomenon in the Netherlands    He suggests that part of the reason the current student protests are gaining traction more broadly in Dutch society is because they are rejecting and calling for alternatives to market-orientated managerial changes that have taken hold in many areas of life and work, including in hospitals, housing corporations, schools and colleges. While the University of Amsterdam\u2019s protesters\u2019 demands are far from being met, last week the executive board issued a list of \u201c10 starting points\u201d on transparency and democratisation which is being cautiously welcomed as a \u201cU-turn\u201d by university staff. The protesters are now preparing for \u201ca battle over detail\u201d to ensure that their biggest concerns are not eclipsed in forthcoming negotiations. The new university movement looks like it could become a national phenomenon in the Netherlands. The energy and momentum of the Amsterdam protests has provided inspiration for similar groups being established in Delft, Groningen, Leiden, Nijmegen, Rotterdam, Tilburg and Utrecht.  Students, teachers and university researchers across the country are expressing support for the protests and discussing ways to challenge the kinds of market-driven reforms that have been so aggressively pursued in the UK \u2013 and to develop alternative visions for the role of universities in society.  One newspaper argued that the occupation reflects \u201cthe great ideological struggle of our time\u201d. Another columnist wrote that the protests could represent \u201can important turning point\u201d leading to a break with \u201cprotracted political apathy and democratic fatigue\u201d. In the coming days the protestors need all of the international support they can muster as negotiations continue.

Born in London to Anglo-Italian parents and a British citizen, Finaldi is no stranger to the London institution and its workings \u2013 he was a curator between 1992 and 2002 responsible for the later Italian paintings and the Spanish collection. Finaldi said: \u201cI feel deeply honoured to take on the directorship of the National Gallery after Nicholas Penny. This is a world-class collection in a world-class city and I eagerly look forward to working with trustees and the staff to strengthen the gallery\u2019s bond with the public and its international standing. \u201cI also look forward to developing an exciting exhibition programme and the gallery\u2019s research and educational activities.\u201d The 49-year-old art historian narrowly missed out on the job when Penny was appointed in 2008.  This time, he has been the firm favourite and joins a gallery in mixed health with, on the positive side, a well-regarded exhibition programme \u2013 not least its current and hugely popular Inventing Impressionism show. There are problems to tackle, however, including the industrial dispute with workers and members of the Public and Commercial Services union, who were on strike again last weekend over plans to privatise its visitor services. The gallery hopes that the dispute will be settled by the time Penny leaves although there is no sign yet of a breakthrough. Five more days of strikes are planned between 24 and 28 March. The Guardian last week published a letter signed by union leaders as well as artist Bob and Roberta Smith and filmmaker Ken Loach calling on the gallery\u2019s trustees to rethink its proposals to outsource two thirds of its workforce. Finaldi has been instrumental in modernising the Prado during his tenure \u2013 which included the opening of the Prado extension in 2007 and the Prado Research Centre in 2008 \u2013 and may face similar challenges in London. His appointment was confirmed by the prime minister, David Cameron. He was chosen from an international shortlist that included Axel R\u00fcger, the German-born director of the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam; Dutchman Taco Dibbits, director of collections at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam; Emilie Gordenker, a Dutch-American in charge of the Mauritshuis in The Hague; and Luke Syson, a Briton, curator of European sculpture and decorative arts at the Met in New York. Finaldi\u2019s boss in Madrid, director of the Prado Miguel Zugaza, said: \u201cGabriele Finaldi has contributed decisively to the modernisation of the Museo del Prado in the last decade, most significantly in positioning the museum internationally and developing its conservation and research roles. \u201cAt the Prado we hope that his presence in London will give a new impulse to the highly positive collaboration already established between our museum and the gallery under the leadership of our esteemed friend and colleague, Nicholas Penny.\u201d Finaldi studied art history in London at Dulwich College and the Courtauld Institute of Art, where his doctoral research focused on the 17th-century painter Jusepe de Ribera. He recently curated an exhibition on Murillo that went on display at the Prado, in Seville and at the Dulwich Picture Gallery, but is best remembered at the National Gallery for the 1997 show he curated, Discovering the Italian Baroque: The Denis Mahon Collection. Finaldi will be joined by a new chair of trustees at the gallery with Hannah Rothschild taking over from Mark Getty, also in August.  Getty said he was delighted that Finaldi was joining. \u201cIn addition to his scholarship, particularly in Italian and Spanish painting, Dr Finaldi has been responsible for internationally acclaimed exhibitions and publications. \u201cAs co-director of the Prado he has been responsible for a range of successful and complex projects and he will bring considerable experience to the gallery.\u201d", "sentences": ["He was chosen from an international shortlist that included Axel R\u00fcger, the German-born director of the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam; Dutchman Taco Dibbits, director of collections at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam; Emilie Gordenker, a Dutch-American in charge of the Mauritshuis in The Hague; and Luke Syson, a Briton, curator of European sculpture and decorative arts at the Met in New York."], "title": "National Gallery in London picks Prado deputy chief as new director", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/18/national-gallery-in-london-picks-prado-deputy-chief-as-new-director", "tags": ["National Gallery", "Art", "Art and design", "Heritage", "Culture", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-03-18T16:15:57Z", "article": " Eurotunnel has announced bumper profits and vowed to emerge stronger from its forced exit from the ferries business, warning that passengers would defect from cross-Channel competitors as green legislation and reduced competition drove up ferry fares. Group revenues jumped 7% to \u20ac1.2bn and operating profits were up 11% to \u20ac334m on the back of increasing volumes of traffic though the tunnel during the peak seasons.  The group, whose core business is the Channel tunnel fixed link and its shuttle services, was ordered by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) to sell or stop operating MyFerryLink by summer.  Eurotunnel said travellers could face more problems in the summer if there was no quick sale of MyFerryLink. Under the competition watchdog\u2019s ruling, the ferry services, which account for 10% of the cross-Channel market, must end on 9 July if Eurotunnel cannot find a buyer. Jacques Gounon, Eurotunnel chief executive, described the peak-season deadline as a \u201cquite a joke\u201d. \u201cEven if we identify a purchaser for the business, it needs clearance from the CMA. If you have three ships less during the summer, it\u2019s going to be very difficult; you\u2019ll see the impact of the CMA decision.\u201d      Jacques Gounon of Eurotunnel described the authority\u2019s deadline as \u2018quite a joke\u2019. Photograph: Graham Turner    He said there had been four expressions of interest. Eurotunnel hopes to net \u20ac120m-\u20ac150m from the sale of the business it developed over the past four years with ferries bought from the defunct SeaFrance. Gounon admitted profits were liable to dip this year with the loss of MyFerryLink but forecast renewed success by 2016. Eurotunnel believes its premium service will become increasingly attractive as ferry companies are forced to push up fares to meet the cost of new regulations on fuel. Environmental directives require Channel ferries to reduce sulphur emissions through investing in additional technology or switching to more expensive fuel.  The group said its outlook was positive given the strength of the pound \u2013 85% of passengers in the tunnel are British, while the majority of freight traffic is for UK imports. Eurotunnel is buying extra freight shuttles to meet increased demand, with 20% more capacity for lorries in the next two years. It will be boosted by increasing revenues from Eurostar, its major customer, which carried 10.4 million passengers in 2014 and plans to expand significantly this year with new, longer trains adding capacity in the tunnel.  Eurostar will also launch direct London-Amsterdam rail services, where it hopes to gain a 30% share of one of Europe\u2019s busiest air routes. Gounon said the British government\u2019s sale of its Eurostar stake underlined the tunnel\u2019s importance: \u201cIt shows the transmanche [cross-Channel] has real value.\u201d  Eurotunnel claimed its confidence was underscored by the announcement of a planned 20% higher dividend to shareholders.  Meanwhile, the tunnel operator reiterated warnings that exit passport checks to be introduced by the Home Office over the Easter holidays could cause massive disruption at ports, and tailbacks on the roads around Kent, as well as costing business if vehicles were not able to access shuttle trains on time for departures.  Gounon said he supported the principle behind the move, but wanted the government to help Eurotunnel use technology to speed the process. \u201cWe want the government to embrace the proposition of faster borders, using smartphones and trusted-travellers programmes.\u201c", "sentences": ["Eurostar will also launch direct London-Amsterdam rail services, where it hopes to gain a 30% share of one of Europe\u2019s busiest air routes."], "title": "Eurotunnel warns ferries business will suffer after its forced exit", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/mar/18/eurotunnel-warns-ferries-business-will-suffer-after-its-forced-exit", "tags": ["Ferry travel", "Channel Tunnel", "Competition and Markets Authority", "Business", "Regulators", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-03-18T23:22:06Z", "article": "A university rugby team travelling to play a match in Amsterdam were banned from travelling back on the same ferry route after one team member allegedly urinated over a table where a family were eating dinner.

A monstrous birdman clutches a bunch of bloodied and shrivelled heads, which dangle from his fist like a cluster of screaming mandrakes. Such are the surreal and provocative scenes in the sepia-hued Polaroids by Iranian photographer Kaveh Golestan, who entitled these collages Az Div o Dad (Of Beast and Wild, quoted from the classical Persian poetry of Rumi). Golestan \u2013 a figure who lived and died by his photojournalism, killed in 2003 while documenting the Iraq war for the BBC - created this innovative series in 1976 by moving collaged fragments in front of an open shutter under long exposure. The images are experimental visions of modern and later Qajar-era (c.1844-1925) photography spliced with the tails and heads of wild animals and the curved flesh of nude figures.

Golestan\u2019s photographs are just some of the unique discoveries that have emerged from Mahlouji\u2019s digging, and they, along with other endangered or forgotten material from the 1960s and \u201870s, are being edited back into Iranian reality through a series of international exhibitions.     Polaroids by Kaveh Golestan Photograph: Kaveh Golestan/Courtesy of Vali Mahlouji    Originally trained as an archaeologist, Mahlouji now unearths photographs and documents as the skeletons of Iran\u2019s unresolved cultural past. \u201cThe project works in two dimensions, which its name reflects\u201d he explains from his London archive. \u201cFirstly, the downward delving into the past, [which is] akin to archaeological practice. After diving vertically across a timescale into the origins of these things, you work horizontally into the context of the material.\u201d His efforts unearth pertinent, and sometimes uncomfortable, issues of memory, history and reintegration. Mahlouji aims to raise awareness of these materials and revisit the events from which they emanated, which were often controversial in their own time.  \u2018Prostitute\u2019  The first two phases of the project shed light on Golestan\u2019s photographs and videos of 1970s prostitutes from Tehran\u2019s now obsolete red light district Shahr-e No (New City) and delved into the extant memorabilia from the Shiraz-Persepolis Festival of the Arts, a pioneering international arts event which took place across both Iranian cities from 1967 to 1977. This initial iteration of Archaeology of the Final Decade, centering on the artistic and intellectual milieu of the final decade before the 1979 Iranian Revolution, was previously exhibited in its own dedicated show space within the recent Iran: Unedited History 1960-2014. Prior to that, for the first time since 1978, Golestan\u2019s \u201cProstitute\u201d photographs were exhibited at the Foam Photography Museum in Amsterdam in March 2014.     Kaveh Golestan \u2018Prostitute\u2019 series  Photograph: Kaveh Golestan/Courtesy of Vali Mahlouji    The various materials for each chapter of Archaeology of the Final Decade arrived in London in disparate batches and in poor states of conservation. Having painstakingly restored them, now with utmost care, Mahlouji slides the photographs out from their makeshift protection. Golestan\u2019s oeuvre, including both Polaroid and Prostitute series, had been residing in an archive in Iran until the late photographer\u2019s widow Hagemeh entrusted the images and their care to Mahlouji. The documents from Shiraz-Persepolis were sourced from those who had visited and performed there. Although the exhibition of Golestan\u2019s work and, likewise, the memorabilia of the Shiraz-Persepolis Festival via the project is a labour of love, the curator believes that the rightful home of this material should be in an Iranian national collection, such as the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, such is its importance to Iran\u2019s cultural memory.  For Archaeology of the Final Decade to show at Art Dubai is in itself a novelty, by introducing a non-profit project within an event that is a frenetic hub of international monetary exchange around art. The Polaroids have been allocated a non-commercial exhibition space within the fair\u2019s Dubai Modern section. It is also a first for the Middle East, as Mahlouji points out: \u201cCan you think of another Middle Eastern artist who used Polaroid as a medium?\u201d It is indeed a rogue choice of format for a photojournalist, but is also unmatched by any other Iranian artist. And that medium itself is quickly becoming obsolete as Polaroid ceased film production in 2008, making these photographs even more of a treasure in a body of work which already holds the weight of Iran\u2019s forgotten decades.  The new station at Art Dubai is also symptomatic of an increasing interest in Golestan from the global art world since Mahlouji began exposing the works. Mahlouji speculates that there is perhaps a wish by gallerists to claim Golestan posthumously away from his long held status as a photojournalist, and these fantasy collages provide a compelling case of departure from his stark documentary work. Indeed, in creating these hybrid Polaroids, Golestan was working very self-consciously as an artist, in a manner very different to the unflinching investigative style in which he captured life in the citadel of Shahr-e No in his Prostitute series of 1975-77, the years that bracket this experimental flourish.  With his Polaroid images, Golestan had condensed his new surrealist vision into the dimensions of Type 600 film. However makeshift and small, the images are intensely compelling: quixotic flights of fancy from the hands of a man who gave his life to a self-confessed mission of uncovering what he termed the \u201cunstoppable truth\u201d in his documentary photographs. Despite Art Dubai\u2019s reputation as an international art platform, showing the Polaroids there was not without its own controversy. Any image showing nudity was unable to be exhibited. As many of the Az Div o Dad images feature nudes, perhaps areas of the Middle East\u2019s commercial art world so eager to claim Golestan are not as ready for his vision as they had anticipated. And so, Golestan remains a fascinating figure, straddling the realms of the professional and the provocative in his public work as a photojournalist and his personal experiments as an artist. There is also an opportunity to view Golestan\u2019s more sobering, but equally pioneering, documentary photography of Tehran\u2019s underbelly in London this May. Mahlouji looks through a slideshow of the history of the citadel of Shahr-e No and the black and white originals of Golestan\u2019s Prostitute series that will be on show at the Photo London Fair.  He stops at an early photograph before the erection of the citadel wall in 1953, a structure that simultaneously confined and defined the area as an inner-city ghetto. The photograph shows two women, one topless, having a chat over cigarette with a male companion in full view of the street. Golestan composed his portraits of the city\u2019s sex workers between 1975 and 1977. \u201cYou have to remember that Golestan was a young man around 25 or 26 when he visited. I feel that, not being coy here, his drive to penetrate the space was very multi-layered,\u201d Mahlouji says. \u201cMany visitors to Shahr-e No went there in search of good times and absolutely loved it,\u201d he continues, \u201cOf course it is romanticised. Golestan\u2019s drive is quite different. His belongs to an intellectual determination that strove to expose the marginalised characters and to motivate democratic civic action. I think the key is that the emancipation of women in the 60s created a major shift in relation to the phenomenon, which is so sensitively reflected here in the portraits by Golestan.\u201d      Kaveh Golestan \u2018Prostitute\u2019 series Photograph: Kaveh Golestan/Courtesy of Vali Mahlouji    The area of Shahr-e No was not just made up of brothels, but was an entire environ which catered to a lower-middle class clientele as a microcosm of urban existence. There were cabarets and bars located inside and backing into its perimeter wall. It was burnt down by fire in 1979 just two weeks before the victory of the revolution, and the destruction took a whole segment of popular culture with it. The matter of its downfall speaks to a collective amnesia about certain events in Iran\u2019s past that troubles Mahlouji. Golestan\u2019s photographs are a rare and honest testament to the human lives and social spaces that have since vanished, he says. The same match burnt down Tehran\u2019s Gomrok district beer factories, liquor stores and popular cabarets also claimed the Citadel: \u201cThe space was a weak link. Not many people would stand up for a red-light district, and in that sense it was easy prey. Shahr-e No can be seen to be a furnace where the post-revolutionary cultural re-orderings in Iran began.\u201d He points to a newspaper article published the day after the blaze. The headline mentions the west and southwest of Tehran being consumed by flames. \u201cIranians haven\u2019t really had time to reassess these moments,\u201d he says.  A Utopian Stage     Shiraz-Persepolis Festival of the Arts Photograph: Courtesy of Vali Mahlouji    It is this drive for cognitive reassessment and material reintegration that propels Mahlouji to decide on the subjects for his research. Aside from the archive of Golestan, a second thread of Archaeology of the Final Decade has brought to light unseen documents from the decade long Shiraz-Persepolis Festival of Arts (1967-1977). The dramatic black and white snapshots of dancers and actors preforming amongst the ancient ruins of Persepolis and in the streets of Shiraz show a cosmopolitan atmosphere of cultural efflorescence contemporary with, but worlds away from, the marginalised desolation of the capital\u2019s red-light ghettos captured by Golestan. In a restaging of the material evidence at London\u2019s Whitechapel Gallery this spring entitled \u201cA Utopian Stage\u201d, Mahlouji has not only created access to scarce images and paraphernalia of the event, but has also taken to task misconceptions and mythologies surrounding the festival itself and its original curatorial vision. Mahlouji is also writing his book Perspectives on The Festival of Arts, Shiraz-Persepolis with Black Dog Publishing due later this year.     Shiraz-Persepolis Festival of the Arts    Like the case of Shahr-e No, the official ban on the materials left over from Shiraz-Persepolis has exaggerated a cultural amnesia. The painstakingly reassembled archives show that performance art offerings from indigenous \u201cthird world\u201d cultures from Africa and Asia combined with commissions from the Western European avant-garde created a cultural festival with a sophisticated and multinational curatorial vision. \u201cThe event itself is symptomatic of, as well as, a response to the universal moment that was taking place,\u201d says Mahlouji, \u201cthe Cold War, Vietnam, decolonisation\u2026 this was also the time of avant-garde developments on both sides of the Iron Curtain\u201d. Contemporary Iranian performance art was exposed to, and no doubt benefited from, this intercultural contact. Mahlouji believes the aim of the festival was to foster an introspective criticality about Iran\u2019s own cultural position in the world. When asked what he thinks is most pertinent in terms of his research into the Festival as a part of his project: \u201cPerhaps the universalism that the event proposed is its most important legacy and is indeed worth revisiting. It unified cultures not under a single globlised model but in finding common roots across differences. It also equalised cultures across the colonial juncture. No wonder the avant-gardists flocked there,\u201d he replies.      Shiraz-Persepolis Festival of the Arts Photograph: Courtesy of Vali Mahlouji    In terms of the project\u2019s next steps, there are larger plans to digitise the archives in their entirety. \u201cIt is important that this material is kept alive for education, posterity and history,\u201d Mahlouji concludes. Each third of Archaeology of the Final Decade is composed of the rare and compelling evidence of the cultural activity of Iran\u2019s \u201clost decade\u201d: the country\u2019s international arts festival, its capital\u2019s citadel of sin and the risqu\u00e9 experiments of one of its finest documentary photographers. Mahlouji has met many Iranians who are completely unaware of these events, spaces and images, and through his exhibitions and publications he has made it his prerogative to bring them back into both public discussion and collective memory.

Early bloggers, like Kathryn Finney of The Budget Fashionista, helped get the less headline-grabbing bits of fashion weeks in front of those who were keen to read about them.  As these forward-thinking followers became the new voice of the fashion week, brands started to experiment with the new digital culture. Fast forward to 2015 and the fashion world is something of a pin-up for how an entire sector can embrace the breadth of opportunity that digital can provide. Burberry and Topshop, two well-known British brands, are two notable supporters. The former was the first luxury brand to live stream a catwalk show to a global, public audience, and has since been recognised as a global leader when it comes to sensibly embracing technology and innovation. The latter recently combined Twitter and real-time outdoor advertising to transport trends from the catwalk to the digital shop floor quicker than you can tap 140 characters. In such a way as technology now allows, we sat back and enjoyed this February\u2019s London Fashion Week and the stories that surrounded it from afar, observing lessons that any brand or business worth its weight in cashmere can learn from. It\u2019s good to dream big With Google Glass alive and well, Apple Watches on the way and Yeezy delivering for adidas, 2015 is reiterating that it can pay to dream big in fashion, and this certainly seemed the case at fashion week. From the models to the live streams, the \u201calmost breaking of the internet\u201d by Burberry, the Charli Cohen shoppable catwalk, the TopShop \u201cVine\u201d booth and the other side of fashion week, the LFW catwalk and its surroundings was as always a realisation of big dreams.   Related: London fashion week: the eight shows that mattered    Never be satisfied Rather than designing for the future, Donatella Versace prefers to reshape the here and now in every new collection, using the phrase \u201cVersace of today\u201d as a way of introducing each new collection. \u201cThe Versace\u201d of AW15 leans heavily on popular digital culture with \u201cat\u201d (@) signs sequined into couture dresses and logos reinvented as emojis. It could be argued that Versace has perhaps commoditised digital culture into couture, nevertheless it\u2019s refreshing to see an experienced fashion institution humorously playing with technology alongside the pop culture of the moment. Embrace speed Whether it\u2019s hashtags or look-see sample leaks, technology shows no signs of slowing down the fashion industry. So it should be no surprise that \u201cblink and you\u2019ve missed it\u201d service Snapchat was the prized tool of many bloggers at this year\u2019s London Fashion Week. The quick snippets of ephemeral content you can publish via Snapchat are seemingly the perfect match for an event that\u2019s heavily reliant on snippets of information and a bit of scarcity. Being thoughtful works Burberry has long been delivering you a catwalk show experience, wherever you may be. This year it decided to offer up simple, one-of-a-kind pictures to anyone who tweeted with it live during their catwalk show. This was a sizeable effort seeking to give a little something back to a large group of people. Try not to be contrived One of the overwhelming observations from this year\u2019s fashion week was the amount of unfiltered fun being shared by everyone in attendance \u2013 most notably the models. The Cara Delevignes and Alexa Chungs of the world are refreshingly open and transparent when it comes to sharing their adventures on the internet. Although brands need to be wary about behaving like \u201cpeople\u201d, many of the models of fashion week demonstrate that the unedited version of what you are can be a powerful thing. It\u2019s not all about the main event New York City street photographer Bill Cunningham once said: \u201cThe best fashion show is on the street. Always has been, always will be.\u201d This thought was very relevant at fashion week; through the technology that people carry around with them every day, anyone with a passing interest in fashion week \u2013 or anyone who\u2019s simply passing by \u2013 can help document what\u2019s happening and the story that\u2019s being told. A very powerful thing indeed.

I caught three of these sessions, held in Austin convention centre, which had varying degrees of insight.  The least insightful \u2013 but the most entertaining \u2013 came from Friday\u2019s keynote speaker Snoop Dogg. The rap legend didn\u2019t really give a speech but was interviewed on stage by his manager Ted Chung. For this reason, a hard-hitting interrogation was not on the cards, but the Dogg still managed to entertain.  Dressed for business is gold-rimmed specs, a posh white shirt and bow-tie, Snoop offered his thoughts on how he\u2019s managed to stay popular and relevant. He said it\u2019s all down to studying the music business and always paying attention to new artists, who in turn show him respect: \u2018I\u2019m Uncle Snoop\u2019, he said, to guffaws from the crowd. Snoop said that he remembered an older generation of artists, like Dionne Warwick, heavily criticising him when he was a young gangsta rapper: \u201ceveryone was on Snoop Dogg like I\u2019m the worst black man ever created,\u201d he said. He said it \u201crubbed him the wrong way\u201d, and so \u201cI try not to rub young homies the wrong way.\u201d It\u2019s not difficult to see why other musicians want to collaborate with him \u2013 while his records have occasionally wavered in quality, he is still demonstrably cool, with a voice you could listen to all day, whether rapping or in conversation.  Snoop also seems remarkably mellow after over two torrid decades in the music industry, though this could be due to the fact that he says the first thing he thinks about in the morning is smoking weed. He is involved in a range of activities from painting to his Youth Football League, which puts inner city children on the road to college, including his son, Cordell Broadus, who is going to UCLA - the first person in Snoop\u2019s family to go to college. Very sweetly, Snoop said that seeing Cordell pick his school was the happiest day of his life. The funny moments came when Snoop discussed his friendship and collaborative partnership with Willie Nelson, based on a shared love of \u201canimals, good music and grass\u201d. Snoop painted a vivid picture of the pair playing dominos while stoned in Amsterdam - \u201che was whoopin\u2019 my ass\u201d. Weed also inspired another of his unlikely pursuits \u2013 abstract painting. He was in \u201cthe Versace hotel in Australia\u201d when he started to make the painting, which was inadvertently finished off with some ash from Snoop\u2019s spliff. It now hangs on the hotel wall.  Snoop has a natural flair for social media, and it was no surprise to hear him praise it. The rapper professes himself \u201cfor the people\u201d, and social media allows him to put his money where his mouth is. He loves having a close relationship with his fans, and hearing the words, \u201cSnoop! Give me a selfie!\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a love thing,\u201d the rapper smiled. (Incidentally, at Art Basel in December the MoMA curator Klaus Biesenbach recommended Snoop\u2019s Instagram account as one of his favourites.) There was less love but probably more insight in a panel about \u201cthe celebrity economy in music\u201d on Thursday which featured the Nobel-winning economist Paul Krugman and Will and Win Butler from Arcade Fire, along with Berger Management\u2019s Nicky Berger and Nielsen\u2019s Tatiana Simonian. Krugman said that in revenue terms, things have changed for artists less than you might think \u2013 touring was always around seven times more lucrative than selling records.  There was a discussion about sponsorship and whether bands should accept it, with Simonian saying that she used to be against it but \u201cstreet credibility didn\u2019t pay my bills ... the dialogue has changed.\u201d She said that Chipotle were sponsoring new bands, and that as a young performer \u201cI would have been stoked to get free burritos.\u201d This cut no ice with Win Butler, who immediately said \u201cIt\u2019s selling out. You can afford to get a Chipotle burrito if you\u2019re running your tour right.\u201d This moment of truth was followed up by Krugman memorably describing the New York Times as \u201can advertising platform for luxury goods wrapped in a little bit of news\u201d. Increasingly, brands will want to involve themselves with bands, though less overtly than in times gone by. Berger approvingly said that the American salad bar chain Sweet Green has a festival called Sweet Life \u2013 though this got a snort from Win Butler. \u201cArtists are always screwed over, only now it\u2019s different people,\u201d he said. They are, he said \u201calways giving more value than you\u2019re getting.\u201d  So with revenues from record sales declining, how will bands be able to afford to play in 10 years? Will Butler pointed out something that has become increasingly apparent \u2013 that more and more, it\u2019s bands\u2019 parents who pay for them to make music. \u201cAs the rich get richer their kids can do whatever the hell they want.\u201d This analysis was backed up by Krugman, who added that the share of cash going to a few bands at the top \u2013 presumably the likes of Madonna and the Rolling Stones \u2013 has increased, meaning that everyone else gets a shrinking size of the pie.  The only real cheer was provided by Will Butler, who pointed out that the internet has facilitated \u201ca golden age of folk art \u2013 all these stupid internet jokes. In terms of creativity we\u2019re in a really good place, but music is less of a golden age.\u201d Something definitely not having a golden age is the music press. Friday saw a panel called \u201cShould music mags survive or get killed off?\u201d It included US music press royalty including Ann Powers, Jim DeRogatis and Jaan Uhelszki, but I didn\u2019t feel as though the question was really answered \u2013 not that music magazines are going to be saved by a panel of hacks arguing about whether or not old copies of Creem had been preserved on microfilm, as these did for what seemed like an eternity.  One of few bright spots in an hour of nostalgic bellyaching was provided by Powers, who pointed out that the internet has enabled a whole crop of talented women to write about music, who would have been marginalised in the boys\u2019 club of the music press. DeRogatis complained: \u201cbut they don\u2019t know where the comma goes,\u201d his point being that writers need editors, lawyers and the rest of the infrastructure a magazine can bring.  No-one made the obvious point, that while there is a plethora of music journalism, and it\u2019s often brilliant, it\u2019s usually now found outside music magazines.

The recent choice of male directors for both has prompted fresh demands for fair representation. \u201cAll my working life, I have been speaking up about how women can smash the glass ceiling, after all it is only glass. Why haven\u2019t we done it?\u201d asked Ruth Mackenzie, director of the Cultural Olympiad in 2012. Her sentiments were echoed by Jude Kelly, artistic director of the Southbank Centre: \u201cNot enough has changed yet. Everybody is talking the right language and the atmosphere is charged. But that is not the same as actually making the changes.\u201d In January 37-year-old Nicholas Cullinan was announced as the 12th man in a row to run the National Portrait Gallery off Trafalgar Square, and last week Gabriele Finaldi, 49, was appointed head of the neighbouring National Gallery. Since its foundation it has been run by 14 men, including Charles Saumarez Smith, who now runs the Royal Academy in Piccadilly. If the top job at the British Museum also comes up this spring, following the rumoured departure of Neil MacGregor, pressure to appoint a woman will be greater than ever. MacGregor, the 19th man to run the museum, is thought to have been approached to run the new Humboldt Forum in Berlin. But Britain stands to lose more than MacGregor to Europe, according to Mackenzie, who believes female talent is better recognised elsewhere. As the new artistic director of the Holland Festival, she is working with a female managing director. \u201cThe new director of the Stedlijk Museum [in Amsterdam] is also a woman, and her predecessor was a woman,\u201d Mackenzie said. \u201cThe CEO of Dutch National Opera and Ballet is a woman. Nobody thinks this is remarkable. One day we won\u2019t have to protest about the brilliance of women leaders working in culture. One day this will simply no longer be a topic because the leaders running our museums and galleries are equally likely to be women as men.\u201d Britain does have a few female directors, including Diana Lees at the Imperial War Museum, Janet Vitmayer at the Horniman Museum in south London and Maria Balshaw at Manchester\u2019s Whitworth art gallery. But it is Nicholas Serota who is in charge at the Tate galleries, and the German Martin Roth at the V&amp;A has been director since September 2011. (Roth is the latest in a succession of men going back to Henry Cole in 1852, punctuated only by the appointment of Dame Elizabeth Esteve-Coll in the late 1980s.) Ian Blatchford is director at the Science Museum, while at the Natural History Museum it is Michael Dixon. In Oxford, Alexander Sturgis became director of the Ashmolean, and in Gateshead Godfrey Worsdale is director of the Baltic. At the Walker in Liverpool David Fleming is director, and at the British Libary in London, Roly Keating, formerly of the BBC, is chief executive. Arts Council England, the central body that handles many major arts funding decisions, has still only had one female chair, Liz Forgan. The current chair is Peter Bazalgette. The biggest role in television, BBC director general, went to Tony Hall in 2013. He handed over his job at the Royal Opera House to Alexander Beard, formerly deputy at the Tate. On Beard\u2019s appointment two years ago, the Observer surveyed the leaders of cultural organisations on a wider scale, including leading performance venues. Of the 30 institutions examined then, only four were run by women. One was the Southbank Centre, where Kelly is still in charge. Speaking then, she said: \u201cIt is very difficult to change things if the world is nearly always telling you that men basically are running the world.\u201d This weekend she described herself as optimistic. \u201cThe right people have to really want the world to change the way it looks before things will happen. There is still that kind of sense that people on appointment boards are asking: could a woman do that? And you would never get that, of course, about a man.\u201d Kelly, who has just returned from launching an American version of her Women of the World festival in Washington, argues that childcare and greater responsibility for ageing parents can hold women back but believes men in power are beginning to understand that calling for more women in responsible jobs is not necessarily a criticism of the work they have done. Deborah Bull, director of culture at King\u2019s College, London, also highlights the importance of female role models leading arts organisations but suspects that diversity problems there may be rooted in academia. \u201cThe thought that men could decide that appointing a woman was too risky is both horrific and shocking,\u201d she said. \u201cNobody is actively trying to exclude anyone \u2013 it is just that these habits are ingrained. Even where there are male hierarchies doing the appointing, and where, of course, they want the best person for the job, I don\u2019t see why that person should not be someone from a different social class, someone with a disability \u2013 or even a woman.\u201d Bull called for a fresh look at diversity across arts management. \u201cOften the landscape is shaped by the structures at the very top. If you look at national government, you also see a lack of diversity, and that ricochets down the system. There are challenges we have to address at every level. We have to learn to be comfortable with difference and make sure our prejudices don\u2019t mean we are favouring certain types. By helping us all to ask these questions, nobody is trying to exclude anyone \u2013 these are very ingrained habits.\u201d", "sentences": ["\u201cThe new director of the Stedlijk Museum [in Amsterdam] is also a woman, and her predecessor was a woman,\u201d Mackenzie said."], "title": "Call for museums and galleries to appoint more women to top jobs", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/mar/22/female-directors-museums-galleries-glass-ceiling", "tags": ["Museums", "Women", "Art", "UK news", "Culture", "National Gallery", "National Portrait Gallery"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-03-22T07:00:03Z", "article": "   Standing in the lake, 2014-15 by Maaike Schoorel: \u2018properly mysterious\u2019. Photograph: \u00a9 the artist, courtesy Maureen Paley, London    The paintings look like nothing at all. That is the point. You see only a series of hazy grey rectangles on entering the gallery. They come in different sizes, billboard to paperback, and in various tones and hues from slate to mist to gun metal, platinum and ash. But still, the instantaneous effect is of many grey blanks. After a moment, there is a faint glimmer in the largest canvas on the far wall, something like a watery reflection. It is not the depiction of light so much as light itself. Naturally, the urge is to discover how this is achieved: the painting is now drawing you purposefully across the room. Up close there is still not very much to see, just a few dots and blots of oil paint \u2013 lilac, titanium white, grey-blue \u2013 sometimes built up with a brush, sometimes seeping into the surface in a diaphanous stain. Perhaps the vision of water was only a mirage. But after a few more moments, and at a slight distance from the canvas, some faint trace of a waterline and a mast-like vertical are intermittently visible. And there is the pattern of brightness that might be light on a briny crosscurrent. Something is coming together \u2013 and then it fades away. Maaike Schoorel is a Dutch painter, born in 1973 and now based in Amsterdam. She has had a high degree of international success, appearing in museum shows all over Europe and America. Her kind of painting \u2013 now you see it, now you don\u2019t (and vice versa) \u2013 is not an optical trick, nor is it some kind of late-flowering impressionism. In fact it has a rigorous scientific underpinning. Schoorel is interested in the mind\u2019s capacity for perception and visual understanding. She has pondered the mechanisms long and hard \u2013 distal stimulus, transduction, proximal stimulus: how the object stimulates the senses, how the image is processed through neural activity and so on \u2013 and her work is presumably devised with extraordinary precision to isolate these stages in separate intervals. You see an unfamiliar image; you try to discover more to confirm whatever you have guessed about it; what you discover is not always confirmed by everything else you now see there.     Kiss, 2014-15. Photograph: \u00a9 the artist, courtesy Maureen Paley, London    This, at least, is the intellectual basis of the work. But her art is the opposite of theoretical. It is lush, extravagant and even quite wantonly gorgeous in its subject matter and effects. Candelight, phosphorescence, fireworks, a lake at dusk, a nude in a bath, even a vase of spring flowers: she is on the very edge of nostalgia and the picturesque. But that becomes part of the pleasure: picturesque paintings that you cannot quite see? This art has a twinkle in its eye. Once you have become accustomed to the way her pictures work (and work upon you), attention turns to individual performances. And here the range of effects is richly diverse. The marks are scribbled, chalked, drawn, pencilled, dripped like milk, rubbed out, or expansively stained \u2013 or so it seems; actually they\u2019re all made with paint and a brush. And are these incidents in or on the canvas? Does the paint conceal or reveal? Even at point-blank range, it is hard to tell. Sometimes the works appear atmospheric \u2013 misty, rainy \u2013 and sometimes seasonal; the paintings in the upper gallery are wintry, which may have something to do with the density or opacity of the paint. But the source of these effects remains out of reach; the feeling occurs in your imagination. Too many marks and an image may be too readily perceived; too few and the painting is empty. Occasionally the balance fails. The bath scene, for instance, is a visual tautology: a spectre perceived through steam is the definition of both the subject and the painting. But at its best, Schoorel\u2019s work is properly mysterious. A fugitive self-portrait seems to shift in time. Stare into the pale surface of the canvas, noticing a hint of a face that instantly dematerialises, become distracted by another notation \u2013 loose Frans Hals locks, as it seems \u2013 and the picture alters. Looking becomes a measurably strange event.     Little Green Bag, 2015 by Christian Rosa: \u2018a form of automatic writing improvised with immense skill and daring\u2019. Photograph: courtesy White Cube/\u00a9 the artist    The abstract paintings of Christian Rosa have a spring in their step, to say the very least. Lithe black brushmarks bound across expanses of unprimed canvas like lariats, animating the virgin space. Their twist and coil is variously athletic, loquacious and calligraphic. All kinds of quizzical forms assemble around them in friendship or resistance. A black disc leaps free of the circle beside it. A dab of scarlet oil paint spreads into an oily halo of its own essence. Lemon yellow settles on the canvas in bars, hyphens and lollipop sticks, as a bright red scribble scuttles out of the picture stage right. It\u2019s a fantastical circus.     Damien or Natas, 2015. Photograph: \u00a9 the artist, courtesy White Cube    It is also a form of automatic writing improvised with immense skill and daring using paint, charcoal, resin and oil stick. Rosa, born in Brazil in 1982, creates something like a spontaneous narrative with these wildly buoyant elements. A whirlwind of a black scribble leaps at a static black bar like a dog on a leash, while a blue oval jumps about below, badly overexcited at the encounter. The paintings are emphatically non-figurative, but all of these disparate elements come together in vividly emotive scenes. Even as the raw elements are isolated on the canvas, as if waiting to be counted, so they merge into antic and joyful compositions that spin off into stories and even quite elaborate jokes. It could be called abstract optimism. \u2022  Maaike Schoorel: Sub-Lo is at Maureeen Paley, 21 Herald Street, London E2 until 12 April. \u2022 Christian Rosa is at White Cube Mason\u2019s Yard, London SW1 until 23 May", "sentences": ["Maaike Schoorel is a Dutch painter, born in 1973 and now based in Amsterdam."], "title": "Maaike Schoorel: Sub-Lo; Christian Rosa \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/mar/22/maaike-schoorel-sub-lo-christian-rosa-white-cube-review", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Exhibitions", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-03-22T15:00:00Z", "article": "   Anne Frank, The Diary of ANNE FRANK    I was overwhelmed after finishing this book. Anne&apos;s writing had so much depth and feeling that it almost felt as if I had travelled to the Secret Annexe and spent time with her. After I had finished reading the book, I considered myself genuinely lucky because I didn&apos;t have to live in a cramped little house with eight people; I didn&apos;t have to listen to the marching army boots,; I didn&apos;t have to hear the army planes soaring high above; and I did not have to listen to the pounding of my heart in terror.   &quot;I don&apos;t think of all the misery, but of the beauty that still remains.&quot;  Her courage, bravery and determination stunned me. Had I been in her shoes, who knows how long I would have survived\u2026 In fact, I always say that if I ever see a snake, I would die on the spot; seeing a snake would have been just a fraction of the tension she had been under.  I cried as I read the book, especially the section where the family expects a visit from the police and goes through a sleepless night.  &quot;The best remedy for those who are afraid, lonely or unhappy is to go outside, somewhere where they can be quite alone with the heavens, nature and God. Because only then does one feel that all is as it should be and that God wishes to see people happy, amidst the simple beauty of nature. As longs as this exists, and it certainly always will, I know that then there will always be comfort for every sorrow, whatever the circumstances may be. And I firmly believe that nature brings solace in all troubles.&quot;  We all know her story, but here it is anyway\u2026 Anne was a Jewish girl who had to go into hiding during World War Two to avoid the Nazis. Together with seven others, she hid in the Secret Annex on the Prinsengracht 263 in Amsterdam. After almost two years in hiding they were discovered and deported to concentration camps. Anne&apos;s father, Otto Frank, was the only one of the eight people to survive. After her death, Anne became world famous because of the diary she wrote while in hiding, which Otto finally published after returning to Amsterdam. Various other biographies, movies and plays followed the diary. I have been to Amsterdam, but I didn&apos;t visit the Anne Frank House. (I went to the Van Gogh museum. I had not read the book then.) But I can still look through the house with the help of the 360 degree tour on Anne Frank&apos;s official website.  I hope you are moved by this book. I certainly was. I would request you to read this sad and at the same time heart-warming book and it would mean so much to me and to Anne (I am sure). Please do read it and I would recommend to people of all ages.   &quot;I don&apos;t want to have lived in vain like most people.

Couples walk arm in arm. Laughter carries in from the casino. Two swans drift past the fountain. This is Castell de Peralada, a\u00a013th-century castle in Catalonia where, as part of the town\u2019s annual arts festival, Orquesta Buena Vista Social Club will this evening make a stop on their farewell tour, nearly 20 years after they began. The ensemble, named after a Havana members\u2019 club that closed in the 1940s, started as a collaboration between the American guitarist Ry Cooder and the Cuban bandleader Juan de Marcos Gonz\u00e1lez, the pair summoning a number of feted Cuban musicians to record an album in just six days. It became a global phenomenon and led to live performances in Amsterdam and New York, as well as an Oscar-nominated documentary directed by Wim Wenders. In its wake came further recordings, world tours, solo albums and, for a while, this cluster of Cubans seemed inescapable \u2013 the distinctive strains of Chan Chan, Dos Gardenias and Candela winding their way around restaurant tables, bar stools and dinner parties the world over. Salman Rushdie even referred to this is in his 2001 novel Fury, describing the warm New York months of 1998 as \u201cthat Buena Vista summer\u201d. But in the last two decades much has changed. Six of the original members \u2013 Ibrahim Ferrer, Compay Segundo, Rub\u00e9n Gonz\u00e1lez, Orlando \u201cCacha\u00edto\u201d Lopez, P\u00edo Leyva, Manuel \u201cPuntillita\u201d Licea \u2013 have passed away. Although singer Omara Portuondo and\u00a0guitarist and vocalist Eliades Ochoa remain, for the past few years the group has toured as the Orquesta, with a shifting lineup. The repertoire remains much the same, though.     Double-bassist Orlando \u2018Cachaito\u2019 Lopez in 1998.  Photograph: S Creutzmann/Zeitenspiegel/Corbis    Cuba has changed, too. In the 1990s, after the Soviet collapse and the hardship that followed, the country was just beginning to open up to the outside world: package tourism was in its infancy, and record companies from abroad had only just begun their musical truffle-hunt on the island. Today, Cuba is one of the most popular Caribbean destinations, with travel bans for its citizens lifted, economic reforms initiated, trade restrictions softened, and a thaw in relations with the US under way. While these changes would surely have come about eventually, the musicians of Buena Vista Social Club played an undeniable part in changing the world\u2019s perception of their country. \u201cThere were about 16 musicians in the room,\u201d says Nick Gold, recalling those magical six days in Havana in 1996. The producer and head of the band\u2019s London-based record label World Circuit, he was in Cuba to work on another project with Cooder and De Marcos, but when that fell through, the trio decided to set down some Cuban son music, reminiscent of the country\u2019s \u201cgolden age\u201d in the 1940s and 50s. \u201cThere was this incredible atmosphere. In one corner, you had Eliadas playing bolero. In another, you couldn\u2019t get Ruben off the piano. No one knew what it was going to become \u2013 but just to be working and playing was something. They were revelling in it.\u201d     The original album cover    Not far from the castle, Portuondo sits in a cafe, eating a croissant and reminiscing \u2013 about performing with Nat King Cole, and touring the world as a solo artist. She is 84 now but, even in her loungewear, there is something stately and spectacular about her: the fine angles of her face, the earthy ferocity of her voice. She was about to go off on a tour of Vietnam when she got the call from De Marcos. \u201cThey needed a female singing voice,\u201d she says. \u201cHe had this idea \u2013 to take Cuban music back to its roots, to spread it around the world. It was such an important idea that I cancelled everything to do this music I love.\u201d Gold adds: \u201cOne thing these musicians had \u2013 and still have \u2013 is a huge faith in their music, in the Cuban son. They\u2019ve looked after it like a baby; they\u2019ve brought it up. And they know they\u2019re good.\u201d Gold and Cooder felt a similar a sense of care and responsibility for the recordings they made. \u201cEach morning, we played what we had recorded the day before,\u201d Gold says. \u201cWe knew it was wonderful. When you listen to it, you\u2019re right there.\u201d This was partly due to the positioning of a pair of microphones high in the studio to capture the ambience of the room. \u201cThe studio has this one fantastic large room. It just has this lovely feel.\u201d But when the pair took the recordings to California to be mixed, they immediately stumbled. \u201cWe weren\u2019t hearing that special something,\u201d says Gold. \u201cThere was a clarity missing.\u201d They began a frantic search for a mixing desk that resembled the one used in Havana, eventually locating the same model in a Christian recording studio in Los Angeles. \u201cAnd there it was \u2013 that sound back in all its clarity! Ry said, \u2018It\u2019s like someone\u2019s wiped the windows clear.\u2019\u201d But this hard-won sound doesn\u2019t just stem from a room full of musicians recording in 1996. It also belongs to that golden age before the revolution of 1959. This was the big-band era, dominated by the Tropicana Cabaret orchestra and its leader, Armando Romeu Jr, as well as Benny Mor\u00e9 and D\u00e1maso P\u00e9rez Prado, all of whom helped shape modern Cuban music \u2013 melding Afrocuban with local jazz, mambo, US big-band styles, slipping from son montuno to cha cha cha, bolero, guaracha and beyond.    When tourists hear it, it\u2019s a connector, it\u2019s a positive thing getting them to appreciate Cuban music    For some, this trip down memory lane was to be viewed positively: Carole Steele is an American percussionist who has recorded with artists from Steve Winwood and Peter Gabriel to Joan Baez and Eric Clapton, and began visiting Cuba in 1987 with the intention of working with two of the country\u2019s most revered Afro-Cuban musicians, Lazaro Ros and Esteban Vega Bacallao. \u201cFor some percussionists it\u2019s Africa that calls them, others it\u2019s Brazil,\u201d she explains. \u201cBut for me it\u2019s Cuba, that\u2019s the motherland. I don\u2019t think I can describe how Cuban percussion affects me in words but it\u2019s a feeling, deep in my solar plexus.\u201d Today she leads music-based tours to Cuba for National Geographic, and presents lectures on Cuban music and dance \u201cfrom son to timba in an hour and 15 minutes\u201d. For her, the Buena Vista Social Club phenomenon should be seen as a starting point, a way in to the country\u2019s rich musical history. \u201cIt\u2019s really funny to me, because people think Buena Vista Social Club is Cuban music and it\u2019s just one style,\u201d she says. \u201cBut it made the world aware of that one particular style of Cuban music, and to me the project is so much bigger than them, it was more than just a CD. When tourists hear it, it\u2019s a connector, it\u2019s a positive thing getting them to appreciate Cuban music, and the job has been done well.\u201d Gold puts it even more simply: \u201cIt helped people listen to music that wasn\u2019t in English.\u201d Some people, however, believe Buena Vista\u2019s portrayal of Cuba might be a little distorted. \u201cIn academic writings on Buena Vista, there\u2019s a big deal made of the nostalgia and mystique and the fact it invokes an earlier era,\u201d says Robin D Moore, professor of ethnomusicology at the University of Texas, specialising in the music of Cuba. In that era, Moore adds, Cuba was something of an American playground: \u201cThere was a lot of money. The mafia was there. Gambling was legal there \u2013 as opposed to most of the US. Folks say there were more clubs and live music venues, too.\u201d But the issue, he says, is that the Buena Vista story, particularly as told in Wenders\u2019 documentary, ignores several decades of Cuba\u2019s social, political and cultural history. \u201cThere\u2019s an odd, selective presentation of history, music and culture in the film that\u2019s a bit disturbing,\u201d he\u00a0says. \u201cWhen I saw the film, I was writing a book on the Cuban revolution and it struck me that these guys lived through amazing changes on the island \u2013 and they\u2019re not being asked about any of that at all.\u201d            Some ethnomusicologists, he says, were annoyed by the portrayal of the musicians as \u201ccountry bumpkins who had never seen skyscrapers\u201d. After all, many had visited the US before the revolution. \u201cAnd in the 60s, when tourism ended, all these artists came on to the government payroll, and the government did organise mass tours to East Germany and Russia, Japan and China. But I was happy that the artists were getting recognition, because of the difficulty they had been through. The US and Cuban governments had damaged their careers.\u201d Cubans themselves were, he says, \u201cbroadsided by the success\u201d of Buena Vista Social Club. \u201cI think a lot of people on the island considered these musicians old hat, like pushing Cole Porter.\u201d He questions the notion of \u201cfeaturing older musicians and ignoring everything that had happened musically in the following 40 years. There is a huge disconnect between what Cubans are listening to and what tourists want. There is more modern and international-sounding dance music. There is timba or salsa cubana, a mixture of son, US funk, jazz and reggaeton, and local folklore drum styles. It\u2019s very modern-sounding, very dense rhythmically.\u201d Yet still, he says, you hear the music of Buena Vista played everywhere in Havana. \u201cThe Buena Vista phenomenon has created a huge number of copycat bands. You\u2019ll hear the same songs everywhere \u2013 Chan Chan, Dos Gardenias. It\u2019s as if it has become a parody to cater to tourists. The Buena Vista collective was very much an artificial creation, a record-company creation, and its rise coincided with the rise of tourism, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and all sorts of legal changes that had started to connect Cuba to the capitalist world.\u201d While all of this may be true, it\u2019s an\u00a0analysis that is at odds with the empassioned recollections of Portuendo, or Gold\u2019s explanation of how this \u201cartificial creation\u201d came about. \u201cIt was only afterwards,\u201d he says, \u201cthat we thought to call it Buena Vista Social Club. I was aware of these social clubs, but it wasn\u2019t until I heard the song Buena Vista Social Club played in the studio that I became aware of this club \u2013 it was written by Cacha\u00edto\u2019s uncle, who played at the club and whose family lived nearby in an area known for its music.\u201d     Buena Vista Social Club musician Francisco Repilado, known as Compay Segundo, aged 94 in 2001. Photograph: Jos\u00e9 Goitia/AP    The castle show is a more formal event than the previous evening\u2019s: a raucous, tub-thumping performance in the south of France. As\u00a0the band soundcheck, I watch two attendants mop the auditorium\u2019s white\u00a0plastic chairs after a light sprinkling of rain. The soundcheck proves unexpectedly moving: a chance to see both the affection and the great musical conversation that exists between these musicians. They play from their\u00a0setlist, but they improvise, too, enjoying themselves in this beautiful setting. It is hard to stand among them and not feel sad about this musical conversation coming to an end. When they take to the stage that evening, to a\u00a0politely rapturous crowd, there is already a sense of absence \u2013 a space where the very particular talents of Ferrer, Gonz\u00e1lez, Segundo, Cacha\u00edto and the others once stood. \u201cWho\u2019s still going?\u201d Steele had wondered. \u201cI imagine it\u2019s bittersweet for Omara. She can go out and people adore her for the fantastic singer she is, but she\u2019s got to miss them all. All their ghosts must be there on stage for her.\u201d When Portuendo appears, she does so in a long purple dress threaded with\u00a0silver, her hair held back from her\u00a0face. She stalks the stage, cheekbones gleaming, singing with fire and moving with a profound sensuality. But, as you hear her voice unanswered, you can\u2019t help looking for ghosts. I think of something she told me earlier, about Ferrer having been her greatest singing partner. \u201cThough he is not here,\u201d she said, \u201cthe love and affection of this great friendship is still alive. It\u00a0still lasts.\u201d \u2022 Lost and Found, an album of previously unreleased tracks, is released by World Circuit today.

The government has so far resisted parliamentary calls for Norway\u2019s 5.5tn krone (\u00a3470bn) nest egg, GPFG \u2013 the world\u2019s largest sovereign wealth fund \u2013 to divest from fossil fuel. A government-appointed panel recently recommended that the fund not divest from fossil fuels, but rather set up a new climate-related exclusion criterion on a case-by-case basis. It concluded:  \u201cEnergy production constitutes an important basis for our society, and fossil fuels \u2013 both petroleum and coal \u2013 will remain part of the mix for decades to come,\u201d the report concluded in December. \u201cThe question is thus not whether investors will own these companies, but which investors are \u2018good\u2019 owners of these assets from a financial and ethical perspective.\u201d The giant Norwegian fund held at least 316.7bn (\u00a326.8bn) krone in oil, gas and coal investments in 2014, according to NGOs Urgewald and Future in Our Hands. It did divest from 52 coal companies last year, but Urgewald says it actually ended up increasing the value of its coal holdings, from 82.2bn krone in 2013 to 85.7bn krone last year. It wasn\u2019t Norway\u2019s cities which led the charge to divest, however. The divestment movement here has its roots in the small community of Eid, population 6,000, whose mayor Alfred Bj\u00f8rlo took up the cause with its pension fund manager more than two years ago, after he was inspired by a city in the US. \u201cIt was towards the end of 2012 when, by chance, I read about the Seattle mayor\u2019s plans to pull out of all coal funds,\u201d said Bj\u00f8rlo. \u201cI thought if a city like Seattle could do something like this, then it is fully possible in Norway.\u201d It was indeed Seattle that was the first US city to join the Fossil Free divestment campaign led by 350.org. Mayor Mike McGinn announced in December 2012 that Seattle would not invest any of its $1.4bn operating cashflow in fossil fuel companies, and would seek to divest its $1.9bn pension fund and $700m deferred compensation plan. Whether the world\u2019s megacities will follows suit is another question entirely. Last week\u2019s vote to call on the mayor to divest London\u2019s\u2019s \u00a32bn GLA Group Investment Syndicate from fossil fuel investments, as well as to ask the chair of the \u00a34.8bm portfolio London Pension Fund Authority (LPFA) to commit to divestment, falls on Boris Johnson \u2013 whose office pointed out what it considered the drawbacks.     A climate change protest in central London. Photograph: Samuel Hardy/Alamy    \u201cThe mayor takes climate change extremely seriously,\u201d a spokesperson said, adding that the mayor\u2019s office believed a sudden divestment on London\u2019s part from fossil fuel investments would cause \u201ca huge disruption to the world economy, let alone the retirement plans for millions of UK residents\u201d. There was, the spokesperson said, \u201ca realism that there needs to be transition away from fossil fuel and not a sudden cliff-edge\u201d.  Danielle Paffard, a campaigner for Fossil Free UK divestment, calls Johnson \u201ca fossil fuel head\u201d and is less than optimistic. But she says that with mayoral elections next year, the issue of divestment could become a big part of the debate. In the meantime, Fossil Free has set its sights on encouraging some European cities, such as Amsterdam, Berlin and Stockholm, to divest. Her US colleague, Amy Miller, points to the progress being made in states such as Massachusetts, which just received the support of the local Great Barrington Select Board; the Minneapolis City Council, which will vote on the issue next week; and great strides being made in Washington DC and her hometown of New York City, which sits on a $160bn pension fund (\u201ca very big goal,\u201d Miller says).  Whether New York is any more likely than London to divest, however, is up in the air, she says. City politicians remain concerned about the possible financial impact of divesting. \u201cThey prefer to remain investors, and to influence through active engagement,\u201d she said. \u201cBut it just doesn\u2019t work.

Are agencies at risk of losing touch when it comes to issues of age, ethnicity and being LGBT? As the Business in the Community network website notes: \u201cGood employers value diversity. Individuals will perform at work to the best of their ability when their identity and the difference in contribution that may flow from that are valued.\u201d It adds: \u201cDiversity is good for business because a range of employees with a range of backgrounds will bring different ideas and enable an employer to appeal to different parts of the marketplace.\u201d Most of all, it says, diversity contributes to innovation and success.

Their two arena shows were rearranged from December, when singer Roger Daltrey was too ill to perform. Three months on, there\u2019s a distinct air of mortality about them. There are no problems with Daltrey\u2019s voice, still a house-flattening bellow, but he\u2019s no longer a frontman who commands the stage \u2013 it\u2019s left to guitarist Pete Townshend to inject some kinetic energy. Daltrey twice fluffs his vocal cues, in Substitute and I Can See For Miles, and even the pair\u2019s bickering after the first incident \u2013 Townshend mocks the singer for ruining his carefully structured song, Daltrey responds with a weary, \u201cHe\u2019s such a tart\u201d \u2013 sounds like men trying desperately to will themselves back to being the world\u2019s angriest, toughest rock\u2019n\u2019roll band. The Who can still be a breathlessly exciting live act, especially in rooms smaller than this 20,000-capacity barn, but tonight they seem constantly to be trying to catch up with themselves. \u201cCan you imagine a football team playing two games in a row?\u201d Daltrey asks, only three songs in. \u201cThat\u2019s what they expect of us.\u201d In the last third of the set, though, what had been a disjointed ragbag of a show finally starts coming together.

This makes UAL one of the latest institutions around the world to be hit by occupations and strikes by staff and students. The causes of such protests vary: some are concerned about working conditions facing graduate students, others point to a lack of transparency about how universities are run. A key issue is the commercialisation of higher education, which many feel has led university leaders to prioritise financial goals over the needs of staff and students.  We speak to academics and students in Canada, the Netherlands and the UK to find out why they\u2019re taking a stand.     \u2018Graduate students should be guaranteed a minimum amount of funding that sits above the poverty line.\u2019 Photograph: Lennart Maschmeyer    University of Toronto, Canada What\u2019s happening? Graduate students at the University of Toronto have been on strike for three weeks. What prompted the strike? Graduate and teaching assistants are essential to the University of Toronto\u2019s teaching. But they are paid a minimum financial package of C$15,000 \u2013 far less than is needed to meet the cost of living.  The basic graduate student funding package has not seen any increase in more than seven years, leaving graduate students doing teaching and research to live more than C$8,000 below the poverty line. Sessional faculty, course instructors and teaching assistants do more than 60% of the teaching at the University of Toronto, but only 3.5% of the university\u2019s budget is allocated to them.  To address this, graduate students should be guaranteed a minimum amount of funding that sits above the poverty line and increases as inflation and the cost of living rises.Instead, management have sought to increase undergraduate and graduate student enrolment \u2013 particularly international students \u2013 in order to increase profits to the university. Rather than addressing the serious financial needs of its students, the university administration team spent weeks refusing to return to the negotiating table. A recent offer failed to address the negative impacts of precarious work in academia that have allowed for the exploitation of lower level and non-tenured academic staff. To prevent further labour action and disruption for all students across university campuses in Canada, university administrators will have to address these serious structural deficiencies that have decayed the quality of education and research at public universities in Canada and across North America.

It is managed and organised around corporate interests, which promote elitism and perpetuate inequality.\u2019 Photograph: Alex Kurunis    London School of Economics and Political Science, UK What\u2019s happening? A central administration room has been occupied by students since 18 March. What caused the protest? The occupation is a reaction against the marketisation of education.  LSE is the epitome of the neoliberal university. It is managed and organised around corporate interests, which promote elitism and perpetuate inequality. OccupyLSE proposes that students, lecturers and workers should run a university \u2013 and we have named this project the Free University of London. We are occupying the main administrative meeting room to symbolically disrupt the management of the school, which is responsible for the neoliberalisation of our education. We have used the space to reclaim our education and encourage political participation by teaching and learning from each other. This is a rejection of the commercialisation of education \u2013 we are learning for free and we are learning freely.  The space and workshops are being used to focus and refine the demands we are making as a movement on issues of free education, workers\u2019 rights, university democracy and governance, liberation and ethics. The power of occupations is that they create a domino effect: this is only the beginning.

Teaching assistants, graduate assistants and contract faculty at York University have been on strike since 3 March. What prompted the strike? Staff and students participating in the strike have a number of demands including: more funding for graduate and research assistants and better employment rights for LGBTQ workers. They also want to \u201cstrengthen the tuition indexation language\u201d, which means that any rises in tuition for graduate students will be met with a rise in their funding.  Once considered a radical institution, York now pursues aggressive divide-and-conquer strike-breaking tactics. On March 9, the university made a \u2018final offer\u2019 that largely appealed to senior contract faculty, a clear attempt to split the union. Teaching assistants and graduate assistants rejected the offer and remain on legal strike.  York is now reconvening courses despite the strike, putting students in a position to cross increasingly tense picket lines to get to class, and has even invited striking workers to scab. Despite these moves, both faculty and undergraduate solidarity is growing, with many exercising their right not to cross pickets. As PhD candidates, we are not only tuition-paying students, but also frontline teachers. In short, we pay for the \u2018privilege\u2019 of our precarious jobs. We couldn\u2019t pursue our careers without full funding.  What does this mean for student-workers? One international student recently tweeted a Kafkaesque image of a pay cheque from the university for C$0.00, all that remained of their funding after paying international tuition. At the university, we call this \u201cgetting York\u2019d\u201d.

Students are occupying Maagdenhuis, the university\u2019s main administrative building, calling for a democrastisation of the institution. What prompted the protest? Protesters want to increase the transparency and accountability of the university decision-making processes and to pause and reconsider its programme of restructuring, cuts and sell-offs.  How do you protest bureaucracy? How do you work against the financialisation and managerialism that has seeped into the university, forcing us to prioritise \u2018rendement\u2019 (efficiency), harmonisation, and profit, rather than creativity, education, and critical thinking?  In Amsterdam we started by occupying symbolic university buildings , organising public rallies and taking to the streets en masse. We wrote articles, appeared on television and the radio and published open letters.  But resistance takes many forms. As a mode of critique and change we have taken back our workspace. We have marked the very corporate-like environment we work in \u2013 all straight lines, uniform spaces, impenetrable concrete, unbending steel \u2013 with signs of alternative voices, thoughts-in-the-making and issues up for debate.  We have joined with our students on a weekly basis to think through the effects of managerialism and financialisation and how, when there is no other way, we can disobey in everyday acts of resistance.  In resonance with Bertold Brecht\u2019s famous phrase \u2018Stell dir vor, es ist Krieg, und keiner geht hin\u2019 (just imagine, there is a war and nobody joins), we imagine what comes of bureaucracy when nobody fills out the forms. When we refuse to cooperate with the system that has hijacked our university, we make a step towards reclaiming and recreating the university. It\u2019s not visible to most, but these forms of protest play a part in recreating the university as a space for learning and discovery.

Because large cities are at the crossroads of these two levels, they are at the forefront of the fight against climate change. This is why, we, the European capitals and metropolises that represent more than 60 million inhabitants and have significant investment capacity (\u20ac2tn GDP), have decided to join forces and strengthen the instruments that will lead us toward the energy and environmental transition.  We are addressing the major causes of greenhouse gas emissions: polluting transport, old and/or poorly isolated buildings and energy supply.  In parallel, we are launching ambitious projects such as tackle urban sprawl, (re)introduce nature and biodiversity in our cities, improve recycling, fight against waste, move us towards a circular economy, prioritize public transport, increase electrical mobility, refurbish buildings and improve energy efficiency.  Job creation and the seeking of partnerships with rural neighbouring territories are a crucial challenge to succeed. During this meeting in Paris, on March, 26, 2015, we pledge to move further with our respective climate plans.  The second level of action is the European level. Time has now come for European capitals and metropolises to pool our efforts to tackle climate change. This requires a closer dialogue between cities through a more regular exchange of expertise and good practices.    Related: Leaders of European cities make pledge to tackle climate change    The European diplomacy of cities, respectful of the diversity of territories and local cultures intends to gain rapid and sustainable momentum. Within the European Union, it must be better supported by the European parliament and commission and should benefit from direct European funding.  We must proceed even further by promoting the coordination of public investments on a voluntary basis. Together, European metropolises represent a very substantial public procurement market of about \u20ac10bn per year and this has a leverage effect on the private sector that very often aligns its own requirements with the public sector.  These investment expenditures should be concentrated on the \u201cgreen\u201d sectors of the economy and \u201clow carbon\u201d industries (modernisation of production tools and innovation) and services. This is the initiative we are launching tomorrow in Paris: we strive to coordinate our public procurements to bring about the emergence of a more ecological offer. The Europe of cities is going to take shape through this bold and collaborative approach.  Lastly, we must be more involved at the global level. The efforts we are making, the policies we are pursuing in our cities must contribute to the adoption of a global agreement on climate. We must build on our networks of cities and local governments involved in climate action to create new global governance.  Since the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, 23 years ago, the United Nations has been trying to achieve an international consensus on the issue of climate change while its effects continue to worsen. Today, we have no alternative. The next climate summit in Paris in December 2015 must show that we are fully aware of what is at stake. European metropolises are already acting by proposing local solutions to tackle climate change.  Tomorrow, we will join other cities across the planet - in North and South America, in Africa, in Asia - which implement innovative local solutions. Together, thanks to the cities gathered in networks and in collaboration with citizens, NGOs, the scientific community, entrepreneurs and businesses we will make a difference.  Because cities are amongst the major contributors to climate change, it is our duty to find viable paths for our future. This is the full measure of the synergy between the mayors who are determined to share globally the solutions they have found locally.

This week students have been protesting to demand a fairer higher education system. We joined them to find out what they want from their universities.    Education is becoming more of a privilege and less of a right.  Harry Blain     Higher education protests: what\u2019s going on?  At the University of the Arts London (UAL) students have occupied the main reception room at UAL\u2019s Central St Martin\u2019s, after the university announced that it will cut student places on foundation courses.  Students at the London School of Economics (LSE) have also been in occupation, criticising what they see as the marketisation of their university and demanding change to the current education system. Students at King\u2019s College London (KCL) began an occupation on Wednesday afternoon. Student occupiers are demanding that their universities address their concerns over the marketisation of education, and that the government make education free and accessible for all.  We spoke to students inside the occupations to find out more.     Lucy Howell    \u2018There\u2019s been a lot of solidarity between universities\u2019 Lucy Howell, 18, a first year studying live events and television at UAL, says: There\u2019s been a lot of solidarity between universities. Everyone seems really supportive of what we\u2019re doing, including staff. The atmosphere\u2019s been lovely, there\u2019s been such a community feel. We\u2019ve had people who\u2019ve flown in from Amsterdam especially for the occupation at UAL and that is fantastic and shows how powerful our university is.      Margherita Asti    \u2018Occupations allow us to support the next generation of students\u2019 Margherita Asti, 21, a foundation student at London College of Communication, UAL, says: Occupations allow us to voice our opinions and support the next generation of students. Cuts will probably still happen, but students should make their voices heard and it\u2019s useful for staff to know how we feel.  The foundation course has been really helpful for me. I\u2019m from Italy and I\u2019d never done anything like it before \u2013 we have freedom to experiment with artistic methods. I decided to do it because I didn\u2019t know what I wanted to do afterwards, and I probably wouldn\u2019t have worked this out without the foundation course.     Ben Morgan    \u2018I\u2019ve been inspired by other occupations around London\u2019 Ben Morgan, a second year philosophy student at KCL, says: I\u2019d been thinking about how unethical our university is for a long time, but there hasn\u2019t been much activism going on among students here. We\u2019ve been inspired by the other occupations that have sprung up around London over the last week. The things King\u2019s invests in are unethical, the pay of managers isn\u2019t transparent and there\u2019s a bad ratio between the highest and lowest paid workers. Tuition fees are decided by the government rather than King\u2019s, so we want to focus our occupation on things our university can do to improve the lives of students, academics and other workers.     Rebecca Livesey-Wright    \u2018Our government is devaluing education\u2019 Rebecca Livesey-Wright, 22, a third year studying criticism, communication and curation at Central Saint Martins, UAL, says: Taking part in the occupation at UAL has been difficult but really fun. I\u2019ve been very stressed but I\u2019m been having a good time. I\u2019ve learned a lot about occupying, about negotiating and about politics, and also about management, as no one\u2019s talked to us about our demands.  Ultimately it\u2019s about how the cuts are part of the wider issues around education and politics in this country at the moment. I think it says a lot about the way that our government and our university devalue education.      Harry Blain    \u2018Education is becoming more of a privilege and less of a right\u2019 Harry Blain, 22, a conflict studies master\u2019s student at LSE, says: Education is becoming more of a privilege and less of a right. Occupations can fizzle out \u2013 there are moments when students wonder what they\u2019re achieving. We want others to start asking questions, because most aren\u2019t politically active. Occupations can make students feel guilty for spending time away from their studies, but this is part of the problem. We\u2019re so stuck in structures of learning that we don\u2019t have much time to think for ourselves, so being in that room and talking freely to each other is probably one of the best things about it.     Shelly Asquith    \u2018The higher education curriculum is failing black students\u2019 Shelly Asquith, 24, president of UAL student union and former Central Saint Martins student, says:  It\u2019s really important that students and staff are making a stand against cuts to foundation courses. Foundation courses have a wide demographic \u2013 there\u2019s a huge number of black and working class students on them. The foundation course is free if you\u2019re under 19 and not an international student \u2013 so it\u2019s one of the last bastions of education for education\u2019s sake. We\u2019ve got people here supporting us from LSE, Sheffield, Goldsmiths and UCL because these cuts are a symbol of what\u2019s going on across education.     Rose Parker    \u2018Occupations can be very effective\u2019 Rose Parker, 22, third year painting student at Wimbledon College of Art, UAL, says: We blame the government for raising tuition fees and forcing universities into situations they wouldn\u2019t necessarily want to be in. But we also blame the management style of the universities, who could be handling this a lot better.  Occupations can be very effective \u2013 especially because of the prominent location of the one at UAL. It publicises the cause and lets university management know very quickly that something\u2019s going on.

Across the street is a small football pitch but there is no one playing. Bogarde takes his seat in a quiet area of the hotel restaurant and, for the first time in his life, opens up about the four notorious years at Chelsea. Wearing an expensive-looking watch and a ring on his wedding finger Bogarde is polite and smiles easily, though he offers glimpses of hurt and anxiety as the former Champions League, Eredivisie and La Liga winner is frank about the lost seasons that ended his career so sourly. Accompanied by his manager, he confesses to loneliness, despair, an understanding of why he is viewed as greedy and, most poignantly, regret. This is the regret caused by drawing a \u00a340,000-a-week salary that earned him nearly \u00a310m between 2000 and 2004 while making only 12 appearances for Chelsea. The first surprise is Bogarde is back in football, eager to be involved in a sport he virtually fell out of love with. \u201cI am a trainer-coach,\u201d the 44-year-old says. Louis van Gaal was Bogarde\u2019s great mentor, harnessing his talents as a tough defender at Ajax where he was part of the 1995 squad who won the Champions League, before later taking him to Barcelona. However, while Van Gaal is now the Manchester United manager, Bogarde is unemployed. \u201cAt the moment I don\u2019t have a club,\u201d he says, pausing for a moment. \u201cI\u2019m doing master classes in defence, individually, until I\u2019m going to get a job.\u201d     Winston Bogarde insists he would have loved to have gone on loan whilst at Chelsea, and says would have taken a 30% cut in wages. Photograph: Irina Popova for the Guardian    The challenge, though, for Bogarde is to rebuild a shattered public image. On 31 August 2000 he was signed by Gianluca Vialli for Chelsea. At 29 this was the final big move of a high-flying career. However, on leaving Stamford Bridge in the summer of 2004, nearly two years had passed since he last kicked a ball. That appearance \u2013 his final as a professional \u2013 was on 6 November 2002, as a substitute in a 2-1 League Cup win over Gillingham. It was his only run-out of the 2002-03 season. In Bogarde\u2019s second and fourth years \u2013 2001-02 and 2003-04 \u2013 there were none. The best return was the 11 appearances of the first season, in which he made his four starts for the club. Bogarde came to represent the greedy, modern-day footballer. The conclusion was if he was desperate to play he would have agreed a loan move or cut a deal with Chelsea and been released. So, what did happen? \u201cVialli bought me and when I had been there a week he got sacked,\u201d Bogarde says of the Italian coach\u2019s removal on 12 September 2000. \u201cYou have to look who the new manager\u2019s going to be and if you\u2019re still going to get a chance.\u201d Six days later Claudio Ranieri was appointed and hopes began to fade. \u201cI didn\u2019t play that much,\u201d Bogarde says. \u201cAnd I was already like 30, 31. So I wanted to end my career good.\u201d     Winston Bogarde won the Champions League with Ajax in 1996 under current Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal. Photograph: Irina Popova for the Guardian    Together with Ranieri\u2019s appointment, Bogarde points to Chelsea\u2019s finances in those pre-Roman Abramovich days. \u201cThey had to cut costs. My situation was not very good and we tried to solve it many ways. Like to maybe go on loan or sell me, or whatever. But in the end it didn\u2019t work out \u2026 \u201d As he trails off I ask Bogarde if there was a particular fall-out with Ranieri. \u201cNot fall-out. Sometimes you had situations when the manager is telling you: \u2018OK now you\u2019re going to get a fair chance\u2019. And two weeks later that changed,\u201d he says. \u201cI was feeling hurt as a player. If it was from him or the club, I don\u2019t know \u2013 it was very difficult to get a chance.\u201d Bogarde says Trevor Birch\u2019s appointment as Chelsea chief executive in March 2002 sealed his fate. \u201cCutting costs was his speciality. Chelsea\u2019s a fantastic club and of course he only did his job. But sometimes you\u2019re dealing with people and have to look for solutions \u2013 for the club, for the player. And we talked about those things. But they were very uncompromising.\u201d Bogarde states he would have gone on loan but Chelsea insisted his full wage be paid. \u201cA club could not pay my whole salary, they could maybe pay 70%,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd they asked Chelsea to pay the other 30% and Chelsea said: \u2018No. If you want to take him it\u2019s going to be 100% or nothing. He is going nowhere\u2019.\u201d Bogarde claims he would have been content to take a 30% cut in wages. \u201cOf course. For a player, for me, it\u2019s terrible not to play. Yet I had to return for training. Return looking for the next solution, you understand?\u201d Did Chelsea try to make him take a cut in his salary? \u201cNo, they didn\u2019t try that,\u201d he says. Bogarde, who is from Rotterdam, made his professional debut for Sparta Rotterdam in 1991 before joining Ajax three years later. An unused substitute by Van Gaal in the triumphant 1995 Champions League final \u2013 Milan were defeated 1-0 \u2013 Bogarde won two Eredivisie titles, the Uefa Super Cup and Intercontinental Cup before leaving for Milan in 1997. After half a season in Italy he rejoined Van Gaal at Barcelona in January 1998.     Winston Bogarde, rear, was a substitute during Ajax\u2019s 1995 Champions League triumph. Action Images Photograph: Action Images    At Camp Nou, Bogarde collected two La Liga winner\u2019s medals, the Copa del Rey and a second Uefa Super Cup while playing alongside some of the game\u2019s aristocrats Rivaldo, Lu\u00eds Figo and Hristo Stoichkov. He was also a member of Holland\u2019s Euro 96 squad \u2013 Bogarde played in the 4-1 defeat by England in the group phase \u2013 and would have been selected for the World Cup semi-final against Brazil at France 98 but broke a leg in training. Given his pedigree and experience it seems surprising Bogarde was not viewed as an asset by Chelsea. Yet despite pictures from the time that suggest he gained weight, and the sense he stagnated at the club, Bogarde insists fitness and attitude were not issues. \u201cI was working hard because if the club needs you, the team needs you, or if another teams need you \u2013 you need to be ready,\u201d he says. \u201cI had some injuries also. I hurt my knee \u2013 three or four months I was out. So these things come mentally in your head.\u201d And the perception he was happier to be paid than play? \u201cI can imagine people from the outside seeing it like that,\u201d says Bogarde. \u201cPeople think: \u2018Oh he\u2019s just sitting there for his money\u2019. But it was not like that.\u201d Bogarde shows a first moment of regret. \u201cIf I could do it over I would have done it very differently,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd the people of Chelsea would also maybe take a different decision.\u201d Asked what Bogarde would change there is no clear answer. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination for the both of us [him and the club] \u2013 we would do it very differently and come with the best solution.\u201d Bogarde laughs when asked if he resided in England when at the club, saying he lived for two years in Windsor and for two years at Chelsea Harbour. \u201cYes, of course,\u201d he says. The question is asked because of the stories he flew in for training from the Netherlands each morning. This is flatly denied. \u201cOf course not. I don\u2019t understand how people come to these ridiculous stories, or lies or whatever. I\u2019ve always been in the training at Chelsea, I\u2019ve always been on time. I\u2019ve never skipped training or I was never sick. I never [have] problems in any way with the club or in private matters. My relationship with people of Chelsea \u2013 the real people \u2013 is from the coffee lady to the kit man.\u201d     Graeme Le Saux and Winston Bogarde mess about in a Chelsea training session in 2002. Photograph: Andy Couldridge/Action Images    Bogarde did become lonely. \u201cMentally it was very hard,\u201d he says. \u201cTo keep the motivation it\u2019s very difficult but since I was very young I had to cope with a lot of difficult situations and each I overcame.\u201d Bogarde, who has five children, however, had the support of his family. \u201cI had a relationship and I had my kids, yes,\u201d he says. The Dutchman, however, cannot recall his final appearance in professional football. \u201cI really couldn\u2019t tell you \u2013 maybe you can tell me \u2013 but it must be a long time ago.\u201d Told this was 6 November 2002 and that he came on as a 69th-minute substitute in a League Cup tie against Gillingham, Bogarde says: \u201cYeah, it\u2019s possible.\u201d On finally leaving Chelsea had he completely fallen out of love with football? \u201cNot completely. But because it was a tough time for me, yeah, I\u2019d had enough of the tough world of football,\u201d he says. There was a final attempt to revive his career in summer 2004. \u201cBecause you didn\u2019t want to end like that so I have the feeling: \u2018OK, if I can push still one year out of me it would be great.\u2019 But I got injured [training] at Ajax. And for my body it was, no, it\u2019s OK now.\u201d That was 11 years ago. What has he been doing since? \u201cHaving fun. But it didn\u2019t last that long, because I\u2019ve been in football all my life,\u201d Bogarde says. There were ventures into the business world, though he denies some stories: \u201cNo, I didn\u2019t have a gaming club.\u201d But he did have \u201can entertainment company, yeah. We did parties and concerts. It was fun.\u201d There was also a book about his life called: \u201cThis Negro bows to Nobody\u201d. Asked about the title, Bogarde says: \u201cI\u2019m a black person, so I don\u2019t have problem with that word. I didn\u2019t \u2013 for me \u2013 [think of] it as a bad word.\u201d Now, despite holding a Uefa Pro Licence, he\u2019s struggling to find an opportunity. Bogarde unsuccessfully applied for the Motherwell manager\u2019s job and recently did the same at Oldham Athletic. Bogarde accepts clubs may be wary of giving him an opportunity because of what happened at Chelsea. \u201cIf people have that in the backs of their mind, that could be a negative for me,\u201d he says. \u201cBut that has been when I was a player. I\u2019m a trainer-coach now. Many people, players, ex-pros have been in problems and I see they are trainer-coaches now. So why should that be like a heavy sword on my back? \u201cIt\u2019s still dragging with me, maybe all my life. Everybody makes mistakes and I\u2019ve learned from it but you need to go on.\u201d     Winston Bogarde has struggled to find opportunities in football, despite holding a Uefa Pro Licence. Photograph: Irina Popova for the Guardian    It is clear Bogarde wants to remake his life and reputation. He lights up when he talks about football. \u201cAm I content? Yeah, I\u2019m content but I want to be on the pitch. I have my badges already a few years and I\u2019m just waiting for a chance to do what I can.\u201d The Chelsea experience will allow him to speak directly to footballers about the game\u2019s pitfalls. \u201cYou can teach them not to make kinds of decisions in a critical moment in their career,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m trying to use the experience of my whole career to pass it on to the young players.\u201d When asked the one thing he would say to any young footballer, Bogarde\u2019s answer is telling. \u201cI can understand that when you\u2019re young and making a lot of money there are a lot of circumstance around you \u2013 people are pulling at you, girls are coming, you want to have good time,\u201d he says. \u201cBut you have to understand that all those things are thanks to football. So football needs to be in first place to keep that focus, to keep that discipline and it can take you very far.\u201d Bogarde\u2019s hope now is that football will take him back in. He certainly deserves a second chance.", "sentences": ["Winston Bogarde is smartly dressed in a black suit and looks well as he arrives early for our meeting on the outskirts of Amsterdam."], "title": "Winston Bogarde: At Chelsea I was feeling hurt.

She had already changed her country twice, her name twice, and been married once, a brief marriage of convenience to Wilhelm Uhde, art critic and collector. He was homosexual; she was under social pressure from her family in Russia. Being married gave her an excuse to stay in Paris. Uhde remained a lifelong friend, but in the artist Delaunay, a pioneer of abstraction, she found a soulmate. Together, they became quite the avant-garde power couple. Born Sarah Stern in Ukraine, Sonia had been sent at a young age to live with her uncle and aunt in St Petersburg. They were highly cultivated, well-to-do Jews, and Sonia adopted their surname. She altered her first name, too, and as Sonia Terk set off to study painting in Germany. At 21, she made her way to Paris in search of freedom, vitality and youth \u2013 which she found. A photograph from 1908 shows her seated at a table in a dark, fussy dress, all buttons and pleats (albeit with bare forearms). She is already looking middle-aged. A photo taken five years later shows Sonia posing in a loose patchwork outfit of her own creation, made in dynamic, contrasting \u201csimultan\u00e9\u201d style. She appears years younger, and ready to dance. The first works in the Tate Modern\u2019s forthcoming show are from Sonia\u2019s pre-Paris youth. They are oil-on-canvas portraits and landscapes, which owe much to Gauguin, with colours that leap from the walls. This early fascination with colour would determine the rest of her long career. The figurative element duly fell away (although it would reappear from time to time) and soon she was producing vibrant abstracts. Her aunt in St Petersburg had died bequeathing her property, and Robert was a minor aristocrat, so the Delaunays enjoyed a private income. Together they entertained and held salons. Among their friends were artists such as Kandinsky and Chagall, and the poets Guillaume Apollinaire and Blaise Cendrars.     Bathing suits designed by Delaunay, c1920s.    In this case, the pram in the hall was not the enemy of promise. (In any case, surely poverty is the more likely candidate.) It is still rare, however, for a cradle cover to be given gallery space and acknowledged as an important artwork. The little blanket Sonia stitched for her son, Charles, in 1911 is to be exhibited, and it seems to have been a breakthrough piece which moved her from figurative work to abstract. The coverlet is a patchwork medley of pinks, creams and greens with hints of maroon and black. It shows how Sonia melded Russian folk-craft with Parisian avant garde, and anticipated the experiments with colour and shape that would become the Delaunay hallmark style, simultan\u00e9. As well as the baby quilt, there is on display the child\u2019s painted toy box, and the outfit Sonia made in the same manner, the one in the photograph mentioned above: by 1913 the Delaunays had found a babysitter and were setting off to the dancehall, the Bal Bullier. As well as making clothing for herself and her friends, Sonia still painted. Next to the dress, which is composed of swatches of fabric in different textures, is her large canvas Bal Bullier. A flow of colour and rhythm, it shows several couples (or one couple twirling) under a new Parisian sensation: coloured electric lights. It\u2019s possible Sonia steered herself away from painting to give Robert space to pursue his, so they could work alongside each other on their mutual project without coming into direct competition. Sonia chose to work increasingly in needlework. She was happy to emphasise her Russian background (though not her Jewishness), as the Russian folk arts were fashionable and undergoing a revival. It may also have been that Sonia and other modernists saw no distinction between fine art and applied art. She was after all a cross\u2011cultural polyglot, accustomed to translating and changing modes of expression. Why shouldn\u2019t her aesthetic manifest itself now as a painting on a wall, now as a dress, now as a book-binding? Her art was wearable, it was the lifestyle statement of a new breed: the creative modern woman. Thus simultan\u00e9, which Sonia and Robert were to practise all their lives, came into being. What was it? A movement, a style, an aesthetic adventure? (Cendrars called it a \u201ctechnique\u201d.) A Russian-French fusion, it rejoiced in the movement and contrast of colours and their loquacity. It relished the dynamic created when this colour or shade was parked next to that, and perceived at once, simultaneously. In Sonia\u2019s work, there is lively movement and rhythm. (\u201cContrast is love,\u201d said Cendrars.) Colour was language. Every sound had its hue.     Yellow Nude (1908)    Cendrars was another cross-cultural polyglot, and soon he and Sonia were collaborating on a book, La prose du Transsib\u00e9rien et de la Petite Jehanne de France (1913). A glorious two metres long by 20cm wide, folded concertina-like into a hand-painted sleeve, the work presents Cendrars\u2019s travel poem on the right in differently coloured fonts, and Delaunay\u2019s tumbling artwork on the left \u201cinterpreting through colours and their shades the themes and feelings expressed by the poetic text\u201d. A triumph of synaesthesia, it hears the poem\u2019s sounds as colour, its rhythms as shapes. At the bottom is a little red Eiffel Tower, a motif that appeared over and over again in the work of both Robert and Sonia Delaunay, as the dernier cri in modernity. This couple at the centre of avant-garde Paris, champions of each other, were on holiday in Spain at the outbreak of the first world war. There they remained until later moving to Portugal. They painted and exhibited and formed contacts that would stand them in good stead. Sonia again produced large canvases, which are as far from the mud of Flanders as can be imagined. Emerging from her unmistakable arcs and bows are market scenes and flamenco singers.     Coat made for Gloria Swanson (1924)     If it was a charmed life, the Russian revolution put a brief halt to it. Sonia relied on letting her properties in St Petersburg, but in 1917 the Bolsheviks seized them and the flow of money stopped. It must have been a shock. In their 30s, for the first time the Delaunays had to find a way to make a living. With her needlework and design skills, Sonia was better placed than the more delicate Robert. In Madrid, the couple had met Diaghilev, and soon Sonia was designing costumes for the Ballets Russes\u2019 Cleopatre. The move into commerce was a mere shimmy for the simultan\u00e9 aesthetic. Never backwards in coming forwards, by the mid-1920s Sonia had a Paris studio dedicated to creating textiles and clothing, and she opened a fashion house called simply Sonia. The once avant-garde experiment was proving its worth, with the word simultan\u00e9 registered as a brand name in France and the US. The central decades of this retrospective are suggestive of an upmarket shopping experience. Boutique windows are recreated with embroidered shoes and bags arranged as Sonia herself decreed. Her fabrics are displayed on mechanical moving rollers for full dynamic effect. There are fabric samples, risque bathing costumes and driving caps for modern girls who drove the newfangled motor cars. It may have been modern, but it was artisanal and expensive, of course. If Sonia\u2019s main aesthetic changed little over decades, and what began as a radical exploration of colour contrasts became a fashionable brand, is it art? Or design? Or, indeed, both at once \u2013 simultan\u00e9? Here was painting enacted, sensualised. It was performance art brought to us by fashion models. Sonia attracted wealthy clients: a woollen embroidered coat was made in 1925 for the movie star Gloria Swanson, in geometric shades of rich spicy reds, browns and creams. In these fashion creations, straight lines predominate as diamonds and stripes and straight-edged lines turn at right angles. It\u2019s as if the excitement of the whirling ballroom has been supplanted by the glamour of the road. But not for long: in the 1930s the curves and wheels and arcs were very much back. For four more decades Sonia designed fabrics for the Amsterdam luxury store Metz and Co, and latterly for Liberty. She didn\u2019t abandon the poets, it must be said. A \u201cpoem-curtain\u201d of the time has verses by the surrealist Philippe Soupault embroidered in wool. She made \u201cpoem-dresses\u201d \u2013 words that walked \u2013 and lectured at the Sorbonne on \u201cthe influence of painting on clothing design\u201d.     Rhythm Colour no. 1076 (1939)    Sonia\u2019s life kept pace with the century. Simultan\u00e9 was devised at the dawn of the modern world, its works hand-painted and hand-stitched. By the 1930s she was aware of the possibilities of mass \u2013 and machine \u2013 production. She said: \u201cIn this way, fashion will become democratic, and this \u2026 can only be welcome, as it will raise general standards.\u201d One wonders what she would have made of shops such as Zara, or H&amp;M. When the second world war broke out and Paris was occupied, Sonia\u2019s Jewishness suddenly became relevant. It\u2019s said that her son, Charles, a noted promoter and critic of jazz who joined the resistance during the war, didn\u2019t know that his mother was Jewish until very late in the day. In 1940, the Delaunays quit Paris and moved south, but by this time Robert was ill. He died in 1941. He had painted constantly, and exhibited widely while supporting his wife in her ventures as she extolled his. She championed his legacy after his death by organising retrospective exhibitions and making gifts of his work, seeking to secure his reputation as one of the great pioneers of abstraction. With Robert gone, Sonia turned to painting in oil and gouache. The tones are more muted, more grainy, less bright and freewheeling than La Prose du Transsib\u00e9rien, with semi-circles arranged along diagonal or vertical axes. Robert has his place, but was not Sonia also a great pioneer? A trenchant essay by Griselda Pollock in the exhibition catalogue presents a feminist view. Modernist culture, Pollock says, made it possible for ambitious and creative women to enjoy new freedoms, and Paris was their centre. However, these modernists did not write their own history. The history of modernism was set down in the 1950s, a difficult decade for women, and it was written by masculinist fogeys. The contribution of women has been ignored, especially where a woman\u2019s work moved fluidly between art and design. Thus, for a long time, Sonia Delaunay was regarded as the helpmeet or wife-of-the-more-famous Robert. This is the first UK retrospective of her work, almost 40 years after her death. It\u2019s the first to assess her as an independent artist. The task, the curators insist, is not to assert that she was better than her husband, but to see her contribution clearly and fully, and in its own right.     Simultan\u00e9 playing cards (1964).    Fortunately, Sonia lived long. By the time of her death in 1979, a new women\u2019s movement was under way and her vibrant contribution to modern art, a counterpoint to a miserable century, was being recognised. Perhaps she was even seen as a safe bet: President Pompidou made a gift of her painting Rythmes-Couleurs no 1633 to President Nixon during an official visit. She remained modern to the last; even late in life, she associated herself with the new and exciting. A snazzy car, a Matra 530, was decorated by her in 1967, when she was 82. The curved lines of the car are painted in large race-flag checks of sky-blue and royal blue, sage green and red. It is art in motion. Sonia ensured that at speed, the colours merged to blue, so as not to distract other drivers. Among her last works are paintings and etchings, which hark back both in technique and style to the early years of her career. She was by then a French national treasure, but the young Russian who had arrived in Paris full of vigour was still in evidence. A shape or rhythm explored in the 1920s could manifest itself again in the 60s. Is that to say her work didn\u2019t change, didn\u2019t develop? Perhaps she had a different idea of time, more like a spiral than an arrow. A piece called Rhythme sans fin, danse, made in 1964, is subtitled \u201cAfter a watercolour of 1923\u201d. The clue is in the name; the dance goes on. Colour is joy. Abstraction denies history. As Sonia herself said: \u201cAbstract art is only important if it is the endless rhythm where the very ancient and the distant future meet.\u201d  Sonia Delaunay is at Tate Modern, London SE1, from 15 April to 9 August. tate.org.uk.

Thanks to the strong pound, UK travellers will have up to 22% more to spend than a year ago. The study, which compares the cost of common holiday expenses in 28 popular city-break destinations, reports a drop in prices at three-quarters of the cities that were studied. The biggest fall in prices is in the Austrian capital of Vienna, where prices have plunged 22.2% year-on-year. A weekend stay in Vienna is now markedly cheaper than one in Amsterdam, Copenhagen or Paris. Although Stockholm has also seen prices fall significantly, with a 14% reduction overall, it remains the most expensive city-break destination in Europe for the third consecutive year. On the other hand, Vilnius has emerged as the most affordable city in Europe \u2013 after a year-on-year price drop of 15%. Visitors to the Lithuanian capital require \u00a3100 in order to cover a three-course evening meal for two with wine, drinks, two nights\u2019 accommodation, airport transfers, sightseeing attraction costs and public transport.       Cities in eastern Europe and the Baltic continue to be among the cheapest destination in Europe. In Prague, dinner for two can cost just \u00a323.94, \u2013 \u00a350 less than the equivalent meal in Stockholm.  Accommodation prices tell the same story. Two nights in a three-star hotel in Riga costs \u00a336, while cities such as Tallinn, Vilnius, Budapest and Athens also offer the same for around \u00a350. Tourists visiting cities such as London, Barcelona or Rome can expect to pay 2-3 times this price.  Venice, Italy, is the most expensive destination to get around in. A 48-hour travel card costs visitors \u00a322. London is the fifth most expensive city in this category, with the cost of the equivalent travel card priced at over \u00a315. In Riga and Tallinn, however, a weekend zipping around on public transport will cost you \u00a33.74.

In the Portuguese capital a bottle of local lager will cost you on average 97p. Lisbon is the most affordable in this category, closely followed by Vilnius, Prague and Krakow. In cities such as London, Venice, Paris and Rome you can expect to pay between \u00a33-\u00a34.  \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win situation for UK holidaymakers this year in European cities because prices are down in the majority of cities we surveyed, thanks to the soaring value of sterling,\u201d said Andrew Brown of Post Office Travel Money. \u201cHowever, prices continue to vary significantly in different cities.

Networking in the day and partying at night is becoming the new norm. The change is due partly to audiences searching for a more sophisticated holiday experience, as well as a growing number of people trying to make it as music producers and looking to learn the magic formula from others. In addition to new festivals emerging to meet this demand, established events are hosting areas where punters can try out equipment and learn from musicians. This year, Croatia\u2019s leading festival, Outlook, which is held in an abandoned fort in Pula, is ramping up its \u201cKnowledge Arena\u201d, a cross between a working musicians\u2019 studio and a trade fair, on the beach amid the revellers. There will be lectures from artists and DJs, and software companies such as Ableton and Serato will give festivalgoers the chance to try out new technology. \u201cAudiences are now rejecting the traditional top-down, spoon-fed music event and curators are having to work hard to stay ahead of the curve,\u201d said John Alexiou, founder of audio technology company SubPac, which will be hosting a daytime space at the Knowledge Arena. \u201cExploration has become a big part of the festival experience and crowds are increasingly keen to get immersed into the latest technologies and learn about the industry from their favourite artists.\u201d Although some festivals, such as Texas\u2019s SXSW, Sonar in Barcelona and Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE), have been doing this for a while, organisers say the daytime programmes are becoming more popular. Richard Zijlma, general manager of ADE, said that the business conference side of the festival has grown quickly over the last three years and, with guest speakers such as Detroit\u2019s techno pioneers Robert Hood and Juan Atkins this year, it is now the primary focus. \u201cIt\u2019s taken off in a way we couldn\u2019t have imagined,\u201d said Zijlma. \u201cThis year we are expecting around 5,500 conference visitors and we\u2019ve got panellists from all sides of the industry, from artists, managers, technology and social media experts, to environmental speakers, composers and radio representatives.\u201d According to avant-garde musician Matthew Herbert, who recently spoke about music, art and technology alongside trip-hop rapper Tricky at London\u2019s new Convergence festival, the popularity of educational music events such as this is inevitable. \u201cNow, more than ever, there is a real appetite to explore the creative process,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the past, we had more straightforward information about our favourite music via record sleeves, TV appearances and carefully controlled industry-led narratives about how and why the music was made,\u201d he said. \u201cThese days, places like iTunes are almost entirely devoid of anything but the barest of information relating to the music. These festivals are encouraging a dialogue where previously the artists were unreachable. To me it feels logical.\u201d Another explanation is found in the dance music revival. As well as wanting to understand the creativity of others, young musicians are increasingly looking for the magic formula to take them to the next level of success. \u201cThis could be a production tip, a unique mic, a special mixing desk or a meeting with an influential person,\u201d said Herbert. \u201cThere is so much music being made now that it has become a disposable product and it\u2019s harder to make a long-term career from it when there\u2019s so many people fighting for space. These lineups are about sharing ideas and getting your music noticed.\u201d Glenn Max, curator of Convergence, agreed, adding: \u201cAfter 30-40 years of festival culture, including its peak as an industry in the last 10 years, audiences today are looking for a more complete experience. They want to see their favourite artists speaking about their own creative development, be a part of a conversation and use some brainpower before they party.\u201d", "sentences": ["\u201cExploration has become a big part of the festival experience and crowds are increasingly keen to get immersed into the latest technologies and learn about the industry from their favourite artists.\u201d Although some festivals, such as Texas\u2019s SXSW, Sonar in Barcelona and Amsterdam Dance Event (ADE), have been doing this for a while, organisers say the daytime programmes are becoming more popular."], "title": "Networking by day beats partying at night as Europe\u2019s festivals move with the times", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/mar/29/music-festivals-networking-education-conferences", "tags": ["Festivals", "Culture", "Festivals", "Travel", "Music", "World news", "Croatia"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-03-29T07:00:06Z", "article": "Obaro Ejimiwe, who records as Ghostpoet, was born in south London in 1983. He studied media production in Coventry and spent nearly a decade making music \u2013 and working in call centres to pay the bills \u2013 before he got noticed. His debut album, Peanut Butter Blues &amp; Melancholy Jam, was nominated for a Mercury prize in 2011 and his third album, Shedding Skin, came out earlier this month. This summer he plays Wychwood, Parklife, Womad and Festival No 6. The record that reminds me of my childhood Food for Thought, UB40 (1980) I remember dancing to this as a kid at Christmas time in our two-bedroom flat in Tooting Bec [in south London]. We had a dodgy vinyl copy and you had to put a two-pence piece on the needle to stop it from skipping, but I was obsessed with putting it on. (My dad had one of those big wooden HMV record players and if you touched it without his permission, you\u2019d get bollocked.) There was something about this track, and the saxophone intro in particular, that pricked up my ears. Maybe the sadness it evoked struck a chord with me. My upbringing was all right \u2013 it wasn\u2019t bad \u2013 but I\u2019ve always been drawn to melancholic sounds.       The first song that stopped me in my tracks Cause a Rockslide, Badly Drawn Boy (2000) This song has soundtracked so many moments in my life. I remember buying Badly Drawn Boy\u2019s debut album [The Hour of Bewilderbeast] from Woolworths in Tooting Broadway when I was 17 and taking it home and playing it for hours and hours. There were so many layers to each track and I became obsessed with them. This particular track is so ramshackle: I imagine it like a collage of photographs cut out of a magazine and stuck together with masking tape. It felt steeped in emotion, but not emotions that I could fully understand at that age. I had no plan to make music back then: I was storing up songs like a hoarder hoarding teapots, for no particular reason.       The record that started me on a musical path Iambic 9 Poetry, Squarepusher (2004) I heard this track on an HMV Playlist CD when I was finishing my degree in Coventry and it stood out by a country mile. I was starting to dabble with production and it was astounding to hear a piece of music that wasn\u2019t afraid to break the rules. There\u2019s a section where it goes a bit mad and you\u2019re not sure what\u2019s going\u00a0to happen next, and then it comes back with this rolling jungle-style beat \u2013 when I played it to my mates they were all gobsmacked. It was a lightbulb moment for me: \u201cIt\u2019s possible to do that? Wow,\u00a0OK.\u201d The track that made me want to become a better writer Crucify Your Mind, Rodriguez (1970) This is such a beautiful, sad song. I loved the documentary Searching for Sugar Man \u2013 the struggles Rodriguez went through on his road to recognition really affected me. I bought the soundtrack the next day and was blown away by his lyrics: their potency, poetry and depth. Crucify Your Mind is such an amazingly well-written song that doesn\u2019t beat around the bush. It\u2019s like he\u2019s saying: \u201cI\u2019m here next to you right now and I know exactly what you\u2019re going through.\u201d       The record that always brings me to tears Pyramid Song, Radiohead (2001) I was obsessed with the album Amnesiac for years \u2013 I\u2019m a massive Radiohead fan \u2013 but I left it alone for a while to maintain my sanity, basically. A couple of years ago, just before my second album came out, I found the limited edition on vinyl in Amsterdam and brought it home. I was living in a little room in Dalston at the time. It was really late at night and I remember the wind howling outside and the window rattling away and it was all intertwined with the strings and Thom Yorke\u2019s voice. It wasn\u2019t a great time in my life and this was like a warm, melancholic blanket around me. Sad music can be a comfort in a weird way: it\u2019s like an understanding of the feelings you\u2019re going through. Thankfully I\u2019m in happier times now: it\u2019s blue skies in Tooting today!       The record that has become my eternal earworm The Passenger, Iggy Pop (1977) This song refuses to retire from my memory banks. Many a night I remember getting very silly to it on the dancefloor. The guitar line is so hypnotic and the bass just rattles your chest. I love the lyrics too. It\u2019s such a dark, toxic sonic journey. He\u2019s talking about the filth of the city he\u2019s living in but the song has quite a jolly melody. There\u2019s something about the juxtaposition of those two elements, the dark and the light, that always intrigues me, and I try to bring it into my own music.       Mannish Boy, Muddy Waters (1955) This song starts with the line \u201cEverything gonna be all right this morning\u201d, and I\u2019m just like, \u201cYeah, that\u2019s what I need to hear!\u201d It\u2019s the last track I play before leaving my house and the last track I play before going on stage. It\u2019s my phone ringtone as well. I\u2019m a bit obsessed with Muddy Waters \u2013 I have his face tattooed on my arm. There are so many versions of this song but I particularly like the one on Muddy \u201cMississippi\u201d Waters Live [1979]. It\u2019s so ramshackle and uncompromising and raw: it\u2019s just the bee\u2019s knees.       The last great record I heard Projections, Romare (2015) I really love the Romare album. It has a Detroit house feel and I haven\u2019t listened to that kind of stuff for ages, having been in an indie-rock bubble for such a long time. I heard one of his tracks, Prison Blues, on the radio and I was just like, \u201cWhat the hell is this?\u201d I can\u2019t find much info about him but I\u2019ve been listening to his album a lot. It\u2019s a great record: really deep and soulful but quite upbeat at the same time.

(Domino) What have been your most memorable festival experiences as a performer?I remember the first time Hot Chip played Glastonbury in 2005, we had two gigs and the first of those was at the Square Pie food tent. We played in the daytime without keyboard stands so we set up on the condiment tables. No one wanted to do the second one just because we\u2019d already dragged the equipment over all the mud. Have there been any disasters?Lovebox in 2007 where Joe [Goddard] and Owen [Clarke] overslept and missed the gig so there was just three of us waiting before we were due to go onstage. Owen walked onstage 20 minutes before the end and just played like he\u2019d been there the whole time, while Joe woke up after it was over. Why Make Sense?, out in May, is the first Hot Chip album since 2012. Are you excited to showcase it live?Very much so. We\u2019ve only played two shows so far, so we\u2019re raring to go. For festivals, we try to imagine that some of our songs have been hits and then put those ones in the festival set. There\u2019s a song on the album that mentions stage fright. Has that ever happened at a festival?Not really. I think I was talking more about the idea that all you have to do really is go on stage and play music, so if that\u2019s the worst of your fears then that\u2019s a pretty good position to be in. I do get quite nervous before any Glastonbury gig. In all the ways that people like Bruce Springsteen and Paul Simon have no idea why people care more about Glastonbury than other festivals, for us we have the exact opposite feeling of it being the most momentous occasion. It feels significant in your career and I guess that\u2019s hard for some people to grasp when they can play massive venues around the world. What\u2019s been the best performance you\u2019ve seen at a festival as a punter?I watched Neil Young at the Big Day Out festival in Australia on the tour where he was ending with A Day in the Life. That was pretty amazing. I got to see that festival gig a number of times because it\u2019s a touring festival, so I saw it from the front and from the side of the stage. If you could curate your dream festival who would be the three headliners?I\u2019d have Marvin Gaye one night, then I\u2019d like to see the Beach Boys circa 1971 and then I\u2019d love to see Kate Bush play a festival again. Have you guys had that perfect festival scenario of the sun setting just as you\u2019re playing?We\u2019ve been really lucky \u2013 at Coachella we had a perfect sunset set and that does make a big difference. But also the right environment can make a big difference in a different way, like playing at Sonar in a big tent at 2am and people are there to have a good time and they\u2019re at the peak of that time, let\u2019s say. They\u2019ve had all the right and wrong refreshments and that can make for an amazing atmosphere.Interview by Michael Cragg     St Vincent on stage in 2014: \u2018There\u2019s a wilder energy at festivals.\u2019 Photograph: London News Pictures/Rex    The critics\u2019 pick: St Vincent With her fourth, highly-lauded album (St Vincent, 2014) and theatrical live performances, St Vincent has established herself as one of contemporary music\u2019s most dazzling stars. She will perform at Roskilde, T in the Park and Green Man Your festival performances in 2014 blew a lot of minds. How do festivals compare with doing your own gigs?When I was conceiving this show, I wanted it to be scalable, so it could look good in a club, theatre, or festival stage. So aside from making sure the set was a little more rough and rowdy, the main difference is in the emotional state of the crowd \u2013 at festivals people might have been up for 72 hours and might not have had a shower in days which makes the stakes higher and makes the whole energy wilder. Who inspires you as a performer?The real showmen are inspiring, like James Brown \u2013 not that I ever got the chance to see him live \u2013 but also more insular performers like Mary Margaret O\u2019Hara. I like the pop and bang of showbiz but I also like pure vulnerability. Nick Cave will always be a highlight to see live. Also Michael Gira from Swans. Swans are a very inspiring to see because there\u2019s a full-on commitment to the art and Michael roams around with his hair slicked back, kind of like an alcoholic father\u2026 He gets in [the audience\u2019s] face and screams at them. I can\u2019t tell if that\u2019s an act or if he\u2019s actually screaming at them, but the effect is very powerful. Who would be your three dream festival acts?D\u2019Angelo, Wire and Sun Ra. I love them. All of them put on a show but for different reasons. They\u2019d all work well at a festival. You said in an interview with the Guardian last year \u201cI\u2019m not a festival person\u201d. How come?Oh no! What I meant to say is not that I\u2019m not a festival person, I quite like playing them, but I\u2019m not an outdoorsy person\u2026 I don\u2019t think I could go a day without a shower. I don\u2019t want to sleep in a tent. I just don\u2019t want to. I want running water and room service\u2026 Have you been to many festivals as a punter?I have some vague memories of going to Blockbuster Rockfest at the Texas Motor Speedway, where there\u2019s no shade, in the middle of the summer. We drove my sister\u2019s Saturn there with two big boxes of white zinfandel. There\u2019s nothing like being a teenager drunk on hideous boxed wine in the scorching sun. We stayed for maybe an hour tops before somebody puked and we all had to go home. It was the late 90s so I think there was Matchbox Twenty, Sugar Ray, No Doubt and maybe Bush playing. What\u2019s your worst festival experience?One moment last summer made me livid. We\u2019d flown from a festival in Trondheim in Norway (where we were on the bill with Warpaint \u2013 those girls are really fun) to Oslo and then to Amsterdam for I think Lowlands [festival], and they lost 18 of our 22 pieces of gear. And it was a tight schedule, just flying in on the day of the show and doing the gig. We played the most hobbling, limping show, because we didn\u2019t have any of our gear. And that made me so angry \u2013 spending all that time and effort to put on the show that we\u2019d worked very hard to create, and not being able to put on the right show because of a totally arbitrary circumstances. That drives me crazy when I feel like I let the fans down because of things that weren\u2019t in my control. In the past 12 months or so you\u2019ve gone from being a leftfield act to winning a Grammy and topping numerous \u201cbest album of 2014\u201d lists. What\u2019s that been like?Well, it\u2019s been really nice. I\u2019ve been in the midst of it for years, on tour, slowly pushing the boulder up the mountain\u2026 [And now] there\u2019s a demand for us to play in South America. The fans [there] are so great and so effusive. And that just wouldn\u2019t have happened a few years ago. So I notice it in terms of demand to play shows in places that are new and exciting, but in terms of my everyday life, friends and family, it\u2019s pretty much the same.Corinne Jones     Loyle Carner: \u2018It\u2019ll be a bit mad to be on stage at a festival.\u2019 Photograph: C Brandon/Redferns via Getty Images    The first-timer: Loyle Carner This south London MC is helping to rejuvenate British hip-hop with smart, heartfelt lyrics. His EP A Little Late is out now and he will perform at the Great Escape, Love Saves the Day, Liverpool Sound City and Blissfields Have you played any festivals before?No, this will be my first time. I\u2019ve always been on the other side of the equation, so it\u2019ll be a bit mad to be on stage. Are these going to be some of your biggest gigs so far?Yeah, I\u2019d say so. The biggest I\u2019ve played was probably at London Shepherd\u2019s Bush Empire when I was touring with [Brooklyn rapper] Joey Bada$$ last year. It was exciting to see someone my age putting on big shows and watching how they interact with the crowd. A learning experience?Big-time, because being a support act is quite difficult: you\u2019re standing on stage in front of people who have no idea who you are and you have to convince them that you\u2019re supposed to be there. I\u2019d be terrified. How do you deal with it?Well, I\u2019m half-Scottish, so I have a glass of whisky. My mum put me on to yoga as well, so I do a bit of yoga before. I still get nervous though. Yoga and whisky?Yeah, that\u2019s how I try to live my life. But I\u2019ve got so many shows under my belt now, it feels a lot more rehearsed: we\u2019ve ironed out all the creases. Your sound harks back to 90s hip-hop. Is that a conscious thing?Yeah, I grew up on it, and as I get older it\u2019s the one thing that sticks with me. Pete Rock, Common and J Dilla are big idols of mine. What are your ambitions?Just to continue to be heard and not compromise what I\u2019m doing \u2013 and to be able to put my little brother through university: that\u2019s my marker of success. Will he be coming to see you this summer?Yeah we\u2019ll smuggle him in \u2013 he\u2019s 13. Every time I\u2019m on stage I say, \u201cYeah my little brother\u2019s here but don\u2019t tell anyone.\u201d There have been a few issues, but I\u2019ll definitely get him along to the festivals, for sure.Killian Fox     Ride, pictured last year, with Mark Gardener second right: \u2018If you\u2019re gonna get back into it, do it properly!\u2019    The comeback: Mark Gardener, frontman of Ride After 20 years away, Britain\u2019s shoegaze pioneers are this summer\u2019s biggest festival comeback. They will play at Field Day, Primavera and Coachella There have been so many rumours of Ride getting back together over the years. What made you finally decide that this year was the one?We just needed things to align. Andy [Bell, guitarist] was pretty constricted with Oasis and then Beady Eye, for one thing. It\u2019s lovely [timing] though because it\u2019s 25 years since we released Nowhere\u2026 which does make me feel a bit old. So you\u2019ve planned for your first gig \u2013 literally your first in 20 years \u2013 to be Coachella. That\u2019s brave\u2026Yes, we\u2019re going to be the last band on before AC/DC on the main stage, which is 70,000 people. I guess if you\u2019re gonna get back into it, do it properly! I understand festivals are not everyone\u2019s cup of tea, so we\u2019re doing Field Day and Primavera and mixing it with other shows. We did big before though, we were the last band on before Public Enemy at Reading 92, and we did Glastonbury. I guess there\u2019s a challenge in that not everybody there is there to see you. You\u2019ve got to blow people away. What makes a good festival performance?I\u2019m not gonna mention any names but I think sometimes some bands can get a bit conservative, a bit bland. We\u2019re a lot more edgy and psychedelic and strange. Some people will be like \u201cWhat\u2019s this? What\u2019s going on?\u201d and some other people will really love it. I think we will polarize opinion a little bit. And we can\u2019t just come back and start where we left off, we\u2019ve got to move this up to another level. I\u2019m not going to start running around the stage like Bono or Freddie Mercury, but I am aware that these are bigger stages and you\u2019ve got to fill them. Festivals have come a long way since you disbanded. I remember seeing you at the Slough festival in 1991, which I seem to recall as more of a concrete car park with a stage at the end of it\u2026Ha! It wasn\u2019t such beautiful surroundings, for sure, but I remember loving that show. Festivals can be something almost transcendental and special for me: that warm summer air, everybody\u2019s outside\u2026 Purely from a spectator\u2019s point of view, some of the great nights of my life have been when I\u2019m a little bit lucid, and then a great band comes on in the evening at the festival and blows you away. What was your worst festival experience?As a punter I remember finding V festival pretty strange. An odd vibe, people throwing bottles around, not having a great time. I think I was spoiled because in the 90s and I would always go to Glastonbury when it wasn\u2019t as organised: just immense mayhem. Where do you stand on camping?When I first used to go to Glastonbury I just turned up without a tent and whatever happened happened. We camped backstage when we played Glastonbury, but I prefer camping with the masses. Backstage, lurking around the corner there would always be Radio Finland or something: \u201cOh Mark, can we do an interview?\u201d And you\u2019re just thinking \u201cMy head\u2019s in no zone to do an interview right now!\u201d Do you still go to festivals?I think it\u2019s great there are so many good festivals now for familes and kids. When my daughter Nancy gets a bit older I\u2019ll be happy taking her to a festival and she\u2019ll be embarrassed by her old man\u2026 She\u2019s only 11 months old, but I can tell she\u2019s already got a bit of festival spirit going on. There was always an element of screaming adoration as well as earnest shoegazing at Ride gigs. Looks-wise, you were the Harry Styles of your time\u2026It\u2019s weird, a few people have mentioned the Harry Styles thing! I found it all really odd to be honest with you. You like to think it\u2019s all about the music and [good looks] just put you in the mode of the pop star, that celeb thing. I wasn\u2019t really that comfortable with it. I\u2019m quite happy hiding behind a hat now and just focussing on the music. So what\u2019s definitely going to be on the setlist at your comeback gigs?I guess there\u2019s a few obvious ones that I can share\u2026 Leave Them All Behind and Dreams Burn Down are sounding amazing. Polar Bear is transformed. I feel quite blessed that we can do this again. There were definitely a good number of years, especially living in the wilds of rural France, where I was wondering where did it all go wrong? Will I ever feel that again? Now, back in a room together, you realise there\u2019s a real special chemistry and voodoo between these four people, which I\u2019ve not felt since. It just works. I appreciate it a hell of a lot more.Sarah Donaldson     Van McCann of Catfish and the Bottlemen at last year\u2019s Reading festival: \u2018the best day of my life\u2019. Photograph: Burak Cingi/Redferns via Getty Images    The crowd-pleasers: Catfish and the Bottlemen (Van McCann, frontman) The band from Llandudno who won hearts and minds at last year\u2019s festivals return with a top 10 album under their belts. They play Latitude, Reading and Leeds, Boardmasters and T in the Park You\u2019ve said previously that performing at Reading last year was \u201cthe best day of my life\u201d. How come?It was the moment for us. There\u2019d been bands on all day that magazines [had hyped], who\u2019d had the tents half full. We\u2019d had no hype, but when we came on there were about 6,000 people in and outside the tent \u2013 it was absolutely mad. Our sound guy was like, \u201cI couldn\u2019t even hear you, all I could hear was everyone else singing!\u201d Singing and crowdsurfing weren\u2019t enough for the crowd, they wanted to tear the place up and that\u2019s how we felt \u2013 it was just an explosive moment. It was the first time I\u2019d ever felt that kind of thing: \u201cWow, people believe in us, and we\u2019ve only just started, we\u2019re still 22.\u201d What\u2019s it going to be like this year?We\u2019ve gone up a step every year; this year at Reading and Leeds we\u2019re the last band on in the Radio 1 tent, so it\u2019s kind of a headline spot. It\u2019s going to be great. I hope everyone comes in to us feeling like they\u2019ve done everything they can do all night, but then after our gig, go, \u201cActually, I was just warming up\u201d. I cannot wait. How does playing at festivals compare with your own gigs?When we started doing festivals, doing the smaller stages, I never used to like it. You\u2019d have to drag all your stuff through the fest with all the punters going, \u201cWho are you?!\u201d and throwing beer at you. But now, when you get to go backstage and sit and have chicken by Arctic Monkeys, it\u2019s dead funny. We used to wait up [at night] to see Arctic Monkeys\u2019 video exclusives on Channel 4 and now we\u2019re sat by them eating chicken. Did you go to many festivals growing up?We used to buy one ticket to V festival between nine of us, slip it between the fence and all get in, it was class \u2013 none of us could afford \u00a3150 a ticket. I remember seeing the Streets there and he just blew the tent off. Camping: fun or torture?When we went to V we wouldn\u2019t bother with tents and would just sleep on the grass. No sleeping bags! We\u2019ve stopped that now. When you\u2019re 16 you think that\u2019s the way you do it, but you soon realise that isn\u2019t the life.

She will perform at End of the Road, the Great Escape and Somersault festival You performed at Green Man and Wilderness last year. What was that like?They were my first UK festivals, and I was really blessed to play such lovely spaces. Green Man was my favourite show I\u2019d ever done. I hadn\u2019t played many up until then, so it was refreshing and amazing to see there\u2019s such a music community at these festivals in the UK. How do you find playing at festivals compared with indoor venues?You have to really work it in a different way. Interacting with a particular audience and adapting to where you are, that\u2019s something I\u2019m still learning how to do. Who inspires you as a performer?I think Antony Hegarty [of Antony and the Johnsons] is a really great performer. And people who are sadly long gone, like Billie Holiday, Nina Simone, who had this timeless quality to them \u2013 almost effortless, but you could see that they really meant what they were singing. That\u2019s key for me. Who are you most excited about seeing at festivals this summer?Father John Misty at End of the Road, Tobias Jesso Jr at the Great Escape and Natalie Prass, who\u2019s just brought out a really great new album \u2013 she\u2019s at End of the Road too. What\u2019s the best festival performance you\u2019ve ever seen?I saw Bob Dylan at Feis, an Irish folk festival in Finsbury Park, a few years ago with my brother. I\u2019ve always been such a big fan of his \u2013 I did a cover of Maggie\u2019s Farm when I was eight, so seeing him play live was a highlight.

They will perform at Green Man, Field Day and Primavera How do you find playing at festivals compared with indoor venues?It\u2019s quite surreal: you\u2019re in a field on your own, go on stage in front of hundreds of people, play and leave. The general audience reaction at festivals is different from shows \u2013 at festivals people stand very still and stare at us for an hour, then afterwards tell us they love our band. And it\u2019s weird, because we\u2019ve all played in punk bands before, where people get really excited all the time. What have been your most memorable festival experiences?Probably when I saw Bonnie \u201cPrince\u201d Billy at Green Man in 2005. I\u2019m a big Will Oldham fan, and seeing him play with some of my favourite musicians was amazing. It\u2019s held in a valley and the music bounced back off this forest on a hill. It was so beautiful. Who inspires you as a performer?Fugazi are a really important band to me and they were always exciting to watch. There wasn\u2019t a real barrier between the band and the audience with them \u2013 I don\u2019t like the idea of musicians being placed on a pedestal. Who are you most excited about seeing at festivals this summer?Sleater-Kinney at Primavera, absolutely. Who would be your dream festival acts?Probably Fugazi, but they never played festivals. I\u2019d choose the Minutemen, H\u00fcsker D\u00fc, Sleater-Kinney, the Velvet Underground and Neil Young. Camping: fun or torture?The idea of playing a show and then having to camp without a shower is kind of gross to me \u2013 it was fun for the first few years, but I find it exhausting and dirty now. But if I\u2019m in the audience I don\u2019t have a problem with camping. What\u2019s your worst festival experience?I saw Smog at ATP about 10 years ago, and I was really sad about a girl at the time, so I cried. That was pretty low. I love Bill Callahan, but I still can\u2019t listen to the song he was playing. Top tip for festival-goers?Take ear plugs. I\u2019m really into making everyone wear ear plugs. Look after your hearing, because otherwise you won\u2019t be able to go to festivals any more. Kathryn Bromwich  This article was amended on 1 April to change Hot Chip\u2019s label to Domino.

As the end of my first year approaches, however, I\u2019m in no doubt that I made the right choice. After an international childhood spent living in four different countries, I wanted to be in a global city. I also wasn\u2019t sure which subject I wanted to study, and the liberal arts course at Amsterdam University College allows me to explore a range of options. The Netherlands is a very relaxed country \u2013 as shown by its liberal attitude towards drugs and prostitution \u2013 and this laid-back vibe is central to the student experience. Here\u2019s why Dutch student life trumps that in Britain. 1. You\u2019re a part of the place you live  Dutch universities typically offer fewer societies, so students take part in activities in their town or city \u2013 such as amateur sports teams and local choirs. I help to organise European Youth Parliament conferences in Amsterdam. Nicole Brusa, who studied at University College Roosevelt in Middleburg last year, volunteered at her local art museum. She spent weekends there, \u201cas a way of escaping the study bubble and doing something that has nothing to do with the university\u201d. Others volunteer at food banks, charities and even refugee camps. Brusa, who lived on campus, points out: \u201cYou need to meet people from outside the gated community that you live in. You know, the university world isn\u2019t real.\u201d     Phoebe (left) and a friend in Amsterdam    2. You cycle everywhere  The idea of jumping on your bike on a summer\u2019s day to cycle down Amsterdam\u2019s canals is pretty idyllic. But you have to cycle to get around every day, no matter what time of year. Cycling in sleety wind in January isn\u2019t always blissful, but it does mean you get daily exercise without any extra effort. Hero Scott, a British student at Amsterdam University College, says: \u201cThe Netherlands is designed for cyclists, so it\u2019s by far the best way to get around, whether you\u2019re going to the supermarket or the club.\u201d 3. Sport is an integral part of life  Children in the Netherlands are brought up playing multiple sports from a young age and, unlike in England, they keep this up as they get older \u2013 and that includes the girls. \u201cMost of my friends have played field hockey, tennis and football from the moment they could walk,\u201d says Hannah Drooglever Fortuyn, a student at the University of Amsterdam. Their sports teams often aren\u2019t related to the university, giving students another chance to expand their friendship circles. 4. There\u2019s time to travel  At Dutch universities, students typically have classes for around 40 weeks each year. This may sounds hellish to British students who are used to a month off at Easter and Christmas - in the Netherlands you get a maximum of two weeks off for these holidays. But after seven months here, I\u2019ve realised I actually prefer this system. Because you\u2019re here for so long, you have to build a varied life for yourself, organising day trips to other Dutch cities or exploring your university city. The location of the Netherlands \u2013 in the middle of western Europe \u2013 also means that cheap weekend trips are very easy to do. You can get to Antwerp, Cologne or Paris in a few hours by coach.   Related: Exchange students: how to survive abroad on a shoestring    5. The work is spread out  There is more time for academic reading and assignments \u2013 this reduces stress levels and means you can pursue other interests without affecting your grades. My friends at British universities, with much shorter terms, often complain about not having enough time to do everything they want to do. The clich\u00e9 of work hard, play hard really applies here. One Cambridge student, who wanted to remain anonymous, says: \u201cWe have to cram about 10 weeks\u2019 worth of work into an eight-week term, while also doing extracurricular activities like plays and rowing. Each term feels like a marathon run at sprint pace.\u201d 6. Doing a master\u2019s is a matter of course  It\u2019s very common for students at Dutch universities to do a master\u2019s after their first degree, especially after a liberal arts course, where you study a broad range of subjects. Employers in the Netherlands tend to focus on your postgraduate qualification rather than your bachelor\u2019s, so you have the luxury of discovering new areas of interest in your first degree without worrying about what you want to do later. Thanks to the broad nature of my course, I could still end up majoring in anything from international relations to art history. There\u2019s no pressure to decide what to do later \u2013 or even race to get internships. The working world is still a few years off.

It confirmed Wales\u2019s second place in the group at the halfway stage (two points clear of the Israelis) and gave further evidence that Israel are short of the quality needed to make the top two. Further good news was the red card picked up by Vincent Kompany in Jerusalem, which would mean that he misses what now looks like Wales\u2019s biggest game in years when Belgium visit Cardiff on 12 June. Things are going in their favour, but their quality is coming through now as well and the presence of both Gareth Bale (twice) and Aaron Ramsey on the scoresheet on Saturday augurs well; if Bosnia-Herzegovina, who still entertain hopes of catching Wales from six points behind, have Edin Dzeko and Miralem Pjanic then Wales have these two and arguably greater depth beyond them than their rivals. Joe Allen was outstanding against Israel too, and it is no coincidence that, with Allen and Bale now 25 and Ramsey 24, Wales are hitting form as their biggest talents enter their peak years. A couple of wins from the next four games would probably ensure that things are firmly under control by the time they face Andorra in their last game. Chris Coleman cannot look that far ahead yet, and it would be a crying shame if Wales\u2019s golden generation let this slip, but there is an air of authority that suggests their time is coming. Nick Ames     Gareth Bale celebrates with team-mates after scoring the second goal for Wales in their win at Israel. Photograph: Matthew Childs/Action Images via Reuters    2) Kompany becoming a liability for club and country The phrase \u2018an uncharacteristic error from Vincent Kompany\u2019 became redundant at some point this season, or possibly even last, as the number of the Manchester City man\u2019s mistakes grew to such an extent that his supporters/apologists could no longer blame Mart\u00edn Demichelis or Eliaquim Mangala. Kompany had an eventful evening during Belgium\u2019s qualifier against Israel too, firstly going slightly rogue by attempting a few keepie-uppies near the centre circle before launching an implausible volley from around 45 yards that sailed way over the bar \u2013 safe to say a pass would probably have been the better option there. And then, with Belgium only 1-0 up, Kompany managed to get himself sent off for two yellow cards, the second coming after losing the ball with a stepover attempt and then trying to retrieve the situation by grabbing Eran Zahavi around the shoulders. Kompany looked stunned by the decision of Mark Clattenburg, but this left his team half an hour to survive in a qualifying match with 10 men, which they did, but it was hardly the work of a responsible captain. This used to be a defender on whom anyone could rely, his mistakes rare and his temperament steady, but not these days \u2013 Kompany has now become a liability for both club and country. Nick Miller 3) Crowd trouble is severely harming the Balkans teams There was no excusing Friday night\u2019s scenes in Podgorica and the Montenegro camp knew it. \u201cMy players are completely distraught, all of them are at a loss for words and I also don\u2019t know what to say after all this,\u201d said their coach, Branko Brnovic, after crowd trouble forced the abandonment of their game with Russia. His subsequent assertion that \u201cwe now don\u2019t stand a chance [of qualifying for Euro 2016]\u201d, was telling: Montenegro will almost certainly be awarded a 3-0 defeat once Uefa have put their heads together, and further sanctions are not unlikely after an evening whose most disturbing sights were those of the Russian goalkeeper Igor Akinfeev being struck by a flare and carried off on a stretcher. It will leave them at least three points shy of the third place they had occupied and with a rare scent of major tournament football appearing far fainter. Brnovic\u2019s side has been severely hindered by extraneous factors and the same could be said of a Serbia team, packed with promising talents, whose hopes of a place in the top three of Group I look very slim after their own points deduction five months ago. That punishment came as a result of the abandonment against Albania, who now seem nailed-on for an unlikely third-place finish. It does not help to make throwaway conclusions about cause and effect in the Balkans but one simple thing seems beyond dispute: two of the region\u2019s football teams have seen decent shots at a place in Michel Platini\u2019s newly expanded tournament all-but scuppered by the behaviour of poorly controlled crowds. Surely something has to change. NA     Igor Akinfeev is carried off on a stretcher after being hit on the head by a flare in the first minute. Photograph: TASS / Barcroft Media    4) Is Townsend actually any good? He\u2019s a strange player, Andros Townsend. He\u2019s a strange concept, really. In theory, he has the tools to be an excellent, genuinely threatening winger, with pace, the ability to beat a man and a rocket of a left foot, so he can often look threatening. The trouble is that more often he isn\u2019t actually threatening, using that pace to run very quickly at a defender, that ability to beat a man to beat a man, and that rocket of a left foot often launches the ball miles into the stands. He\u2019s an astonishingly frustrating player, one who promises much but frequently delivers well, not so much really, and it thus wasn\u2019t a huge surprise to see him out of the Tottenham team for much of the season. Still, Roy Hodgson seems to like him, and having forced his way back into the Spurs team his inclusion in this England squad wasn\u2019t entirely unmerited, even though it went against the views of noted sage Paul Merson, who decreed that Townsend should be \u2018nowhere near\u2019 Hodgson\u2019s selection. And he justified Hodgson\u2019s faith with a tracer bullet shot to secure a draw in Italy. He could be a sort of reverse John Barnes: brilliant at international level, not quite so good at club level. Or the new Darius Vassell if you will. All of which leads to the confusing question of whether he actually is any good. Perhaps we will never know. Townsend himself seems pretty sure, of course. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret there was criticism of my call-up, as usual,\u201d he said after the game. \u201cBut every time I put on an England shirt I have done myself justice. It was my third goal in seven caps and it was really important that I really did come on and silence a few critics, so I am pleased with my personal performance. I have been thinking about that criticism all week. I have just been desperate to get on the pitch and silence a few critics. As soon as the goal went in, I was thinking of all the people questioning my call-ups and saying I should be nowhere near the England squad.\u201d As the old saying goes, hell hath no fury like an inconsistent winger scorned. NM 5) Will the win against Spain buy Hiddink time? The natives were restless in Amsterdam on Saturday. And, if we resort to lazy national stereotypes, it takes a fair bit to get the natives in Amsterdam restless. Holland were insipid in the 1-1 draw with Turkey, resorting to the rather unsubtle tactics of chucking the ball into the mixer and aiming for the big man as they chased the game, the big man in this case being Bas Dost. Indeed, they were pretty lucky to get away with a draw, Wesley Sneijder\u2019s shot deflecting in off Klaas-Jan Huntelaar, and that didn\u2019t save Guus Hiddink from the opprobrium of a footballing nation used to rather more refined fare. And yet they pulled a face-saver out of the bag on Tuesday, beating Spain 2-0 thanks to a much livelier performance and goals from Stefan de Vrij and Davy Klaassen. So will this save Hiddink\u2019s position as well as some face? Like being a millionaire, beating Spain isn\u2019t what it used to be, but the result could buy the Dutch manager a little time. The question that presents itself there, is whether that\u2019s good news or not for Holland. NM 6) McClean should have started for Republic of Ireland Martin O\u2019Neill got it wrong from the start. Lining up in a 4-2-3-1 was the attack-minded set-up almost every Irish supporters wanted to see but few fans will have been happy with Jon Walters occupying a position wide on the right of midfield. He was placed there in the match against Germany and from a defensive point of view, he did a tremendous job. However, he offered little going forward \u2013 direct runs and searing pace are not his thing \u2013 and a German weak spot, the inexperienced left-back Erik Durm, went unexploited. It was more of the same against Poland. It is obvious to anyone who has seen Poland play in this campaign that they are susceptible to pace on the flanks, so why play the plodder that is Walters out there? Why not start with James McClean? As he showed when he came on, he has the speed and skills to get behind the Poland defence and set up good opportunities for his team-mates. That was not the only choice O\u2019Neill got wrong. If you are going to play Wes Hoolahan, then you need to play Shane Long in front of him. Long has the legs to run on to the type of passes Hoolahan can come up with, unlike the man who was chosen in his stead, Robbie Keane. The LA Galaxy forward was more static than wool fabric and despite his impressive goalscoring record, now looks past his use-by date. Ian McCourt           Martin O\u2019Neill discusses the Republic of Ireland\u2019s 1-1 draw.    7) Davis is Northern Ireland\u2019s quiet genius Before this campaign started the chances of Northern Ireland qualifying for Euro 2016 in an automatic spot seemed as remote as the idea of life being found on Neptune. Should you have suggested such a possibility, people would have laughed in your face. Long and loud and hard. Ha, ha, ha. But the joke could be on them soon enough. With five games to go (three of which are at home and two of which are winnable away fixtures against the Faroe Islands and Finland), Northern Ireland are a point behind group leaders Romania and four points clear of Hungary in third place. Kyle Lafferty\u2019s well-taken first-half goals against Finland (rightly) won him the bottle of champagne but it is worth mentioning the quiet work of Steven Davis. The Southampton player is one of the most crucial cogs in Michael O\u2019Neill\u2019s side. In a team not noted for its ability to keep the ball, he rarely losses possession (he misplaced just two passes on Sunday) and his level-headed approach brings a zen-like calm to the team. He also showed, with his last-ditch tackle on Teemu Pukki, that he has the pace and ability to stop opposition attacks in their tracks. He did not return for the second half due to a thigh injury and his absence was obvious as O\u2019Neill\u2019s side looked a lot more vulnerable. He could be a key figure in France. IMc 8) Odegaard offers scant consolation for Norway There seems little chance of Martin Odegaard enjoying a quiet couple of years, even if Real Madrid Castilla are watched by crowds that barely scrape 1,500. He was pitched into a far more challenging atmosphere at Zagreb\u2019s Maksimir Stadium on Friday night when 23,000 Croats were given five reasons to raise the roof by an accommodating Norway side, and broke another international record in the process. At 16 years, 101 days, Odegaard became the youngest player to start a European Championship qualifier and completed the entire 90 minutes, performing creditably in the No11 shirt for a generally impotent team and starting the move that led to Alexander Tettey\u2019s consolation goal. The desperation to press Odegaard into such sustained action does not necessarily speak well of the manager Per-Mathias Hogmo\u2019s options but,with four caps to his name, he seems part of the furniture now and could yet end up in the brightest spotlight of all next summer. Encouragement was scant for a Norway side in last week\u2019s 5-1 defeat \u2013 with the Croatia coach Niko Kovac even expressing dissatisfaction at his side\u2019s performance \u2013 but they still sit four points ahead of fourth-placed Bulgaria and a play-off place appears likely. It is sadly inevitable that a few mediocre teams will sleepwalk into these finals and Norway have as good a chance of going all the way as many; whether it will benefit his development or not, Odegaard seems to be in the international fold to stay and may be required to carry his country\u2019s fight where it counts a year from now. NA 9) G\u00f3mez could make a difference to wasteful Germany No one expected Germany to take anything but three points from Georgia and they did not disappoint. The win was a welcome retort after the draw with Republic of Ireland and the defeat to Poland but it was not quite the perfect retort. \u201cWe could have made it easier for ourselves,\u201d said Thomas M\u00fcller and he is right. Too often, Germany were profligate up front. Mario G\u00f6tze did not manage a single shot on goal; Marco Reus hit the bar twice; M\u00fcller missed a couple of chances \u2013 and almost messed up his goal with a poor first touch \u2013 and Mesut \u00d6zil, though not noted for his scoring, could have done better on a few occasions. This wastefulness has been a hallmark for Joachim L\u00f6w\u2019s side of late. They had 16 attempts against Georgia (with six on target); 19 against the Republic (with eight on target); and 22 against Poland (again with eight on target). Before this game, L\u00f6w was asked if he would consider bringing Mario G\u00f3mez back into this squad. \u201cWe always keep an eye on him,\u201d he said. \u201cIf Mario finds his rhythm and is playing and scoring regularly then he\u2019ll obviously be an option looking ahead to the Euros.\u201d With eight goals in his last eight games and Germany proving to be wanton up front, G\u00f3mez might just be getting that call sooner than he thinks.

Lee Casciaro\u2019s accurate low finish, which briefly levelled the scores a minute after Shaun Maloney had put Scotland ahead, did offer some cause for concern and at least provided a riposte to those dismissing the fixture as a waste of time. It is justifiable to wonder how far Gibraltar, whose population does not quite hit 30,000 and who have made the worst-ever start to a European Championship campaign, can realistically go but it jars against the game\u2019s spirit not to share in moments of joy. Casciaro\u2019s goal was heartwarming at the time and celebrated wildly; Gibraltar were brought back down to earth soon enough but scenes like these have a happy knack of cropping up just often enough to postpone more weighty discussions and it will be genuinely interesting to see whether this can be a spur for improvement in the second half of the qualifiers. Their next assignment, a \u201chome\u201d match with Germany in Faro, may not be the best barometer and you suspect that the worst could still be to come for David Wilson\u2019s team \u2013 but any non-Scot unable to raise a smile when Casciaro beat David Marshall could do with remembering that these moments define international football just as much as those as the opposite end of the scale.

But what does that even mean? \u201cGreenness\u201d is a concept that\u2019s hard to pin down \u2013 there\u2019s no official list of the top 50 most eco-friendly cities, nor any widely agreed set of measurements for working out how green a city actually is. In the realm of environmental science, concepts such as biodiversity can be assessed using indicators that give a standard set of measurements \u2013 for example, the number of different species of birds spotted in a given area on a given day. But for greenness or eco-friendliness, the possible indicators are endless, covering everything from road transport to recycling. In a 2015 study published in the journal Ecological Indicators, scientists based at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California have fine-tuned a potential method for assessing Chinese \u201ceco-cities\u201d using 33 key indicators. So, for example, they propose to measure renewable energy usage by looking at the percentage of total energy purchased by a city that comes from renewable sources (not including nuclear). Other \u201cgreen indicators\u201d in this study include the share of all \u201ctrips\u201d made by public transport, and the daily average concentrations of air pollutants \u2013 plus a surprising number of social and economic variables, such as healthcare practitioners per 1,000 citizens and unemployment rates.    Measuring a city\u2019s relationship to its environment is 'complex' and 'challenging' \u2013 eco-cities cannot easily be compared       Copenhagen was a predictable victor in the European region of the Green City Index. Photograph: Alamy    The study\u2019s researchers have also reviewed other systems for assessing a city\u2019s greenness, coming up with 14 international-level methods. But they conclude that, in essence, there is no good system. Measuring a city\u2019s relationship to its environment, they write, is \u201ccomplex\u201d and \u201cchallenging\u201d, and eco-cities cannot easily be compared.  (It should also be noted that, in general usage, the term \u201ceco-city\u201d is ill-defined, and that despite China\u2019s plans to establish hundreds of them, it\u2019s not actually clear what constitutes the status \u201ceco\u201d.) In the absence of an accepted scientific indicator system, the EU\u2019s Green Capital programme at least has a rigorous shortlisting process based on a technical assessment covering aspects such as biodiversity, green spaces and how a city deals with wastewater, noise and air quality. The programme, however, is limited to European cities and, furthermore, to those that actually apply for consideration \u2013 the most recent winners are Copenhagen, Bristol (the current incumbent) and, for 2016, Ljubljana.     Ljubljana\u2019s Old Town: the city will be European Green Capital in 2016. Photograph: David Levene    Slightly less \u201cskewed\u201d, perhaps, is the Siemens-sponsored Green City Index put together by The Economist Intelligence Unit. Since 2009, the German engineering giant has been publishing reports assessing one region at a time, starting with Europe and working through Latin America, the US and Canada, Africa and, last year, Asia. In total, 120 cities have been scrutinised via indicators under the following subject headings: energy &amp; CO2, transport, water, air quality, land use &amp; buildings, waste, sanitation and environmental governance. Although it\u2019s difficult to compare cities from different regions, especially as data from each was collected at different times, the Green City Index does attempt to rank cities, from those that perform well above average for their region down to those that perform well below average. So who are the winners?  Copenhagen was a predictable victor in the European region, scoring 87 compared to London\u2019s 72 (in 11th place) and Kiev\u2019s bottom-of-the-pile 32. Despite its enthusiasm for bikes, Copenhagen finished behind Stockholm and Amsterdam in transport \u2013 but made the top seven in every category.  Curitiba in Brazil, San Francisco in the US and Singapore came top in their respective regions, with Singapore\u2019s waste and water reclamation policies setting it apart from 21 other Asian cities (20% of Singapore\u2019s water is purified from wastewater using cutting-edge technologies). In Africa, none of the 15 cities that were assessed performed well above average, but two performed well below \u2013 Dar es Salaam in Tanzania and Maputo in Mozambique. The Green City Index is certainly not the perfect system. Its data comes from cities that have different ways of collecting it, and certain city-level data is missing or has to be extrapolated. And another problematic issue it raises is how to compare cities in vastly different economic situations \u2013 is it fair to compare the developing and developed urban worlds?    Another problem is how to compare cities in vastly different economic situations \u2013 is that fair?       The historical centre of Curitiba, South America\u2019s \u2018greenest city\u2019. Photograph: PA/Getty Images/Flickr RF    One interesting finding to come out of the Siemens studies is that both richest and poorest cities in a region often outperform middle-income ones. The average resident of Kuala Lumpur, for example, uses 497 litres of water per day and produces 816 kilograms of waste per year. Contrast these statistics to those of relatively richer Singapore \u2013 309 litres of water and 307 kilograms of waste \u2013 or relatively poorer Delhi: 209 litres of water and 147 kilograms of waste. In the midst of economic growth, it seems, consumption overtakes sustainability and isn\u2019t curbed until a city becomes positively wealthy. The \u201ctipping point\u201d in Asia appears to be a per capita GDP of around US $20,000. Perhaps we\u2019re making this too complicated. Why not stop pretending \u201cgreenness\u201d is a measurable thing, and instead focus on the details we\u2019re actually interested in? For example, which cities have the cleanest air or the lowest greenhouse gas emissions? Yet even then, it\u2019s still difficult to find data of this type that has been collected and reported on consistently across a wide number of cities.   Related: What is the oldest city in the world?    The World Health Organisation collects data on air quality from 1,600 cities worldwide, but the data is pieced together like a patchwork from different types of sources. And there is no list of the world\u2019s biggest fossil-fuel burners on a city-by-city basis. The Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions is a common standard for city-level greenhouse gas accounting, but that was only launched in December. As more genuinely useful, comparable measures are developed for city-level use, it should become clearer which cities are performing best. Singapore, San Francisco, Curitiba and Copenhagen seem the most obvious candidates for the planet\u2019s \u201cgreenest\u201d title right now \u2013 but as better data emerges, others may begin setting new benchmarks.

Almost 40 years had passed since the South African striker Steve \u2018Kalamazoo\u2019 Mokone spent two seasons playing for Egbers\u2019 hometown club Heracles Almelo in Holland\u2019s third division. But in 1993 no one had heard from him since. \u201cMy father always used to tell me about this wonderful player who joined the club in the 1950s who was a black man \u2013 something that was unheard of in our part of the country,\u201d he remembers. \u201cAt that stage nobody had really taken any interest in his football career. Steve left Heracles in the middle of the night in 1959 and people hadn\u2019t heard from him ever again. He sort of went up in smoke, which of course added to the mystification of this star. \u201cI decided to try and track him down but of course this was in the pre-Google age so it was not an easy task,\u201d adds Egbers. \u201cI eventually traced him to New York where he lived at the time working as a doctor in psychiatry and political science at a hospital. At first he was a little bit reserved and wanted to know who I was and why I wanted to talk to him. It was only years later that I was able to find out exactly why.\u201d After spending time with the man who had become the first black African to play professionally in Europe when he signed for Coventry City in 1955, Egbers published \u2018De Zwarte Meteoor\u2019 (The Black Meteor) \u2013 a novel based on Mokone\u2019s successful spell at Heracles that saw them win promotion at the end of the 1957-58 season. It was remarkably well received and \u2018Kalamazoo\u2019 was invited back to the provincial town close to the German border for the first time in almost four decades as the club named the new stand in their Polman Stadion in his honour. Within five years the story had been turned into a film, too. \u201cThere was a big premiere in Amsterdam and Ruud Gullit, Guus Hiddink and Frank Rijkaard were among the famous people to attend,\u201d remembers Egbers. \u201cFive days after the premiere there was a story in the newspaper by a Dutch journalist who had spoken to a South African who had told him that Steve had been in prison for years in America. \u201cI found out he had spent time in jail for assaulting his wife and wife\u2019s lawyer, with whom he had been in a custody trial over his daughter. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I could not believe it. I called him and said, \u2018Listen, this is in the Dutch paper. Please tell me that it\u2019s not true\u2019. \u201cWe had become friends and he had never mentioned it to me. Eventually he admitted it had happened but said: \u2018I was sentenced. I\u2019m not guilty but I don\u2019t want to talk about it.\u2019 I said: \u2018You can\u2019t do this. There\u2019s been a book written about you, we made a film about you and there is a street named after you and we have travelled the world together. I thought we were friends.\u2019 \u201cBut he didn\u2019t want to tell me. So I decided I would write another book to try and find out what happened.\u201d Egbers spent 18 months trawling through the archives looking for information on Mokone\u2019s arrest and trial. Having also enjoyed brief spells at Cardiff, Torino, Barnsley, Salisbury, Marseille, Barcelona and Valencia, he had moved to the United States in 1964 and began studying psychiatry. Thirteen years later, having separated from his first wife and endured an acrimonious but eventually victorious custody battle, Mokone was accused of throwing acid into her face before a similar attack the following week left her lawyer blind in one eye. \u201cI had promised myself that, if I had found out that Steve was indeed guilty, I would write it down,\u201d Egbers says. \u201cBut I became convinced more and more that he was convicted for a crime he didn\u2019t commit.\u201d In 2002 he published Twaalf Gestolen Jahre (Twelve Stolen Years), which alleged that Mokone had been framed by the US authorities in collaboration with the South African Department of Internal Affairs (DIA). Egbers detailed the lengths they had gone to ensure a conviction \u2013 a story that dated back to Mokone\u2019s arrival at Highfield Road in 1955. \u201cThe reason why Steve had to be behind bars was that he had fled South Africa because he was a rather prominent member of the ANC, which even by the 1970s was considered to be a terrorist movement by the US government,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was friends with Desmond Tutu and Miriam Makeba, who went to the same teacher training college in Pretoria. When he felt it was all getting too dangerous, that\u2019s when he fled to Europe. As soon as Steve got to the US and started to study, he became more and more politically active.\u201d     Steve Mokone, third right, appears at a press conference in New York to support a bid to boycott the 1968 Olympics in protest at South Africa\u2019s proposed readmittance. Photograph: Bettmann/CORBIS    Mokone is believed to have caught the attention of the authorities when he was involved in the successful campaign alongside prominent African-American sports stars of the day including Jackie Robinson and Arthur Ashe to stop South Africa competing in the 1968 Olympic Games in Mexico City. He continued to voice his opposition by writing articles about South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime for a respected left-wing journal in New York throughout the 1970s and Egbers found evidence that the FBI had been asked to keep him quiet. \u201cThe \u2018framing\u2019 becomes clear when you hear the clips and read the correspondence that was used or deliberately not used during his trial,\u201d he says. \u201cI managed to get hold of a hypnosis interview done by the CIA with his ex-wife and it is really incredible to hear how things are manipulated. After about 30 minutes of the interview, she is convinced that it was Steve who had attacked her but she is terribly led by the investigators. Those tapes were never used in the trial because it was obvious they were not admissible. There is also correspondence that shows the FBI and CIA dug into this matter. Now if you commit a crime, that doesn\u2019t usually happen. You will be arrested and you will go to trial but why would the CIA look into Steve Mokone? Everything was done to make people testify against him. \u201cFor instance, Steve\u2019s son Ronnie Sello didn\u2019t have a US passport but was living there. They told him that, if he didn\u2019t testify, then he would be thrown out of the country and that\u2019s what he had to do. It was terrible. He had to testify against his own father.\u201d Sentenced to between eight and 12 years in prison, Tutu \u2013 who had been the unlikely goalkeeper for their college football team \u2013 was among several prominent members of the ANC to write to the US government asking for Mokone\u2019s early release. However, he had to wait until August 1990 to be granted his freedom, under the strict condition that he never spoke about what had happened to anyone. \u201cSteve was married to an American woman called Louise, who is now his widow, and they wanted to stay in the US,\u201d says Egbers. \u201cHe feared that if he ever said anything about what happened then he would have to leave. So he never spoke about it.\u201d Mokone\u2019s death at the age of 82 in Washington last month after a prolonged illness was covered extensively in the Netherlands and South Africa\u2019s players wore black armbands in this week\u2019s friendly against Nigeria to commemorate one of their most important pioneers. Following a ceremony at Johannesburg\u2019s FNB Stadium \u2013 the venue for the 2010 World Cup Final \u2013 next week, the ashes of the man described as \u201cour flag bearer in all the corners of the world\u201d by the sports minister, Fikile Mbalula, will be scattered in his homeland. For Egbers it will be hard finally to say goodbye. \u201cHe meant a lot to me, not just over the last 20 years but before then as well,\u201d he reflects. \u201cI was inspired by the stories of my father because he was the favourite player I never saw. When you don\u2019t have any images or even pictures then you can make this mythological player as brilliant as you want to. This was the man that my father had told me stories about before I went to bed. At the time I thought about him as just a football player but he was so much more than that.\u201d", "sentences": ["\u201cThere was a big premiere in Amsterdam and Ruud Gullit, Guus Hiddink and Frank Rijkaard were among the famous people to attend,\u201d remembers Egbers."], "title": "The sad secret kept by trailblazing South African Steve Mokone | Ed Aarons", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/02/south-african-footballer-steve-mokone-coventry-cardiff", "tags": ["Coventry City", "Cardiff City", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-04-02T10:24:17Z", "article": "Two of the year\u2019s unexpected bestsellers \u2013 Emma Healey\u2019s mystery of an elderly woman with dementia, Elizabeth is Missing, and Jessie Burton\u2019s portrait of 17th-century Amsterdam, The Miniaturist \u2013 go head to head on the longlist for the Desmond Elliott prize for the year\u2019s best first novel. Judges have announced 10 titles on a longlist praised by the chair, novelist Louise Doughty, for \u201cthe breadth of the books, in terms of subject matter and style, but also the level of attention the books have received so far\u201d. \u201cTwo of our titles are already acclaimed bestsellers, others have received critical attention \u2013 and some are names that are either published very recently or haven\u2019t yet had their moment in the spotlight,\u201d the author said. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly thrilling to have such a disparate list to choose from and the field is wide open.\u201d Healey and Burton\u2019s major sellers are up against Paul Kingsnorth\u2019s crowd-funded The Wake, set after the Battle of Hastings and already longlisted for last year\u2019s Booker, Laline Paull\u2019s tale of a bee born into the lowest class of her society, The Bees, and James Hannah\u2019s The A to Z of You and Me, which takes the tiny canvas of a young man lying in a hospice bed to create what judges described as \u201ca novel of universal resonance\u201d. The \u00a310,000 Desmond Elliott, named for the late publisher and literary agent, was won last year by Eimear McBride\u2019s A Girl is a Half-formed Thing, which was originally published by tiny independent press Galley Beggar. The publisher has another title on this year\u2019s longlist: Randall by Jonathan Gibbs, which imagines an alternate art world where Damien Hirst died in 1989 to be replaced by the genius and provocateur Randall. \u201cMore than mischievous satire, Randall freeze-frames for private censure that commercial merry-go-round, the contemporary art market,\u201d said Doughty and her fellow judges. Also longlisted for the award are Simon Wroe\u2019s Chop Chop, set in a Camden gastro-pub, Alex Christofi\u2019s Glass, in which the protagonist is asked to clean London\u2019s Shard, and Claire Fuller\u2019s Our Endless Numbered Days, which sees a survivalist father take his young daughter to a remote cabin and tell her the world has disappeared.

The great Leonid meteor shower was passing overhead. For Prophet Smith, it was a manifestation of the divine: \u201cI arose, and to my great joy, beheld the stars fall from the heavens like a shower of hailstones ... it seemed as if the artillery and fireworks of eternity were set in motion to enchant and entertain the Saints, and terrify and awe the sinners of the Earth.\u201d The artist Regine Petersen has chosen Smith\u2019s testimony as the epigraph for Stars Fell On Alabama, the first part of her beautiful new three-part artbook Find a Fallen Star. A poetic visual meditation on meteorites, it explores the strange fascination they exert on the imagination, particularly to those that have witnessed them falling to Earth.     Ann Hodges of Alabama, who survived being struck by a meteorite that crashed through her roof in 1954.    It all started, says Petersen, when she came across \u201ca photograph of a woman surrounded by policemen, one of whom was holding a black rock. They were looking up at a hole in the ceiling, as if they didn\u2019t know what to make of it all.\u201d The woman was Ann Hodges, who was hit on the hip by a grapefruit-sized fragment of the Sylacauga meteorite in 1954. It fell though her roof in Oak Grove, Alabama, while she was asleep on her couch. Hodges, who died in 1972, was the first officially recorded person to be hit by a meteorite in modern times. (An Italian manuscript from 1677 describes how a friar from Milan died after being struck by one.) \u201cI had to know how the meteorite changed her life,\u201d says Petersen, \u201cand what became of her.\u201d Hodges\u2019s close encounter left her with severe bruising \u2013 and fleeting worldwide fame. The meteorite was seized by the US Air Force despite a legal challenge mounted by her husband and a counter-challenge by her landlord, who planned to sell it to the highest bidder to pay for the damage to his property. By the time it was returned, the meteorite was old news and Hodges could not find a buyer. In 1956, she donated it to the Alabama Museum of Natural History, happy to be rid of it. Hodges\u2019s story, in its mix of the otherworldly and the all-too-human, is central to the narrative flow of Find a Fallen Star, which combines Petersen\u2019s own images with archive press cuttings, found photos and first-hand testimonies. The finished project is currently showing at FOAM in Amsterdam, and Stars Fell On Alabama is also on show at Format festival in Derby.     Regine Petersen\u2019s Dog (Impact Site 1) from the Alabama chapter of Find a Fallen Star.    Petersen\u2019s images are low-key, luminously beautiful and always poetic. The wonder of a meteor shower, for instance, is reflected in an arrangement of bright golden leaves that resemble stars in a patch of shadowy woodland. Often, she places the quotidian and the mysterious side by side: the timber-framed house where Hodges lived is rendered in square-format black-and-white amid its sun-shadowed surroundings, while opposite, a white puppy lies prone on the leafy ground, the pinkish hue on its skin suggesting an alien light source. Though her approach has elements of documentary, everything is suggestive, only hinted at. Petersen\u2019s book, particularly in its use of first-person accounts, veers between the real and the mythic, the half-remembered and the exaggerated. Her raw material is three real, if extraordinary, events, for which there are no reliable witnesses. Oak Grove, Alabama was her starting point, but she also travelled to Kanwarpura village in India, where a 6.8kg meteorite fell close to Rajasthan atomic plant in 2006, and across her native Germany to Ramsdorf, where local children unearthed a meteorite then broke it into small pieces for each of them to have as a keepsake.     Sputnik, from the Fragments chapter of Find a Fallen Star.    It is not just in our minds that meteorites carry the threat of apocalypse or the promise of reawakened childhood wonder. For Petersen, meteorites are both solid scientific evidence and wondrous objects that have fallen from the heavens, carrying all sorts of resonances \u2013 from the scientific to the superstitious, the earthly to the supernatural. \u201cThey are time capsules from the beginnings of our solar system,\u201d she says, \u201cand they still contain the first solid matter from that time. In a way, a meteorite is like a photograph of a time long before there was any life on Earth. Thinking of that, it is mind-boggling to hold one in your hand.\u201d Find a Fallen Star is a fascinatingly multilayered work in which Petersen has let her imagination roam freely. The images move from the everyday sublime to the symbolic, and are threaded through with a wealth of found material. First-hand accounts are blurred by the passing of time, memory itself becomes a form of embellishment, and witnesses and official accounts contradict each other. These fragments of rock that have tumbled from the sky often seem like the only solid element in the earthly narratives they leave like twisting trails of light in their wake. \u2022 Find a Fallen Star by Regine Petersen is published by Kehrer", "sentences": ["The finished project is currently showing at FOAM in Amsterdam, and Stars Fell On Alabama is also on show at Format festival in Derby."], "title": "Waiting for a star to fall: meteorites caught on camera", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/apr/02/meteorites-regine-petersen-photography-find-a-fallen-star", "tags": ["Photography", "Meteors", "Culture", "Art and design", "Space", "Astronomy", "Science"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-04-03T05:00:08Z", "article": "There are worse things that can happen on a city break than getting locked in a room, I tell myself as I frantically try to piece together a grid of pattern-covered squares, hoping it will reveal the code to the last combination lock. George (an esteemed colleague on the Guardian Data team, chosen for his numerical nous) has just knocked one of the pieces off the table and I\u2019m beginning to doubt his value as a team member, but with minutes to go the answer reveals itself. We unlock the box, grab the final piece of treasure and dash for the door. I\u2019m at Lock\u2019d, London\u2019s newest room escape game venue, and one of hundreds opening in cities all over the world. For the uninitiated, room escape games are immersive experiences where players are voluntarily locked in a room filled with cryptic puzzles that have to be cracked. They\u2019ll all be on a theme: for example, I\u2019ve just \u201cbroken into a museum\u201d to recover some ancient artefacts. The games first appeared in the late noughties, as puzzlers experimented with creating real-life versions of popular video games, but in the past two years their popularity has snowballed. Now, they are among the most popular attractions on Tripadvisor in cities from LA to Bangkok. A generation brought up on The Crystal Maze has come of age and they really, really want to play.   Related: Caminito del Rey path in M\u00e1laga reopens with beauty replacing the fear factor    \u201cPeople are sick of entertainment that isn\u2019t real,\u201d Alexander Shaf, one of the founders of Lock\u2019d tells me \u2013 once I\u2019ve escaped, that is. \u201cPeople play computer games and spend more and more time online. Now they\u2019re realising it\u2019s more fun to try these games in real life.\u201d Although room escape games have a dedicated following among gamers and are a popular corporate bonding activity (escape the room ... and your boss!), the games have already made their way onto must-do lists in many popular city break destinations. In Budapest, for example, more than 30 room escape games have opened in the past few years, with tourists clamouring to give them a try. New venues continue to open across Europe, in cities such as Prague, Berlin and Amsterdam. Last year saw the first Lisbon venue, when Jo\u00e3o Santos and Anna Mendes opened Lisbon Escape Game in Cais do Sodr\u00e9. Paul Bart is the founder of Escape Hunt, based in Malaysia, which has 21 branches around the world, with a further 55 planned for this year. A psychologist, Bart puts the popularity of the games down to a handful of innate desires: \u201cPeople like to compete, and they like to interact with their environment. Look at the cinema, it started off silent, then they had the talkies, then it went 3D and now there\u2019s 4D. People got bored with the sedentary and want to interact. This interaction is what makes it extremely addictive.\u201d But European and Asian games differ in style, he says. \u201cWith the European style, which has its roots in Hungary, you have your own dedicated room, you\u2019re not mixing with other people and it\u2019s a lot more genteel. In Asia, it\u2019s completely different. Y ou have more blood, screaming and it\u2019s a lot more sensational. There\u2019s one in Bangkok called the Nazi game. You wouldn\u2019t get away with that anywhere else.\u201d Their popularity did get a bit out of hand, he admits. \u201cIf you typed in any city in the world on Tripadvisor, the number one thing to do was an escape game. They\u2019ve had to change their algorithm and put us in a separate sub-category now.\u201d But whether they will ever be viewed with the same regard as a city\u2019s more traditional attractions or not, they seem to provide a welcome alternative to travellers. Danielle Brennan, 26, tried a room escape game for the first time on a visit to Budapest last year and her group enjoyed it so much they tried another one the very next day. \u201cWe just wanted to try something new,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was like Fort Boyard meets Saw and you got a free beer.

If you\u2019re a good enough player as a child you\u2019ll be picked up by the relevant scouts and signed, and then if performances are of the right standard you\u2019ll progress through the youth set-up into the senior squad. From there, into the top division of whatever country you\u2019re playing in, international recognition, a transfer to a big club if you\u2019re not already there, then come trophies, money, adulation and recognition as one of the best. Of course, the variables in football are such that you need luck: not perhaps \u201cgood\u201d luck, more the ability to avoid bad luck with injuries, incompetent managers and so forth \u2013 and this is especially true in international football, where your place of birth, timing and a myriad of other factors out of your control determine whether you get to do your thing in front of the world. To be laden with the haul of honours that one associates with the greats, even if oral history lets the world know that you were among them, you need serendipity on your side. George Best had the misfortune to be born in a country that would not qualify for the World Cup in his career. Ferenc Puskas would probably have lifted the 1954 World Cup were it not for a reducer early in the tournament that left him a half-fit passenger in the final. Roberto Baggio was a foot or so away from being Diego Maradona in 1994, having hefted the Italian team onto his back and carried them to Pasadena, in much the same way as the great Argentinian had done eight years earlier. These were men denied their moment of defining international glory through circumstances beyond their control, bad luck or a matter of inches. In the grander scheme of things, Fabio Grosso would have had a perfectly decent career were it not for the summer of 2006. He was a professional footballer for 17 years for a start, which already elevates him above most of us. He played in two countries, winning the league in both, picked up 48 international caps and generally had a pretty lovely time. Not too many would have remembered him though, were it not for the World Cup. \u201cIf they were being honest, few Italian fans even knew what Grosso looked like before the tournament began,\u201d wrote John Foot in Calcio: A History of Italian Football. Grosso began his career as a midfielder, playing for Renato Curi in the Eccellenza Abruzzo regional league, and five years before the World Cup he was playing in Serie C2 with Chieti. He earned a move to Perugia in Serie A, but after a promising start which saw him gain his first Italy cap he was sold to Palermo, at that point in Serie B. Still, promotion was achieved, and Grosso was one of four Palermo players included in Marcelo Lippi\u2019s 23-man party for Germany.     Fabio Grosso falls after fighting for the ball with Australian defender Lucas Neill. Photograph: Johannes Simon/AFP/Getty Images    In the squad he may have been but Grosso wasn\u2019t meant to be in the starting XI. However, the first-choice left-back Gianluca Zambrotta picked up a thigh strain in training and Grosso stepped in at left-back for the opener against Ghana. The Juventus man recovered in time for the second match against USA and slotted back into the team but after right-back Cristian Zaccardo had a fairly disastrous game, scoring the own goal that would deny the Italians a win, Grosso came in for the final group encounter against the Czech Republic with Zambrotta switching flanks, and this was how the defence remained for the rest of the tournament. Grosso did not really come to prominence until injury time of the second-round match against Australia, in which he won a penalty in circumstances that were painted as controversial at the time, but objective appraisal suggests there was little contentious about it. Lucas Neill took Grosso down with a rogue section of torso, which was clumsy rather than malicious but still obviously a penalty \u2013 a fact which has not prevented some from analysing it as if it is the Zapruder film. Ukraine were casually dismissed in the quarter-final, setting up the semi against the hosts Germany, the nation fizzing with anticipation and, in a tournament that lacked a dominant team, expectation. Semi-finals aren\u2019t supposed to be electrifying, end-to-end affairs, but this was. The remarkable tension of a host side straining to cope with the pressure of having 80m people willing them to win contrasted nicely with Italy, for whom expectations were so low before the tournament it felt like every step forwards was a bonus. Indeed, the primary reason for that lack of Italian expectations, the Calciopoli scandal, loomed large as the proposed punishments for the clubs involved were announced by the Italian Football Federation\u2019s prosecutor Stefano Palazzi on the morning of the Germany match. He advised that Juventus be demoted to \u201cbelow Serie B\u201d, stripped of their 2005 and 2006 scudetti and docked points, with relegations and point penalties imposed on Fiorentina and Lazio, and just the latter for Milan. In total 13 members of the Italy squad and seven of the men who started in the Westfalenstadion played for clubs implicated in the scandal, while the manager Marcelo Lippi\u2019s son Davide was also being investigated, so they would have been forgiven for not having their minds on the job. If that was true it didn\u2019t show when the game began, a frantic affair that wasn\u2019t helped (or was helped, depending on your point of view) by the jingoistic atmosphere in the respective countries\u2019 media. Arrivederci Pizza ran the headline in the ever-subtle Bild, while there were suggestions that Italian TV had played a significant role in the suspension of the German midfielder Torsten Frings, Sky Italia lingering rather on a punch thrown by Frings in a melee after the quarter-final against Argentina. Additionally there was the strange tale of Bruno, a young Italian mountain bear who got lost and found himself in Germany, where he killed various animals and was shot by Bavarian hunters. \u201cTrentino-based Italian supporters carried little toy bears on their way to watch the match in July,\u201d wrote Foot in Calcio \u2026 \u201cBruno, it was said, had to be avenged.\u201d The stakes were high. When the game eventually began, Italy were the better side, but to say either team dominated would be to suggest there was any real pattern to it. Michael Ballack had an early penalty shout, Simone Perrotta wasted a golden chance for the Italians, Bernd Schneider likewise for Germany. In the second half Andrea Pirlo set Grosso free on goal but he hesitated horribly, displaying none of the poise that would emerge later, his effort smothered by Jens Lehmann. The German keeper later did a passable impersonation of Harald Schumacher, clotheslining Perotta in the process of punching a Pirlo pass clear, but it was extra time when the real drama started. The substitute Alberto Gilardino twisted the blood of assorted German defenders before hitting the upright, and shortly afterwards Zambrotta tested the structural integrity of the goalposts by booming a shot against them from the edge of the box. Lukas Podolski made a dreadful hash of a free header, possibly afforded so much space by the extraordinary gung-ho approach from Lippi, who by this time had introduced Gilardino, Vincenzo Iaquinta and Alessandro Del Piero to play alongside Francesco Totti up front, suggesting he wasn\u2019t exactly playing for penalties. His tactics were vaguely absurd but they were consistent throughout the tournament, Lippi seemingly on a one-man crusade to shut the door on catenaccio and any old stereotypes of Italian football. A combination of that and the inevitable tiring of legs meant there was space aplenty in which attackers from both sides could roam freely, and further advances were exchanged; Podolski forced a brilliant save from Gigi Buffon, Pirlo did similar to Lehmann, winning a corner. Then \u2026 Palla taglata \u2026 Messa fuori \u2026 c\u2019\u00e8 Pirlo \u2026 Pirlo \u2026 Pirlo \u2026 ancora Pirlo di tacco \u2026 TIRO! \u2026 GOOOLLLLLL \u2026 !!!!! \u2026 GOOOLLLLLL \u2026 !!!!! \u2026 GOOOLLLLLL \u2026 !!!!! \u2026 GROSSO \u2026 !!! \u2026 GROSSO \u2026 !!! \u2026 GOOOLLLLLL \u2026 !!!!! \u2026 GOL DI GROSSO \u2026 !!! \u2026 GOL DI GROSSO \u2026 !!! \u2026 GOL DI GROSSO \u2026 !!! \u2026 MANCA UN MINUTO \u2026 !!! \u2026 MANCA UN MINUTO \u2026 !!! \u2026 GOL DI GROSSO \u2026 !!! \u2026 INCREDIBILE!!! \u2026 INCREDIBILE!!! If your Italian isn\u2019t what it could be, it doesn\u2019t matter. You get the general idea. The reaction from Fabio Caressa, the Sky Italia commentator who understandably allowed emotions to get the better of him in the most wonderful way as two hours of frantic tension exploded, was reflected on the pitch. Grosso charged away letting out a magnificent roar, a primal scream that said he really didn\u2019t know what to do with himself, howling \u201cNon ci credo\u201d (\u201cI don\u2019t believe it\u201d) over and over again. It wasn\u2019t quite on the level of Marco Tardelli in 1982, because the celebration didn\u2019t eclipse the goal itself as it has for Tardelli, but it wasn\u2019t far off.     German goalkeeper Jens Lehmann dives in vain to save athe shot from Fabio Grosso. Photograph: AFP PHOTO/AFP/Getty Images    He was not the only one to lose his thread. Totti celebrated by throwing a drinks bottle into the crowd for some reason, Buffon raced from the other end of the pitch so quickly that he was the second Italian to reach/catch Grosso, while Lippi was on the verge of tears. He managed to compose himself for long enough to yell at his players and straighten his preposterously oversized lanyard, a constant source of amusement at these tournaments; imagine the jobsworth who would stop the manager of Italy and tell him he must carry the proper accreditation at all times, or else he ain\u2019t getting in. Grosso himself, after being mobbed and covered with ecstatic team-mates, jerked around on the floor like a recently caught fish trying to flap out of an angler\u2019s hand. This was perhaps the ultimate \u201cin from the moment it left his foot\u201d goal. The camera angle from behind the net shows the perfect arc of the ball, swooping towards the corner of the net like a sniffer dog homing in on the pockets of a backpacker returning from Amsterdam. Lehmann offered a full dive, but he knew. He had to know he could do nothing, his efforts a mere token. It\u2019s usually said of strikers that they \u201cknow where the goal is\u201d, but one of the more remarkable things about this goal is that Grosso didn\u2019t look up, and neither did it appear like an especially convincing shot. It seemed as though Grosso\u2019s legs were travelling through water, or that he had an anvil attached to his ankle. It resembled a baseball hitter just closing his eyes, swinging from his heels and hoping for the best, then looking up just in time to see the ball sail over the fence. Not that this is necessarily a criticism: it was a moment of instinct, from which some of the best goals are scored. Grosso didn\u2019t have the time or, given his fatigue and the tension of the occasion, the capability to think about it. He swung his foot one second and was an Italian hero the next.     Fabio Grosso scores the for Italy. after Andrea Pirlo\u2019s pass. Photograph: Lee Smith/Action Images    But before the goal, the pass. Oh the pass. In the film Looking For Eric, Eric Cantona is asked what his favourite moment in a Manchester United shirt was. Cantona, or at least the fictionalised version of him, rejected the dozens of brilliant goals he scored and instead picked a dinked pass for Denis Irwin to find the net instead. If someone ever does the same for Pirlo, his answer may well be the same. It was only a six- or seven-yard ball, but it was the timing that made it. If in jazz it is the notes you don\u2019t play that matter, it was the opportunities Pirlo didn\u2019t take to play the pass on this occasion that were important, the playmaker\u2019s playmaker delaying and delaying until the moment was exactly right. Picking up the ball on the edge of the area in the last minutes of a World Cup semi-final might panic many, but not Pirlo. There was even a hint of a showboat thrown in there, looking towards the right touchline as he slipped the ball the other way, between Bastian Schweinsteiger and Christoph Metzelder, the latter in theory supposed to be marking Grosso from the corner. The sheer audacity of playing a no-look pass in that situation is very nearly better than the goal itself. \u201cI hoped the ball would arrive,\u201d Grosso told the Italian paper La Repubblica earlier this year. \u201cWhen I saw that Andrea had the ball at his feet the chances of it coming to me increased. At times he doesn\u2019t look at you but he often finds the perfect moment to pass to you. I had a feeling it would come to me \u2013 and it did. I aimed for the corner without looking at the goal, imagining where the corner was. Luckily I pictured it correctly, in the right place.\u201d His reaction immediately after the game was a little more emotional. \u201cI am drunk with joy,\u201d he said. \u201cI haven\u2019t got much to say only that it is a victory for a strong group of people.\u201d Germany attempted to equalise, but their spirit was surely broken. As they threw everything forwards, Italy countered and Iaquinta fed Del Piero to open his body, curl the ball into the top corner and make it 2-0, dumping salt into a gaping wound. It was a little like a gangster standing over a body to shoot bullets into a freshly-killed adversary, not even to make sure they were dead but more to assert absolute superiority. Del Piero ran off to celebrate in front of Noel Gallagher, high in the stands, with whom he is implausibly rather good pals, and who the Juventus forward thus decided was a lucky charm and insisted he attend the final, wearing exactly the same clothes.     Fabio Grosso curls the ball into the net. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/Guardian    After the goal, and the win, mere details for Grosso. All he then did was score the winning penalty to give Italy the most unlikely World Cup victory since, well, the last time they won it. In theory that penalty was more significant than the semi-final goal because it won the tournament, but without the strike a few days earlier they might not even have been there. Somehow it doesn\u2019t seem fair that Grosso could have two moments like this. Baggio, and indeed Franco Baresi, will forever be haunted by their misses in the 1994 final, two of the greats of Italian football left to wonder what might have been and who, despite their weighty hauls at club level, don\u2019t have the medal, or the moments, that Grosso does.

It is a vast, incalculable human tragedy.  But how much do you really know about it?  Recently, BBC reporter Mamdouh Akbiek and researcher Eloise Dicker, put their knowledge and experience of the conflict into an interactive text adventure, Syrian Journey, which is available for free on the BBC site. Based on dozens of first-hand stories accrued during a BBC Arabic digital project on the region, it starts with the player selling their home in Damascus for a vastly reduced price, before making a series of gruelling decisions about what to do next. Do you flee to Egypt or Turkey? Do you trust the traffickers profiting from the misery of refugees? Do you reach Europe by sea (cheaper) or air (less risky)? Sadly, according to the game, many of those choices will end in tragedy. Both the Daily Mail and The Sun have reacted with bluster and fury to the project. In its story on Monday, the Mail claimed that BBC bosses have been \u201cslammed\u201d for depicting the humanitarian tragedy in a game. The article quotes a Middle East expert who states \u201cthe decision of the BBC to transform the human suffering of literally millions into a children\u2019s game beggars belief.\u201d Mostly, of course, this is down to a misunderstanding about what games are \u2013 or can be. It\u2019s telling that the Mail\u2019s expert refers to Syrian Journey as a \u201cchildren\u2019s game\u201d despite the fact that no such claim is made on the game\u2019s home page. Indeed, it is placed in the site\u2019s news section, and is clearly labeled as a news-based interactive experience.  The inference is that all games are for children, and that this is not a medium that can support or explore serious subject matter. It is, in short, an old-fashioned moral panic, a dated reaction to a medium that has been maturing for over 40 years. Indeed, interactive news games have been around for over a decade, ever since web-based platforms like Flash have allowed developers to quickly develop and distribute topical interactive experiences. A glimpse at the work of studios like Molleindustria and Persuasive Games shows how subjects like fast food production and airport security can be effectively analysed and expressed in game form. Ex-BBC journalist Janet Jones is now a professor in journalism and dean of arts and creative industries at London South Bank university. For the last 15 years she has been studying the evolution of journalism, from print, through broadcast and into the digital era. She\u2019s not surprised that tabloid news sources would take such a stance. \u201cThe idea that in the future, news will be played rather than read is quite hard for some people to think about,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you look at the history of journalism, whenever a new platform comes online, whether that\u2019s been radio, television or the internet, you\u2019ve had people saying that news could never migrate. The idea of television news caused a huge moral panic. The BBC was worried about influencing viewers in a way that would undermine the serious discuss of news culture. The idea of an anchor person was problematic \u2013 what if they made a particular expression while saying a phrase? How would that translate into the way the public received that news? They were worried about how a visual medium could communicate the discourse of news.\u201d Now, however, most key news organisations are exploring the possibilities of interactive storytelling. Several major European news corporations have taken part in news hackdays in Cologne and Amsterdam, where experimental news games were produced over weekend sessions; meanwhile Buzzfeed already has a game development studio working on topical projects.   Related: Gaming the news: why today's hack events are tomorrow's headlines    \u201cGames have really matured as a form in the last few years,\u201d says Tomas Rawlings of Auroch Digital, a Bristol-based developer that specialises in news games, and has produced its own exploration of the Syrian conflict, Endgame Syria (and has also made games for the BBC). \u201cWe\u2019re seeing them being used in health, education, training and in simulation. So the idea that games must equal fun and so trivialise a topic is really out of touch. Games offer a range of ways of taking on a topic that linear forms can\u2019t \u2013 putting you in the shoes of another person being one advantage; which this game does.\u201d Over 33 million people in the UK now regularly play games, according to research by the Internet Advertising Bureau: the figures are similarly high in most developed countries. Games have become pervasive \u2013 and more importantly to a generation of teenagers, they represent our digital era. Through tablets, smartphones and social media, children now expect to be able to interactive with what they see on screen. They understand that games are a medium of communication, not just of entertainment. There is a vast difference in tone and nuance between, say, a blockbusting mega-release like Grand Theft Auto, and a title like Papers, Please, a game that beautifully and engagingly explores the idea of immigration politics. Like every other artform, from poetry to film, games are capable of nuance and subtlty.  Syrian Journey is a very simple but very direct exploration of the country\u2019s refugee crisis, but it houses the issues in a compelling and involving format. It is a digestible introduction to the concept of trafficking, and the desperate uncertainty of migration. (The Guardian launched its own interactive game in 2014, in which users assumed the role of a Syrian asylum seeker navigating the difficult entry into Fortress Europe.) According to Jones, this is not something that can be shut down. It is something that\u2019s inevitable as we move from linear to interactive media. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop a medium that now fundamentally underpins all communication in our society today,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t cut off interactive media from the news discourse. It\u2019s a misunderstanding that all games are frivolous and that\u2019s all they can be. For years, interactive simulation experiences have been used in the training of pilots and in the military, they\u2019re the way scientists explore how something may work. It\u2019s an engrossing and intellectually challenging experience when you game an experiment \u2013 there are many scenarios underpinning every decision. \u201cMy children expect media to be interactive. I watch what they get from Buzzfeed, which is now investing in deeper investigative journalism, and I understand that interactivity is who they are, it\u2019s how they engage with the world. My ten-year-old has probably never watched television \u2013 I expect a lot of children are the same. We can\u2019t put this genie back in the bottle, we can\u2019t make them interact with media in the way that I did.\u201d Jones is now working on establishing the sorts of codes of conduct that will be needed as games emerge as a stable and conventional news medium. There will be outrages and mistakes on the way, as there have always been when new media channels have sought to tell us about the world, but there will also be new possibilities.  This is only going to become more pressing, and more fascinating, when virtual reality headsets like the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive make it into people\u2019s homes. Projects like the University of Southern California\u2019s Immersive Journalism experiment, in which researchers created a virtual depiction of a Syrian street scene during a missile attack, hint at the power and potential of placing us directly within news stories. Immersion, participation and direct visceral experience are all becoming part of the news agenda. Now, the response has to be one of preparation rather than knee-jerk terror. \u201cOf course there are pitfalls, there always are with new media,\u201d says Jones. \u201cSo lets have a look at those issues and work through them. To respond with moral panic, well, that is what beggars belief.\u201d", "sentences": ["Several major European news corporations have taken part in news hackdays in Cologne and Amsterdam, where experimental news games were produced over weekend sessions; meanwhile Buzzfeed already has a game development studio working on topical projects."], "title": "Syrian Journey: why the BBC is right to make a game about the refugee crisis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/06/syrian-journey-bbc-game-refugee-crisis", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Culture", "Controversy", "Syria", "Game culture", "PC", "BBC"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-04-06T15:45:27Z", "article": "James MacMillan\u2019s St Luke Passion is the second of four planned works, one based on each gospel, that aim to approach the differing passion narratives from contrasting stylistic perspectives. The big, controversial St John Passion was first heard in 2008 and an intimate setting of St Mark is in the offing. The St Luke Passion, its scale somewhere between the two, was first performed in Amsterdam last year, and was heard in Birmingham and Cambridge before being given its London premiere by the Britten Sinfonia. MacMillan himself conducted. The work\u2019s principal reference point is Bach, whose chorale O Haupt Voll Blut und Wunden emerges in the orchestra during the angry postlude to the crucifixion. But its presence throws up differences rather than similarities: where Bach\u2019s passions draw the listener into a private confrontation with mortality that can transcend individual belief, MacMillan is exactingly theological.    There is an unvarying quality to it all that doesn\u2019t quite sustain the work\u2019s 80-minute span    The passion story is contextualised by a prelude dealing with the annunciation and a postlude that depicts the ascension and glances towards the second coming.

The deal will give the US firm access to TNT\u2019s European road network, and create a substantial competitor to DHL and UPS. TNT\u2019s executive and supervisory boards have unanimously recommended the deal. Its largest shareholder, PostNL, has agreed to sell its 14.7% shareholding. FedEx will pay \u20ac8 in cash for every TNT share, a 33% premium over TNT\u2019s closing price of \u20ac6 in Amsterdam on 2 April. Two years ago, UPS tried to take over TNT but its \u20ac5.2bn bid was blocked by EU competition authorities. Unlike FedEx, UPS already had a strong European network when it made its \u20ac9.50 a share offer.  That deal would have seen the creation of the biggest European group in the fight for the global parcel market. The deal was torpedoed after EU competition authorities said it would have restricted competition on the continent. Since then, TNT has revamped its business, selling operations and investing in its road network in a weak European market for business package deliveries. In a joint statement, FedEx and TNT said they would \u201ccooperate to avoid any significant redundancies in the global or Dutch workforces\u201d and \u201cexisting employment terms of TNT Express will be respected\u201d. They plan to keep TNT\u2019s hub in Li\u00e8ge, Belgium, but will sell its airline operations in compliance with airline ownership regulations.  Data from 2013 puts DHL at a 19% market share in Europe with UPS at 16% while TNT was at 12% and FedEx 5%. \u201cThis transaction allows us to quickly broaden our portfolio of international transportation solutions to take advantage of market trends \u2013 especially the continuing growth of global e-commerce \u2013 and positions FedEx for greater long-term profitable growth,\u201d FedEx CEO Frederick W. Smith said in the statement. Both FedEx and TNT Express said they were confident the deal will be passed by regulatory authorities. \u201cThe transaction will increase competition in Europe. We say a third strong competitor in this marketplace is essential,\u201d FedEx Express chief executive David Bronczek said. He said the FedEx and TNT Express networks are \u201cextremely complementary\u201d. \u201cTNT has an exceptional European road platform. It will greatly improve our ability to serve European customers,\u201d he said. \u201cFedEx has always been recognised to have a need for a stronger pan-European ground network to complement our strong intercontinental network.\u201d TNT chief executive Tex Gunning said the deal is \u201cmuch better and simpler\u201d than the UPS takeover. \u201cWhile we did not solicit an acquisition, we truly believe that FedEx\u2019s proposal, both from a financial and a non-financial view, is good news for all stakeholders,\u201d he said.  \u201cOur people and customers can profit from the true global reach and expanded propositions, while with this offer our shareholders can already reap benefits today that otherwise would only have been available in the longer run.\u201d Gunning brushed off reports that the deal would lead to job cuts at TNT Express, which employs some 65,000 people worldwide. \u201cThere is little overlap, our businesses are complementary,\u201d he said. The two companies expect the deal to close in the first half of 2016. Andre Mulder, an analyst with financial services company Kepler Cheuvreux, said an opportunity for FedEx arose when the UPS deal was blocked.   \u201cIt was a deal long overdue. I think FedEx was from the start the most logical partner of TNT. Because of its very low market share in Europe, I think it is better to buy a company in one stroke than to go through a lengthy process of buying all the companies in markets in Europe and integrate them,\u201d he said. \u201cBy acquiring TNT, FedEx gets a useful exposure on the ground in Europe.\u201d  TNT TNT Express operates in more than 200 countries and maintains a leading role in the road freight network in Europe. The company went through extensive restructuring after the UPS bid failed, announcing in March 2013 that 4,000 jobs would be slashed \u2013 or 6% of its total workforce \u2013 over the next three years. FedEx FedEx employs more than 320,000 people worldwide with an annual turnover of $47bn. Based in Memphis, Tennessee, the company will finance the deal with debt.

The suspect\u2019s lawyer, Gerald Roethof, told De Telegraaf that his client did not know what drug he was selling. He had \u201cthe shock of his life\u201d, Roethof said, when he saw CCTV footage of himself in the media and learned he was wanted in connection with street sales of the drug, which have left 20 other foreign tourists needing emergency medical treatment over the past year. \u201cHe immediately tried to trace his supplier, but was unsuccessful,\u201d the lawyer told the paper. \u201cThat\u2019s why he decided to give himself up.\u201d  The images, broadcast last month on Dutch television, were recorded on a city-centre street in February on the day that three Danish tourists bought the drug, fell seriously ill, and had to be taken to hospital. White heroin, which is historically produced in the \u201cGolden Triangle\u201d of south-east Asia, is typically both purer and more expensive than brown. It can prove fatal when inhaled, according to a spokeswoman for the Jellinek addiction clinic: \u201cHeroin is a depressant and cocaine a stimulant,\u201d she told Dutch media.  \u201cIf people don\u2019t know they are using heroin and lay out a line thinking it\u2019s cocaine, there is a very high chance of overdosing. Their heartbeat and breathing can slow right down. They may fall into a semi-conscious state; they may end up inhaling their vomit; eventually, they may stop breathing and die of respiratory failure. Snorting white heroin can be fatal.\u201d The bodies of Britons Shaun Brotherston, 20, and Bradley Price, 21, were found in a hotel room in south Amsterdam last November, less than a month after a third 22-year-old British tourist died in similar circumstances. The pair were lying next to a white powder, later identified as white heroin, which a police spokesman, Rob van der Veen, said they had \u201calmost certainly\u201d bought in the belief it was cocaine. The deaths and hospitalisations \u2013 many patients needed resuscitation \u2013 prompted the city to launch a public awareness campaign. Posters in popular tourist areas, such as the Leidseplein, and English-language flyers in hotels and youth hostels warned young holidaymakers that people were suffering \u201csevere health problems after using cocaine bought on the street\u201d. Electronic billboards carried stark messages such as \u201cExtremely dangerous white heroin sold to tourists as cocaine\u201d, while the justice ministry offered a \u20ac15,000 (\u00a311,000) reward for information leading to the arrest of the dealer.

In this situation, avoiding more victims takes precedence \u2026 over any negative impact on the city\u2019s reputation.\u201d Although hard drugs are illegal in the Netherlands, many tourists, particularly young visitors, are drawn to Amsterdam\u2019s famous coffee shops, where the sale of cannabis is tolerated.

Realising his ambitions for live performance as general director of English National Opera proved more elusive, but he went on to do much more in broadcasting, particularly radio, once free of the demands of having to run an organisation. Dennis\u2019s desire to communicate his love and knowledge of music, and the context in which it was created, lay at the heart of the outstanding TV documentaries that he produced. Liszt in Weimar (1986), for example, covered the composer\u2019s piano playing, romances, travels and the social, cultural and political world that nurtured him. Dennis could tell this story in all its cultural complexity and thereby further understanding of Liszt\u2019s music, because, as with his other favourite composers \u2013 Mahler, Jan\u00e1\u010dek, Wagner and Bart\u00f3k \u2013 he was a true European. Mitteleuropa was in his blood. He thought big and took risks, as with the wonderfully evocative Vespers in Venice (1989). When John Eliot Gardiner conducted Monteverdi\u2019s Vespers of 1610 in St Mark\u2019s, Dennis seized the opportunity to highlight the basilica\u2019s spectacular architecture, shooting on film to guarantee richer and deeper colours. This called for six cameras placed all over the building, synchronised with each other and with the sound recording, and proved a triumph for all concerned. At the BBC, Dennis held posts as editor, music programmes (1985-88), assistant head of music and arts (1988-91) and head of music programmes (1991-93). New music, particularly new opera, was an abiding passion: he directed a TV version of Tippett\u2019s New Year, produced a TV version of Mark-Anthony Turnage\u2019s Greek, directed by Peter Maniura, and televised Michael Nyman\u2019s The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat. In addition to his work with Gardiner, he forged close working relationships with the conductors Georg Solti and Valery Gergiev. His gift for putting together creative teams was evident in inviting Leslie Megahey to direct Bart\u00f3k\u2019s Duke Bluebeard\u2019s Castle: Megahey\u2019s success in bringing out the opera\u2019s dark eroticism led to the magnificent production being awarded the Italia prize in 1989. Perhaps Dennis\u2019s closest collaborator was the playwright Michael Frayn. They met in 1972, when Dennis was starting his directing career with a series on writers\u2019 houses \u2013 Michael wrote and presented one on Laurence Sterne\u2019s Shandy Hall. The pair went on to make films about four great cities of central Europe: Imagine a City Called Berlin (1975); Vienna: The Mask of Gold (1977), evoking the city\u2019s cultural heyday in 1900; Magic Lantern: Prague (1993), featuring the city\u2019s traditions of magic, illusion and storytelling; and Budapest: Written on Water (1996). Michael says of Dennis: \u201cHe was a remarkable man, so intelligent, so quick, so good at making clear what we were trying to say. We could sometimes get very cross with each other, but mostly we worked very easily and fruitfully together. We laughed a lot, and had a great deal of fun.\u201d When Dennis went to ENO in 1993, he told Opera magazine that he wanted \u201cto make opera a natural part of the fabric of living as much as any other entertainment like television or movies\u201d. His championing of new music resulted in the commissioning of Turnage\u2019s The Silver Tassie and David Sawer\u2019s From Morning to Midnight, and productions of Bernd Alois Zimmermann\u2019s Die Soldaten and Alfred Schnittke\u2019s Life With an Idiot. Although an inherited deficit made his tenure at the company one of his less happy experiences, Dennis never lost his long-term vision. It became clear to him that ENO needed a purpose-built opera house. Discovering that he would not get sufficient support for this bold idea, he resigned in 1997. But Dennis remained loyal to ENO, attending first nights whenever he was able, including the production of Wagner\u2019s Mastersingers earlier this year.         Dennis Marks discussing Wandering Jew: The Search for Joseph Roth    After leaving ENO, Dennis created some of his finest work: the film Jan\u00e1\u010dek\u2019s Gypsy Love (2004), with the tenor Ian Bostridge, and the TV series All the Russias, a history of Russia told through its rich musical legacy. His books included Wandering Jew: The Search for Joseph Roth (2011), an account of the life of the writer. Dennis was born in Harrow, north-west London. His father, Samuel, and mother Kitty (nee Ostrovsky) were children of immigrants from Russia; Samuel became company secretary for a clothing manufacturer. Dennis went to Haberdashers\u2019 Aske\u2019s boys\u2019 school, Elstree, Hertfordshire. That was where Dennis and I first acted in plays: he was a very convincing, scary Macbeth. We were in the choir together and shared the wonderful experience of performing Bach\u2019s B Minor Mass and the Verdi Requiem. At Trinity College, Cambridge, he gained a first in English, and in 1969 he joined the BBC as a television researcher. In recent years he embarked on a new career, in radio: the warmth of his speaking voice made him a natural for the medium. His narration of Jan\u00e1\u010dek Day on Radio 3 in July 2004, marking the 150th anniversary of the composer\u2019s birth, combined travelogue, biography, history and musical analysis. One of his finest achievements was The Search for Sepharad (2006), a four-part series for Radio 3. Typically for Dennis, it embraced all aspects of Sephardic culture in Spain. As he tracked the diaspora of Jews from Spain in the late 15th century through Istanbul, Thessaloniki, London, Amsterdam and Jerusalem, his gift for evoking place through words turned radio into a cinema of the mind. The programmes embraced cultural and political history, cookery, philosophy, wine, anecdotes and, as always, music. Dennis had a big, warm personality. Even those with whom he fought testified to his ability to inspire others. In 1972, he married Deborah Cranston, and they had two children, Gabi and Ben. That marriage ended in divorce, and in 1992 Dennis married Sally Groves. She, his children and his sister, Sue, survive him.John Abulafia Humphrey Burton writes: Among the boisterous and bolshy crowd of producers and directors that I took over as head of BBC TV music and arts in 1975, young Dennis Marks already stood out as somebody who knew the difference between a hawk and a handsaw. True, he could be maddeningly argumentative; he was not always a model of tact and he sometimes barged about the room like the proverbial bull. But he was warm-hearted and funny \u2013 indeed absolutely brilliant at the department\u2019s 1977 Christmas party, where he donned a kilt and did a wicked impression of John Drummond departing the BBC for the Edinburgh festival. Dennis knew a lot and he talked a lot about what he knew, but the point was that he could deliver: he made well-crafted and deeply interesting programmes across a broad cultural spectrum. Colleagues at home \u2013 and abroad via the International Musik Zentrum, the organisation for music and media professionals based in Vienna \u2013 admired his energy and passion as he planned music shows and series for the BBC in the 1980s. He enjoyed shocking the bourgeoisie and was an unrepentant modernist, relishing his own zany telecast of Nigel Osborne\u2019s impenetrable Glyndebourne opera The Electrification of the Soviet Union (1987). Having been his boss for six years, I later enjoyed working for him as a director of two much more mainstream projects: a three-hour salute to George Gershwin hosted by Michael Tilson Thomas (1987), and a live relay by a BBC camera team of Boris Godunov from the stage of the Kirov Opera to Leningrad, as it then was (1990). What chutzpah to dream up such a project! And how he put together a budget was a mystery and a marvel. The city was tottering towards collapse; there was virtually no food to be had in shops or cafes, but Dennis was a BBC producer who made sure his staff had a hot meal at the end of the day: he authorised the purchase of black-market pizzas at $50 apiece. And there he was next evening in the director\u2019s box at the opera doing live interviews with Gergiev and our British Boris, Robert Lloyd, while the show was relayed back to the UK. The show was such a success, we repeated the operation two years later with Prokofiev\u2019s War and Peace.

Three of the artists I spoke to were born in this country; the fourth, Yusra Warsama, arrived as a baby. All in their 30s, they are old enough to remember the relatively relaxed multiculturalism of the 1990s and to have come of age during the increasing tensions, driven by the news agenda of the past 15 years. The question I was interested to put to them was this: to what degree do they feel a responsibility to use their artistic voices to counter the stridently negative stereotypes that young British Muslims face? The answers, properly complex and varied, are set out in their words below. Though each of them had a very distinct reaction to the challenges of making art that seemed honest and relevant to the present moment, it was also true that in talking to the four of them separately, common themes emerged. One was the sense, expressed by poet, actor and playwright Warsama, that the current media conversation was almost entirely one way. British Muslim communities were often the subject of inquiry and suspicion, but were rarely allowed space to express exactly how they felt about it. \u201cWhen people find language for themselves it should mean they can have a robust conversation,\u201d Warsama said. \u201cThat is what my generation is about. We feel British, we feel part of this society, we want to talk about it.\u201d And when each of the four did talk about it, there was the sense in every case that the desire to be understood, in a sea of misunderstanding, was the impulse that led them to pursue their vocation in the first place. Two of the four gave up other careers because they felt they had no choice but to try to make better sense of their world; writing, for Avaes Mohammad, who was studying for a PhD in chemistry at the time of 9/11, was a way of maintaining sanity. He suggested that the Muslim communities he knew felt \u201cunder siege\u201d \u2013 spied on, interrogated, routinely asked to \u201cput their house in order\u201d as if they were not, and had never been, an equal part of British society. This, suggested Birmingham street artist Mohammed Ali, had led to a greater defensiveness, an inward turn, insularity and paranoia, both within his community and toward it. If the four artists were collectively committed to one thing it was to reverse that trend, to get communities talking to one another again. Art \u2013 whether it be one of Ali\u2019s murals mixing Qur\u2019anic calligraphy with Banksy-style graphic impact, or Aisha Zia\u2019s play No Guts, Ho Heart, No Glory, staged in a boxing gym and telling true stories of young Bradford girls\u2019 lives \u2013 was the channel for that conversation, a way of undermining polarities and finding some shared ground. None of the artists saw herself or himself as a spokesperson \u2013 that would be a different kind of denial of individuality. As Warsama said: \u201cI could write something about being a subjugated Muslim Somali girl in Manchester, held down and determined to break free of her shackles, you know. That\u2019s what I\u2019m expected to do. It would be really easy to get an audience going. But I wouldn\u2019t be telling the truth. The oppressed Muslim girl is a sexy story. The woman from Moss Side who wears a headscarf and has become an astrophysicist or whatever is not sexy because it doesn\u2019t fit that dominant narrative.\u201d Changing that narrative is frustrating and sometimes courageous work. It is, as they would all agree, also about mischief and surprise.     Mohammed Ali: \u2018Street art made sense to me as a Muslim.\u2019 Photograph: Antonio Zazueta Olmos/The Observer New Review    Mohammed Ali, street artist and curator Mohammed Ali, 35, was born in Birmingham and set up the Hubb arts centre in his home city. His painting includes references to Arabic calligraphy as well as western graffiti styles. He has been commissioned to create murals in London, New York, Chicago, Toronto and many other cities. He recently spoke at the first TedX conference at the Vatican, on the subject of religious freedom. This Hubb space opened and it was exciting because there was nowhere else like it. It was run by Muslim artists but open to all. And it wasn\u2019t in Birmingham city centre, it was in Sparkbrook, an area associated with all kinds of negativity. That was 2008. We ran it for three years and it was amazing. People were coming from all over. I have travelled to a lot of places but I am very pro-Birmingham. This is my city: my father was buried here, my three kids were born here. The city council compulsorily purchased the Hubb building. They said they were demolishing it but it\u2019s still there. There\u2019s some talk it might be an Islamic centre, but we don\u2019t need any more of those. We need art reaching outwards. I just took on the keys to a new space, owned by the Yemeni community. In six months we will be up and running again. One problem for Muslims is that social spaces in this country exist around alcohol. People expect it to be there. If you\u2019d seen what I\u2019d seen in the restaurant my dad ran when I was growing up, the crap we had to put up with from drunks, the puke I had to clean out of the toilets on a Friday and Saturday night, you would know it is not just a religious issue with me. Alcohol put my dad in hospital \u2013 I saw him beaten around the head. So I won\u2019t meet in bars. I go to cafes. But there is not much cafe culture here. That\u2019s why the Hubb space was exciting. When I had an event there I would get upset if there wasn\u2019t a 50/50 white/Asian split in the room. They would often be on separate sides but they would at least be in the same room. Whenever I do a programme in mainstream places I say to people in the community: go, claim your place in these spaces, it\u2019s your taxes that are paying for them. The sad reality is that, increasingly, there is nowhere in the city where people really mix. I\u2019m fed up with being part of a silent minority. The immigrant mentality when my father came was: \u201cSon, keep your head down.\u201d People would do a runner in my dad\u2019s restaurant. His mentality would be: let them go. My brother and I never did. We would chase them for miles. You have to stand your ground. A friend of mine runs a website in Amsterdam, which is called, in Dutch, We Are Here to Stay. There is something about the spirit of that that I love. Street art is like that. It is not the only thing I do but it is the perfect medium for me. It made sense as a Muslim. It was an expression of \u201cHey, I\u2019m lost in this city, but I exist!\u201d I like that George Orwell quote: \u201cIn a time of universal deceit, telling the truth is a revolutionary act.\u201d It feels like that. When I started, you could count on one hand the Muslim artists in this country. Here we were, post-9/11, trying to represent our Muslim British identity. It felt like something historic, almost. I was in the middle of a painting when the Charlie Hebdo news happened. I was thinking: how will this painting be taken? I was thinking: will I have my door kicked in? Will there be a law introduced that will stop the free expression of Muslim artists? The painting was exploring some of the local heritage that interested me. My dad worked at the Birmingham Small Arms (BSA) factory. People here forget that the south Asian community worked in the factories. In the painting I was looking at the history of the pen. There was a time this city made 75% of the world\u2019s pens and I really liked that idea. It linked back to calligraphy and Islamic tradition. Then in the middle of me making this painting \u2013 Charlie Hebdo. Suddenly pens became a different thing. This weapon we were being prodded with. So it became a darker piece, in a way. The next day the government starts talking about the inevitability of surveillance being increased. Our FaceTime, our WhatsApp \u2013 that was their priority now. I incorporated this surveillance camera in the painting. It was kind of a live piece. Art is the best way of getting things out in the open. When we talk about radicalisation and we talk about those girls in Bethnal Green, say, my response is: give them a space in society to express themselves, to be angry and create what they want. I\u2019m not an expert in preventing radicalisation but my feeling would be that being heard is enough for most people. I always say that if I was not being an artist I could have fallen into all kinds of crime. I thank graffiti. God knows what it saved me from. We can theorise for ever about radicalisation but sometimes the answers are right under our nose.     Avaes Mohammad, photographed at the Park Theatre in Finsbury Park, London: xxxx Photograph: Antonio Zazueta Olmos/The Observer New Review    Avaes Mohammad, poet and playwright Avaes Mohammad was born in Blackburn in 1978. He is the author of seven acclaimed plays. His poetry has won him an Amnesty Media award. His new plays, Hurling Rubble at the Moon and Hurling Rubble at the Sun, which examine the parallels between extreme English nationalism and Islamic fundamentalism in a northern city, will premiere at the Park Theatre in London next month.  I wrote my first poem, for performance, after the Oldham riots in 2001. I was in Manchester being a student, completing my bachelor\u2019s degree in chemistry, and in May I came home from a club one night, late, off my head, and turned on Newsnight to see a man in a suit explaining how there was a serious issue with young Asian men in the north. That was a real huge shock to me. In my somewhat inebriated state, I remember thinking: \u201cThere is nobody on that panel speaking for Asian youth, so these men could get away with saying anything.\u201d Later that summer, I returned to Manchester to start my PhD, 9/11 happened and the whole world, including my whole world, changed. Suddenly everyone wanted to know about Islam. Friends started to question my religion and where I was brought up. Before that, I was just a student like everyone else. I started writing poetry, performing poetry, looking back, as a means of trying to stay sane within myself, with all the lies around me. When I first pitched these new plays three years ago, it was a trilogy that was going to look at the British Muslim experience of the last 15 years. The first part was going to be about that 2001 summer. And it was going to be set in a car. When I was that age, I spent my youth in cars, with friends, smoking weed, listening to Tupac, chasing girls and pretending to be bad. In Blackburn. When we were doing that nobody wanted to find out about us. As soon as the riots and 9/11 happened, though, it was as if young Asian men were noticed for the first time as a group. At the end of the play, these guys would emerge from the car. When I pitched it, though, the theatre company, Red Ladder, said it couldn\u2019t be a trilogy. They said why don\u2019t you make it an analogous play and look at the white working-class extremes in those northern cities, too. I was excited by that. I had done a lot of creative workshops trying to bring those two communities together. There was a truth in the idea that the two extremisms were symbiotic, even though they were mostly segregated. What happened in one affected the other. So my plays are about two people who don\u2019t feel they belong any more, a young Muslim and a white working-class guy. Neither has been allowed to feel part of the mainstream makeup of the country. That is where the extremism comes from on both sides. To use a scientific analogy, if you leave something alone too long then it stagnates and creates infection. I did a lot of research for both parts of the play. I looked hard at the lives of the Leeds bombers and Mohammad Sidique Khan. He is a similar age to me. He was quite invested in this country but at some point he clearly began to feel terribly out of place here. His parents practised this kind of rural Pakistani version of Islam and that didn\u2019t fit for him. Forty years ago, there were probably political groups you could join. Workers\u2019 parties might have told you it was the fault of global capitalism. But that doesn\u2019t happen any more. In fact, the only people telling these young men why their lives were as they are were these radical Islamists preaching in jeans and T-shirts. Their arguments are not right but they do make sense. Palestine, Kashmir, Iraq, Afghanistan \u2013 these are post-imperial conflicts, they say. And suddenly your poverty of opportunity in Leeds or Blackburn becomes a global struggle. For certain young men, that is an incredibly powerful message. Ironically, it is something like the same for the white working class. Except instead of the Islamists telling them why they are where they are, they have the BNP or the EDL. I think, I hope, my plays can bring light to that simple truth but also humanise these issues. The fact is, I don\u2019t think we are ever going to get to a place where we can think about solutions until we understand these people are part of us, part of Britain. It is not Islam that has created them alone. These are British Muslims. I was on a different career trajectory. I was going to be a scientist. But since 9/11 I felt I had no option but to write. I do it because this is my home and I want to make it a better place.     Yusra Warsama: \u2018I want to show the good side of Somali people and Muslim people, because it\u2019s clear the world doesn\u2019t see us that way.\u2019 Photograph: Antonio Zazueta Olmos/The Observer New Review    Yusra Warsama, poet, actor and playwright Yusra Warsama, 30, grew up in Manchester. A play she co-wrote, Rites, about issues surrounding female genital mutilation is currently touring. She will appear in James Graham\u2019s The Vote, for Channel 4 and the Donmar Warehouse, a \u201creal-time play\u201d set in a polling station, in May. I don\u2019t say I\u2019m a Muslim artist any more than I would say I am a black artist or a Mancunian artist, but they are all facets of my identity. I was born in the UAE after being displaced by civil war from Somalia. We were called \u201cblack Pakis\u201d when we first came here. Still, at primary school the worst thing that would happen is maybe someone would pull off your headscarf. The majority of the time people would ask you questions. Some of it was ignorance, some of it was curiosity, but I didn\u2019t mind that too much. I remember 11 September happened when I was at sixth form and the change was just really, really shocking. I had always worn my headscarf in a wrap style, but after that we all started to wear them in a traditional hijab way. It was almost like a statement, I suppose, but not one we had thought through. It was like, when you know something as beautiful all your life and suddenly the whole world is looking at it and that gaze isn\u2019t necessarily a gaze of curiosity but something more negative, then you start to feel defensive about what you love. The hardest thing is there are no questions any more. People think they know about Islam. But what they think they know is nothing I have ever seen. People say all Muslims are terrorists, and we are all responsible for terrorism. It\u2019s like saying Jimmy Savile was a paedophile so all English people must prove they aren\u2019t paedophiles. Really mad. I became an artist not to communicate anything in terms of my identity or my religion. I was doing a degree in criminology and sociology and I had always written and been interested in theatre. I went to the Contact theatre in Manchester and John McGrath, the director, gave us the space to experiment there. I did some professional acting, which I still do, but the writing was the thing I loved. I\u2019ve never felt a responsibility to write about British Muslims. But I suppose I want to show the good side of Somali people and Muslim people, because it\u2019s clear the world doesn\u2019t see us that way. I think I went on stage because I genuinely wanted to talk to people. I mostly prefer to do that in a play now rather than in the spoken word pieces I do. I find the ego part of it a bit uncomfortable at poetry slams or whatever. But at its best, performance poetry is: what if? How about? It\u2019s designed to open up a conversation. People crave that. I don\u2019t want to be coerced into being a spokeswoman for anyone but me. You know, there was a period when the Dutch activist Ayaan Hirsi Ali was really prominent in the media, and people called me up expecting me to be like her because I was Somali too. I was 22, had just had my first born, living in Manchester. I don\u2019t want to play someone else\u2019s role. In the 1990s, I had the opportunity of growing up with freedom of thought and space to think. Now there is such a negative feeling about Islam that young Muslims don\u2019t have that opportunity. They can\u2019t just be a mix of things, they have to be us or them. Why should a 15-year-old have to be asked all the time: how British are you? Or: how Muslim are you? They need space to breathe and express how they feel. You are told you can be free, but if you choose to express yourself in a particular way, even if it is slightly dangerous or wrong, there is no way to have a conversation about it. That is what causes the frustration and alienation. It\u2019s like when the Iraq war broke out in 2003. I was 19 and I couldn\u2019t understand it at all. It really upset me. I couldn\u2019t see it as anything else than an attack on Islam. What else was it? I was convinced they were going to attack Mecca. I remember having this thought that I would go to Mecca and be a human shield. That\u2019s a ridiculous idea really, of course, but that is how it felt. I remember that intensity of frustration. I was used to the institutions in British society making a bit of sense, having some clarity of thought, but here was the government you had been asked to trust, randomly perpetuating the hate against you. That is scary because where do you go? For me, one place is art or theatre. I\u2019m in this play The Vote, by James Graham at the Donmar Warehouse, which will also be on TV the night of the election. Judi Dench is in it too, which I am so excited about. Being a Muslim I\u2019m only meant to worship God, but when it comes to her I have to make a small exception\u2026     Aisha Zia, photgraphed at her home in east London: \u2018I happen to be an artist of Muslim and Pakistani heritage but I don\u2019t think this negative stereotyping is my issue, I think it is all of our issues.\u2019 Photograph: Antonio Zazueta Olmos/The Observer New Review    Aisha Zia, writer Aisha Zia is 34. She was a picture editor on the Financial Times for three years, before becoming a writer. Her second play No Guts, No Heart, No Glory, about Muslim women boxers, won the Scotsman Fringe First award in Edinburgh in 2014. Staged in real boxing gyms, the cast is made up of five young Muslim Pakistani women from Bradford, including Saira Tabasum, a British universities boxing champion. Your question is: \u201cDo I feel responsible for making art that responds to political issues because I am of Muslim heritage?\u201d The simple answer is no. The fact is, I have never felt the need to answer these questions. You wouldn\u2019t say I was a Christian playwright or a Catholic artist. My play No Guts, No Heart, No Glory is not about being a Pakistani or a Muslim or even about being a boxer. It is about being the best version you can be of yourself. Having said that, we \u2013 the Common Wealth theatre company \u2013 wanted to make the play because we felt we were taking on the media images of the Muslim community and we wanted to offset that. But it is not a Muslim thing, it\u2019s a social thing. I happen to be an artist of Muslim and Pakistani heritage but I don\u2019t think this negative stereotyping is my issue, I think it is all of our issues. There is a lot of black and white about our idea of British Muslims. There is a distinct lack of colouring-in or vibrancy. It was pretty difficult growing up as a Muslim girl in Peterborough; there weren\u2019t that many of us. I knew from a very early age it was going to be twice as hard for me to achieve anything I wanted to achieve because I had to fight harder for it. I was quite resentful when I was 16 because I had English friends and they just couldn\u2019t understand why I wasn\u2019t allowed to go out on a Friday night or go to a party. I decided that I wouldn\u2019t keep trying to explain it; I would do something different. I stayed in and read and tried to make myself as smart as I could be. I had to empower myself. I would look at those girls and think: you have no idea how easy your life is. One of the things I wanted to explore in the play was the difference between being a young English girl and a young Muslim girl. In the end, the answer I discovered was that there wasn\u2019t all that much difference, apart from the ones we impose. The script came out of interviews with the cast in Bradford, and my own experience, remembering being 16 and some of the problems I\u2019d had. Meeting the girls was very refreshing. I think the important thing about Bradford is that the Muslim community is incredibly diverse. The perception is that there are only two types of Muslim \u2013 the extremist and the liberal. But there are obviously as many different voices as in any community. One of the inspirations for the show was this wonderful lady we met, Alaa al-Abasi. She has 11 children, she wears a burqa and she boxes in the gym to keep fit. It\u2019s a very visceral thing, the play. We did it in Edinburgh, then Bradford and then we did Manchester, in Moss Side, at the Fire Station Boxing Gym. We want to take it to where people are rather than having them come to us. I love watching every show because I love watching the audience. The girls\u2019 families have been really positive about their daughters being in the play. We had to get consent, obviously. We didn\u2019t want to do anything they weren\u2019t comfortable with. We didn\u2019t want to sneak boyfriends into the story, mainly because that wasn\u2019t true to it anyway. The parents were mainly my age, my generation, and they were very keen to have a different version of the community portrayed. Not everyone\u2019s dad is trying to ship his daughter off to Pakistan to get married. It was important to spend time \u2013 about six months \u2013 with the girls to get their voices. They were awesome. We had cast them because they were all just about to become adults; we had Saira, who is a real boxer, with this amazing energy, and she coached the other girls. It was incredibly powerful. One of the interesting things for me was to see many of these girls consciously being Muslims because they want to be. They are modern girls, they pray five times a day, but nobody makes them do it \u2013 it comes from them. It is all about freedom of choice. \u2022 This article was amended on 15 April 2015. An earlier version of the interview with Aisha Zia said that she was a picture editor at the Financial Times for seven years, rather than three, and that she was born in Britain, rather than Pakistan. In addition, the quotation in which she described herself as \u2018a Muslim artist of Pakistani heritage\u2019 should correctly have read \u2018an artist of Muslim and Pakistani heritage\u2019.

The Bradford-based business reported \u00a3800m of losses just before Potts arrived, and had already earmarked \u00a31bn for price cuts over three years in an attempt to win back customers.", "sentences": ["Related: Morrisons sacks half its senior management team    While he was living in the UK during the week, Meijer is thought to have been leaving on Friday afternoons to fly back to Amsterdam where his family is based."], "title": "Morrisons loses another executive as management upheaval continues", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/apr/13/morrisons-loses-another-executive-as-management-upheaval-continues", "tags": ["Morrisons", "Business", "Retail industry", "Supermarkets", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-04-14T16:27:39Z", "article": "Viv Albertine, singer, the Slits My first job: Minicab leafleting all round Finchley in London. It was scary, wandering the streets at night, door to door. I was so terrified my mum used to come with me and wait at the end of each street. I had no idea how to work hard, no self-discipline. I\u2019d shove leaflets in the bin and had a stack in my bedroom that never got delivered. I never thought further than a week ahead until I was in my 20s. My big break: It was more like lots of threads coming together. Our mothers were born in the 1940s and grew up unable to express themselves. They raised a generation of militant girls \u2013 we would pursue what we wanted, and not bow to the pressure of doing things like owning a house. So the term \u201cbig break\u201d is kind of misleading. Young people can go on for ever waiting for a big moment, but it was lots of little things that led me to pick up a guitar in 1976. It was a crazy thing to do. Loads of boys played and thought I was ridiculous. But I did it anyway. My next job: I\u2019m writing another book. It\u2019s not as big as the last one. This is more meditative: it\u2019s about how the small things in life can be extraordinary too. Lennie James, actor     \u2018It was after working with Lynda La Plante that I felt I\u2019d shifted up to another level\u2019 \u2026 Lennie James. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    My first job: I worked as a freezer boy in Bejams the frozen-food retailer, in Wandsworth. I was 15 and my job was to stay in the warehouse, which was ice cold, and constantly fill up carts full of frozen stuff, to be taken to the shop floor by people who were allowed into the warm. My big break: The first time I noticed a difference in how I was treated was when I walked into an audition after Civvies. It was a show written by Lynda La Plante, about ex-paratroopers trying to make it in civilian life, and I was one of the six paratroopers. Lynda then wrote another miniseries for Channel 4 called Comics, and she offered me a role straight away because of my work on Civvies. I felt I\u2019d shifted to another level. I still have to go to auditions \u2013 everybody does \u2013 but there are more things I\u2019ve been shortlisted for. It\u2019s very rare, whoever you are, that you are the first choice for a gig. It\u2019s shocking the number of things about which you think: \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anyone else doing that role.\u201d Then you find out Tom Selleck was the first choice for Indiana Jones, or that Steve McQueen and Sly Stallone were considered for Beverly Hills Cop before Eddie Murphy. My next job: I\u2019m about to get on a plane to Atlanta to shoot zombies in the head. The writers are still working on the sixth season of The Walking Dead, so they haven\u2019t told me how long I\u2019ll be there \u2013 I\u2019m packing a bag I can use for three to six weeks. But I\u2019m used to that. As long as there\u2019s a washing machine, you can survive. David Hockney, artist     \u2018My big break was John Kasmin buying my pictures from the Young Contemporaries Exhibition in 1961. He paid about \u00a340\u2019 \u2026 David Hockney. Photograph: Jane Bown for the Observer    My first job: I never really had a job. I have always just painted. It\u2019s what I am still doing. My big break: It was John Kasmin buying pictures from the Young Contemporaries Exhibition in 1961. He bought Doll Boy and some of my other pictures, and paid me about \u00a340. I was in my second year at the RCA, so in my third year I\u2019d become a rich student and could buy cigarettes in packets of 20, not the usual tens most students had. My next job: I will be coming to England in May for my show at Annely Juda\u2019s in London. It\u2019s called Painting and Photography. Gina McKee, actor     \u2018My first job was a TV series called Quest of Eagles in 1979. I was 14. It was a brilliant learning curve\u2019 \u2026 Gina McKee. Photograph: ITV/Rex Shutterstock    My first job: I did a TV series called Quest of Eagles in 1979. I was 14. I was in the Youth Drama Workshop and someone came to see us and asked me to audition; I was the only one who got handpicked to audition. It was a brilliant learning curve. If I remember correctly, it was about this boy whose father dies, and on his deathbed he tells his son about a rare Polish icon that he has to find \u2013 and he also discovers that the secret service are after it, plus some baddies. I played the boy\u2019s best friend. My big break: Things changed for me when Our Friends in the North was transmitted, and there was another change \u2013 particularly outside the UK \u2013 when Notting Hill was released. It\u2019s always hard to tell, but the opportunities grew after those projects. Gail Stevens, the casting director, asked me to audition for Our Friends in the North. I had three auditions, and my final recall was a screen test, which was terrifying. They wanted to know what I\u2019d look like in the 60s, so I was made up by this wonderful makeup artist. But she only had a black nylon wig that looked like a Cher wig, so I looked like a drag artist. My next job: I\u2019m about to start rehearsing The Mother at the Ustinov in Bath. It\u2019s a brilliant French play by Florian Zeller. It was really successsful in France \u2013 it won the Moli\u00e8re award for best comedy. We haven\u2019t started rehearsals yet, but it\u2019s described as a black farce, so we\u2019ll see how we get along. Ken Loach, film-maker     \u2018We \u00adbecame notorious. We \u00adtackled what were thought to be daring subjects\u2019 \u2026 Ken Loach\u2019s Cathy Come Home Photograph: BBC    My first job: In the school holidays I worked in the Jubbly orange drink factory in Nuneaton. I got ripped to shreds by the women on the production line \u2013 all us adolescent boys did. Any youth was verbally abused for his lack of physical attraction, or insinuations about his manhood. I remember being bright red most of the time. I got 15 shillings, or a pound a week, to wheel stuff about; this would\u2019ve been 1953 or 54. It wasn\u2019t much more than pocket money. Then at 19, I started national service for two years, in the RAF, rising to the dizzy ranks of senior aircraftsman. I typed equipment schedules for two years then volunteered to go to the far east. They sent me to Nottingham. Coming from the West Midlands, it was certainly east. My big break: When I was at the BBC, I was asked to join The Wednesday Play group. It came on after the news at 9.15pm, and the point was to be as provocative and contemporary as the news. The BBC was quite provocative in those days \u2013 it became well known for its radical stance. The Clean-Up TV pressure group, with Mary Whitehouse, was formed largely because of what we did. There were four or five directors making programmes full-time. It became notorious because we did things like Cathy Come Home and Up the Junction, which tackled what were thought to be daring subjects. My first one was called Tap on the Shoulder, about London\u2019s underworld and gangs in the 60s. It was a comedy, really, but it opened the door to socially engaged drama \u2013 that was our brief. If I hadn\u2019t been asked to join the group, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do the things I\u2019ve tried to do since. I don\u2019t want to overblow it, but it was quite a groundbreaking thing. My next job: I\u2019m scratching around with the writer I work with, Paul Laverty, to see whether it\u2019s worth going round the course again. It\u2019s a job for the younger man really. We thought we\u2019d done the last one, but we\u2019re feeling there are stories still left to tell. Things are so horrific for a lot of people now, a whole set of experiences are being bypassed by politicians as the election conversation gets narrower and narrower. The level of poverty is so destructive. But it\u2019s always a matter of finding the right character.

Photograph: Antonio Olmos    My first job: I was a painter-decorator in a hostel for ex-offenders and ex-drug addicts. I blagged it through a friend of my mum\u2019s, who was the caretaker \u2013 she mentioned it to my mum, who just said: \u201cYeah, he can paint!\u201d I couldn\u2019t. I had to learn as I went along. I was 16 or 17. Needles were the weirdest thing for me to come across at that age. It was always odd when you were emptying out rooms and saw drug paraphernalia. You had to be careful not to get stabbed. I\u2019ve always had the attitude that I\u2019ll give anything a go. It gave me a bit of money, so I just did it. My big break: I was living in Coventry after my degree, working for a car insurance company by day, and making music at night. I posted anything I thought was decent on MySpace. Without even knowing it, I was networking. A friend I made on MySpace knew someone at Gilles Peterson\u2019s label, Brownswood, and they asked for more demos. I thought: why not, no skin off my nose sending a few tracks through. A week later, they asked me to come to London. Gilles was really nice. He asked how I made my music, then at the end he said: \u201cLet\u2019s put a record out on the label.\u201d My next job: I\u2019m doing a big European tour in May, then summer festivals \u2013 Blissfields, Parklife, a fair few. I just want to get my stuff out there. Sue Johnston, actor     \u2018It was exciting to be there at the beginning of something so groundbreaking\u2019 \u2026 Ricky Tomlinson and Sue Johnston in Brookside    My first job: I was a tax officer in Liverpool at 17. I hated it so much: to be confined to an office was hell on earth. I felt sorry for the people who came in with complaints: I used to hide all their letters, then get hauled in by my boss. I also did a drama class at the Liverpool Institute at night. That was my first step into acting, and we formed a group who went round old age pensioners homes with our sketches and songs, carrying our props on the bus. Looking back, it was horrendous. I\u2019d also go to the Cavern Club to see the Quarrymen \u2013 who became the Beatles \u2013 and Gerry and the Pacemakers. A job came up at Brian Epstein\u2019s record store, Nems, and I left the tax office. The bands were in all the time, and I got to know them well. Because of all that, I drifted off my goal for a while. I always had jobs in school holidays. You didn\u2019t ask your folks for money because you knew they didn\u2019t have it. I left school in sixth form to act. I had no idea how to do it. This burning desire took me on a very, very long route, but I got there in the end. My big break: I suppose it was Brookside. I\u2019d been doing theatre for 20 years, but I had to leave because I\u2019d had a child and was on my own. I nearly gave up and became a drama teacher, but thought I\u2019d give it one last crack, so I got an agent. I got four episodes in Corrie, playing the betting shop-owner\u2019s wife. Then my agent said: \u201cThere\u2019s this new soap, it\u2019s going to be the new Corrie \u2013 do you want to meet Phil Redmond?\u201d He interviewed me and I got a callback. I went to this building site \u2013 which was Brookside being built. We had loads of improv sessions with other actors, mixing and matching husbands and wives and kids, then one day Phil said to a bunch of us: \u201cYou\u2019re my Grant family.\u201d That changed everything. I moved near the set and got my son into a local school. We all had to learn fast \u2013 it was exciting to be there at the beginning of something so groundbreaking; it really moved soap opera to a different level. It was my lifesaver. My next job: I\u2019m bobbing in and out of Downton Abbey, which is a joy, but not very demanding. I have some lovely scenes with Dame Maggie. It\u2019s a wonderful ensemble, and they\u2019ve got such a bond. Grayson Perry, artist     \u2018I sometimes feel I rose without trace\u2019 \u2026 Grayson Perry. Photograph: BBC/Richard Ansett    My first job: It was a paper round \u2013 my stepfather bought a newsagents when I was 16. He paid me the grand sum of \u00a38 for 24 hours a week. That was pretty poor wages, even in 1976. It was rather exploitative, though he framed it as \u201cearning my keep\u201d, waking up at 5.30am before I got the bus to school \u2013 oh, and giving up my weekends. I also had a dog-walking job, but that paid even less. My big break: I sometimes feel I rose without trace. I didn\u2019t have a massive moment, but my big break was probably when a curator called Marjan Boot at the Stedelijk museum in Amsterdam found a couple of my vases in the storeroom \u2013 they\u2019d been bought by the director, but never even properly labelled! After her chance encounter, we met and got on, and a year later she offered me a solo show at the Stedelijk. I was already 40 and had a good back catalogue. That was my first institutional show, and it got me a Turner prize nomination. My next job: I\u2019m just finishing off my House for Essex, which is all looking on schedule. Then I\u2019m doing a show at the Turner Contemporary in Margate in May called Provincial Punk, which concentrates on my earlier work. Ashley Walters, actor     \u2018Saul Dibb wrote Bullet Boy with me in mind. I was in prison while he was writing it\u2019 \u2026 Ashley Walters. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    My first job: When I was a teenager, I worked in WH Smith in Sloane Square on the newspaper stand. I\u2019d just finished filming a movie called Storm Damage for the BBC. I worked there for four months, then the film came out. People would buy a paper, then stop and say: \u201cAren\u2019t you that guy on the TV?\u201d I didn\u2019t like working there. There were a lot of rude people \u2013 some wouldn\u2019t even say hello. But it was an experience I needed, to understand what working life was all about. My big break: It has to be Bullet Boy, which came out in 2004. Saul Dibb, the director, wrote it with me in mind. I was in prison while he was writing it. I came out and faced all this backlash in the media \u2013 being classed as a gun-toting gangster. I met Saul and he said: \u201cOnly you can play this part.\u201d I was reluctant at the beginning, but it was well received. I won the most promising newcomer at the British independent film awards, and it restarted my career. My next job: I\u2019m filming an eight-part drama for the BBC called Cuffs. It\u2019s a police drama set around the lives of a police response team in Brighton. It\u2019ll be out in the autumn. Caitlin Moran, writer     \u2018There aren\u2019t any other women like me. And there should be\u2019 \u2026 Caitlin Moran. Photograph: IBL/Rex    My first job: My first regular job was working on Melody Maker at the age of 16. I\u2019d finished writing my first novel by then, and was waiting for it to be published, and had got into music by listening to John Peel and getting CDs from Wolverhampton Central library \u2013 the way you could listen to music for free before Spotify, but which also meant bands got paid; which was, I think it\u2019s fair to say, a better system for encouraging working-class talent. But here I go being all Marxist again. I just wrote six sample reviews and sent them off to Melody Maker. I speckled the envelope with Lemon Essence from our kitchen \u2013 the only perfume available \u2013 as I\u2019d heard that pleasant, uplifting smells could be an important way to make a favourable subconscious impression. It did the trick \u2013 they gave me regular work. Enough to start buying cider and begin a terrifying smoking habit. My big break: Winning the Dillons Bookstore young reader of the year competition when I was 13. I won a \u00a3250 voucher but, more importantly, one of the judges \u2013 Valerie Grove of the Times \u2013 was intrigued that I\u2019d called myself \u201chome-schooled\u201d on the entry form, and came to interview me for the paper. When the piece ran, she said I was talented and that I could really write, and that was it: I just needed one person to tell me \u2013 to give me permission \u2013 and I was off. I started writing my first novel the next week. It\u2019s why I always accept being a judge on a writing prize. I know what it\u2019s like to be on a council estate in the middle of nowhere and how you need to feel London, the media and \u201cthe grown-ups\u201d are asking you to take part. If you\u2019re not posh or connected, you need to be invited. Just once. And then you bite their arm off. You\u2019re ready. My next job: Well, like an excessive idiot, I\u2019ve given myself four next jobs, and am having to regularly dose myself from a pipette of Valerian nerve tonic to deal with it. I\u2019m adapting How to Build a Girl for Film4, but also working on two other scripts. Me and my sister Caz are working on the second series of the sitcom Raised by Wolves for Channel 4. I\u2019ve spent this month doing my standup tour in the UK, which goes to the US in July. There\u2019s a second compendium of journalism, Moranifesto, in which I lay out my political manifesto for the world while also telling amusing stories, eg the day I accidentally tried to break into Kate Moss\u2019s house, then ended up getting pissed in Benedict Cumberbatch\u2019s house while forcing him to do impressions of Sherlock and Smaug, then realised I\u2019d \u201cdone some period\u201d on his sofa. And then I start the second novel in my trilogy, How to Be Famous, in the autumn. When you get invited in and they start saying, \u201cYes, we would like you to make TV shows and films and write novels and play to 1,700 people in Manchester,\u201d you go, \u201cYes! I will do this!\u201d, because you know most people from where you\u2019re from don\u2019t get asked. There aren\u2019t any other women like me. And there should be. Lesley Manville, actor     \u2018It was the first time I played an interesting character that wasn\u2019t just a sweet young thing\u2019 \u2026 Lesley Manville (right) in Mike Leigh\u2019s Grown Ups (1980). Photograph: BBC    My first job: I had a Saturday job in a hairdressers in Hove, washing hair. I certainly wasn\u2019t destined for that kind of work. At the age of 15, I made a very independent decision to leave school in the middle of my A-levels. My big break: Meeting Mike Leigh in 1979. We met when he cast me in a play at the RSC. The play never saw the light of day \u2013 it got cancelled. So he said: \u201cYou\u2019d better come and do something else for me.\u201d Then we worked together for his film Grown Ups at the BBC. It was the first time I played an interesting character that wasn\u2019t just a sweet young thing. I started acting at 16 and did any job that came along \u2013 from panto to Emmerdale to children\u2019s TV. I did all sorts of strange things. If I hadn\u2019t met Mike by fluke, I don\u2019t know what I would have ended up doing. My next job: I\u2019m in the middle of reading scripts. I\u2019ve just done a pilot of a series called Mum, which I\u2019m hoping will be commissioned. It\u2019s a gentle comedy about a woman who has just lost her husband and is looking for the next chapter of her life \u2013 and about all the extraordinary people around her. Roy Williams, playwright     \u2018The climate is tougher now for all of us in the arts, what with austerity and the cuts\u2019 \u2026 Roy Williams. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    My first job: It was in McDonald\u2019s. I was in the last year of school and broke. A mate had worked there and put in a good word. I was so restless \u2013 I knew my heart lay in the arts. I was the worst cashier, the worst burger-flipper in all of London. When you started at McDonald\u2019s, you got a green badge as a beginner. When you\u2019re good, you get a yellow badge. I stayed on green \u2013 and gave up after three months. I didn\u2019t get sacked, I just didn\u2019t go back. We sort of fired each other. My big break: Having my first play, The No Boys Cricket Club, produced at Theatre Royal Stratford East in 1996. I wrote it when I was 26 \u2013 it was based on my mother\u2019s experiences of growing up in Jamaica and coming to England. You see a woman in her 60s who goes back in time and meets her younger self and tries to stop her making the same mistakes. It\u2019s a Field of Dreams/Back to the Future type thing. I\u2019d written it in my final year at Rose Bruford drama college. They suggested I send it to Stratford East for feedback, and the theatre did a reading of it and put it on. I was blown away. It was directed by Indhu Rubasingham and she was very insistent that I be there as much as possible during the rehearsals, so it was a real learning curve. My next job: Another series of my afternoon radio drama, The Interrogation, for Radio 4. It\u2019s a simple premise: two cops spend 45 minutes interviewing a suspect and you slowly get an idea of why they did what they did. It explores the choices we make and addresses themes such as masculinity, homophobia, racism and class. I knew the original producer, Jessica Dromgoole, and she asked me for radio ideas. They commissioned it and it came back. Now I\u2019m on series four. It was a dream to end up in this position. The climate is tougher now for all of us in the arts, what with austerity and the cuts. But I knew it would be like that going in. Making a living in the arts world is tough, and you\u2019ve got to be made of stern stuff if this is the life you choose for yourself. Paul Abbott, screenwriter     \u2018I had about 26 jobs\u2019 \u2026 Paul Abbott. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian    My first job: I had about 26 jobs. I worked in factories, in antique stores, I was a barber, furniture remover, everything. And I couldn\u2019t hold a job down. I can\u2019t stand still \u2013 thankfully, as as a writer you don\u2019t have to \u2013 you\u2019re on to the next scene. My first job was when I was 16, at Lambert Howarth\u2019s shoemakers. There were whole families who worked in these factories, all the way up to the grandchild and grandpa working together. That\u2019s where Clocking Off came from. I was working on hessian mules. I used to have to put a heel on a spike \u2013 you\u2019d spin it with your foot and spray it with glue. But in the first week they turned the industrial fan off so you\u2019re high as a kite on ethanol from the glue and your eyelashes get glued to your face. It was a little trick they played on apprentices. I was a student, which was even worse. My big break: My breakthrough came when I was 23. It was a radio play that Alan Bennett sponsored. Somebody knew where he lived, so I wrote to him and said: \u2018Would you sponsor my play?\u2019 He said: \u2018Good you didn\u2019t send the play, you sent the letter first,\u2019 and agreed to look at it. He said: \u2018It\u2019s not the masterpiece you think it is, but I\u2019ll certainly put my name to it.\u2019 It got made, then I got commissioned to do a Monday Night play for Radio 4, and it got repeated on Saturday so that was two-and-a-half grand. It paid for a whole year\u2019s rent. Until then, writing was a hobby. That\u2019s when I realised I was a writer. The play was called David and \u2026 Who\u2019s Goliath? It was a lot like Shameless, and it\u2019s embarrassing to listen to now. My next job: I\u2019m working on a new show with Tommy Schlamme, the co-creator of The West Wing, in the US. It\u2019s called Blabbermouths, and is a fiction about reality TV. He\u2019s a such a beautiful bloke. We haven\u2019t sold it yet, and it will take a year to write. We\u2019re also working on the second series of No Offence. Series one is just about to start on Channel 4 and we don\u2019t know if we\u2019ll get a second, but we have to start writing it now, because if you wait for them to tell you you\u2019ve got it, you\u2019re fucked. And I\u2019m working on my first animation \u2013 about obesity. It\u2019s called Patsy Clinger\u2019s Near-Death Cookery Course. It\u2019s a six-part animation series, and I haven\u2019t sold that yet either. Paulette Randall, director     \u2018I worked at Brixton market until I was 18. I didn\u2019t realise until much later, but it was like a theatre\u2019 \u2026 Paulette Randall. Photograph: Felix Clay    My first job: It was in Brixton Market at a shop selling \u201ctoilet requisites\u201d, as the sign had it. I loved it \u2013 I started when I was 11 and worked there on and off until I was 18. We sold all sorts: bubble bath, toilet paper \u2013 and bad wigs. I didn\u2019t realise until much later, but it was like a theatre. There was always some drama happening on a Saturday morning with all the families coming and going. I\u2019d gone to the market for years with my mum, but moving to the other side of the counter, I found a world I didn\u2019t really know existed. My big break: I went to Rose Bruford college of speech and drama, and then set up a company with two other women: Theatre of Black Women. It was what it says on the tin. We wrote and performed our own pieces and did workshops to finance productions. Then my first play was in the young writers\u2019 festival at the Royal Court, directed by Danny Boyle. I said I wanted to get into directing, and Danny told me to talk to the Court\u2019s artistic director, Max Stafford-Clark. We had a two-hour meeting. Max told me to go away and think about it all, and then he took me on as assistant director when I went back. He was great to learn from in terms of pulling a script apart, and getting out of a writer the story they are trying to tell. From the Court I went to Bolton Octagon. I didn\u2019t even know where Bolton was! It took for ever to get there. The job was in the winter \u2013 I\u2019ve never been so cold. The atmosphere was so different. The Octagon was a fortnightly rep when I was there. Virtually no new writing, all tried-and-tested shows: Shakespeare, thrillers. I directed Wait Until Dark. That was my first main-house show. My next job: I\u2019m going to Rada (the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London) for the first time ever. I\u2019m directing a new piece called Obama-ology with the students there. It\u2019s about a young man who goes off on the voter-registration drive in Cleveland leading up to Obama\u2019s first stint as president. It\u2019s quite funny and quite stylised \u2013 the writer suggested that it\u2019s done in a sort of Brechtian, comedic way. We shall have a go and see if that holds water.

Photograph: Myung Jung Kim/PA    My first job: I worked as a clerk at Manchester Town Hall. I prepared the wage packets for all the corporation\u2019s employees, from cemetery workers to park wardens to school teachers. I did hundreds and hundreds of envelopes, and the last one had to tally exactly. I remember there were perforations in the envelopes to help people count the coins once they were sealed. During my lunchbreaks, I would go out and explore the great buildings of Manchester. Even now, I can describe them in nitpicking detail. My big break: It was 1956, I was 20 and had just finished doing national service with the RAF. After some months doing odd jobs, I got a place at Manchester University\u2019s school of architecture. It was undoubtedly the big turning point in my life \u2013 just getting in made me so happy. But even though I\u2019d made it through on merit, having shown an interest and an ability to draw, I couldn\u2019t get a grant, since I didn\u2019t have any A-levels or anything like that, having left school at 16. Where I came from, that\u2019s what boys did. So I had to support myself by doing part-time jobs. I sold ice-cream and made crumpets in a bakery, but the most terrifying job was working as a bouncer at a very rowdy cinema. Someone beat up the manager once. I chased the guy, tackled him and brought him back as the police arrived by bike. Coming from this background, and having this sort of experience of university, has shaped my attitude \u2013 and I know I can easily work on several things at once. My next job: I spent this morning working on the new international airport for Mexico City. It will be an extraordinarily dramatic, cathedral-like structure, incredibly light with no straight lines. It will be one of the biggest airports in the world \u2013 but not actually the biggest. That\u2019s Beijing. We did that 10 years back.

Photograph: David Sillitoe    My first job: I worked in the raw meat section of a factory in Grantham that made ready meals for M&amp;S. I got expelled from secondary school for piercing my mate\u2019s ear and spent a few months on the dole, so I got a job there before I took my GCSEs. I worked on the mince. I\u2019d get massive sacks of pre-packed meat and put it into little 20g tubs that would then be sent to the cookhouse. My big break: Meeting our manager Steve Underwood. He runs an underground punk label, Harbinger Sound, and we played a festival he put on in Nottingham called the Rammel Club weekender. We caught his attention and he asked us if we wanted to put a record out. That was enough to get us on to the gig circuit \u2013 from then on we were getting offers left, right and centre. My next job: Hopefully just keep writing music. I\u2019ve written a few articles. I\u2019m in the process of doing a book of short stories for Bracket Press, which will hopefully be out next year. It\u2019s based on childhood experiences. Some of it\u2019s fictional; other parts are things I still remember and think about.

Photograph: AGF/Rex    My first job: I worked in the Aberystwyth branch of Peacocks, mostly helping old women try on shoes. I hated it. You might get to work at the tills, which was easy, but a rarity; otherwise you\u2019d get stuck in the stock room stripping plastic off the endless boxes that arrived on trucks every morning. I did that for a year, starting at 16. I can\u2019t say it felt like a calling.  My big break: I went to Rada but left my course early, three years ago, to do a play called The Last of the Haussmans at the National, with Julie Walters and Rory Kinnear. I\u2019ve never celebrated getting a job so much. It felt like an affirmation. You go to drama school just hoping you\u2019ll scrape a living, then to get work at a place and with people you so admire \u2013 you realise maybe you are cut out for this after all. I\u2019ve had no bad experiences to date with egos. Julie is even lovelier than you might think \u2013 inclusive and grounded and very funny. I come from a Welsh-Liverpudlian working-class family, and Rada subsidised my fees. More than half of my year were in a similar position; it\u2019s simply not the case that it\u2019s exclusive.  My next job: I\u2019m on set at the moment, making a film about Eddie the Eagle with Hugh Jackman and Christopher Walken. I\u2019m playing Eddie. I haven\u2019t met Christopher Walken yet, but he\u2019s got to be a total legend, hasn\u2019t he? I\u2019m nervous. I\u2019m going to call him Mr Walken and see how we go. We\u2019ve just come back from filming all the ski-jumping stuff in Germany. I have a new respect for Eddie, having sat atop a ski-jump in my lycra suit, which I\u2019ve christened The Condom. I\u2019m not the most aerodynamic of people. I only jumped a few metres \u2013 on a wire. \u2022 Mark Lawson hosts a Guardian Live: Diversity in the Arts panel debate with Chris Bryant MP, Dreda Say Mitchell, David Lan and Ben Stephenson, Wednesday 14 April at 7pm, Kings Place, London N1.

This week, TV funny woman Sue Perkins disclosed that she had decided to take a hiatus from Twitter because bookmakers Coral made her favourite to replace Jeremy Clarkson as Top Gear host, news which led a spate of misogynistic tweets. \u201cMy timeline has been full of blokes wishing me dead,\u201d tweeted the Great British Bake Off and chatshow host. \u201cThis morning, someone suggested they\u2019d like to see me burn to death. All of which goes to say that I am off Twitter for a bit. Love and peace x.\u2019\u201d  And then there was professional troll - sorry! esteemed fellow journalist and former Apprentice contestant \u2013 Katie Hopkins, who revealed that she has installed a panic button at her Exeter home after being advised by police to take extra safety precautions when securing her house due to the number of death threats she has been receiving. Hopkins recently tweeted the following: \u201cDementia sufferers should not be blocking beds. What is the point of life when you no longer know you are living it?\u201d, prompting a fresh spate of death-threat tweets and posts. \u201cOur house is rigged up to the local police station,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cThat\u2019s just my life I suppose.\u201d  Then on Tuesday, there was news that US reality-show winner Rebecca Francis had received death threats after posing for a photo next to a giraffe she had just shot dead. Comedian Ricky Gervais, who posted on social media an image of the Extreme Hunter winner lying alongside the dead giraffe, tweeted: \u201cWhat must\u2019ve happened to you in your life to make you want to kill a beautiful animal &amp; then lie next to it smiling?\u201d His post was retweeted more than 20,000 times, and resulted in a flurry of death threats from disgusted Twitter users, some at least alive to the irony of wishing death on a woman for being a killer. For instance, @AsapGinger1 wrote: \u201cI know this is very hypocritical of me but i want to f****** shoot her just for this picture.\u201d   Related: Sue Perkins takes Twitter break after Top Gear threats    A death threat made against Tony Hall last month led to the BBC director general and his wife Cynthia being placed under 24-hour police guard. It raised several questions. One: if you are one of those who think that Hall should not have sacked Top Gear presenter Jeremy Clarkson for punching producer Oisin Tymon in a dispute about the deficiencies of post-filming catering, then is threatening to kill him likely to result in Clarkson\u2019s reinstatement? Apologies if that sounded more sarcastic than I\u2019d intended. Two: did a single email reportedly sent from abroad warrant the Met deploying a team of bodyguards costing \u00a31,000 a day to protect the Halls? It\u2019s the second question that obsessed the Daily Mail which, you would think, made that security operation more difficult and costly to the public purse by publishing photographs of Hall outside his home and describing its location. But there is a bigger question. Why has the death threat become very nearly as intolerably ubiquitous as Clarkson himself? Time was when the death threat was the weapon of last resort, or at least had the whiff of the exotic about it. For instance, in 1989 Iran\u2019s Ayatollah Khomeini celebrated Valentine\u2019s Day by declaring a fatwa on Salman Rushdie for the offence to Islam the author\u2019s novel The Satanic Verses had reportedly caused. Rushdie went into hiding for 13 years as a result, during which time his constant companions were officers in four bulletproof Jaguars and the real threat of being murdered. If, in 1989, a death threat was exceptional and shocking, today it has become part of the background blah of everyday life. It\u2019s the go-to response of anyone with two thumbs and a keyboard whenever someone does or says something they don\u2019t like. Feminist campaigner suggests how lovely it would be to have a woman, say Jane Austen, on a \u00a310 note? Death threat. Thirty-four-year-old Heidi Agan dares to make a living as the world\u2019s leading Duchess of Cambridge lookalike? Anti-royalist death threat. Can\u2019t bear to live in a world so unfair that Jeremy Clarkson no longer presents Top Gear? Then tweet your hopes for the imminent demise of third parties. One Twitter user, for example, said they hoped Tymon \u201cvisits the morgue very soon\u201d; while another wrote: \u201cTony Hall BBC director, I wonder if Oisin\u2019s and your head can stop a bullet!!! just wondering.\u201d Someone looks at you wrong? Death threat. Someone spills your pint? Death threat. I exaggerate, but only slightly. Once, the death threat required application: you needed to cut out the letters from newspaper headlines, paste them on to a sheet of paper, quite possibly travel to another postal district before mailing your subliterate, but nonetheless illegal (under section 16 of the Offences Against the Person Act 1861) rant. And then you had to wait days before anything happened. Alternatively, you could have made your death threat over the phone by using a little gizmo that changed the tone of your voice to protect your anonymity. Few bothered to make the effort \u2013 barring the occasional Ayatollah feeling unloved after receiving (one imagines) no Valentine\u2019s cards that morning.     Salman Rushdie, pictured shortly before going into hiding as result of a worldwide fatwa. Photograph: Terry Smith/Time &amp; Life Pictures/Getty Image    Social media has made the death threat a much easier proposition. Not only will your threat reach its target, but if you threaten the right celebrity, your message can go satisfyingly viral. For instance, Zayn Malik, the former One Direction heart-throb (let me clarify: he\u2019s no longer in One Direction, but remains, so far as I can tell, a heart-throb) last year tweeted the hashtag #FreePalestine to his 13 million followers. He called it \u201cdoing a Rihanna\u201d because Rihanna had tweeted the same hashtag, withdrawing the tweet seconds later. Within moments, Malik\u2019s tweet had been retweeted 130,000 times and favourited 138,000 times. But within another few moments the abusive tweets started coming: one called on Malik to \u201ckill himself\u201d and another read: \u201cLet me kill you\u201d, the first one, you would think, sent by someone even lazier than the second. Without wishing to understate the fear and upset such threats can cause, many can be readily decoded as dumb recreational abuse, the last rhetorical redoubt of the unimaginative Twitter troll who wouldn\u2019t dare say such things in real life, or (I suspect) have the necessary commitment or manual skills to make an old-school death threat with scissors and glue. But how does one tell recreational abuse from a genuine death threat? And is the sense that the number of death threats has increased in the social-media age borne out by the data? \u201cWe don\u2019t have any kind of unit that deals specifically with death threats,\u201d says a Met spokeswoman. \u201cThey are dealt with on a case-by-case basis by individual boroughs.\u201d  However, Aaron Schoenberger, CEO of Beverly Hills-based social-media threat-assessment company Soteria, can offer some insight. \u201cGathering data and painting a picture of who they really are is critical,\u201d he says. \u201cFor example, if someone makes a death threat on Twitter against Sue Perkins or Tony Hall and just so happens to be fascinated with guns, the chances of them carrying out an attack go up based on their activity and interest. Additionally, if a potential threat is identified and the post was geotagged near Sue or Tony\u2019s homes, the threat level rises immediately. These are the types of factors we use to gauge seriousness and help law enforcement agencies. \u201cAs a rule of thumb, I believe every threat should be taken seriously and reported to authorities. Once reported, law-enforcement agencies must take an empirical approach to threat assessment and prioritise threats based on the data. No threat should go unreported, and the most credible threats should be investigated immediately.\u201d Schoenberger cites the case of Ismaiiyl Brinsley, who shot two NYPD officers dead in December 2012, as an example of the need for improved monitoring of social media sites to prevent murders. Brinsley had boasted on Instagram that he would take the lives of two policemen hours before shooting them. It has since emerged that Brinsley had already been arrested 19 times for offences including concealing a weapon, and disorderly conduct. He had also threatened to hang himself, and had been disowned by his mother and two sisters for being violent and aggressive. Today, when a death threat comes by means of old media rather than tweet, email or Facebook post, it seems more threatening. In March, the US ambassador to Japan, Caroline Kennedy (JFK\u2019s daughter), received a death threat that came in the form of a phone call to the embassy from an English speaker. Similar threats were made to the US consul general in Okinawa, leading some to speculate that they were made by Japanese resentful over the continued existence of American airbases on the island. But should the threats have been taken seriously? Quite possibly. They occurred shortly before the US ambassador to South Korea, Mark Lippert, was slashed by an anti-American activist in Seoul, requiring 80 stitches to his face. How easy is it for police to determine the credibility of a new-media death threat? Earlier this year, Dutch officers turned up at the door of 28-year-old web developer Jeffry van der Goot. They were investigating a tweet sent by @jeffrybooks saying \u201cI seriously want to kill people\u201d at a fashion and cosmetics convention in Amsterdam. The only problem was that Van der Goot hadn\u2019t written the tweet. Instead, Van der Goot had handed the Twitter account over to \u201cjeff_ebooks\u201d, a bot that could automatically send tweets and hold conversations. And yet Van der Groot was held accountable for the algorithmically generated death threat. \u201cI feel very conflicted about it,\u201d said Van der Groot. \u201cI can see their point but it does not feel right to me that the random output of a program can be considered something I said.\u201d Even more intriguingly, the death threat was issued during a conversation with another bot, each having been programmed to reply to messages from strangers. \u201cSo they were just spamming random stuff at each other,\u201d he continued. Can a bot make a credible death threat against another bot, the more philosophical of Amsterdam detectives asked themselves? They must have decided not, since they are no longer pursuing the case.     Paul Chambers (centre) and his celebrity defendants Al Murray and Stephen Fry. Photograph: Rex Features    A more pressing difficulty for the police is how, when language has become more extreme and hyperbolic, they should distinguish credible death threats from fatuous ranting or people letting off steam through bad jokes. \u201cBecause people tend to treat social media as conversational,\u201d says internet psychologist Graham Jones, \u201cthey get the feeling they are just chatting with their friends, hence many of the apparent online death threats could be nothing more than the non-realistic conversational expressions of anger.\u201d \u201cCrap!\u201d tweeted 28-year-old trainee accountant Paul Chambers in 2010 to his 690 followers. \u201cRobin Hood airport is closed. You\u2019ve got a week and a bit to get your shit together otherwise I\u2019m blowing the airport sky high!!\u201d He was frustrated \u2013 who wouldn\u2019t be? \u2013 that he couldn\u2019t get a flight to Northern Ireland to see his new girlfriend. A week later, he was arrested by five police officers, questioned for eight hours, had his computers and phones seized and was subsequently charged and convicted of causing a menace under the Communications Act 2003. On appeal in 2012, his conviction was quashed, but the worry remained: \u201cProblem is,\u201d said comedian Al Murray, one of Chambers\u2019 celebrity supporters, \u201cthe law don\u2019t do funny.\u201d Technological change helps in making death threats more credible. For instance, there is now an app telling American gun owners where anti-gun activists live. Just possibly the first amendment right to free speech is being used to help gun openers defend their second amendment right to bear arms. Or perhaps it\u2019s facilitating anyone who wants to shoot someone who objects to their lifestyle. This highlights another problem for policing: one person\u2019s death threat is another\u2019s freedom of speech. The US supreme court is currently considering the case of Anthony Elonis who is appealing against conviction for writing on Facebook about wanting his ex-wife dead and about shooting children. \u201cThere\u2019s one way to love ya but a thousand ways to kill ya. I\u2019m not gonna rest until your body is a mess, soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts,\u201d went one post to his former wife. Judges will rule on whether what Elonis wrote is covered by the first amendment, or whether it so clearly had the intent to cause harm behind it that it constituted a criminal threat. Perhaps if the police and courts struggle to decide whether death threats are credible, still less to effectively punish trolls, the social networks might work harder to protect their users from abuse? Twitter CEO Dick Costolo said as much in a leaked memo in February. \u201cI\u2019m frankly ashamed of how poorly we\u2019ve dealt with this issue during my tenure.\u201d Twitter\u2019s rules prohibit only \u201cdirect, specific threats of violence against others\u201d. For example, Twitter has deleted posts that feature videos of violent acts by the terrorist group Isis and videos that instruct jihadis to attack targets in the west. But trying to stop Isis making death threats is trickier than that. When Twitter closed down what it suspected to be Isis accounts recently, a post was uploaded to the JustPaste site calling for the death of the social-media site\u2019s co-founder Jack Dorsey and employees. \u201cYour virtual war on us will cause a real war on you,\u201d said the post, opposite a picture of Dorsey in the crosshairs of a gun. The message went on to make a specific death threat. How can victims respond to death threats? Ignoring them? Reporting them to the police? Deleting themselves from social media? Taking trolls out for dinner, as Mary Beard did with her Twitter tormentor? Taking trolls out? Don\u2019t even think about that last one. One way is to switch the abuser-victim roles around. Consider, for instance, what Joey Barton did with his death threat from a Parisian admirer during his 2012-13 season playing for Marseille.  \u201cIf you\u2019re [sic] not left France by June 1st I will come to you specially Marseille smash your head shots baseball bat,\u201d went the handwritten message. Barton posted the death threat online and tweeted: \u201cNot sure what\u2019s more offensive, the grammar or the intent?\u201d Barton also posted a Google Maps image of the Paris address given on the letter, writing next to the picture of a block of flats: \u201cBy the way his gaff looks nice \u2026\u201d Very clever Mr Barton, at least so long as your correspondent didn\u2019t give a false address.", "sentences": ["They were investigating a tweet sent by @jeffrybooks saying \u201cI seriously want to kill people\u201d at a fashion and cosmetics convention in Amsterdam.", "Can a bot make a credible death threat against another bot, the more philosophical of Amsterdam detectives asked themselves?"], "title": "Sue Perkins, Zayn Malik, Tony Hall: how did death threats become so casual?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/apr/16/sue-perkins-zayn-malik-tony-hall-how-did-death-threats-become-so-casual", "tags": ["Cyberbullying", "Social media", "Top Gear", "Tony Hall"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-04-16T16:19:11Z", "article": "When fundraising for charity, picking a cause close to people\u2019s hearts and subjecting yourself to a sufficiently gruelling physical ordeal might help, but scientists suggest there could be an even easier way to swell the coffers. Picking a flattering photo and persuading a male friend or relative to make a hefty donation to your fundraising page early was found to significantly boost donations - for women at least. A study of fundraising pages from the 2014 London Marathon showed that men become competitively generous when they see another man has already given a large sum of money. The effect was especially striking when men stood to impress an attractive female, the study revealed. In these circumstances, men quadrupled their average donations from \u00a310 to \u00a340 when another man had already pledged a large sum. Nichola Raihani, an evolutionary biologist at University College London and first author, said: \u201cThe take away message for fundraisers is get a good picture on your donation page and if you have a generous friend, make sure they donate early on.\u201d The authors believe that men display competitive altruism as a \u201cpeacock\u2019s tail\u201d to attract females.   Related: Sex and the successful fundraiser | Richard P Grant    \u201cThese are not necessarily conscious responses \u2013 in fact, they\u2019re probably not,\u201d said Raihani. Neither do the findings necessarily undermine men\u2019s less self-interested reasons for charitable giving, she added. \u201cPeople tend to get shirty and say \u2018My reasons for giving are not self-serving\u2019,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that there\u2019s an ulterior motive and that men are only being nice to attract women. There\u2019s more than one cause for why you do any behaviour.\u201d  The study, published today in Current Biology, analysed 668 charity fundraising pages linked to the 2014 London Marathon. Each included an image of the fundraiser whose gender was identified and attractiveness rated independently by four different people. Each of the pages selected also featured large donations \u2013 more than double the mean donation and at least \u00a350 - from people whose gender was clear from their name. Irrespective of gender or attractiveness, securing a large donation was helpful, with donors increasing their pledges by roughly \u00a310 when faced with a previous lavish donation. This \u201canchoring\u201d effect also had a downside for those unlucky enough to have a few stingy donations early on, which seemed to lower the overall benchmark for acceptable generosity.  Attractive fundraisers, both male and female, tended to raise more money and smiling on your photo increased income by about 10%. Prof Sarah Smith, an economist and co-author from the University of Bristol, said: \u201cNot everyone can be the most attractive, but it doesn\u2019t hurt to put up a smiling photo.\u201d The most powerful effect, however, was when males entered a competitive upwards spiral on the pages of attractive female runners. Here donations rose by \u00a338 on average, with many men seeking to match the previous big donation or even surpass it. \u201cThe thing that is surprising is there\u2019s obviously a lot of people included who we wouldn\u2019t expect to be giving competitively \u2013 father, brothers and gay friends,\u201d said Raihani. \u201cIt\u2019s probably a diluted effect that we\u2019ve found here.\u201d The findings confirm, in real life, what scientists have previously observed in the laboratory setting. One study, led by Mark van Vugt, professor of psychology at the VU University in Amsterdam, found that men playing charity games in experiments were more giving when being observed by a female. \u201cIt\u2019s a basic mating signal,\u201d van Vugt said. \u201cGenerosity signals that you both have resources and are kind natured enough to part with them, which are pretty good traits in a mate.\u201d These \u201cstone age biases\u201d are so ingrained in our psyche, he added, that they persist even in today\u2019s society where women are often financially independent or better off than their male peers. Van Vugt agrees that the effect could be even more pronounced in a group of single people. \u201cIf you\u2019re on the mating market, you should respond even more strongly to these cues.\u201d Raihani believes that in future, the effect could potentially be harnessed for public good. \u201cGiving blood or anything slightly heroic we\u2019d expect to see the same effect,\u201d she said.", "sentences": ["One study, led by Mark van Vugt, professor of psychology at the VU University in Amsterdam, found that men playing charity games in experiments were more giving when being observed by a female."], "title": "Fundraising?

For now, we call on all the parties in this election \u2013 and particularly Labour \u2013 to make it clear that they will urgently review such anti-therapeutic practices, and appropriately refashion their much-trumpeted commitment to mental health if and when they enter government.

Uber continued to operate its UberPop peer-to-peer ride-sharing service in the Netherlands in violation of a Dutch court order which saw fines of \u20ac10,000 for every driver caught providing the UberPop service. It is the latest setback for the taxi service, which has been banned in several European countries in recent months, and recently had its offices in Paris raided by French police. Uber allows users to summon taxi services with smartphones while its UberPop arm links private drivers to passengers. It has gained popularity around the world since its 2010 launch but has drawn controversy over its aggressive approach when compared to traditional taxi services.  In December, a Dutch court banned UberPop on the grounds that it fell foul of licensing laws for commercial drivers. Uber is contesting the ruling.  Dutch prosecutors, who raided Uber\u2019s offices in March, said they were starting an inquiry after police in Amsterdam caught dozens of drivers offering illegal taxi services.  \u201cThe company Uber is now a suspect,\u201d said a statement released on Friday. \u201cThis means a preliminary examination will be started to collect evidence that Uber is providing illegal transportation on a commercial basis.\u201d  Dutch police have fined 23 Uber drivers \u20ac1,500 for operating without a license, it said. Uber\u2019s service offerings differ by price and country and are called by different names in different countries. In the US, for instance, the \u201cUberX\u201d service is the equivalent of the UberPop service in Europe. In the UK however, UberX is the name of the lowest-priced professional service, which employs licensed minicab drivers. The company, launched in 2009, now claims to operate in 55 countries and 250 cities. It has been valued at $40bn (\u00a325.5bn) and has recently secured a further $1.6bn in funding from Goldman Sachs. \u2022 Uber introduces panic button in India \u2022 Uber offices raided in Paris by French police in \u2018car-pooling\u2019 controversy", "sentences": ["Dutch prosecutors, who raided Uber\u2019s offices in March, said they were starting an inquiry after police in Amsterdam caught dozens of drivers offering illegal taxi services."], "title": "Dutch police launch criminal investigation into Uber", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/apr/17/uber-dutch-police-launch-criminal-investigation", "tags": ["Uber", "Technology", "Apps", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-04-18T06:00:09Z", "article": "I walk straight past the hub by Premier Inn when I arrive from the Trafalgar Square end of St Martin\u2019s Lane. All those Lenny Henry ads have programmed my brain to expect a purple hue and I wasn\u2019t looking for low-key, lime-green branding. I\u2019m met by a couple of cool young things who ask me how I\u2019m doing and if I have any evening plans. Fine, I say. Yes. They seem a bit put out that I haven\u2019t downloaded the hotel\u2019s app, which lets guests control the TV, lights and air-con from a phone, contains a city guide and eases the check-in process. But their smiles only wane for an instant and I\u2019m soon directed, via the lifts, to my fourth-floor room. As I walk down the long corridor, passing a door every couple of steps \u2013 it\u2019s quite a warren \u2013 it\u2019s clear what Premier Inn owner Whitbread is up to. For over a decade, hoteliers in cities like Berlin and Amsterdam, aping their Tokyo sleep-in-a-tube precursors, have been selling us tiny cells as if they were a contemporary lifestyle decision. We\u2019re meant to congratulate ourselves on being low-impact, no-frills, no-fuss, and cheap. It\u2019s considered cutting-edge to regard a hotel as chiefly a bed, because \u2013 it\u2019s implied \u2013 we\u2019re too busy consuming the city to stay in. But is this true? If that lower-case name were not proof enough, my room confirms that the designers of hub by Premier Inn have done their research. From the glass-walled loo, to the small bed against the wall, to the blinding whiteness of the d\u00e9cor, I\u2019m in a wholly functional space. I\u2019ve got a large suitcase, as I\u2019m flying overseas in the morning, but dare not open it. There\u2019s a narrow, alfresco slit for hanging up a coat and maybe a shirt. There\u2019s a small chair, but not much of a window to sit beside \u2013 and that window is, of course, sealed tight against carbon monoxide/traffic noise/my committing suicide. There\u2019s a nifty slide-out desk and some useful under-bed storage, which is just as well because \u2013 though these rooms are targeted at singletons \u2013 I\u2019ve made the fatal mistake of inviting my girlfriend. When she arrives with her smaller weekend case, we have to laugh at our cramped conditions. But who will sleep by the wall?     Hub by Premier Inn    I actually like the design: minimal, a bit sci-fi, smooth and clean. The map-inspired artwork is nice. But a lot of the aesthetic is about what\u2019s lacking. The hotel has no gym or pool. The room has no bath. No fridge. No stuff. No space. After steamy-hot showers with Original Source shower gel (provided), we want to eat, but not the snacks and sarnies on sale in the hotel\u2019s funky deli-cum-cafe. St Martin\u2019s Lane is one of the best locations in London, a hop away from Covent Garden, Soho, the Strand or the Thames, and five minutes\u2019 walk from the South Bank. That places a lot of culture and food within walking distance. On our return, other guests are doing the same. Some are single business people. There\u2019s a Spanish couple on a tight budget carrying a supermarket supper. We also spot some sixtysomething theatregoers \u2013 the Coliseum, home of the English National Opera, is just across the road. We bump into them at the refreshments stand, where free Twinings teas and coffee available 24 hours a day is a generous touch. The double bed is soft and cool. I get the outer edge. The TV is flush with my toes and looks huge. There are some tricksy buttons behind my head, and it takes a while to work out which are for lights, sound or heating. But, come sleep time, it\u2019s deadly quiet once I\u2019ve killed the fan in the aircon. During the night, my ear switches on some of the buttons \u2013 and they glow a fluorescent blue. I can\u2019t work out how to turn them off. I should have got the app\u2026 Leaving, I grab a great little fruit and granola breakfast from the deli and re-enter the normal world. Yes, it feels just like that. The hub idea is hotel as airlock, storage dock and recharging unit. Whitbread is planning dozens of them, and I\u2019ve no doubt they will suit travellers who just need to crash out between meetings or flights. But I like staying in, and no one \u2013 not even Lenny Henry \u2013 will convince me this kind of experience is enhancing my lifestyle or upping my hipness quotient. \u2022 Accommodation was provided by hub, 110 St Martin\u2019s Lane, 0333 321 3104 premierinn.com.

Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    \u2022 See Of course, I\u2019m biased, but for a quiet moment I go down to the lower basement of St Martin-in-the-Fields to the Dick Sheppard Chapel, which is always open in daytime and has a magnificent Gerhard Richter tapestry in which I never fail to see new things. You\u2019re spoiled for art around here, but my favourite is the Poussin collection at the National Gallery.

But never has a show been devoted to a woman like Sonia Delaunay. A pioneer of abstract art, Delaunay (1885-1979) drew no distinction between painting and design, and this show respects that continuity, flowing seamlessly between high-chrome canvases, eye-popping gowns for Dada parties, and swaths of linen printed in vivid geometric patterns that look the very squeak of chic even today. That timelessness is one of Delaunay\u2019s strongest attributes. She seems perpetually modern, always in tune with the times as the 20th century progresses. Born Sarah Ilinitchna Stern to a poor Jewish family in Odessa, she was adopted by a rich uncle, renamed herself Sonia Terk and was educated all over Europe. In Germany she studied alongside Schoenberg; in Paris she met Braque and Picasso, and married the gallerist Wilhelm Uhde who showed the works of Gauguin, Derain and the fauves.     Court shoes, 1925.

Gift of Sonia Delaunay to UFAC, 1965\u00a9 Pracusa    And it was in Paris, after her first show with Uhde, that she met the young abstract painter Robert Delaunay, whose semi-cubist series of the Eiffel Tower, in brilliant primary and secondary colours, are so intensely familiar from a million Metro maps and posters. They married, and together invented simultanism \u2013 an art of pure colour, modulated by rhythm, contrast and geometry. It is no disrespect to say that there is very little difference, at times, between her paintings and his. The look is simple and immediately recognisable: circles and half-circles, rainbows, sheaves of stripes, triangles and radiating haloes all keyed up in paint-box colours. Sometimes she weaves figures into these open geometries \u2013 flamenco dancers, nightclub drinkers \u2013 and sometimes the image seems to celebrate the experience of living in Paris, as in the Electric Prisms series, with their bright vortices and beams. But mainly the paintings are bright, smart, unswervingly abstract and quite amazingly consistent. Delaunay only stops painting when history intervenes \u2013 the first world war, the aftermath of the Russian Revolution, the rise of Hitler, when the couple escape France for Spain and Portugal and money is tight. But each time she resumes. Delaunay paints this way right through her husband\u2019s long illness and eventual death in 1941, and right up until her own. It is a lifelong commitment. But whether the principle is aesthetic or pragmatic has often seemed hard to judge, and this first British survey doesn\u2019t make things any easier. Of course Delaunay is a classic modernist, in a sense, sweeping away the distinction between art and life in the half-century of constructivism, suprematism, the Italian futurists with their coffee cups and cars, the Bauhaus with its bespoke carpets and cabinets. But what is so striking, as you pass through this show, is her outstanding work ethic. Her passion for sewing abstraction into the fabric of everyday life becomes a foray into branding (her signature, and her look, on everything from cushions to headscarves). She needed to make a living for her family, and she did.     Electric Prisms, 1913. Photograph:  Davis Museum at Wellesley College, Wellesley, MA, Gift of Mr. Theodore Racoosin \u00a9 Pracusa    In Madrid, in 1918, Delaunay started a shop called Casa Sonia selling spectacular two-colour coats, embroidered shoes, striped ballgowns that fizzed like op-art paintings long before their time (think Vivienne Westwood in the King\u2019s Road in the 80s). She decorated nightclubs, designed bee-striped umbrellas and knitted swimming costumes that were as impractical as they were modish. She was a colour-blocker long before anyone else. She worked for Zenith Watches and Le R\u00eave gas stoves, designed fabric for Metz &amp; Co in Amsterdam and Liberty in London. Her home became a showroom (or a three-dimensional collage, in the curators\u2019 preferred parlance) and her studio turned into a shop. Anyone interested in the history of textile and costume design will surely find themselves seduced by the gorgeous piebald coats and harlequin jackets hand-stitched by Russian seamstresses, by the yards of exquisite fabric bearing her fabulous rectilinear designs, which can balance three stripes of different blues against one black and two red like a perfect melody. Her fabrics are trenchant, suave and characteristically dynamic; it is well said that her best students were the original designers of the Scandinavian clothes company Marimekko.     The coat Delaunay made for Gloria Swanson, 1923-24: \u2018a tour de force\u2019. Photograph: Private Collection \u00a9 Pracusa 2014    But the commonplace about Sonia Delaunay appears wrong on the evidence of this show. Her look does not translate equally well into crayon, gouache, linoprint, fabric, oil and furniture. It does not suit a wooden box as well as a flowing tunic for Diaghilev\u2019s Ballets Russes. And though the enormous murals made for the Palais de l\u2019air at the 1937 Paris international exhibition are outstandingly vibrant in their lemon, red and orange discs against an expanse of cobalt blue ether, they lose force on such a scale and revert to stiff drawings of dashboards. Delaunay is at her best when most fluid and intimate. The embroidered coat made for Gloria Swanson is a tour de force of flying chevrons in coral, ochre and burnt umber, perfectly tailored to the film star\u2019s body. And with the poem-dresses, stitched with the verses of surrealist writers such as Tristan Tzara and Philippe Soupault, Delaunay made words move and shimmer round the room. In one of the earliest works in this show, from 1913, she painted a single long scroll of abstract motifs, one flowing into the next, alongside the text of a poem by Blaise Cendrars imagining a train journey from Moscow to China. His words are piquant enough, but it is Delaunay\u2019s painting \u2013 fragile, blithe and modest, bowling fluidly along through graceful peaks and sunlit passages \u2013 that really takes the mind on its journey.

By the time she left at the end of 2014 to take up a post with the Royal Collection Trust, she had played a key role in transforming the institution that bills itself as the world\u2019s greatest museum of art and design. When she started, the V&amp;A was, in every sense, notoriously difficult to navigate. Different systems of signage abounded and a variety of vested interests prevented any change. But Moira would brook no opposition and in what seemed like no time a new, coherent and elegant scheme by the graphic consultants Holmes Wood was soon rolled out. She was someone who knew what she thought and said what she meant: a breath of fresh air began to move through the museum. She went on to develop what was called FuturePlan, and we worked together on this for 10 years. The principles were simple: work with and value the architecture and decoration of the V&amp;A\u2019s complex of historic buildings, open up views so that people would know where they were and be tempted on to see what was coming next, bring natural light into the galleries, provide views both to the outside world and to the garden within, which became the museum\u2019s public hub, and find ways to make sense of the sequence and adjacencies of different displays. It sounds simple, but it was a long, difficult and demanding process, which she led from 2005 onwards as director of projects and design. It also required charm, steely determination, a clear and coherent understanding of the overall picture and the confidence to tell me, as director, and the trustees when they were wrong. She also had to argue away the light-phobic shibboleths so sadly common among conservators and curators. The more than 40 projects that she realised with architects and designers included two by Softroom, the Jameel gallery of Islamic art and the Sackler education centre, with its cunning reuse of the difficult spaces in the wing named after the museum\u2019s first director, Henry Cole. She also oversaw the reinstatement and reopening of the original tearooms; Ewa Jiricna\u2019s shop, sculpture gallery and exquisite jewellery gallery; great medieval and renaissance galleries by the architects MUMA; the ceramic galleries by Stanton Williams and the ceramic study galleries by Opera Amsterdam, and the elegant fashion gallery by 6a. Away from the South Kensington site were the Museum of Childhood by Caruso St John in Bethnal Green, east London, and the Clothworkers\u2019 Centre by Haworth Tomkins at Blythe House, Kensington Olympia. This represented a rate of progress easily excelling anything seen at the V&amp;A since the 19th century. And at the same time Moira steered through the competition to design new exhibition galleries on Exhibition Road, won by Amanda Levete, with whom she worked very closely. A great promoter of new talent and an ardent feminist, Moira was the most demanding and discerning commissioner of projects, sometimes quite scary, never letting her high standards drop, but also a funny, kind and supportive colleague and boss. She loved design for its own sake, but also believed that it served a public purpose: that good design could make life better and more pleasurable for everybody. She hoped that, little by little, the work that she led would transform the experience of those who came to the V&amp;A so that it would feel cared for and tended, light and airy, tranquil and engaging. So the ladies\u2019 loos needed to be lovely. Designed by Glowacka Rennie, they needed an art installation to make them really special, and I was sent to persuade the Paris-based Swiss artist Felice Varini that this was the right location for work by him. Installations, like the Random International studio\u2019s Swarm III, were commissioned for otherwise neglected spaces and what might have been an ordinary fire-escape became, thanks to Jim Eyre\u2019s design, the beautiful ceramic galleries bridge. Moira hoped, as Cole had, that those who knew the V&amp;A would become impatient with unnecessary and spirit-sapping ugliness and demand better in every aspect of their lives. Always immaculately presented, Moira loved London and was the most urban of people. Yet she was born in Campbeltown, Argyll, the principal town of the Kintyre peninsula, and grew up on a remote farm in Kintyre, daughter of Helen and John Gemmill. She always retained a love of the region\u2019s wild landscape, her family and family home, and for all things Scottish, tartan very much included. From Campbeltown grammar school, under the eye of her mother, who taught there, Moira went on to study graphic design and photography at Glasgow School of Art. This was a turning point. Though enjoying extracurricular activities far too much to be a model student, she loved the art school, found herself, and met the circle of friends who remained with her throughout her life. After graduating in 1981 she moved to Aberdeen, where she helped set up Citygirl, a listings magazine that was lively and fun but eventually went bust. So Moira got a job at Aberdeen Art Gallery and found herself planning and staging exhibitions, under the directorship of the artist Ian McKenzie Smith. In 1997 she became head of design and exhibitions at the Museum of London, under Simon Thurley. There, working alongside Magdalen Fisher, who became her closest friend, she was responsible for exhibitions including London Bodies, Terence Donovan\u2019s London and Vivienne Westwood. She also oversaw long-term displays such as the World City Gallery and a network of \u201coutsites\u201d that showed archaeological finds where they had been discovered. A Scottish dimension to Moira\u2019s legacy will come in 2017 with the opening of V&amp;A Dundee, a scheme to take the V&amp;A\u2019s name and exhibitions north and create a design centre for Scotland. She also took charge of the V&amp;A\u2019s pioneering relationships with two Indian institutions: the Dr Bhau Daji Lad Museum, Mumbai, and the National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad, Gujarat. The exhibition programme, which on Moira\u2019s initiative employed so many emerging designers, gave rise to more V&amp;A exhibitions travelling to more places around the world than from any other museum. An honorary fellow of the RIBA, a judge of the Architect\u2019s Journal Women in Architecture awards and chair of the V&amp;A Illustration Awards, Moira excelled at finding ways to ensure that the winners she wanted got the recognition she knew they deserved. As director of capital programmes at the Royal Collections Trust, Moira had been looking forward to the opportunity to work on Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace and Holyrood Palace in Edinburgh. Brave, brilliant and beautiful, she was the brightest and best of a generation that transformed the V&amp;A. She is survived by her parents, her brother, Andrew, and sister, Jennifer. \u2022 Moira Gemmill, design director, born 18 September 1959; died 9 April 2015", "sentences": ["She also oversaw the reinstatement and reopening of the original tearooms; Ewa Jiricna\u2019s shop, sculpture gallery and exquisite jewellery gallery; great medieval and renaissance galleries by the architects MUMA; the ceramic galleries by Stanton Williams and the ceramic study galleries by Opera Amsterdam, and the elegant fashion gallery by 6a."], "title": "Moira Gemmill obituary", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/apr/19/moira-gemmill", "tags": ["Museums", "Art and design", "Design", "Culture", "London", "Scotland", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-04-20T11:14:39Z", "article": "Sufjan Stevens will perform his first UK shows in four years, as part of a European tour in August and September.

Last month we showcased a selection of the stories the project had collected \u2013 and invited you to contribute your own experiences. The fact that we received more than 1,200 comments is testament to how much this issue affects our readers \u2013 and how common near misses are.  We\u2019ve rounded up some of these experiences \u2013 from the dangers of the \u201csorry mate I didn\u2019t see you\u201d drivers to tales of more deliberate aggression.   Over the last six years \u201cnear misses\u201d became so commonplace when I was out riding, commuting to work, or riding for fun at weekends, that I thought I had become immunised to them. Then, one morning last summer, I was treated to such a \u201cnear miss\u201d, from a car coming in the opposite direction which was overtaking a bus on a rural B road that I lost control and ended sprawled betwixt hedge and verge. He saw me. No doubt about that. He even flashed his headlights in a \u201cget out of my way, and get in the gutter, fool\u201d kind of way. There was no one behind me. He just didn\u2019t care. He started his overtake and thought \u201cIt\u2019s only a bike\u201d. I\u2019m ashamed to admit that when I locked the bike in the shed that evening, a dam within me burst. Every single close pass was like a grain of sand weighing me down, hundreds of them. Thousands. Every one required my to bite down on my emotions and suppress my fear. And I let go. Next morning, I walked to the station and bought a six month rail season ticket. I\u2019ve not commuted by bike since. - workhard   One evening last year I was cycling across Bishopsgate onto Camomile Street, which was undergoing roadworks at the time. Despite a sign saying \u201cDo Not Overtake Cyclists\u201d a tipper truck overtook me from the right at about 30 mph, leaving less than one foot from my handlebar. I was in a hi-vis jacket and had two rear lights flashing; I braked instinctively but can\u2019t imagine what could have happened if I didn\u2019t brake. - konnyaku   There are numerous times I\u2019ve had to stop because I\u2019m shaking in fear. I\u2019m just a person trying to get where I need to be using the means of transport that is best suited and yet other people feel that solely based on my mode of transport, they can bully me and threaten my life. We need to end the sense of privilege that motorists have that makes them feel that they can act in such a way. And while people are being let off with not even a slap on the wrist for killing people using their car, this won\u2019t happen. - KT      Cyclists at Piccadilly Circus. Photograph: Alan Auld/Alamy     Everyone should be responsible and respect other road users, but drivers need to recognise that they are driving something significantly more dangerous than cyclists are. Being cross is not an excuse for committing negligent homicide. - InestableVacio   I was heading along a reasonably quiet road on a cycle way adjacent to parked cars when a woman opened her door on me. I had less than 5 seconds to react, but react I did and just managed to avoid the leading edge. I came to a stop a few meters on and asked her how she thought I was feeling right now. I received apology after apology. Will she be more careful next time? Who knows!  - t0nymod   We are a family of three living in Bristol. We are doing all our travels on bikes, and it is a daily fight for survival. There are hardly any inner-city cycle lanes, except for a few flashy bits in the centre to show off the city\u2019s supputed Green Capital credentials. Most lanes are a matter of sharing existing pavements with pedestrians, and it is assumed people in poorer areas do not even consider taking up cycling since cycle lanes stop in the middle of nowhere. Mind you, they\u2019d be crazy to compete for space with the hundreds of trucks flying through the city at +40mph. The problem is that, politically, no one has the guts to state the obvious: before cycling can really take hold and make a change, everything must be done to get as many cars off the roads as possible. - Boris Kremer   I was a top level cycle racer for years in Holland and Belgium, cycling 20,000km+ a year. Holland has separate cycle lanes, and in Belgium cycle racing is the national sport and people tend to be very respectful and supportive. I did visit the UK to do some races and was shocked to see that roads weren\u2019t closed properly for races, and out training with my teammates we were threatened, beeped at and overtaken with deliberate close proximity. - blackflame79      Cycling in Amsterdam: could the UK learn from the Netherlands? Photograph: Romain Cintract/Hemis/Corbis     Returning from shopping on the bike on a windy day, a car passed very close (~15 inches) and fast on a 30mph limit straight road with lots of pinch points. As the driver got out, I had a polite word. She was initially utterly bewildered. Then came up with \u2018I\u2019m sorry, I didn\u2019t realise I was so close\u2019. She probably wasn\u2019t even aware that she\u2019d just driven past a cyclist, never mind having done so while leaving no safe space. The number of cyclists is going to keep gradually increasing. A huge public campaign of public education is necessary to make the \u2018I-didn\u2019t-realises\u2019 finally realise that they are responsible for bringing a potentially lethal piece of machinery into a public place populated by vulnerable others for whom they have a duty of care. - Chris Groves   When I was 4 months pregnant, I was cycling home from work in a small town, wearing all the right high-vis gear, including bright helmet and flashing bike lights. I went onto a small roundabout, only to see a man in a Mercedes look me full in the eye, then decide to come on in front of me from the left. I couldn\u2019t stop, smashed into his bonnet and came off my bike. He drove off at full speed; I ended up in hospital. - northernjools   About 6 months ago I was cycling to work with my girlfriend in London. She stopped in front of me at a set of lights. There was a cab behind to her left. He was in the wrong lane and tried to jump the lights to get across the other traffic. He knocked my girlfriend off of her bike. I\u2019ve cycled in London for about 5 years and have had a fair few incidents but it really scared me as was powerless to protect my girlfriend as I watched the cab hit her. She was ok just shaken up. - ID2578915   I invite the Guardian to come and speak to my kids who I\u2019ve moved to the Netherlands last August. A month before we moved, my son wobbled off the pavement and bounced off the petrol tank of an oncoming HGV - we owe our life to the driver who saw my son on the pavement wobble and took action to avoid the worst. I don\u2019t blame the drivers who are generally very good. I blame the way our roads are designed - and the bad eggs out there have free reign to do a Jeremy Clarkson - that man has a lot to answer for.  Cycling is effectively banned for children in the UK and drivers have been led to believe that the roads are their domain - if you enter that domain on a bike, you are asking to die. I can\u2019t live in a country that lets this happen, I can\u2019t bring my children up in a country like this. - christabelaroo   I have near misses every day. Today I was almost crushed by a bus on Holderness Road in Hull. I\u2019ve had drivers overtake when I\u2019m turning right, overtake and cut me up when turning left, shouted out for not using a cycle lane on the left hand side of a road when I needed to be in the centre lane to go straight ahead, had lorries push me into the kerb, and so on. I love cycling but hate the behaviour of some drivers and am always grateful when shown consideration by sensible drivers. - Maya Goia      Cycling on Princes Street, Edinburgh. Photograph: Murdo Macleod     As a lifelong cyclist who has been riding for over fifty years, I\u2019ve had hundreds, if not thousands of such incidents, including having cars driven at me, being threatened by drivers and their passengers and being knocked off. What is clear is that the vast majority of drivers are reasonable, there is a sufficiently large minority of unreasonable ones, and inattentive ones, to inspire fear in even the most seasoned cyclist. What is also clear is that the judicial system is grossly biased in favour of drivers and that dead cyclists don\u2019t bother politicians. - burtthebike   I was driving in the dark at rush hour (7.30ish London) yesterday and along major bus-routes. I passed 11 cyclists... Only 2 out of 11 were road legal w/r/t their lights. Only 3 out of 11 were immediately visible. One of the cyclists with no lights or hi-vis moved from the bus lane, in front of my car to turn right without either looking or indicating. If most of my attention wasn\u2019t focussed on him prior to that manoeuvre, I could easily have not seen him and hit him and it would not be my fault because he was dressed head to toe in dark colours and had no lights. But had I hurt or killed him it would have ruined both our lives. Everyone using the road should obey the rules and behave considerately. I have great sympathy with cyclists being harassed when cycling safely, but some seem to have a suicide wish. - Hmmmph   I always wear high vis and a helmet, but I\u2019ve had the classic car pull out of a quiet side road in Holloway \u201cwithout seeing me\u201d and luckily the road was quiet so I could swerve to the other side to avoid. The two incidents that make me more angry are cycling from Islington to Ealing, in a bus lane in Shepherd\u2019s Bush / Acton and a big, smart car in the lane next to me passes me, slows and just turns left straight across me toward a side road without even seeing me, resulting in me slamming on my breaks pretty hard; and cycling back in the dark from Ealing, seeing a waste collection truck behind me, I sped up so I could get a safe position and be seen at the red light / junction ahead, only to get the fright of my life when the truck pulled up right next to me with little space between us, at the lights, with the driver laughing and gesturing at me. I do everything I can to try to keep myself as safe as possible on the road, and behaviour like this just feels like an assault on those of us who are trying to get around using a non polluting, healthy and cheap form of transport, which can often be physically and emotionally hard work.  - Lucy Watt      A cyclist negotiating London traffic at night. Photograph: D Hale-Sutton/Alamy     I stopped cycling in and around Edinburgh some time after a bus nearly killed me. I was coming up to the traffic lights on a four-way junction, and could hear a bus coming up behind me. I glanced over my shoulder, saw that the bus was close enough to the kerb to run right over me, and realised that it wasn\u2019t slowing down, at all. I yanked my bike off the road and fell off it on to the pavement, but picked myself up with no harm done as the bus passed by me. If I hadn\u2019t jumped when I did I would be dead. - JCarnall   The sad thing is that after years of cycling around London and Bristol I now see the danger and abuse as \u2018one of those things\u2019. I love my bike and cycle a lot, both to get around town and recreationally and must have at least one incident a week. Last week\u2019s was pretty typical and involved me filtering through stationary traffic to the front of some traffic lights - something I always do as I feel it\u2019s safer to be at the front and make sure you\u2019re noticed. A couple of seconds after I reached the cycle zone the lights changed and I set off only to have the car that had been at the front of the queue lean on his horn and then roar past me, pretty close, at the first opportunity. - Justonge     There are lots of cyclists who jump red lights, don\u2019t signal, cycle dangerously etc. There are also lots of car drivers who jump red lights, don\u2019t signal, drive while using their mobile phone etc. It\u2019s not cyclists vs drivers.

Elevators traveling to the observatory of the tower are walled with large high-definition monitors made to look like windows, which for the 47-second ride show a panorama of the city as it has changed over the centuries. The first video of the elevators was reported by the New York Times. Ascending at more than 10m (33ft) per second to 1,268ft above the sidewalk, the elevators offer a historical theme park ride. The ride begins in 1500, as the elevator rises out of the rock and swampy waters that lay off Manhattan before humans decided to extend the island; a small village lines the river, before the Dutch arrive to turn it into New Amsterdam. In the 1600s, homes of colonists start materializing on the island\u2019s meadows. In the 1700s, the shoreline creeps farther south as the city transforms into colonial New York, and masted cargo ships dot its expanding docks. By 1839, passengers can see the tidal strait known as the East river; later they can see the Brooklyn bridge. Towers start to dot the skyline. A century later the Manhattan bridge is in sight and architectural behemoths have taken over the landscape. For a few seconds in the late 20th century, the south tower of the original World Trade Center looms alongside the ascending elevator. The south tower fades out of existence as the elevator\u2019s chronological ticker strikes 2001.  The video is not so detailed as to show construction; buildings gauzily appear and disappear instead. Finally, steel beams and structural supports of the new tower spindle outward into existence, and the building appears to coalesce around the elevator just in time for arrival on the 102nd floor.   Related: The windowless plane set for take-off in a decade    While the south tower appears in the video from 1973 to 2001, the video is not entirely historically accurate.

Look a little closer and it becomes clear this is not a mobile phone store or a luxury watch retailer but dedicated to selling season tickets for West Ham\u2019s first season in the Olympic Stadium. Hi-tech \u201cvirtual venue technology\u201d will allow you to see what the view will be like from your new Club London hospitality suite. But be quick because, according to West Ham, spots in the \u201cfinest catering and facilities in bespoke lounges inspired by the legendary history of West Ham, London\u2019s East End and the 2012 Olympics\u201d are all but sold out, with only a few hundred left more than year before the club\u2019s first match in its new home in August 2016.   Related: West Ham face compensation risk over state aid for Olympic Stadium refit    It is, in short, all a long way from Green Street. West Ham\u2019s vice-chair, Karren Brady, rumoured to have received a sizeable bonus for winning her battle to secure the stadium for the club, and co-owners David Gold and David Sullivan hope it will take them to the next level. The reason they fought so hard to move from Upton Park after 112 years was because they believe it will turbocharge their prospects. That sleek sales office is a manifestation of their hopes for a huge boost in commercial and hospitality income thanks to its proximity to the City and Canary Wharf. A few hundred yards away, contractors are frantically continuing to install the retractable seats, hospitality facilities and cantilevered roof \u2013 the largest of its kind in the world and requiring construction techniques usually employed on North Sea oil rigs \u2013 that are required to make the stadium suitable for football as well as athletics. The folly of the process that led here is underlined in FOI documents seen by the Guardian that show that without the substantial conversion work, costing almost \u00a3200m, the stadium would not have met local authority safety regulations that require all seats to be covered if it is to host winter sports. Stratford is now one of the best connected parts of the capital and the move will make the ground far more accessible to fans to the south and east of the capital. According to Brady\u2019s evangelical case, it will also make West Ham more internationally attractive thanks to its globally iconic stature while also embedding them even more firmly in the local area by allowing them to offer cheaper tickets to locals. But not everyone is happy. The extended, convoluted saga surrounding the deal with West Ham, who ended up as the only option if London Mayor Boris Johnson and LLDC (London Legacy Development Corporation) wanted to have a major football club in the stadium and retain the athletics track, blunted some of the anger from critics.     West Ham believe the iconic status of the stadium that was created at London 2012 will make the club globally attractive. Photograph: Francois Xavier Marit/AFP/Getty Images    Yet as the moving date looms and the first events in the stadium since the conversion get closer \u2013 the LLDC remains confident that the London Anniversary Games in July and the Rugby World Cup matches scheduled for September will go ahead as planned \u2013 new questions are being raised over the rights and wrongs of the hundreds of millions of pounds of public money that have been poured into West Ham\u2019s new home. Pull back the lens a little and most histories of the comedy of errors surrounding the stadium alight on a meeting in 2007 when the Olympic board, keen to start building to avoid another Wembley-style fiasco, took the fateful decision to effectively mothball discussions over its future by backing a scheme to strip it back to an uninspiring 25,000-capacity bowl after the Games.    West Ham have been given an advantage not just against Charlton but against clubs across London  Steve Clarke, Charlton Athletic Supporters Trust     But according to Steve Lawrence, the architect who was involved in some of the earliest masterplans for the London Games, the story goes back much further, all the way to 2003, when he was involved in the initial blueprints for a potential bid. For Lawrence the deal boils down to a simple question of fairness. He points to the \u20ac9m annual rent paid by Ajax to the City of Amsterdam for its 53,000-capacity arena as a useful comparison. If West Ham qualify for Europe, he expects rival clubs overseas to take a keen interest in West Ham\u2019s deal. \u201cFrom my point of view, I just want competition between football clubs to be fair,\u201d said Lawrence, who submitted the original complaint that contributed to the original process collapsing. \u201cWhen Ajax play West Ham in the quarter-finals of the Champions League I want to know that their team hasn\u2019t been bought with British taxpayers\u2019 money.\u201d When the coalition government and Johnson came into power they resolved to look again at the case for getting a top-flight football club interested, believing it would give the Olympic Park more stardust, footfall, profitability and focus. Johnson persuaded the Spurs chairman, Daniel Levy, to bid, who duly did so on the basis the existing semi-permanent structure should be knocked down and a purpose-built football ground constructed in its place. But a backlash against the idea of losing the athletics track, led by an emotionally charged Lord Coe, saw West Ham win the day only for the process to be scrapped amid legal paralysis. The LLDC had to rerun the process, this time giving West Ham a licence to use the stadium for a pre-agreed number of days rather than a tenancy. This enables it to argue West Ham effectively only occupy the stadium for 25 days a year and it can be utilised for a range of other uses outside those periods. But for critics this is a specious argument given that it is designed to look and feel like West Ham\u2019s home stadium for the duration of the football season. And the narrow legal question of whether European state aid rules have been broken refuses to go away, never mind nagging wider concerns about the amount of public money that has effectively subsidised a new stadium for a Premier League football club.   Related: West Ham\u2019s long and winding road to the Olympic Stadium    The state aid question is a hugely complex and legally opaque one. But the central charge from critics \u2013 that the LLDC erred by not applying for prior approval as most other major publicly funded stadium projects are increasingly advised to do \u2013 is hard to reconcile with the organisation\u2019s confidence that it is legally watertight. One expert in European state aid issues said case law concerning sporting projects had progressed significantly, with the EC taking an increasing interest in the sector after ignoring it for many years. Oskar van Maaren of the Asser Institute at The Hague said it was a \u201chot topic\u201d for the EC at the moment with formal investigations already launched into football clubs in Spain and Holland. He said the LLDC would have been well advised to seek prior approval, which would have created \u201ctransparency and legal certainty\u201d. He said the EC would have undertaken a \u201cbalancing test\u201d and said that if the LLDC had been up-front in applying for approval it would have increased its chances of being given a clean bill of health. \u201cNotification would prevent complaints being launched in the future. Given that complaints have been launched in the past regarding similar measures that involved the Olympic Stadium chances are that this will happen again,\u201d said Van Maaren. Having spent so long battling to secure the stadium and cock-a-hoop at the initial response from potential hospitality customers queuing up to watch the Hammers in the new bowl West Ham are resolute in their defence. \u201cWest Ham United is confident that its agreement with the LLDC complies with all relevant UK and European legislation and categorically does not constitute state aid,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cIndeed, the European Commission looked into a complaint in relation to our move to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park in 2013 but \u2018decided not to further pursue\u2019 the matter.\u201d The LLDC is similarly forthright in defending its decision not to seek prior approval. \u201cOur position has always been absolutely clear the arrangements for the Stadium at Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park do not constitute state aid. The stadium will remain in public ownership after it has been transformed into a multi-use arena and has two concessionaires UK Athletics and West Ham United,\u201d said a spokesman. Sir Robin Wales, the combative Mayor of Newham, also defends its own position in the process and the \u00a340m loan it has contributed towards the conversion costs in return for which it receives certain benefits. The LLDC and Newham are joint venture partners in E20 Stadium LLP, the special purpose vehicle that owns the stadium. Like others, he also points to other cases where public funds have helped football clubs - such as the beneficial tax regime that has helped clubs in Spain and the deal that saw Manchester City move into the City of Manchester stadium after the 2002 Commonwealth Games \u2013 as evidence that the Olympic Stadium is being unfairly singled out. But those comparisons ignore the fact that the EC is indeed taking an interest in Spanish clubs and that the Manchester deal \u2013 generally considered to have been far better planned in advance \u2013 predated the Commission\u2019s current interest in deals involving sports stadiums and is now beyond the 10-year window for complaints. Challenged on the matter by the Guardian at an event to promote the launch of a new London-wide sports participation push Johnson was typically matter-of-fact. \u201cThey can bog off. It\u2019s totally ridiculous. I can never exclude that some lawyer will come up with some ridiculous interpretation of article 105 of the EU treaty or whatever but I\u2019m as confident as I can be that it isn\u2019t going to be a problem.\u201d With Johnson returning to Westminster next month and exiting City Hall next year, it will no longer be his problem. But it is one that will not go away for his successor. Not everyone believes that the LLDC would fall foul of the rules \u2013 the test would be whether they acted as a commercial operator would have done but there are caveats that could help its case \u2013 but all find it hard to explain why it did not go down the \u201cprior approval\u201d route, thus saving itself from a potential decade of drip, drip complaints. Those that oversaw the decision, and those that profited from it, point to a 2013 complaint from Charlton Athletic Supporters Trust that was eventually taken no further by the Commission. However, in correspondence the EC has actually said it does \u201cnot at this stage envisage to pursue the matter further\u201d - a subtle difference of emphasis - and appears to be continuing to keep the matter under review and accumulating relevant material. Steve Clarke, of the Charlton Athletic Supporters Trust, said that they did not object to West Ham moving into the stadium but had a problem with the terms, which they argued would give West Ham an unfair advantage. \u201cWest Ham have been given an advantage not just against Charlton but against clubs across London and throughout the League. Their buying power in the transfer market will be instantly enhanced,\u201d he said, raising concerns that it would also enable the club to subsidise ticket prices and lure potential Charlton fans from across the river. \u201cThere is no reason at all why so much taxpayers money should be spent creating such a huge advantage.\u201d For its part, West Ham argues that it was selected as \u201canchor concessionaire\u201d following a \u201cfair, transparent and robust process\u201d and won because it offered a sustainable future for the stadium and \u201cprovided the best return to the taxpayer\u201d. \u201cThe financial benefit of having West Ham United in the Stadium is that it underwrites the multi-use purpose vision for the venue and secures a year-round calendar of sports and entertainment events. The move will create more than 720 new jobs and bring in more than 1m additional visitors to Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park each year, making it an ongoing viable stadium,\u201d said a spokesman. \u201cWithout West Ham United, the stadium would continue to cost the taxpayer millions of pounds a year. With us, the public purse will see a return on the hundreds of millions of pounds that were committed to build the stadium, long before West Ham\u2019s association had begun.\u201d Yet almost everything surrounding the deal that delivered the stadium to West Ham remains shrouded in secrecy. For a project that has commanded such a flow of public funds, there is a serious lack of transparency. \u201cThe secrecy worries me if those decisions are being made without giving us the ability to hold them to account,\u201d says Conservative London Assembly member Andrew Boff. \u201cBut what worries me more is the stupidity of some of the decisions that have been made.\u201d Campaigners have spent years engaged in FOI ping pong, succeeding only in obtaining a very heavily redacted version of the contract and limited answers about the process from a twitchy LLDC. Heavily redacted versions of the LLDC\u2019s response to the European Commission and the original contract reveal that it will take a cut of the matchday catering revenues up to a certain amount, beyond which the income is split with West Ham. But all hospitality income will remain with the club. It also argues that the LLDC will receive a \u201csignifcant uplift\u201d in naming rights income as a result of West Ham\u2019s presence and that there is a \u201csignificant community benefits arising from West Ham\u2019s use of the stadium\u201d including 100,000 free tickets per annum to be distributed to locals.    The secrecy worries me if those decisions are being made without giving us the ability to hold them to account  Andrew Boff, Conservative London Assembly member     It also highlights the so-called Threshold Amount deal with West Ham ensuring that the LLDC will receive a slice of the proceeds if the club is sold within a certain timeframe (although it will only receive \u201ca share of that increase in value above a certain threshold\u201d). Yet all the financial information and contractual details in the 25-page letter and the original contract are redacted for reasons of commercial confidentiality, making it impossible to ascertain whether the deal is fair one. \u201cThe LLDC\u2019s refusal to release the commercial details of the contract even under Freedom of Information law adds to the suspicion that those involved do not want the deal to come under public scrutiny until it is impossible to reverse,\u201d said Clarke. \u201cWe hope the Information Commissioner will prevail and that taxpayers can take a good long look at what has been agreed in their name.\u201d In a response to a letter from a group of Leyton Orient fans, Labour London Assembly Member Len Duvall said: \u201cWe are in agreement that there are concerns around the transparency of the Olympic Stadium deal and have requested its publication, with little success.\u201d The ongoing questions surrounding the Olympic Stadium should not obscure the progress that has been made elsewhere on the Park, where children tumble on adventure playgrounds and the first residents are moving into the flats that once housed the world\u2019s best athletes. The velodrome and pool are attracting local residents and elite athletes alike and, while much of the site remains a work in progress, it is possible to start to get a feel for how it will eventually look. Wider questions about the mix of housing, its density and whether Johnson\u2019s Olympicopolis vision of a hotch potch of cultural, sporting and educational establishments will succeed in the long run will remain. He has lured offshoots of the V&amp;A, Sadler\u2019s Wells dance studio and the Smithsonian Institute to the site to sit alongside his still divisive Orbit sculpture and work is now underway on the iCity \u201cdigital quarter\u201d that will sit alongside BT Sport\u2019s studios. Like it or not the stadium will remain the most high-profile manifestation of the arguments surrounding London\u2019s physical Olympic legacy. If the decision not to seek prior approval of its state aid arrangements comes back to bite the LLDC, it will be one more embarrassment to add to a long list. As West Ham\u2019s owners ponder whether to stick with Sam Allardyce or twist on a new manager ahead of a crucial last season at Upton Park ahead of the move, they will want to be sure that they will not be left liable for a compensation bill that could run into millions. In the meantime it would not hurt Johnson and the LLDC to consider being a bit more transparent with their critics. It is the opacity and evasiveness of their responses that can\u2019t help but increase fear and loathing among critics of West Ham\u2019s great leap forward.", "sentences": ["He points to the \u20ac9m annual rent paid by Ajax to the City of Amsterdam for its 53,000-capacity arena as a useful comparison."], "title": "Question of state aid still lingers over West Ham\u2019s luxurious new home | Owen Gibson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/20/west-ham-olympic-stadium-state-aid-question", "tags": ["West Ham United", "Olympic Stadium", "Olympic legacy", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-04-23T11:20:18Z", "article": "Modern football was invented in Barcelona in the mid-90s. Of this season\u2019s Champions League quarter-finalists, four sides are managed by players who turned out for Bar\u00e7a in 1996: Pep Guardiola, Luis Enrique, Julen Lopetegui and Laurent Blanc. Within a couple of years, they had been joined by Frank de Boer and Phillip Cocu as well as the coach, Louis van Gaal, and his assistant, Ronald Koeman. In slightly differing ways, the eight are apostles for the Barcelona way \u2013 or, more accurately, given the influence of Ajax on that style, the Bar\u00e7ajax way. However, there was another presence there, initially as a translator and then as a coach. In the Bar\u00e7ocracy of modern football, there is a fallen angel. In the modern world, at least at elite level, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho stands alone. He was at the greatest coaching seminar the world has seen, when the game as we know it was shaped, but he did not draw the same lessons everybody else did. The other eight espoused the proactive, possession-based football seeded at the club by Vic Buckingham, developed by Rinus Michels and taken to new levels by Johan Cruyff.   Related: Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, the Martyr of Islington | Corley Miller    Mourinho, however, was different. Mourinho believed in reactive football. He was the outsider, the outcast who now revels in his role as the dark lord. Saturday\u2019s game against Manchester United was typical. Others, playing at home in a match that could effectively ensure the title, might have felt compelled to attack. Mourinho fielded Kurt Zouma, a central defender, in midfield, sitting deep, and won the game with 28% possession. Mourinho may have objected to Diego Torres\u2019s biography of him but the passage describing his methods against the better sides was as true of Saturday\u2019s win as it was of the victory over Liverpool that determined the destination of the title last season: 1. The game is won by the team who commit fewer errors. 2. Football favours whoever provokes more errors in the opposition. 3. Away from home, instead of trying to be superior to the opposition, it\u2019s better to encourage their mistakes. 4. Whoever has the ball is more likely to make a mistake. 5. Whoever renounces possession reduces the possibility of making a mistake. 6. Whoever has the ball has fear. 7. Whoever does not have it is thereby stronger. It\u2019s true that earlier in the season, Chelsea were more expansive. When Diego Costa, Cesc F\u00e0bregas and Nemanja Matic were fit and in form, they attacked and racked up goals. The talk was all of how, after the regular failures to break down massed defences last season, Mourinho had taken decisive action. As the squad has tired and form has waned, as the finish line has approached, though, he has reverted to type. Chelsea have been struggling for form and consistency all year and yet, in the 12 league games since the 5-3 defeat by Tottenham on New Year\u2019s Day, they have conceded only seven goals and dropped only six points. There was a concern earlier this season that Mourinho might be losing his touch. Against Manchester City (home and away), United (away), Southampton (away) and PSG (home and away), Chelsea took the lead, sat back and ended up conceding equalisers. It could even have happened on Saturday, Falcao hitting the post with 11 minutes remaining. However, even if Chelsea have been unusually vulnerable at times in a lead this season, Mourinho hasn\u2019t changed \u2013 and it could be argued that Saturday was vindication.

Photograph: VI-Images/VI-Images via Getty Images    Anyway, the sense is that it\u2019s not entirely a matter of utility: Mourinho has his sides play that way because he enjoys it. Cast out from Barcelona, overlooked by them when they appointed Pep Guardiola in 2008, he is now the anti-Barcelona, determined, like Milton\u2019s Satan, that \u201cglory never shall his wrath or might; extort from me\u201d, vowing: \u201cTo wage by force of guile eternal war, irreconcilable to our grand Foe.\u201d Every defensive performance, every win with limited possession, is a blow against Bar\u00e7a. There\u2019s probably no game Mourinho has enjoyed so much as Internazionale\u2019s Champions League semi-final second leg at the Camp Nou in 2010, when his side, down to 10 men for more than an hour, had only 19% possession and lost 1-0 to win 3-2 on aggregate. Who needs the ball? Mourinho is not a pragmatist in the way that, say, Fabio Capello is, changing approach according to his players and, where necessary, adopting reactive, defensive tactics. Rather his preferred way of playing is reactive, which is why he sold Juan Mata. He may have been Chelsea\u2019s player of the season in each of the two previous years but he had no place in Mourinho\u2019s conception of football. The paradox is that if Mourinho really has allowed his philosophy to be defined in opposition to Barcelona \u2013 he is that which they are not \u2013 then he is still allowing Barcelona to dictate terms, creating a dichotomy where there could be multiplicity. It is not that there is the Bar\u00e7ajax school and Not-the-Bar\u00e7ajax school; it is that the Bar\u00e7ajax school is one way of playing among an almost infinite variety, as represented by J\u00fcrgen Klopp, Carlo Ancelotti and Diego Simeone among others. And that, of course, is testimony to the astonishing influence of Barcelona over modern football. Mourinho cannot escape his upbringing as a coach; even as a rebel, it is Barcelona he is rebelling against.", "sentences": ["From left to right: the then Barcelona manager Louis van Gaal, assistant coach Ronald Koeman, keepers\u2019 trainer Frans Hoek and assistant trainer Jos\u00e9 Mourinho during a friendly in Amsterdam in 1999."], "title": "Jos\u00e9 Mourinho, the anti-Barcelona, stands alone in modern football | Jonathan Wilson", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/apr/23/jose-mourinho-the-anti-barcelona-chelsea-pep-guardiola", "tags": ["Jos\u00e9 Mourinho", "Chelsea", "Barcelona", "Luis Enrique", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-04-24T21:30:06Z", "article": "The sea of ceramic poppies installed at the Tower of London last year to commemorate the outbreak of the first world war has led to the castle being shortlisted for the 2015 museum of the year award.

Admired by many secularists for her fearless denunciation of Islamic fundamentalism, she is loathed not just by Islamic fundamentalists but by many western liberals, who find her rejection of Islam almost as objectionable as her embrace of western liberalism. Confronted by the tribal, patriarchal and religious confines of her upbringing in east Africa, where she suffered female genital mutilation, and the liberty of the Netherlands, where she sought asylum from an arranged marriage, she chose the cultural values of her adopted home over those she had inherited. Not only did she turn her back on her native religion, she became one of its most articulate and vehement critics. The price she paid was 24-hour police protection, and the loss of an artistic collaborator, the film director Theo Van Gogh \u2013 he was murdered in an Amsterdam high street by a jihadist, who promised to kill Hirsi Ali too. When she moved to the safer environs of America, and the welcoming arms of a conservative thinktank, her departure was little lamented in Europe. Hirsi Ali was variously accused of being a self-hating Islamophobe and a traumatised apologist for western imperialism. Even in the US, she is still unpopular in progressive circles. As she records in her new book, Heretic, an honorary degree from Brandeis University was withdrawn following a petition by students and the faculty accusing her of \u201chate speech\u201d. The campaign, she notes drily, saw \u201can authority on \u2018Queer/Feminist Narrative Theory\u2019 siding with the openly homophobic Islamists\u201d. Such a spectacle is just one of the many ironies that litter the contemporary discourse around Islam, freedom of speech, racism and terror. But Hirsi Ali is not much concerned with such sideshows. She is a plain speaker (too plain for some). Her views about the violence and misogyny she sees as inherent in Islamic culture have seen her denounced as an \u201cenlightenment fundamentalist\u201d.     \u2018Plain speaker\u2019: Ayaan Hirsi Ali. Photograph: Christian Marquardt/Getty Images    Having previously argued that Islam was beyond reform, in Heretic she says she wants to strike a more conciliatory note. She sets out to find common ground with the majority of Muslims who view their religion as peaceful and spiritual. While this may be a noble aim, one doubts that a meeting of minds is about to occur anytime soon. For one thing, Hirsi Ali calls for a wholesale Islamic reformation. It makes no sense, she says, to maintain, as so many politicians and religious leaders do, that the terrorism seen in Pakistan, Kenya, Nigeria, Syria, Iraq and elsewhere has no religious justification in Islamic texts. \u201cWe delude ourselves,\u201d she writes, \u201cthat our deadliest foes are somehow not actuated by the ideology they openly affirm.\u201d She quotes chapter and verse of violent exhortations in the Qur\u2019an, and argues that as long as Muslims hold to the notion that the book is the literal word of God then extremists will be able to lay confident claim to theological rationale for their acts. Put simply, her position is that \u201creligious doctrines matter and are in need of reform\u201d. But how? The statistics she assembles do not make optimistic reading. For example, 75% of Pakistanis are in favour of the death penalty for apostasy and sharia law is gaining ground in many Muslim-majority nations. However, Hirsi Ali sees the potential for change in the social protests of the Arab spring \u2013 even if they have mostly ushered in either dictators or Islamists. She also believes that Muslims in the west have a vital role to play in forging a new identity for Islam. She divides followers of the faith into three distinct groups: the Mecca Muslims, the large majority who represent the more tolerant side of the religion, as articulated during Muhammad\u2019s early Mecca period; the Medina Muslims (or the jihadist wing) who are inspired by the harsher aspects of the Qur\u2019an that Muhammad is thought to have expressed during his later consolidation in Medina; and the Modifying Muslims \u2013 those dissidents and reformists who actively challenge religious dogma. The reformers and extremists, writes Hirsi Ali, are currently locked in a battle to win the hearts and minds of the mass of passive Mecca Muslims. She claims to be hopeful that the reformers will prevail, yet she produces little evidence to support such an outcome. Instead, her strengths lie in showing the difficulties in bringing about reform \u2013 not least the widely held belief that as a final and perfect rendition of God\u2019s word, Islam is powerfully resistant to the very concept of reinterpretation. Even her fiercest detractors would struggle to deny much of what Hirsi Ali states about the current predicament within Islam. Unfortunately that doesn\u2019t make it any more palatable, particularly in an era dominated by the modern commandment not to offend anyone. It\u2019s an unpleasant paradox that Islam\u2019s best hope of reform might lie in its worst incarnation. In making such a visible horror show of their crimes, groups such as Isis, Boko Haram, the Pakistan Taliban and Al-Shabaab have laid down a challenge to mainstream Islam for the soul of the religion. Simply denying that these groups are part of the faith is no longer a viable option. Whatever one may think of her solutions, Hirsi Ali should be commended for her unblinking determination to address the problem. Heretic is published by Harper (\u00a318.99).

Even the sybaritic city of New Orleans finally outlawed smoking last week. But when you look into it (as determined smokers no doubt have), there are still many bars and cafes around the world \u2013 and even in the US \u2013 in which they may freely enjoy their unhealthy habit. For example ... New York Surprisingly, some bars do still exist in New York where people can legally smoke indoors, thanks to the \u201ccigar bars loophole\u201d. To qualify, a bar must have been opened before the end of 2001, it must receive at least 10% of its revenue from tobacco sales and 60% from alcohol, and it must be certified compliant by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene. Philadelphia, too, hasn\u2019t yet banned smoking completely in bars, according to the American Nonsmokers\u2019 Rights Foundation. Las Vegas Perhaps the only conceivable benefit of a cigarette addiction is that it can (briefly) restrict your gambling addiction, if you have to go outside to light up. The gambling haven of Nevada can\u2019t have that, of course, so as things stand smoking remains permitted in the gaming areas of casinos, as well as certain designated bars and nightclubs. Copenhagen Just one exception has been provided in Denmark\u2019s otherwise total ban on public smoking: bars may allow you to do it if they, or a designated room, have an area less than 40 square metres (that\u2019s about one seventh of a tennis court, for reference). Few bars qualify, so people generally smoke outside in the Danish capital, which is usually perceived as a paragon of urban virtue. Amsterdam Technically it is legal for residents and visitors to smoke only cannabis in an Amsterdam coffeeshop, although it is perhaps far-fetched to imagine someone\u2019s joint being searched for evidence of contraband tobacco. Nevertheless some coffeeshops and other venues do supply a separate smoking room, which by law must be separate, enclosed and unstaffed. Vienna Thanks to a terrible law full of loopholes, small bars and cafes are exempt from Austria\u2019s smoking ban - as are larger ones, provided they establish a smoking area, which nobody polices very thoroughly. As a result, Vienna and the rest of Austria are virtually the last holdout for smoking in western Europe. Plans for a new law are underway, however, so this situation may not last long. Prague Eastern Europe is another matter. In the Czech Republic, currently, bar owners can ban smoking if they choose - or not if they don\u2019t. And a lot don\u2019t. But as in Austria, such permissiveness may well soon be legislated away.  Cairo Both cigarettes and shisha pipes are deeply ingrained in Egyptian life \u2013 and so, as a result, are heart disease and lung cancer. In fact, smoking in public has been banned several times by various regimes, both nationally and by individual cities, but each time the new rules have been almost totally ignored and soon forgotten. As a result, although a ban covers most public buildings and a lot of hotel restaurants, people can generally smoke as much as they like in almost any cafe in Egypt. Beijing Nearly a third of the world\u2019s smokers live in China, and the Chinese government is getting serious about tobacco control in cities. It just isn\u2019t getting serious very fast. Smoking was only banned in Chinese schools last year, which as a result can now no longer sell tobacco in their canteens or accept sponsorship from tobacco companies! Different cities have different laws, but smoking is permitted in most places, except public buildings.     People smoking and drinking in a \u2018Cafe Tobacco\u2019 shop in Tokyo\u2019s Shinbashi district. Photograph: Kazuhiro Nogi/AFP    Tokyo Traditionally a smoker\u2019s city, the Japanese capital has gradually tightened its restrictions to the point where they are, well, still extremely loose. Not only can people smoke in many bars and restaurants, sometimes they might even be required to, in order not to break rules that prohibit smoking on the street. Havana It seems almost unthinkable that public smoking might be banned in the world\u2019s most famous tobacco city. In fact it has been banned in all of Cuba, in virtually all enclosed public spaces, since 2005, but that doesn\u2019t mean everybody realises. Finding a bar or a restaurant that will let you smoke is, by all accounts, not much of a challenge. Phnom Penh In Cambodia there is no smoking ban as such. Instead, cafe owners are asked to consider telling people to smoke outside. \u201cIf they still do not obey, the owner must call the police to educate them,\u201d explained Hok Khiev, a director of the legal department at the Ministry of Health.  Jakarta Smoking is so freely practised in Indonesia that people can do it almost anywhere. Cigarettes are barely taxed. Cigarette advertising is unrestricted. Even when legislation began to require unpleasant images to be printed on packets last year there was little sign of it actually happening.  Sark Not a city, obviously, but the fourth largest Channel Island still merits a mention on this list for possessing some of the world\u2019s weirdest smoking laws. As things stand, smoking is banned there in pubs, bars and restaurants, but not in shops, offices or places of worship. Which is one way to improve church attendances, I suppose. You can\u2019t smoke in your car, of course, because Sark also bans cars. And more ...  The countries of the former Yugoslavia belong on a long list of others \u2013 along with Romania, Greece, Portugal, Israel and most of Latin America \u2013 which in theory have introduced a ban on smoking in bars and restaurants, but where in practice many visitors would find it difficult to tell.", "sentences": ["Amsterdam Technically it is legal for residents and visitors to smoke only cannabis in an Amsterdam coffeeshop, although it is perhaps far-fetched to imagine someone\u2019s joint being searched for evidence of contraband tobacco."], "title": "From New York to Beijing, where in the world can you still smoke in a bar?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/29/new-york-beijing-where-world-smoke-bar-smoking-ban", "tags": ["Cities", "Smoking", "Society", "Health", "Law", "World news", "Pubs", "Food & drink", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-04-30T11:18:42Z", "article": "Ngoc Minh Ngo says her father was a colonel in the South Vietnamese army, \u2018caught up in a complicated war\u2019: \u201cThe Vietnam War was far more complex from the Vietnamese perspective than anything portrayed in the Western media. My father [pictured above with his American advisor] was a colonel in the South Vietnamese Army. He was educated at the French Catholic school Ecole Pellerin. The Japanese invasion of Vietnam in 1940 galvanized his generation\u2019s political consciousness. Like many of his peers, he left school to join the Viet Minh, seeking independence from French colonial rule. He became a guerrilla fighter, living and hiding in remote areas to avoid capture by the French. When the country was divided in two, he chose to remain in the south while his younger brother and many of his friends went north.   For two decades, they fought on opposite sides, but after the war, my father and his brother reconnected as soon as they could. The years of war did nothing to alter their bond.  \u201cIt was revealed after the war that my father\u2019s driver for years was a Viet Minh sent to kill him, a mission that he failed to carry out several times because of his loyalty to my father. His previous driver had been killed in an assassination attempt on my father, which also took the lives of my uncle (my father\u2019s youngest brother) and my cousin, while leaving him unscathed. This is just a small glimpse of the intricate web of human lives caught up in a complicated war, with conflicting familial and personal loyalties. The Vietnamese who fought on both sides of the war wanted the same thing for the country that they love, peace. It\u2019s a picture that one never sees in the portrayal of the Vietnam War in the West.\u201d Jack V Sturiano describes his \u2018Forrest Gump moment\u2019:     Jack V Sturiano (pictured second row, second from right) meets President Lyndon B Johnson, 31 August, 1967. Photograph: Frank Wolfe/LBJ Library photo    \u201cI was a US Navy Hospital Corpsman 3rd class stationed at the National Naval Medical Center, Bethesda, Maryland. They asked some wounded vets to attend the signing of the New GI Bill on Aug 31. 1967. Corpsman always come with the Marines when they leave the hospital and I was pushing a wheelchair and wound up in the front row. I got one of the pens LBJ is handing out. One year later I was in Vietnam with the 2nd Bn ,1st Marines.\u201d David Hariman says his friend and fellow US marine, John Mooney, was his first experience of a war casualty: \u201cIn early January 1967 John Mooney and I were US marines aboard the USS Iwo Jima, a helicopter carrier, off the coast of Vietnam near the Mekong Delta. The Iwo Jima, carrying remnants of the 1st Battalion Ninth Marine Regiment, was one ship of a naval flotilla participating in Operation Deckhouse V. John was a gunner aboard a helicopter that picked up a marine in the Delta. As the marine jumped into the chopper, a fused grenade dropped from his belt suspender strap, exploded and killed him and my friend John, a corporal at the time. John\u2019s death was the first war casualty I experienced. On the night of January 7th I walked alone through the Iwo Jima\u2019s hangar deck and stopped behind a parked helicopter. It was then that I cried. John was 29 at his death. He was from Lakewood, California. His name is etched on Panel 13E, Line 123 on the Vietnam War Memorial in Washington, D.C. I have always, and will always, cherish our friendship.\u201d Rob Bolvin describes the aftermath of the war for his cousin and US marine Connie: \u201cMy cousin Connie, named for baseball manager Connie Mack, joined the marines in 1967. I last saw him at our grandmother\u2019s funeral in 1970. He was very different from when I had seen him a few years before, he didn\u2019t joke around with me and my brother like he used to, he kept to himself. He was only eight years older than me but it seemed the weight of the whole world was on him. Before leaving my grandfather\u2019s home my dad, a combat vet hugged him and told him to stay in touch, but nobody in the family has been able to find him since then. When we got home from the funeral Dad told me the Tet offensive at Hue had killed many of Connie\u2019s friends during the heavy fighting but he came through uninjured. Back then guys returning from the war were called baby-killers, nobody knew about PTSD or survivor\u2019s guilt, and his mom and dad were heavy drinkers. I hate thinking he dealt with all of this alone. I hope wherever he is, he\u2019s okay.\u201d Kirsty McFadden shares her story of the \u2018chemical legacy\u2019 of the war: \u201cMore than 15 years after my father Paul returned from Vietnam, I was born. In this photo I\u2019m about six weeks old. Dad was 38. Like any proud father he says I was perfect \u2013 alert, curious, in perfect health \u2013 but within a year my family knew that something wasn\u2019t quite right. I was a little tiny doll, significantly smaller than other children my age, and while walking at 12 months, I had a limp.     GuardianWitness contributor WeeLassNZ as a baby and her father. Photograph: Kirsty McFadden/GuardianWitness    It was 1984 and while investigations have since uncovered that the US government knew about the effects of exposure to dioxins like Agent Orange, in the eighties, in Aotearoa New Zealand, where our country\u2019s involvement in Vietnam was not discussed or acknowledged by anyone, the truth was only beginning to reach the public.     Kirsty McFadden\u2019s father during his military service. Photograph: WeeLassNZ/GuardianWitness    By the age of two I had been diagnosed with two neurological conditions \u2013 spina bifida and diastematomyelia. At aged three, as nerve damage started to take hold I had my first surgery to release my spinal cord, tethered around three lower vertebrae. It was unsuccessful and I started a long process of rehabilitation and monitoring to stop further deterioration. At age six, I underwent brain surgery to release the spinal fluid building up in the base of my skull. I learnt to walk again. The following year there was a series of corrective surgeries to save my right foot and leg. At 13 I developed scoliosis on top of my underlying conditions and with increased strain on my already fragile spinal cord, with my heart and lungs affected, I had surgery to straighten my spine. Seven ribs were removed and I spent three months in a full body brace as they grew back over the summer holidays. Growing up, the New Zealand government refused to acknowledge that birth deformities and conditions like mine were linked to exposure to dioxins in the war, despite successive studies in the US and Australia, acknowledging causal links with exposure to the dioxins used in the war and birth deformities in children. They tried to say that New Zealand troops were never sprayed but Dad speaks of living, working and eating in a chemical haze. In 2007 another government inquiry finally acknowledged the truth: New Zealand troops were sprayed with Agent Orange; it had increased their risk of certain cancers and neurological conditions, and it had caused birth defects in their children. I was awarded a small amount of compensation for everything I\u2019d been through, compensation that didn\u2019t cover the costs of my final surgery.   Today, I\u2019m 31, and a living echo of a war that my country should never have been a part of and even now, so many years later I\u2019m still paying the price.\u201d  ratherbehappy says their first view of Vietnamese people in the UK taught them compassion: \u201cI was very young. There was a family across the road. They were mostly young men in smart jackets and open-necked shirts as was fashionable then. They looked so bright and happy. I thought they were Chinese. My school pal said, no, they are from Vietnam. Refugees. I felt so happy that we could welcome them. It was a different place it seems to me, the UK then, we felt quiet pride in welcoming these lovely people from a terrible situation.\u201d Hannah Foster says the Vietnam war has shaped her and her family\u2019s life. You can read more of her story on GuardianWitness. \u201cMy dad served a full tour, 1970-1971, approximately half of which was in and out of the DMZ [demilitarised zone] as his unit rotated through Khe Sanh. He received his draft card when he was 19 or 20, shortly after he left university to take care of a new baby (chances of being drafted were much higher if you were not a student). His brother tried to volunteer in his stead because of the baby, but that was not permitted, so my dad enlisted hoping to avoid deployment. You see, draftees were sent to boot camp and then usually straight to combat, but career guys they would train. My dad\u2019s deployment happened the last year of his enlistment, his marriage did not survive his tour, and my uncle says he\u2019s never been the same. I\u2019m his first child by his second wife, I was born in 1976, and I\u2019ve never met my older brother.  My dad has only recently started talking about his experiences over there ... diving out of a jeep down a 10-foot concrete stair well to avoid incoming RPG, fire fights, massive sleep deprivation, substance abuse.  But the one that still wakes him in a cold sweat is the memory of waking up over his M16 while on duty. He has no idea how long he was asleep (everything looked the same), says an enemy fighter easily could have crept to his position and killed him. Basically all the rumours you hear about that war he lived. Like many veterans he struggled finding work when he came back and was chronically underemployed until his forced retirement from a construction trade in around 2008. He has PTSD and addiction issues, and was rarely at our house; my parents relationship was volatile and they\u2019ve been separated/divorced as long as I can remember ... Our society did not (and does not) give returning soldiers and their families anything remotely like the kind of support they need, but some of this is his own fault too. I don\u2019t think I pity him (not that he\u2019d want it), but I do wonder sometimes what his life would have been like if he hadn\u2019t gone. My uncle has said, \u201cI wish you could have met your dad before he went,\u201d and I sometimes do too. He competed in German nationals for swimming when he was in High School; I do think he must have been a very, very different person... Randomly, I now live near Garden Grove, California, which has the largest Vietnamese population outside of Vietnam (we have great food here); and I work with two individuals who left Vietnam as war refugees. One of these guys has impossible stories about being on a packed ship at around 8 years old with mom and baby sister ... This person is one of the nicest, gentlest people I know, and has been through the most harrowing things of anyone I\u2019ve been acquainted with. So in a weird way, it\u2019s with me every day, even still.\u201d Ivan Pope describes a snapshot of life in 1960s Vietnam: \u201cMy grandfather, Roger Felix Pirard, was a French colonial businessman who ended up in Saigon in the sixties. He was part of a group of Frenchmen who were cozy with the South Vietnamese regime. He died of throat cancer and was buried in this ceremony. My father, a journalist, got a friend who was in Saigon, to take photos of the funeral. I\u2019ve never visited, but it\u2019s on my list.     Funeral procession in Ho Chi Minh City, 1968. Photograph: ivanpope/GuardianWitness     \u201cI was seven at the time. I remember it well. I came down to the kitchen and noticed something. I asked mum why she was crying and she said, \u2018Because my daddy died\u2019. I\u2019m not even sure I knew she had a daddy, but that response always stuck with me and I always remember the day she heard.\u201d Andrew Pearson, a news and documentary maker, shares a story of working in Vietnam in 1969. You can read more of Andrew\u2019s story on GuardianWitness: \u201cThe American district advisor (like a county) was showing me the edge of \u2018secure\u2019 territory. This was a village in Central Vietnam in the province of Binh Dinh, where he was pretty certain he could go without being blown up or ambushed. But that was a decision his enemy would make - it was their option ... We got out of our jeep to look at the next village over, a few hundred yards across a rice field. There was nothing to see except coconut and banana trees beyond the rice. People\u2019s thatch homes were a little farther off, concealed by the fruit trees. A few villagers came out of their homes on our side of things, curious about who we were and what we were doing. A single military jeep with two Americans in it and one enlisted man with a portable radio and a rifle, riding \u2018shotgun\u2019 ... I greeted them in Vietnamese, but there was an uncertainty among the villagers, a reserve, and they stood just outside their homes, silent. There were no young adults around, just the elderly and some children. In places like this, the young adults are all on the other side in armed units, or hidden from us right now, in tunnels. An older woman held out what I presumed was her grandchild, for me to see. The child was limp and very thin. \u201cDo something,\u201d the grandmother meant, with her gesture. Dysentery, I thought. When I first started making films in villages near here, for ABC News, I always took some basic medicine with me ... There was a dispensary very close to the village where I was filming, built with US aid funds, after the area had been re-taken by US and Korean ground forces in 1965, but villagers told me it was empty. When I stopped there to look at it, no one was there and no medicines were on its shelves. The usual story in a case like this was that the supplies had been sold somewhere along the supply chain for private profit, even to their enemy.     Old defences on the Hai Van pass, Vietnam. Photograph: Nick Board/GuardianWitness    The closest doctor was in the provincial city, but for local villagers, it might as well have been in another country because it was too far to walk, they didn\u2019t have money to hire transportation and they knew that if they managed to overcome these obstacles, the medical staff wouldn\u2019t treat them unless they paid for care, and they couldn\u2019t pay. I once got an Australian nurse from a medical aid mission based in the provincial capitol to come out to the village to treat a very sick child whose scalp was terribly infected from scabies. Rural women believe it\u2019s wrong to wash the soft part of a baby\u2019s scalp- anyway, they don\u2019t have soap, so the tiny insects borough in to the child\u2019s skin. I returned to the village about four months later and asked how the child was doing. She died, they told me. One nurse\u2019s visit hadn\u2019t been enough. That\u2019s what I was remembering, standing there in front of the old woman\u2019s sick grandchild. ... Twenty years later, I had a chance to make up for my neglect. I was with rural guerillas in the Philippines, the New People\u2019s Army, when I noticed another very sick child. He had an open sore at the base of his throat about an inch long. Tuberculosis, they told me. All they had for treatment was herbs. I asked the mother if she would bring her child when we left and I would take them to the hospital in the city. She agreed. We had a long walk out of the hills along a mountain pathway but were then picked up by a truck and driven in to town. We went to the hospital where I arranged for the little boy, about five years old, to be taken care of ... By the third day, there was light in his eyes already. But I can\u2019t tell you if he lived. I had to return to Manila. I was always on New York time but at least I had learned something: to care for people no matter what. It\u2019s a lesson my country still needs to pay attention to. Care first about ordinary people in countries where some national interest seems to be critical. Not the geopolitics, not the natural resources. Know and care about people and their basic needs. And know their culture and history. Go easy on the ground troops and the killing.\u201d Blifil48 shares a view of the protest movement:     Posters promoting an anti-Vietnam war march, Harvard Square, 1972. Photograph: Blifil48/GuardianWitness    \u201cIn Harvard Square, 1972. Across the street, an SDS (Students for a Democratic Society) poster promoted a confrontational march on Washington on April 29. This sign in front of the Coop (Harvard Cooperative Society) promoted a \u2018Peace Day\u2019 march in New York City on 22 April, a week sooner. It was sponsored by the Greater Boston Peace Action Committee. This activist was collecting donations for the 400-mile round-trip bus ride from Cambridge to Manhattan.\u201d SpiritOfTheEel describes being an \u2018accidental \u2018Nam demonstrator\u2019: \u201cThe years blur it now, but sometime in the early 1970s I was in London for some reason, probably the Boat Show. It was, I think, in Hyde Park that I came across an anti-Vietnam war demonstration setting off. I joined them. Just behind me was a group of University Students - from Bristol I think - who sang, to the tune of Glory, Glory Hallelujah: \u2018Listen, listen Mr. Nixon, why\u2019re you dropping napalm on the children...\u2019 I forget the rest. I didn\u2019t stay in the demonstration for very long. I was afraid of being arrested ... I was sure that the police would close in at any minute. And to my discredit I have to admit that I was actually rather more interested in boats than the Vietnam War, which by then seemed to have gone on endlessly on our TV screens each evening. Still, for about half an hour I was, perhaps, part of history, a genuine, if somewhat accidental, anti-Vietnam war demonstrator.\u201d Bastiaan Rosendaal, a protester, on being on the right side: \u201cIt came even faster than we expected. For 10 years we demonstrated in the streets of Amsterdam, walked with banners and shouted slogans against Lyndon B Johnson and Nixon. The protest movement had grown from a small group of young radicals to a broad front of people from all over society. They included social democrats, intellectuals, troubled believers and long haired youth that wanted to take a distance from their inveterate conservative parents. The objection that the Americans liberated us, silenced gradually. The Domino theory lost its persuasiveness. And suddenly, March 1975, the end was there. Small Vietnamese men with kalashnikovs took over Saigon. The images we saw on the TV news, were unbelievable. Americans in panic who tried to get away with their large helicopters. And even with that they failed. The last helicopter was thrown by American soldiers from the roof of the American embassy. And now, so many years after, we can say that we were right in our protests. The feared domination of communism did not take place. The domino stones even fell to the other side.\u201d  This piece was updated on 30 April to include additional information from Ivan Pope.

On Friday evening the Henley-on-Thames-born defender will line up for AS Trencin, who lead the Fortuna Liga, in the Slovakian Cup final against FK Senica at the Poprad Stadium in the foothills of the snow-capped Tatra mountains. At 22 Lawrence already has a storied career. Formerly at Arsenal, Queens Park Rangers, HFC Haarlem, Ajax, Sparta Rotterdam and RKC Waalwijk he holds an international masters in sports management, attained at the Johan Cruyff Institute. While the determination to establish himself as a player has taken him from England to Slovakia via the Netherlands, Lawrence\u2019s resilience is also illustrated in his recovery from a serious heart complaint and a double sports hernia suffered during his early years in the Netherlands. After his father, Steve, moved the family from north London to Amsterdam in 2008 to aid Lawrence\u2019s ambition, a year at Haarlem and two at Ajax \u2013 where Dennis Bergkamp was a coach \u2013 were followed by a move to Sparta. \u201cI spent a year there, didn\u2019t really feel it was the right place for a breakthrough, so found a club called RKC Waalwijk in the south of Holland. They played in the top league so it was a good club.\u201d Lawrence appeared for the Under-23s. \u201cBut I had no first-team minutes. I stayed for two years waiting for my chance that was promised and promised,\u201d the defender says of the then manager Erwin Koeman, brother of Ronald, to whom he is currently the No2 at Southampton. \u201cThe team was very old, average age in the region of 28, so not a place for young players. Through a contact we still had at Ajax we agreed I\u2019d go for a week to Trencin and see how it was.\u201d The club is owned by the former Ajax and Holland winger Tschen La Ling and, as with much of Slovakian football, is influenced by the Dutch game. \u201cI really enjoyed it, it was a good club, lots of very young players, and I got a contract offer and decided to accept,\u201d Lawrence says. The end of a quest that began in boyhood to play professional football came on 13 August in a bow worthy of the dream-debut cliche, as Lawrence scored in a 4-0 win at SK Strazske in the second round of the cup. A few days later he made his first league appearance, coming on as a 77th-minute replacement in a 4-2 victory over MFK Kosice. He has featured 24 times, making 15 starts, in his breakthrough season. During an era in which Greg Dyke, the Football Association chairman, talks of the \u201cdepressing\u201d scarcity of English players at Premier League clubs, Lawrence\u2019s trajectory could yet follow that of Eric Dier, who was playing away from these isles at Sporting Lisbon before being brought back by Tottenham.     Jamie Lawrence receiving the certificate for his international master\u2019s degree in sport management from Johan Cruyff.    \u201cThe football didn\u2019t take much getting used to as we try to play a similar style to the Dutch teams,\u201d Lawrence says. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely been an adjustment but I\u2019m comfortable with the differences now. In terms of the culture, the city where I live has more of a village feel. This means that everyone knows everyone and news travels fast. It means for a good family feeling within the club too. It took me around four years to get to grips with the Dutch language and I think Slovak is more difficult. Not many people here speak English at a good level which makes communication hard. We have a pretty international team at the moment. \u201cI now find the idea of playing in other countries exciting, whereas I feel like if I\u2019d spent my whole career in England I might be more tentative about venturing abroad.\u201d Lawrence almost certainly would not have a masters degree either. \u201cI did it in my last year in Holland; it is a course designed for athletes. There were two classes, 42 in total \u2013 no other footballers but it had a range of professionals including swimming and judo. I studied two nights a week in Amsterdam, right next to the family apartment. I was at RKC then, usually playing on Monday evenings and training on mornings or afternoons.\u201d Trencin lead the Fortuna from MSK Zilina by five points and are 19 points clear of Senica so are favourites to claim the cup when the final starts at 5.15pm local time (4.15pm BST). The second part of the double requires Trencin to maintain their nerve in the closing six matches of the league campaign. Trencin, a city of around 60,000 located in the west of Slovakia where many of the 12 top-flight clubs are, have never been champions since being founded in 1992, the best finish being last year\u2019s second place. Of facing Senica in the final, Lawrence, who is likely to line up at left-back in Martin Sevela\u2019s 4-3-3, says: \u201cWe\u2019ve played them twice \u2013 the first game ending 1-1 and the second 3-1 in our favour. It won\u2019t be an easy game but if we play to the standard we know we can then we should come out on top. Our cup run has been exciting. I missed one of the earlier games but apart from that I\u2019ve played in every game so far. \u201cLooking back it\u2019s been a real adventure and has opened up the possibilities for the future. I\u2019m playing for the best team in Slovakia. If we maintain our form we\u2019ll be playing Champions League qualifiers next season. I couldn\u2019t be happier about that.\u201d As with Harry Kane at Tottenham Hotspur, who went on loan four times before his stellar breakthrough this term, Lawrence offers hope and inspiration to all young players just to keep on keeping on.", "sentences": ["After his father, Steve, moved the family from north London to Amsterdam in 2008 to aid Lawrence\u2019s ambition, a year at Haarlem and two at Ajax \u2013 where Dennis Bergkamp was a coach \u2013 were followed by a move to Sparta.", "I studied two nights a week in Amsterdam, right next to the family apartment."], "title": "Jamie Lawrence has eyes on Slovakian double after mastering his own destiny", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/apr/30/jamie-lawrence-slovakia-cup-league-double", "tags": ["European club football", "Football", "Sport", "Slovakia"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-04-30T13:27:40Z", "article": "In 2009, nearly half of the world\u2019s new polio cases were in India. The disease which can cause paralysis and death is highly infectious, but by January last year, thanks to a concerted vaccination programme, the country had gone three years without a single case of the virus. It was officially \u201cpolio-free\u201d.     Alan Rusbridger. Photograph: Graeme Robertson    This immense achievement involved many people, including 2 million vaccinators fanning out across the vast country, but was due in no small part to the determination of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, whose resources helped make those vaccinations possible. Gates himself is now betting on eradicating polio entirely from the world by 2018 \u2013 and who would bet against him? The polio story is one of countless other seemingly intractable global problems that the Gates Foundation has set its collective mind and resources to solving \u2013 HIV, malaria, sanitation, education, agriculture. All are in Gates\u2019 sights. So why would the Guardian launch a climate change campaign aimed at one of the world\u2019s most valuable and far-sighted organisations? The answer is, precisely because of that far-sightedness. Since mid-March, the Guardian\u2019s Keep it in the Ground campaign, in partnership with 350.org, has been calling on the Gates foundation (and also the Wellcome Trust, another global medical charity) to divest its $43.5bn (\u00a328bn) endowment from fossil fuel assets. That would mean moving $1.4bn from oil, coal and gas stocks into alternatives. The logic is simple, these companies are committed to prospecting for more fossil fuels at a time when proven reserves are already far greater than we can afford to safely burn. We chose to call on the Gates Foundation (which incidentally also funds the Guardian\u2019s global development coverage) precisely because they are one of the good guys. They certainly understand the nature of the climate threat. In their annual letter in January, Bill and Melinda Gates wrote:   \u201cThe long-term threat [of climate change] is so serious that the world needs to move much more aggressively \u2013 right now \u2013 to develop energy sources that are cheaper, can deliver on demand, and emit zero carbon dioxide.\u201d  We agree. And we\u2019re asking Bill Gates for leadership on a global problem where leaders are in short supply. That\u2019s where this video comes in. The Keep it in the Ground campaign is a collection of over 190,000 voices from over 170 countries. When we asked those supporters to make a personal message to Bill, the result was an impassioned plea for leadership from around the world. If the Gates Foundation were to divest, it would send a powerful signal to fossil fuel companies and to governments that business as usual is not acceptable. It would also have a huge snowball effect on other organisations currently considering whether to move their own money. In short it would be real climate leadership. Will you lead us Bill?  Help us convince Bill Gates that his leadership is desperately needed. Please watch the video and share it as widely as possible using #keepitintheground.

The students, who call themselves the Free University of London, are protesting against university privatisation, tuition fees and a lack of diversity in higher education. University management sent a letter of eviction to students on Wednesday night, informing them that they must leave the occupied premises by midnight or risk the university taking legal action to regain control of the building. The letter comes after the occupying students staged a series of highly-attended events on Tuesday, including a screening of Russell Brand\u2019s new film, The Emperor\u2019s New Clothes, and a talk by David Graeber.    #OccupyLSE thank you for watching Emperor&#39;s New Clothes  #ThingsCanChange pic.twitter.com/Vah7S7TaIB&mdash; Russell Brand (@rustyrockets) April 28, 2015    An LSE spokesman said that if the students do not move the university will go to court to try to get an injunction to request a legal removal. However, so far the students have refused to move. The occupation notice, signed by Andrew Webb, the LSE\u2019s acting school secretary, and delivered to occupiers by hand, lists the university\u2019s attempts to \u201cresolve [the] occupation amicably\u201d and says participants\u2019 behaviour poses a risk to other students and staff. In a statement released on Wednesday night, an LSE spokesman said: \u201cWe are highly concerned by the appearance of non-LSE students on site including those demanding access to closed school buildings late at night.\u201d It continued: \u201cWhile we continue to make every commitment to LSE students in support of their right to free speech, our allegiance to and duty of care must remain with them and cannot be extended to outsiders.  \u201cIn the face of mounting concern, notably from other LSE students, the school has been forced into a position where it must take action. This is a matter of genuine regret.\u201d However, the students deny the university\u2019s charges against them. In a statement posted to the Occupy LSE Facebook page, they said: \u201cThe legal threat from management is in direct response to us organising a day of events founded on the principles of free education. \u201cFor the last six weeks the Vera Anstey Room has been used as an educational space, where hundreds of people have participated in discussions, events, seminars and workshops on a variety of topics. The events have all been open to the public, students or not, in reflection of the belief that universities, and educational spaces, are to be free, open and accessible to all.\u201d Hundreds of students have joined the LSE occupation, since it began on 18 March, which is one of a series of occupations at London universities. University of the Arts London began legal action against student occupiers earlier this month. Natalie Fiennes, 23, a postgraduate student at LSE and participant in the occupation, said: \u201cAfter UAL this month, and events in Quebec and Amsterdam, this is yet another example of a university taking action against their own students who are fighting for a more just and equal future through legitimate political expression.\u201d \u201cWhat has happened is emblematic of the marginalisation of the political voices of the young.

Pop-Up City interviews the artist, who explains: \u201cI love the structure of the city and its endless possibilities, just after a while I start wondering: who are we, who am I?

The problem being, of course, that the therapeutic new tunnel could cause a great deal of stress for someone else \u2013 the person who shares the garden, say. London\u2019s unicyclists It seems that London is becoming increasingly obsessed with electric unicycles, as City Metric reflects on a growing number of sightings of 21st-century unicyclists in the capital. We might have recently called it a \u201ctorture device\u201d but that\u2019s not stopping the popularity of the unusual urban transport method. \u201cPeople are willing to annoy (and potentially run over) other pedestrians, look silly, and maintain a tricky-looking balance, all for the pleasure of not using their feet,\u201d writes Barbara Speed. Maybe we\u2019ll stick to walking. The Hamburg wall If you\u2019ve ever tried to board a London tube in rush hour, you may have felt that there was a wall of people preventing you from getting on. Unidentified urban guerrillas in Hamburg have gone a step further, however, by actually building a brick wall in the doorway of one of the city\u2019s S-Bahn trains. No one\u2019s quite sure about the reason, but irritated police have admitted that \u201cthere\u2019s craftsmanship behind it\u201d.

Seated inside her glass booth in the middle of a moving car, she is besieged by tourists on all sides. \u201cI have no tickets left!\u201d she announces abruptly. Bemused sightseers, destined for the museum quarter, can now enjoy a free ride, but have little or no room to move, or breathe. This city really does not seem in need of more visitors. Especially not the British. On the train in from the ferry port, members of the standard English stag trips were in evidence. One groom-to-be, easily spotted in his yellow banana suit, was excitedly running through the lineup of bars and late-night attractions ahead. And yet next month busy Amsterdam wants to reach out across the North Sea and remind its near neighbours what it does well; not the druggy coffee shops, nor the quaint canal cruises, nor the sex tours, but instead its blistering display of difficult, even confrontational, culture at the annual Holland festival. The festival\u2019s co-director this year is a Brit and she is a high-profile one. Ruth Mackenzie, former arts adviser to a succession of Westminster culture ministers and the woman responsible for putting together the programme of the Cultural Olympiad in London in 2012, has been working with a team of Dutch experts to bring greater international attention to a major summer event that has been going on since 1947. At its inception, in the wake of war, the Holland festival was one of the cultural celebrations intended to revive Europe, alongside Edinburgh, Avignon and Vienna. Despite its longevity and its significance inside the Netherlands, large numbers of British fans of music, theatre, art and ballet have so far failed to mark the festival on their calendar. Plenty have not even heard of it. The rows of weekend tourists standing in front of Rembrandt\u2019s The Night Watch on the first floor of the refurbished Rijksmuseum fall broadly into two categories. Some are middle-aged couples engaged in a pleasant round of cultural box-ticking: others are young students, dutifully scanning European art treasures. None I spoke to were aware of the Holland festival. Naturally, Mackenzie thinks this is silly, and particularly for Brits, because the festival is a chance to see good European art before it comes to London, as well as to sample oddities that probably never will. \u201cIt\u2019s actually often easier to get out here than it is to get to Edinburgh,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is only 45 minutes in a plane from London and there are direct trains too.\u201d A big draw this year is British artist Liam Gillick, who will contribute his first piece of art using the human form. In his All-Imitate-Act Gillick is to invite passersby on the Museumplein next to Amsterdam\u2019s contemporary gallery, the Stedelijk, to place their heads, seaside pier-style, inside holes at the top of a series of cardboard cutout cultural figures. This element of public participation picks up on a theme of shared experience for 2015. The festival will open with a DJ live-streaming a bespoke party mix into the homes of anyone who wants to join in. There will also be a 12-Hour Proms event, with music ranging from Thomas Tallis to the Mercury Music prize-nominated British singer Anna Calvi. With tickets going for \u20ac10, Mackenzie sees this as an enticing offer for Calvi fans across the water. This spring the Stedelijk has staged a different Tino Sehgal \u201chappening\u201d each month. When I visited, the Turner-nominated Anglo-German artist had uniformed gallery wardens leaping out and informing art lovers: \u201cIt\u2019s so contemporary!\u201d It was hard to disagree. For the festival next month he has something special, and rather darker, planned. The only fly on the pancake for cultural tourists is the length of the queues outside the bigger national institutions. \u201cI just can\u2019t bear these lines. Let\u2019s go,\u201d I heard an American teenager complaining outside the Van Gogh Museum. Tickets should certainly be pre-booked. In a noble response to bleak days before Amsterdam\u2019s liberation 70 years ago this week, the longest wait is for those standing in the serpentine line outside Anne Frank\u2019s former hiding place on Prinsengracht. This bends not just around several street corners, but right around the large Westerkerk, the church with the bells that sounded out Frank\u2019s quarter hours. These landmarks of the tourist trail are all at hand, but Mackenzie\u2019s vision for June centres on her 18 world premieres and 29 Dutch premieres. \u201cThere is so much going in Amsterdam anyway, you really have to raise it up a notch to make an impact,\u201d she said.  \u201cAmsterdam is often the first place to recognise a talent,\u201d says Mackenzie. \u201cWe have lots of artists who have not yet worked in the UK. One who is going to be taking the idea of public involvement to an extreme is the Argentinian, Fernando Rubio.\u201d Rubio will set up six double beds across the city and then invite people to climb in for one-to-one performances of a short text about loneliness, delivered by an actress. \u201cMembers of the public will become the artwork and they are not going to forget that experience.\u201d Why then do the British not come over en masse? The old associations with stag trips and prostitutes, coupled with the tawdry \u201chead shops\u201d selling cannabis, could be to blame. This spring the canalsides are dotted with the odd beer-sluiced post-adolescent, but Amsterdam has an overwhelmingly friendly atmosphere, not a seamy one. The chief danger is getting lost at night in the maze of apparently interchangeable canal frontages: a stage set from the 17th century, with gabled rooftops peering down on either side. \u201cAmsterdam is completely gorgeous. It looks like a Pieter de Hooch painting and it is very safe,\u201d enthuses Mackenzie. \u201cI have never felt at risk.\u201d Yet a luridly honest sign in the forecourt of the main railway station tells another story. The digital display, of the kind usually offering advice on planned roadworks, blinks out a warning to tourists not to buy drugs on the street because there have been two deaths in the last few months. Mackenzie sees this sign as typical of the straightforward and caring attitude of the Dutch capital. \u201cIt is a very liberal, gentle city.

They hurry in swarms through the streets, unbothered by traffic rules, taking precedence whenever they want, rendering motorists powerless by their sheer numbers. Cyclists rule in Amsterdam and great pains have been taken to accommodate them: the city is equipped with an elaborate network of cycle-paths and lanes, so safe and comfortable that even toddlers and elderly people use bikes as the easiest mode of transport. It\u2019s not only Amsterdam which boasts a network of cycle-paths, of course; you\u2019ll find them in all Dutch cities.  The Dutch take this for granted; they even tend to believe these cycle-paths have existed since the beginning of time. But that is certainly not the case. There was a time, in the 1950s and 60s, when cyclists were under severe threat of being expelled from Dutch cities by the growing number of cars. Only thanks to fierce activism and a number of decisive events would Amsterdam succeed in becoming what it is, unquestionably, now: the bicycle capital of the world.      The share of trips made by bicycle in Amsterdam plunged from 80% to 20% between the 1950s and 70s. Source: Bruheze and Veraart    At the start of the 20th century, bikes far outnumbered cars in Dutch cities and the bicycle was considered a respectable mode of transport for men and women. But when the Dutch economy began to boom in the post-war era, more and more people were able to afford cars, and urban policymakers came to view the car as the travel mode of the future. Entire Amsterdam neighbourhoods were destroyed to make way for motorised traffic. The use of bikes decreased by 6% every year, and the general idea was that bicycles would eventually disappear altogether.     The streets no longer belonged to the people who lived there, but to huge traffic flows  Maartje van Putten, former MEP     All that growing traffic took its toll. The number of traffic casualties rose to a peak of 3,300 deaths in 1971. More than 400 children were killed in traffic accidents that year. This staggering loss led to protests by different action groups, the most memorable of which was Stop de Kindermoord (\u201cstop the child murder\u201d). Its first president was the Dutch former MEP, Maartje van Putten. \u201cI was a young mother living in Amsterdam and I witnessed several traffic accidents in my neighbourhood where children got hurt,\u201d van Putten, 63, recalls. \u201cI saw how parts of the city were torn down to make way for roads. I was very worried by the changes that took place in society \u2013 it affected our lives. The streets no longer belonged to the people who lived there, but to huge traffic flows. That made me very angry.\u201d     In the 1960s planners viewed the car as the travel mode of the future, and swaths of the city were destroyed to make way for motorised traffic. Photograph: Fotocollectie Anefo/Society for the Nationaal Archief    The 1970s were a great time for being angry in Holland: activism and civil disobedience were rampant. Stop de Kindermoord grew rapidly and its members held bicycle demonstrations, occupied accident blackspots, and organised special days during which streets were closed to allow children to play safely: \u201cWe put tables outside and held a huge dinner party in our street. And the funny thing was, the police were very helpful.\u201d Van Putten remembers the 70s as a time when Dutch authorities were remarkably accessible: \u201cWe simply went to tea with MPs \u2013 and they really listened to what we had to say. We cycled with a group of activists and an organ grinder to the house of the prime minister, Joop den Uyl, to sing songs and ask for safer streets for children. We didn\u2019t get beyond the hallway, but he did come out to hear our plea.\u201d    We had a great fighting spirit and we knew how to voice our ideas. And in the end, we would get our bicycle lane  Tom Godefrooij     Stop de Kindermoord became subsidised by the Dutch government, established its headquarters in a former shop, and went on to develop ideas for safer urban planning \u2013 which eventually resulted in the woonerf: a new kind of people-friendly street with speed bumps and bends to force cars to drive very slowly. Nowadays the woonerf has gone out of fashion, but it can still be found in many Dutch cities. Two years after Stop de Kindermoord was established, another group of activists founded the First Only Real Dutch Cyclists\u2019 Union to demand more space for bicycles in the public realm \u2013 organising bike rides along dangerous stretches of road, and compiling inventories of the problems encountered by cyclists.     An estimated 38% of all trips in Amsterdam are made by bike \u2013 compared with 2% in London.  Photograph: Tony Burns/Getty Images/Lonely Planet Image    \u201cSomehow we managed to strike a chord,\u201d says Tom Godefrooij, 64, who got involved with the Cyclists\u2019 Union as a young man. He remembers noisy mass demonstrations with tricycles and megaphones, and nightly ventures to paint illegal bicycle lanes in streets the union considered dangerous. \u201cFirst we would be arrested by the police, of course, but then the whole thing would be in the newspapers and municipal politicians would eventually listen. We had a great fighting spirit and we knew how to voice our ideas. And in the end, we would get our bicycle lane. Even in the 70s, you know, there were politicians who understood that the general focus on cars would eventually cause problems.\u201d The activists of Stop de Kindermoord and the Cyclists\u2019 Union were resourceful and undaunted, but there were other forces helping to create a fertile soil for their ideas. The Netherlands \u2013 possessing few hills and a mild climate \u2013 had a great tradition of cycling to begin with and the bike was never completely marginalised as it was in some other countries. The intolerable number of traffic deaths really was a serious concern for politicians, and there was a nascent awareness of the pollution caused by vehicle emissions. The 1973 oil crisis \u2013 when Saudi Arabia and other Arab oil exporters imposed an embargo on the US, Britain, Canada, Japan and the Netherlands for supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur war \u2013 quadrupled the price of oil. During a television speech, prime minister Den Uyl urged Dutch citizens to adopt a new lifestyle and get serious about saving energy. The government proclaimed a series of car-free Sundays: intensely quiet weekend days when children played on deserted motorways and people were suddenly reminded of what life was like before the hegemony of the car.      Amsterdam is now home to an estimated 881,000 bicycles. Photograph: Timothy Clary/AFP/Getty    On one of these car-free Sundays, Maartje van Putten, together with a group of other parents and children, rode her bike through a tunnel to the northern part of Amsterdam, in which no provisions for cyclists had been made. \u201cWe didn\u2019t realise that what we did was dangerous, because there were still some cars on the road. Our trip ended at the police station, but we made our point.\u201d Gradually, Dutch politicians became aware of the many advantages of cycling, and their transport policies shifted \u2013 maybe the car wasn\u2019t the mode of transport of the future after all. In the 1980s, Dutch towns and cities began introducing measures to make their streets more cycle-friendly. Initially, their aims were far from ambitious; the idea was simply to keep cyclists on their bikes.  The Hague and Tilburg were the first to experiment with special cycle routes through the city. \u201cThe bicycle paths were bright red and very visible; this was something completely new,\u201d says Godefrooij. \u201cCyclists would change their routes to use the paths. It certainly helped to keep people on their bikes, but in the end it turned out that one single bicycle route did not lead to an overall increase in cycling.\u201d Subsequently, the city of Delft constructed a whole network of cycle paths and it turned out that this did encourage more people to get on their bikes. One by one, other cities followed suit. Nowadays the Netherlands boasts 22,000 miles of cycle paths. More than a quarter of all trips are made by bicycle, compared with 2% in the UK \u2013 and this rises to 38% in Amsterdam and 59% in the university city of Groningen. All major Dutch cities have designated \u201cbicycle civil servants\u201d, tasked to maintain and improve the network. And the popularity of the bike is still growing, thanks partly to the development of electric bicycles. The Cyclists\u2019 Union has long ceased to be a group of random activists; it is now a respectable organisation with 34,000 paying members whose expertise is in worldwide demand.   Related: End of the car age: how cities are outgrowing the automobile    \u201cWe have achieved a lot, but we\u2019re facing many new challenges,\u201d says their spokesman, Wim Bot. \u201cMany old cycle paths need to be reconstructed because they do not measure up to our modern standards \u2013 some are used by so many people that they are no longer wide enough. We have the problem of parking all those bikes, and we are thinking of new ways to create even more space for cyclists and pedestrians. What our cities really need is a totally new kind of infrastructure. They\u2019re simply not fit for so much car traffic.\u201d \u201cThe battle goes on,\u201d says Godefrooij. \u201cThe propensity of urban planners to give priority to cars is still persistent. It\u2019s easy to understand: an extra tunnel for cyclists means you have to spend extra money on the project. We\u2019ve come a long way, but we can never lower our guard.\u201d  Which are the most cycle-friendly cities in the world?

He believes in it so much that his company, Arizona Natural Selections, operates two medical marijuana dispensaries that have served about 9,000 patients since opening last year. Holyoak, a financial adviser, has a big cannabis nursery in a warehouse on an industrial estate near Phoenix Sky Harbor airport. And he believes that recreational marijuana should be legalised \u2013 not through any enthusiasm for stoner culture, but because it is sound conservative policy. Holyoak, a Republican, said he has \u201clearned about the total futility of the war on drugs\u201d and is convinced that the only two choices are \u201ctax and regulate, or enrich criminals\u201d. Because of this, he is backing a new ballot initiative asking Arizona voters to legalise recreational pot. He sees it as a wholly separate issue from medical marijuana, which was narrowly approved in the state in 2010 when \u201cyes\u201d won 50.13% of the vote.   Related: High rollers: marijuana entrepreneurs harvest cash from legalised industry    The current campaign needs to secure about 150,000 valid signatures by June next year to get the proposal on the ballot in November 2016. \u201cI\u2019m comfortable and confident that we\u2019ll gather the signatures,\u201d said Holyoak, a serious man who weighs his words as carefully as if he were selling them by the gram. If it passes the ballot, Arizona will become the fifth state to pass such legislation, after Washington, Colorado, Oregon and Alaska. But even if it does, the road to total legalisation in the US remains a long and bumpy one. Marijuana is still illegal at the federal level, and the Drug Enforcement Administration still lists it as a schedule 1 narcotic, or \u201cthe most dangerous drugs\u201d with \u201cno currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse\u201d, according to the DEA. This is partly because of American treaty obligations; a scheduled 2016 UN special session will consider changing the stance of cannabis, but federal change is unlikely while the current treaties remain. At a coffee shop in downtown Scottsdale, Carlos Alfaro said he is steeling himself for a long and bitter fight, convinced that Arizona can be a key domino to fall on the path to nationwide legalisation. \u201cIt [wouldn\u2019t be] the first Republican state \u2013 Alaska legalised it before Arizona. However, I do think it\u2019s the first big Republican state, the hardest battle that we\u2019re fighting on the national front,\u201d said Alfaro, the state\u2019s political director for the Marijuana Policy Project. For Dan Riffle, the federal policy director for the Marijuana Policy Project, the biggest roadblock is \u201cthe mindset of career politicians who have been in Congress since the 70s and 80s, and came of age in a time when we were waging a war on drugs,\u201d he said, adding that one such legislator \u2013 Iowa senator Chuck Grassley \u2013 is chair of the Senate judiciary committee, exactly where change would have to take place. But there are reasons for hope. DEA administrator Michele Leonhart is retiring this year. The DEA has oversight of the scientific process, determining which researchers get licensed and which studies approved \u2013 and it is the DEA, ultimately, which sets what schedule of drug marijuana is. If the next head of the agency comes from a scientific or health background rather than law enforcement, Riffle said, \u201cthen I think there is a window for reform\u201d. In Arizona, even with the petition drive just getting started, the battle for hearts and minds has begun. Near Phoenix airport is a huge billboard with a cute picture of a baby eating a cookie. \u201cWould your child know if this cookie had pot in it?\u201d asks the ad. For Alfaro, who has worked at the DC-based libertarian thinktank the Cato Institute, individual freedom is the core of the issue. It\u2019s an argument he hopes will persuade voters who last year elected the staunchly pro-gun, anti-abortion, Sarah Palin-backed Doug Ducey as governor. \u201cEven though Arizona\u2019s really red in terms of Republican conservative culture, we\u2019re seeing a very strong libertarian streak with the elected officials that we get, some of the laws that we pass. We have a long way to go on things like immigration but when it comes to issues of personal choice I think a strong majority of Arizonans believe that the government shouldn\u2019t be making that choice for us and we should value more personal liberty,\u201d Alfaro said. He is not alone. Several candidates in the 2016 field, including Rand Paul and Ted Cruz, have said that they believe cannabis is a states\u2019 rights issue, rather than a federal one. Like Holyoak, Alfaro is framing the proposal in a way designed to be palatable even to the likes of the retirees who live in places like the Sun City retirement community, north of Phoenix, where a medical marijuana dispensary opened last December. Adults aged 21 and up would be able to buy a maximum of 1oz from a state-licensed retailer, with home-growing restricted to six plants per person and 12 per household. Revenue from a special 15% tax would go towards regulation and public health education. Cities and towns will have the chance to ban sales, private property owners could prohibit it on their premises, and employers would be able to enforce drug-free workplaces.  Activists hope that by stressing tight control and limited access, regulating weed in a similar way to alcohol, they will convince the sceptics that Arizona won\u2019t turn into Amsterdam. \u201cThe substance is not off the streets. It\u2019s very accessible and it does fund an underground market. I think people see that,\u201d Alfaro said as he sat in the coffee house\u2019s outdoor deck on a mellow sunny afternoon. \u201cThey\u2019ve experienced the failure of marijuana prohibition and want to go a different direction.\u201d", "sentences": ["Activists hope that by stressing tight control and limited access, regulating weed in a similar way to alcohol, they will convince the sceptics that Arizona won\u2019t turn into Amsterdam."], "title": "Bid to legalize marijuana in Arizona has some advocates seeing red", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/07/arizona-marijuana-legalization-2016-ballot-initiative-conservatives", "tags": ["Arizona", "Cannabis", "Drugs policy", "Republicans", "US politics", "US news", "Drugs"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-05-08T05:30:02Z", "article": "Oliver Sacks, the eminent neurologist and writer, whose many books have done perhaps more than any other body of work to explain the mysteries of the brain to a general readership, is a strong supporter of the \u201cnarrativity\u201d theory of the human subject.

It was a great benison \u2013 all the greater, because: \u201cIt was just as well that I had no foreknowledge of the future, for after that sweet birthday fling I was to have no sex for the next 35 years.\u201d Accustomed to the contemporary obsession with \u201cidentity\u201d (and sex for that matter), we might expect the autobiography of a gay man \u2013 especially one from a Jewish immigrant background who ends up emigrating to the US from Britain \u2013 to be preoccupied by differences of sexuality and heritage. But Sacks is a man of his generation, and while no prude, nor a jealous guard of his own privacy, nonetheless the personal and existential aspects of this autobiography are definitely secondary to the main business of his life, which has been the practice of neurology and the chronicling of the insights this practice has afforded. In part the light touch on these matters can be explained by a desire not to repeat himself: Sacks\u2019s memoir of his boyhood, Uncle Tungsten, brilliantly realised a portrait of his eccentric family of medics, scientists and technologists, while also recording the traumas of his wartime evacuation and the burgeoning of his own vocation. Then again, throughout Sacks\u2019s literary oeuvre there has been a determination to put himself in the frame: whether writing, in Awakenings (1973) about the post-encephalitic patients he bestirred from half-century-long swoons, or, in An Anthropologist on Mars (1995) and many other works, about the bizarre psychic, cognitive and perceptual worlds of people with autism, Tourette syndrome, congenital blindness, and a host of other \u201cneuro-atypical\u201d conditions, he has always been at pains to emphasise the interpersonal dimension. For Sacks there can be no conception of the mind in isolation: personhood is a property ever emerging from social and perceptual interaction. Not that this perspective came to him fully realised at the outset; rather the impression On the Move conveys is of a shy and withdrawn young man, who, through a combination of unusual life experience and intensive medical practice, comes to realise in himself an almost preternatural sensitivity to the perspectives of others, no matter how alien these may be. You don\u2019t need to be a psychologist to see Sacks\u2019s unusual depth of involvement with his patients as some sort of substitute for those 35 romance-free years. The poet Thom Gunn, a friend of the author\u2019s, remarked that he\u2019d worried Sacks was deficient in empathy until he became a clinician. Sacks himself is even more forthright: \u201cI had fallen in love \u2013 and out of love \u2013 and, in a sense, was in love with my patients.\u201d The criticisms levelled at Sacks \u2013 that his books are exploitative, presenting disabled and damaged people as a sort of freak show \u2013 are exposed as a nonsense by the books themselves, but if you were in any doubt, the quite unselfconscious accounts given here of Sacks\u2019s extraordinary openness to his patients, should lay them to rest. He writes of intervening during a strike by support workers at Beth Israel, the New York hospital where he worked for many years: \u201cWe spent the next four hours turning patients, ranging their joints, and taking care of their toilet needs\u201d. Elsewhere \u2013 just as an aside \u2013 he mentions that his apartment at the hospital \u201cwas always open\u201d to patients. And while he is not known especially as a critic of the psychiatric gulag, many of his experiences in these hospitals move him to anger: \u201cIn some of these places, generically referred to as \u2018the manors\u2019, I saw the complete subjugation of the human to medical arrogance and technology.\u201d   Related: My hero: Oliver Sacks by Hilary Mantel    Sacks met Gunn when he was living in San Francisco and converting his English qualifications to American ones. It was a period in his life defined as much by motorcycling as by medicine \u2013 hence the book\u2019s title \u2013 and Sacks\u2019s embrace of physicality and risk will be a surprise to any reader who expects a neurologist to be a cold technician. While living in London, Sacks had been a member of the Ton Up Boys bikers\u2019 club that once frequented the Ace cafe on the city\u2019s North Circular bypass. He embarked on an enormous circuit of his new-found home by bike, taking photographs and writing an extensive journal as he went. Then, living in Los Angeles in the late 60s, Sacks became a habitue of Muscle Beach, and even gained a Californian weight-lifting record. At the same time, he was experimenting with a wide range of mood-altering drugs, experiences he wrote about in greater depth in his book Hallucinations (2012). He later moved to New York, where he lived on City Island off the Bronx, and regularly swum around it \u2013 swimming remains one of his passions to this day. It is surely Sacks\u2019s apprehension of his own physicality in these myriad ways that has synergised with his intense clinical experience to produce some of his most fruitful and intellectually exciting work. I began this review hoping to synopsise Sacks\u2019s entire life, but it\u2019s a hopeless task. His truly has been a life lived to the full \u2013 and beyond. Friendships with such divergent luminaries as Francis Crick and WH Auden, and with his childhood companions Jonathan Miller and Eric Korn, bring a roseate glow to reminiscence without ever rendering it sickly. The detailed examinations of his own writing life \u2013 including the eight traumatic years it took him to write A Leg to Stand On (1984) \u2013 are set beside pen portraits of the many patients who have shared their lives with him. The fruits of success are counterpointed with some quite astonishing professional setbacks, including manuscripts lost and books plagiarised. But while this autobiography foregrounds Sacks\u2019s human relationships, it is the adventure of ideas he has undertaken that has bestowed on his life its remarkable originality.     British biophysicist Francis Crick in 1993. Photograph: Daniel Mordzinski/AFP/Getty Images    When Sacks began practising as a neurologist, the theoretical understanding of the relationship of the brain to the conscious mind was still based on gross anatomy: if a portion of the brain was damaged, we might be able to discover by observation of the patient what its function was. The advances in brain-imaging have informed new conceptions of the brain, as a highly plastic environment in which there is constant reorganisation. In the early 1990s Sacks became acquainted with Gerald Edelman and his theory of \u201cneural Darwinism\u201d, by which individual consciousness is explained as the function of a process of natural selection between cohorts of competing nerve cells. Sacks describes Edelman\u2019s theory as \u201cthe first truly global theory of mind and consciousness, the first biological theory of individuality and autonomy\u201d. Sacks\u2019s enthusiasm for Edelman\u2019s ideas is more than understandable: the sort of conundrums and paradoxes he has investigated in his own patients for decades have all inclined him towards this, the great riddle of human being. Sacks reports that Edelman once said to him, \u201cYou\u2019re no theoretician\u201d, to which Sacks replied \u201cI know \u2026 but I am a field-worker, and you need the sort of fieldwork I do for the sort of theory making you do.\u201d To which Edelman readily assented. \u201cField worker\u201d is something of an understatement when it comes to Sacks, unless your idea of a field is incredibly wide \u2013 stretching, in fact, to the very horizons of human potential. While not especially forthcoming about his relationship with his father (a doctor who lived and practised into his 90s), Sacks does quote a letter the then chief rabbi, Jonathan Sacks (no relation), sent him after Sacks senior\u2019s death: \u201cHe was a true tzaddik \u2013 I thought of him as one of the 36 \u2018hidden righteous\u2019 whose goodness sustains the world.\u201d In February, Oliver Sacks announced in an interview that the ocular melanoma that had cost him the sight in his right eye seven years ago has returned, and he is now terminally ill. Considering now the vast range of his achievements \u2013 which have been moral, and dare I say it, spiritual (despite Sacks describing himself as an \u201cold Jewish atheist\u201d) \u2013 I have no hesitation in extending the chief rabbi\u2019s encomium down the generations: Oliver Sacks, like his father, is a true tzaddik, although there\u2019s been nothing particularly covert about his righteousness \u2013 any more than his homosexuality. Perhaps it is because he has kept on the move that he has always been able to hide in plain sight. \u2022 To order On the Move go to picador.com/books/on-the-move.", "sentences": ["Perhaps the most extreme of these are two seemingly throwaway remarks Sacks makes concerning his sexual life: aged 21, and desperate to lose his virginity, he found himself in the tolerant atmosphere of Amsterdam \u2013 yet, trammelled by his Orthodox Jewish upbringing and the social repression of the era, he was unable to act, and instead sat in a bar all evening drinking \u201cDutch gin for Dutch courage\u201d."], "title": "On the Move: A Life by Oliver Sacks \u2013 review", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/08/on-the-move-a-life-oliver-sacks-review-autobiography-neurologist", "tags": ["Oliver Sacks", "Autobiography and memoir", "Biography", "Books", "Culture", "Neuroscience", "Science"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-05-08T10:06:38Z", "article": "Drown your sorrows  Nigel Farage\u2019s election campaign may have resembled one long pub crawl, but for most of us, the hard drinking will just be starting.

Particularly if you live in an urban area and your travel is mostly within that urban area (or to other urban areas) it may not make sense to have a car.  I am a pretty good example of this - I live in Frankfurt and got rid of the car 2 years ago. Since then I use a mixture of bike, public transport, and taxis. I use a car from a car-share scheme or one of the big hire shops when I specifically need a car, which is 1-2 days a month on average. This has reduced my mobility costs by 60%. It won't work for everyone and it'll never work in rural areas, but simply more and more people are realising that a car is no longer a necessity.

We have tarmacked over the places we live. Our children can no longer go out to play. We get asthma and lung cancer. We grow fat and unhealthy, we get diabetes.

I sincerely hope in future we look back on this period of madness in our history in horror, as something that has passed and that we will never go back to.       I live in Bangkok and decided after my last 9 year stint here with a car not to buy one. Life far less stressful than the previous 3 hour daily minimum in jams.

Our privatised bus system will provide transport to and from the city centre, but if you need to move in a different direction at any point, there won\u2019t be a bus to take you. The buses are unreliable as well; you can\u2019t expect them to regularly get you to work on time. Like the trains, they\u2019re outrageously overpriced.

Bopstar    28 April 2015 10:59am   This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate There are probably more vans, lorries, taxis and buses in London now than there were all vehicle types in the 70's. Also the public transport system can't take much more capacity. Not at peak times anyway. Also the tube needs to run 24h (yes I know it's coming on weekends) and even more importantly the trains need to run 24h in south London. I guess what I'm saying is unless there is huge investment, the car will be around for a good while.       Building solely for the needs of motor transport has proved a costly and deadly cul-de-sac, but reversing this lemming leap will take not just some cash, but lots of leadership, commitment and wrangling. Such commitment already exists in the Netherlands and Copenhagen where, by a variety of means, cycling as a mode of transport is not simply encouraged and promoted, but also aspired to and, most importantly, enabled. In most of the English speaking world, bike travel is mistakenly viewed as a problem that can and should be solved by means of infrastructure designed more for the needs of motor traffic, to be only grudgingly provided for specifically, but in general to be pushed aside or totally eliminated altogether. A mass cycling culture will only appear with the creation of safe spaces for cycling on. But in the UK we are many years away from having that outside some small pieces of London and a tiny number of other cities. It may cost money, but it will cost more in the long term to keep ignoring the elephant in the room. It has already been demonstrated almost everywhere properly designed protected bike lanes have been installed, that local business benefits, vulnerable road users benefit, and even those who continue to drive benefit. The UK\u2019s own DfT reported that protected bike infrastructure would recoup \u00a35 for every \u00a31 spent on it. - congokid   Living a car-free life is actually really cheap if you plan it right and the alternatives are accessible and low-cost. But for this process to be accelerated, we need that most hard to achieve thing: joined-up thinking. It is about ensuring easy and safe cycling and walking, cheap and convenient and reliable public transport, and a range of good value car hire schemes for those times when a car really is nice to use. The potential for a real societal shift is there - anyone who visits a range of cities from Rennes to Copenhagen can see that the move creates wonderful, liveable cities, and these are where people want to live. We just need more and more smart nudges to keep the process going. - PhilipD   The tram scheme in my nearest large city was scrapped, due to cost. Given this lack of infrastructure quality and expanse, can I assume that we\u2019re not going to be part of this car-free utopia?

Invest heavily first, or hands off my car! - shelltune      London has an extensive public transport network: but what about other cities? Photograph: Alamy    ... and it wouldn\u2019t work outside city centres Consensus is that towns and suburbs are unlikely to get the sort of infrastructure investment received by city centres \u2013 so for many people, cars remain the only reliable option for getting around.             Gelion    30 April 2015 10:16pm  This discussion commonly shows the partition between people who live in densely built up cities like London or Birmingham and those outside those cities. Having lived in both, I did not need a car in Sheffield, I lived 1 minute walk from a bus router and could go virtually anywhere in the city on bus, bike or tram.  Then I moved out and ever since have needed a car and currently own my own business with nationwide clients and I drive easily 500+ miles a week. We also live in the suburbs now and I would say that we need a car to access basic services because there is no public transport. So this leaves me needing a car for business &amp; home life. I don't care if it's a car I drive myself or an automatic, but in reality a large percent of the population will need access to personal vehicles for decades to come because many journeys cannot be catered for by public transport.                 Chriswr    28 April 2015 3:08pm  Cars + cities = bad (arguably)Cars + towns = essential. Cities have a critical mass of housing, leisure and employment so that you rarely need to leave them. And it's all dense enough to be served conveniently with public transport. And maybe car-sharing and taxis to fill in any gaps. But out in small town Britain (and many other countries) none of this applies. And the lower density living is appealing to families with children who typically need space. Out there cars are here to stay. And why not, they are twice as efficient as they were 20 years ago and with hybrids and electric cars coming along that progress is set to continue.

They might pollute less, but they still take up more road space than the alternatives, they still need to be parked somewhere. They still sever neighbourhoods and discouraging walking, play, community on streets. Many of our cities had a troubled and incomplete adaption to the car in a short space of time.

The other blessing will be a changeover to electric cars or zero-emission cars. Right now it is disgusting cycling amongst fossil fuel burning vehicles and drivers are actually breathing in more fumes than cyclists (supposedly).                 Ben Williams    28 April 2015 1:53pm  The author has a point about the mode is car ownership changing. I live in inner Sydney, just outside the CBD, and subscribe to a car sharing scheme (&quot;Go Get&quot;). It's brilliant.

Uber faces regulatory opposition in many places \u2013 authorities in the Chinese city of Chengdu paid a visit to Uber\u2019s offices last week as part of an ongoing investigation; and the service has been banned in the US state of Kansas \u2013 but in Italy, the battle has become personal. Benedetta Arese Lucini, 31, has been the subject of a steady stream of harassment from people staunchly opposed to the private taxi service in Milan, where Uber has its Italian headquarters. In February, a sign accusing Arese Lucini of being a prostitute was displayed near her house. She has had eggs thrown at her, and posters with the words \u201cI steal\u201d printed over her face have been plastered around taxi stands.    Posters with the words \u2018I steal\u2019 printed across Arese Lucini\u2019s face have been plastered around Milan\u2019s taxi stands    Her open-plan office, in a former photography studio in a trendy district of Milan, is entirely unmarked from the outside, and nearly impossible to find. \u201cIt\u2019s like that on purpose,\u201d she said. \u201cWe try to avoid too many people knowing where we are.\u201d It is not just Arese Lucini who has been targeted. Her marketing managers are insulted on Twitter every day, she says, and there\u2019s a worrying sense of \u201cprivate justice\u201d pervasive among people in the taxi industry. They are staunchly opposed to Uber, an app-based service that allows people to locate the closest available car on their smartphone and book a ride after agreeing a set fare. Protests and regulatory interventions against Uber around the world have focused on allegations that it is, in effect, an unregulated taxi service. Referring to her opponents in Milan, Arese Lucini says: \u201cOn their side, they don\u2019t feel like the government is doing enough for them. It\u2019s not a healthy environment.\u201d She adds that Travis Kalanick, the San Francisco-based chief executive of Uber, \u201cknows that I am fierce. But he is very clear about the fact that people come first.\u201d     Uber in use in Barcelona, Spain. Photograph: David Ramos/Getty Images    This was supposed to be Uber\u2019s year in Europe. Having faced resistance in cities across the EU, Kalanick declared in January that he wanted to focus on forging \u201cnew partnerships\u201d in European cities, and promised that the expansion of the private company could eventually create 50,000 jobs. Since then, Uber has become the subject of a criminal investigation in the Netherlands and an injunction in Geneva, where it was accused of operating as an illegal taxi service. But the company \u2013 which prefers to call itself a ride-sharing service \u2013 is fighting back: it recently made a complaint to the European commission over the banning of its peer-to-peer unlicensed services in Germany, France and Spain. In Italy, Uber operates in a grey zone \u2013 not quite illegal, but not quite condoned by the law, either. \u201cThere has been no single, centralised pronouncement on Uber,\u201d said Carlo Alberto Carnevale Maff\u00e8, a business professor at the Bocconi school of management in Milan. \u201cWe have political positions and several contradictory interpretations of the law. There is no jurisprudence.\u201d The company\u2019s challenges here are the same as those facing any innovative group in Italy: deeply entrenched regional and local interests, a painstakingly slow-moving judicial system, stodgy bureaucracy and a general resistance to change.    Uber argues it is different from public taxi services in that it only gives rides to people who book through its app    Arese Lucini sees herself as part of a new guard trying to shake things up, much as Italy\u2019s 40-year-old prime minister, Matteo Renzi, has sought to foster his image of an agent of change. Uber\u2019s biggest obstacle in Italy at the moment is a 1992 law that, among other things, puts severe restrictions on taxi and limo services by limiting the number of licences that are available for drivers in any given city. Although there have been attempts to deregulate the system in the past, none has succeeded. For now, Uber is arguing \u2013 mostly with success \u2013 that it is different from public taxi services because it is discriminating about its users \u2013 in that it only gives rides to people who book through its smartphone app. Changes to the 1992 law are being debated, and Arese Lucini hopes it will recognise that Uber as a private alternative to public transport. In the immediate future, she is focusing on this summer\u2019s Expo world fair in Milan and the partnership she has forged with the US delegation. Uber has promised Expo guests free rides. She says she is excited by the opportunity, though it is clear she had hoped for much more. If Arese Lucini had it her way, the Expo \u2013 which is expected to attract 20 million people over the next six months \u2013 would have been a grand coming-out party for Uber, and the city of Milan would have promoted it as an alternative to public transport. \u201cI was hoping the pressure of the numbers of people and foreign visitors would have encouraged a bit more openness,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re not there yet.\u201d Cities where Uber has run into trouble     Black cab and licensed taxi drivers protest against Uber on The Mall, London.

AmsterdamUber drivers have been blocked in by taxi drivers and one reported having his tyres slashed. A Dutch court banned peer-to-peer service uberPOP in December and some unlicensed drivers have since been fined. MadridAfter the Madrid taxi association complained about Uber, a judge ordered the company to stop operating in Spain because drivers were unauthorised and taking part in unfair competition. BrusselsUber is illegal in Brussels, and some of its drivers claim their cars have been vandalised. Brussels has announced plans to legalise Uber next year, but under strict regulation. ChengduFollowing raids in Guangzhou, Chinese police have visited Uber offices in Chengdu in a widening investigation into the company\u2019s operations in China, where authorities have banned drivers of private cars from offering app-based services. Montreal The Canadian province of Quebec and its largest city regard Uber\u2019s service as illegal and in a crackdown the city\u2019s taxi bureau seized 40 cars from drivers in the past few weeks.

Even fewer athletes have been so far ahead of their time that, two decades later, the global impact they made remains unsurpassed. As Jonah Lomu reaches his 40th birthday this week, the events of 1995 continue to be etched in the minds of those lucky enough to witness them. Happily Jonah is still around to celebrate Tuesday\u2019s milestone, the big man having being dragged dangerously low at times by the rare kidney disorder which necessitated a transplant in 2004. In those halcyon May and June days of 1995, lest we forget, he was as formidable a try-scoring presence as the union code has ever witnessed. Above my desk sits a card bearing the immortal words sent via fax by a New Zealand fan to the team\u2019s hotel in Johannesburg. \u201cRemember rugby is a team game \u2013 all 14 of you pass the ball to Jonah!\u201d Most people tend only to remember the human steamroller who flattened Mike Catt in Cape Town in 1995. They overlook the scarcely credible fact that he scored four tries in that semi-final alone to prompt the pithiest of verdicts \u2013 \u201cHe is a freak and the sooner he goes away the better\u201d \u2013 from England\u2019s defeated captain Will Carling. In all he scored seven in five games and still retains the all-time World Cup record of 15. Despite increasing health issues he contributed 37 tries in 63 Test appearances for New Zealand, raising rugby union\u2019s profile to unprecedented heights. All of which begs a few pertinent questions. Given rugby union turned professional that same year would the game have developed as it has done without the sudden re-invention of wings as 19 stone, 6ft 5in tall stormtroopers? Were Lomu to burst on to the scene now, would he be as absurdly dominant given the significant advances in fitness and conditioning levels? And, perhaps most relevant of all in a World Cup year, is there anyone else out there capable of springing from relative obscurity and leaving the same indelible mark on our imaginations? On the first count, someone somewhere would surely have decided at some point that sticking a giant on the wing was an idea worth pursuing with or without Lomu as a role model. Dominance-wise, it is also worth remembering that Lomu never actually won a World Cup winners\u2019 medal. That adoring All Black fan was wrong; even if you do possess one superhuman athlete a team still needs the intelligence and ability to find him some space occasionally. As for unearthing little-known youngsters genuinely worthy of the \u201cnew Lomu\u201d tag, the internet no longer makes it easy to keep rare talent a secret. The teenage Jonah had starred in the 1994 Hong Kong Sevens \u2013 take a look at YouTube, the footage is remarkable \u2013 but came into the World Cup having won just two relatively low-profile caps. Not many northern hemisphere countries seem inclined to take such a risk nowadays. Even if they were, social media can strip away a player\u2019s mystique with cruel speed. On the other hand, the conveyor belt of Pacific Island talent is still churning out exceptional ball carriers, the latest of whom neatly sums up the eligibility and club v country debates currently entangling the game. Taqele Naiyaravoro, a rugby league convert built on similar physical lines to Lomu, scored the type of individual try for the Waratahs last weekend that would make any talent scout sit up. As things stand the Fijian-born Naiyaravoro is wanted by Edinburgh for next season \u2013 but only if the Wallabies do not pick the 23-year-old first. At present he is also awaiting his Australian residency visa and is steadfastly keeping his options open. \u201cMate, if that\u2019s God\u2019s plan for me,\u201d was his opaque response when asked by the Sydney Morning Herald if declaring for the Wallabies was a possibility. The Sevens World Series circuit is also home to some sensational runners, not least Fiji\u2019s Semi Kunatani and the USA\u2019s Perry Baker who can cover 100m in 10 seconds. Both certainly possess the talent to illuminate any stadium. In terms of transfixing all-comers at a 15-a-side World Cup, however, Lomu remains in a world of his own. Happy 40th birthday, Jonah, and good luck to anyone looking to eclipse his towering legend.

Never before has it taken a boy from the endless summer of Honolulu to the dark days of die Erzgebirge, the Ore Mountains that separate the Germans from the Czechs.  Specifically, it\u2019s the town of Aue that Wood calls home right now. It has a population of well under 20,000 and yet also a team that came close to promotion to the Bundesliga a few years back. Mostly though, they can be found fighting to stay out of the third division, which is the battle they are in right now. So what is a promising young USMNT striker doing at a club like FC Erzgebirge Aue? In a strange twist of fate (and internal politics), Wood is trying to help them relegate the club he joined Aue from, 1860 Munich. Both teams are fighting to beat the drop \u2013 indeed they occupy the bottom two places in Bundesliga 2 at the moment \u2013 but the success of one could well be at the expense of the other. And it is looking like one of the best things that could have happened to Wood. \u201cI like to play in an environment where I feel welcomed, and the players get along and the people are working for each other. For me that\u2019s important, so I can play at my best. Everyone does that here.\u201d It\u2019s fair to say they aren\u2019t the best of friends at the moment, Wood and 1860, the club he moved across the world for at the age of just 14. His initial struggles were with the language and the culture; in recent times, they have been with the club itself, where he got little game time and felt he was dumped to the reserves for no reason. But did he really tell the coach to kiss him where the sun don\u2019t shine, as the Munich press has reported? \u201cNo, no, no. I did not say that,\u201d he responds, resolutely. \u201cI did not say that.\u201d What did happen, he says, was that he and a group of players stayed out on the training pitch to do some extra work one day. There was six of them out there, \u201cbut the coach just decided to really yell at me in front of everyone, and in front of the fans, for really no reason. \u201cHe wanted to yell at me, and I just told him, like, \u2018Really? You\u2019re really just going to yell at me because I\u2019m the youngest player?\u2019 All I said was, \u2018You just want to show your power, you know. Like, what\u2019s up with that?\u2019 I didn\u2019t cuss at him or anything.  \u201cAnd that\u2019s another thing I didn\u2019t like. It got out to the press, which it shouldn\u2019t have, and then they started telling lies about the whole story, as well. And I felt that was really messed up, because stuff like that, it happens, you know, and it should have stayed internal.  \u201cThey made a big deal of it for no reason. They told stories that I cussed at the coach, the biggest lies in the world. It\u2019s whatever. That coach got fired. I really don\u2019t care about that. I was laughing when he got fired to be honest. It\u2019s whatever, it happens.\u201d      Bobby Wood\u2019s Aue are battling relegation Photograph: Karina Hessland/Bongarts/Getty Images    It\u2019s turned out to be like the lancing of a boil. If J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann calls him up for June\u2019s friendlies in Amsterdam and Cologne, he might seem like a different player to the one who lined up against Chile. Wood is just the second Hawaiian to represent his country in the sport (a fact he was surprised to learn). The first was Brian Ching. For USMNT fans baying for more homegrown talent, he is a worrying sign. Not Wood himself, but what his position says about American grassroots development.  Here is an injury-plagued 22-year-old whose talents could soon be submerged into the third tier; yet if not for Klinsmann\u2019s relentless recruiting drive in these parts, he\u2019d be the only member of the USMNT cadre regularly playing in the top divisions here in Germany. The fallout with 1860 hasn\u2019t helped all parties, though it has been wonderful for Wood. And Aue. In eight games together, they have five wins, and he has three goals. That\u2019s as many as he scored (at this level) in all his years in Munich, and he is one reason their coach now believes they will drag themselves out of the drop zone. If they do, Wood stays put. If they don\u2019t, his coach at 1860 has said he would welcome the striker back. With the way the relegation battle is playing out, anything is possible. The bottom four sides have been the form teams of the past month, and the worst case scenario is that both Aue and 1860 go down. It would be a harsh blow for Wood, who is at last is getting a chance to show what he can do. He\u2019s philosophical about it. \u201cIt\u2019s slowly working out. I just have to stay healthy, and I think I can make my way through. Mentally, it\u2019s been tough, especially moving here at such a young age. But I did learn a lot about myself, and I\u2019m learning just to do my own thing now.  \u201cIf I want to make it big, I just have to bite through it.\u201d", "sentences": ["If J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann calls him up for June\u2019s friendlies in Amsterdam and Cologne, he might seem like a different player to the one who lined up against Chile."], "title": "USMNT's Bobby Wood interview: 'I didn't insult my coach but I laughed when he was fired'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/12/usmnts-bobby-wood-interview-i-didnt-insult-my-coach-but-i-laughed-when-he-was-fired", "tags": ["USA", "Football", "Sport", "US sports", "1860 Munich", "European club football"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-05-14T08:00:10Z", "article": "It is one year since the European Court of Justice ruled that citizens have the right to request that Google remove links to information about them if these are out of date, misreprentative or irrelevant. But some of the world\u2019s most expert academics claim that Google has not been transparent enough in how it is responding to requests for delisting, and 80 academics from around the world have written to the corporation demanding more transparency about its processes. Here is the full text of the open letter, also published on Medium today: What we seek Aggregate data about how Google is responding to the more than 250,000 requests to delist links, thought to contravene data protection laws, from name search results. We should know if the anecdotal evidence of Google\u2019s process is representative: What sort of information typically gets delisted (e.g., personal health) and what sort typically does not (e.g., about a public figure), in what proportions and in what countries?   Related: Google must be more open on 'right to be forgotten', academics warn in letter    Why it\u2019s important Google and other search engines have been enlisted to make decisions about the proper balance between personal privacy and access to information. The vast majority of these decisions face no public scrutiny, though they shape public discourse. What\u2019s more, the values at work in this process will/should inform information policy around the world. A fact-free debate about the RTBF is in no one\u2019s interest. Why Google Google is not the only search engine, but no other private entity or Data Protection Authority has processed anywhere near the same number of requests (most have dealt with several hundred at most). Google has by far the best data on the kinds of requests being made, the most developed guidelines for handling them, and the most say in balancing informational privacy with access in search. One year ago, the European Court of Justice, in Google Spain v AEPD and Mario Costeja Gonz\u00e1lez, determined that Google and other search engines must respond to users\u2019 requests under EU data protection law concerning search results on queries of their names. This has become known as the Right to Be Forgotten (RTBF) ruling. The undersigned have a range of views about the merits of the ruling. Some think it rightfully vindicates individual data protection/privacy interests. Others think it unduly burdens freedom of expression and information retrieval. Many think it depends on the facts. We all believe that implementation of the ruling should be much more transparent for at least two reasons: (1) the public should be able to find out how digital platforms exercise their tremendous power over readily accessible information; and (2) implementation of the ruling will affect the future of the RTBF in Europe and elsewhere, and will more generally inform global efforts to accommodate privacy rights with other interests in data flows. Google reports that it has received over 250,000 individual requests concerning 1 million URLs in the past year. It also reports that it has delisted from name search results just over 40% of the URLs that it has reviewed. In various venues, Google has shared some 40 examples of delisting requests granted and denied (including 22 examples on its website), and it has revealed the top sources of material requested to be delisted (amounting to less than 8% of total candidate URLs). Most of the examples surfaced more than six months ago, with minimal transparency since then. While Google\u2019s decisions will seem reasonable enough to most, in the absence of real information about how representative these are, the arguments about the validity and application of the RTBF are impossible to evaluate with rigour. Beyond anecdote, we know very little about what kind and quantity of information is being delisted from search results, what sources are being delisted and on what scale, what kinds of requests fail and in what proportion, and what are Google\u2019s guidelines in striking the balance between individual privacy and freedom of expression interests. The RTBF ruling addresses the delisting of links to personal information that is \u201cinaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant, or excessive for the purposes of data processing\u201d, and which holds no public interest. Both opponents and supporters of the RTBF are concerned about overreach. Because there is no formal involvement of original sources or public representatives in the decision-making process, there can be only incidental challenges to information that is delisted, and few safeguards for the public interest in information access. Data protection authorities seem content to rely on search engines\u2019 application of the ruling\u2019s balancing test, citing low appeal rates as evidence that the balance is being appropriately struck. Of course, this statistic reveals no such thing. So the sides do battle in a data vacuum, with little understanding of the facts \u2013 facts that could assist in developing reasonable solutions. Peter Fleischer, Google global privacy counsel, reportedly told the 5th European Data Protection Days on 4 May that, \u201cOver time, we are building a rich program of jurisprudence on the [RTBF] decision.\u201d (Bhatti, Bloomberg, 6 May). It is a jurisprudence built in the dark. For example, Mr. Fleischer is quoted as saying that the RTBF is \u201cabout true and legal content online, not defamation\u201d. This is an interpretation of the scope and meaning of the ruling that deserves much greater elaboration, substantiation, and discussion.  We are not the only ones who want more transparency. Google\u2019s own Advisory Council on the RTBF in February 2015 recommended more transparency, as did the Article 29 Working Party in November 2014. Both recommended that data controllers should be as transparent as possible by providing anonymised and aggregated statistics as well as the process and criteria used in delisting decisions. The benefits of such transparency extend to those who request that links be delisted, those who might make such requests, those who produce content that is or might be delisted, and the wider public who might or do access such material. Beyond this, transparency eases the burden on search engines by helping to shape implementation guidelines and revealing aspects of the governing legal framework that require clarification.  Naturally, there is some tension between transparency and the very privacy protection that the RTBF is meant to advance. The revelations that Google has made so far show that there is a way to steer clear of disclosure dangers. Indeed, the aggregate information that we seek threatens privacy far less than the scrubbed anecdotes that Google has already released, or the notifications that it is giving to webmasters registered with Google webmaster tools. The requested data is divorced from individual circumstances and requests. Here is what we think, at a minimum, should be disclosed  What we seek    Categories of RTBF requests/requesters that are excluded or presumptively excluded (e.g., alleged defamation, public figures) and how those categories are defined and assessed. Categories of RTBF requests/requesters that are accepted or presumptively accepted (e.g., health information, address or telephone number, intimate information, information older than a certain time) and how those categories are defined and assessed. Proportion of requests and successful delistings (in each case by % of requests and URLs) that concern categories including (taken from Google anecdotes): (a) victims of crime or tragedy; (b) health information; (c) address or telephone number; (d) intimate information or photos; (e) people incidentally mentioned in a news story; (f) information about subjects who are minors; (g) accusations for which the claimant was subsequently exonerated, acquitted, or not charged; and (h) political opinions no longer held. Breakdown of overall requests (by % of requests and URLs, each according to nation of origin) according to the WP29 Guidelines categories. To the extent that Google uses different categories, such as past crimes or sex life, a breakdown by those categories. Where requests fall into multiple categories, that complexity too can be reflected in the data.  Reasons for denial of delisting (by % of requests and URLs, each according to nation of origin). Where a decision rests on multiple grounds, that complexity too can be reflected in the data. Reasons for grant of delisting (by % of requests and URLs, each according to nation of origin). As above, multi-factored decisions can be reflected in the data. Categories of public figures denied delisting (e.g., public official, entertainer), including whether a Wikipedia presence is being used as a general proxy for status as a public figure. Source (e.g., professional media, social media, official public records) of material for delisted URLs by % and nation of origin (with top 5-10 sources of URLs in each category). Proportion of overall requests and successful delistings (each by % of requests and URLs, and with respect to both, according to nation of origin) concerning information first made available by the requestor (and, if so, (a) whether the information was posted directly by the requestor or by a third party, and (b) whether it is still within the requestor\u2019s control, such as on his/her own Facebook page). Proportion of requests (by % of requests and URLs) where the information is targeted to the requester\u2019s own geographic location (e.g., a Spanish newspaper reporting on a Spanish person about a Spanish auction). Proportion of searches for delisted pages that actually involve the requester\u2019s name (perhaps in the form of % of delisted URLs that garnered certain threshold percentages of traffic from name searches).  Proportion of delistings (by % of requests and URLs, each according to nation of origin) for which the original publisher or the relevant data protection authority participated in the decision.  Specification of (a) types of webmasters that are not notified by default (e.g., malicious porn sites); (b) proportion of delistings (by % of requests and URLs) where the webmaster additionally removes information or applies robots.txt at source; and (c) proportion of delistings (by % of requests and URLs) where the webmaster lodges an objection.    As of now, only about 1% of requesters denied delisting are appealing those decisions to national Data Protection Authorities. Webmasters are notified in more than a quarter of delisting cases (Bloomberg, May 6). They can appeal the decision to Google, and there is evidence that Google may revise its decision. In the remainder of cases, the entire process is silent and opaque, with very little public process or understanding of delisting. The ruling effectively enlisted Google into partnership with European states in striking a balance between individual privacy and public discourse interests. The public deserves to know how the governing jurisprudence is developing. We hope that Google, and all search engines subject to the ruling, will open up. Sincerely yours,   Ellen P.

The Last Leaves Falling by Sarah Benwell      One of my favourite 2015 debuts, Sarah Benwell\u2019s beautiful and heartbreaking book features Japanese teenager Sora who is diagnosed with ALS (known in the UK as motor neurone disease). Sora\u2019s story is about rising above the limitations imposed by his illness and finding strength in both the ancient wisdom of the Samurai and the current support of his two best friends. When Sora realises exactly what he has to do, and takes control of his life, he makes a decision that none of us would ever want to face.  2. Apple and Rain by Sarah Crossan Sometimes a turning point is a moment when a character knows what they have to do. Sometimes it is about outside events forcing decisions on them. In Sarah Crossan\u2019s beautiful Apple and Rain, it is about main character Apple finding that the fantasy life she has imagined she will have when her long lost mum comes back for her is not matched by the reality. When her mum finally does come back, she has brought something (or someone) with her that makes Apple question everything she\u2019s ever believed, and forces her to reassess her new life completely.       3. Two Boys Kissing by David Levithan This book is possibly my favourite LGBTQ book on the YA bookshelves right now. It is not so much about a turning point, but about all the turning points. The boy who hasn\u2019t come out to his parents but decides to do a record-breaking 32-hour kiss with his ex-boyfriend. The boy who can\u2019t connect with real people any more and makes a devastating decision after his parents discover his guilty secret. The parents who know they have to accept their child or lose him forever. The trans boy who is brave enough to bare his soul to his new love. The turning round and facing the bullies. This book has it all, and every single word of it is beautiful and heart-breaking and perfect. Read the first chapter of Two Boys Kissing 4. Boys Don\u2019t Cry by Malorie Blackman You don\u2019t get much more of a turning point than opening your front door and being handed a baby you never knew existed. Your baby. That\u2019s what happens to Dante in Malorie Blackman\u2019s wonderful book. But this story isn\u2019t only about Dante\u2019s struggle to come to terms with fatherhood. It\u2019s also about the horrific homophobia faced by his brother Adam, whose story is intertwined with Dante\u2019s. Emotional, intense and \u2013 as you would expect from a writer of this calibre \u2013 beautifully crafted, this is a book which I would give to everyone to read if I could. Boys might not cry, but this reader certainly did! 5. The Art of Being Normal by Lisa Williamson Another of my favourite debuts, Lisa Williamson\u2019s ground-breaking book features David Piper \u2013 the boy whose parents think is gay and who the bullies call a freak. Only his best friends know the truth \u2013 that he wants to be a girl. Running alongside David\u2019s narrative is Leo\u2019s \u2013 whose only wish is to be invisible. What the two teenagers have in common, and the turning point that brings their lives together and unites them in their bravery, is a moment that had me cheering from my seat. A fantastic book in the LGBTQ stable.      6. 7 Days by Eve Ainsworth Eve Ainsworth\u2019s gritty contemporary debut novel explores bullying from two sides of the story. To Jess, the beautiful and popular Kez is everything she wants to be. To Kez, Jess is everything she loathes \u2013 a victim. During the course of one week, events escalate rapidly \u2013 leading to a violent and shocking confrontation between the two girls which leaves Kez with a sudden and deadly realisation of what she has become. Kez\u2019s turning point begins the unravelling of her protective armour, while Jess\u2019s turning point leads to a growth in her own inner strength and a realisation that she is no longer a victim. Seven Days takes a bold line, showing \u2013 in a life-changing way \u2013 that bullying doesn\u2019t necessarily have just one victim. 7. All of the Above by James Dawson James Dawson\u2019s new YA book isn\u2019t out till later this year, but I was lucky enough to be given an early read of it. Cool, modern and witty, the book charts the life and loves of Toria, Nico and Polly \u2013 and explores the blurry edges of the lines between love and friendship. I\u2019m proud to be sharing the UK YA LGBTQ corner with James, and this book is a great addition to it. Toria\u2019s dawning realisation that things aren\u2019t exactly how she\u2019d thought makes her take a turn in her life that she had never expected or planned to take.  8. This is Not A Love Story by Keren David Keren David\u2019s This is Not a Love Story is a story about love, rather than a conventional romance. It\u2019s a book which asks questions about young love, what it is, how we find it, and, most of all, how we kid ourselves about what we want. New to Amsterdam, Kitty and Theo explore their own hearts as they discover their new city. Theo\u2019s turning point comes when someone shows him unexpected understanding and kindness, while for Kitty, the crucial twist in fate is far more painful.      9. The Knife that Killed Me by Anthony McGowan The Knife that Killed Me is a very dark, tense thriller, set in a tough inner city comprehensive. It\u2019s about the terrible consequences that follow on from the decision of narrator, 15-year old Paul Varderman, to carry a knife. The story has a feeling of tragic inevitability. As you\u2019re reading it, you\u2019re convinced you know who\u2019s going to die, and who\u2019s going to be doing the killing. But then McGowan suddenly pulls the rug from under you, and reveals that everything you thought you knew was wrong, and that a \u201cdeath\u201d can mean more than just a body lying in a desolate field. 10. Close Your Pretty Eyes by Sally Nicholls I am a long-standing fan of Sally Nicholls\u2019 books, and this is probably my favourite. Creepy and dark, the story charts the life of foster child Olivia, who begins the book in her 19th foster placement. The turning point for her is about realising that the destructive defensiveness which she has always used to protect herself might not be as powerful as a decision to open herself to the risks of being part of a family and allowing herself to be loved and cared for. Sometimes the bravest thing is admitting that we need others.      Liz Kessler is the author of a number of books for younger readers. Her first YA novel, Read Me Like a Book describes a year in the life of a 17-year-old girl, Ashleigh Walker, as she negotiates her final year at college. It is a turbulent year in which Ash undertakes her A-levels, falls in love with her English teacher, deals with her parents\u2019 divorce\u2026and comes out as gay.

But people are also funny, and as such, say funny things; principally to, and about each other. Thus have insults evolved, and the world is immeasurably the richer for them. When not preoccupied with themselves, or as part of caring about themselves, people also find time to care about other things, like politics, music and sport. As such, many of our favourite slights were born in these arenas: Disraeli informing Gladstone that he was \u201c\u2018inebriated with the exuberance of his own verbosity\u201d, say, or Eminem advising Everlast that \u201cI\u2019d hate me too if I was you\u201d \u2013 a line of similar genus and genius to our first selection. In September 1996, Ars\u00e8ne Wenger arrived in English football, and, being a sentient being in an open society, formed and voiced opinions about his environment \u2013 in particular, a fixture list that he felt favoured Manchester United. This was ill-received by the presiding demagogue, thinking and speaking the sole preserves of Alex Ferguson and his minions, and accordingly, Wenger was witheringly admonished via a ukipish dismissal of his credentials. Clearly, a migrant worker with recent experience of multiple cultures was incapable of making a salient point about the one he currently inhabited. Subsequently, everything proceeded as normal: Arsenal expired, Manchester United bumbled to the title with a record low points tally, Manchester United streaked clear the following season. Except, before its conclusion, United expired, and Arsenal powered to the title with an incredible 10 consecutive wins, then added the FA Cup too. Enmity intensified immediately afterwards, when, for the first time in the history of the English game, two great teams reached a concurrent peak. But after United shaded the next league and cup, the rivalry sagged because Arsenal did likewise; the next two winning margins were 18 and 10 points respectively. Wenger\u2019s protestation that it was difficult to sustain a challenge given the number of London derbies simply sounded like the desperate raving of the eternally overwhelmed. Then, in the summer of 2001, United refreshed their midfield and attack with Juan Sebastian V\u00e9ron and Ruud van Nistelrooy; at 8/11, they were shortest-price pre-season title favourites of the generation. But lozzing Jaap Stam for Laurent Blanc caused their defence to concede goals as quickly as they could be scored, and though they recovered through the winter, were left little margin for error. This was principally because, in the meantime, Arsenal exploded: Robert Pir\u00e8s settled, Freddie Ljungberg and Dennis Bergkamp bonded, and Thierry Henry thierryhenried. An unprecedented run-in of 13 straight wins mass-murdered them to a championship that, once again, became a double. In the Wilmslow shipyards, there was consternation. Despite Arsenal\u2019s post-Christmas record of W17, D3, L0, compared to United\u2019s W15, D2, L3, Fergie was unable to grit his soul and feign the usual magnanimity. \u201cThey are scrappers who rely on belligerence,\u201d he said of the country\u2019s best team. \u201cWe are the better team.\u201d Wenger might have left him there, marooned on the last vestige of the vanquished: imagining a subjective, arbitrary and moral standard to supersede the objective, official and factual standard that is a concluded league table. As if. Instead, he delivered a riposte of scrumptious snide and studied subtlety, forked tongue coated in caramel. On the face of it, \u201cEveryone thinks they have the prettiest wife at home\u201d is barely an insult at all, Wenger himself being a part of \u201ceveryone\u201d; \u2018Don\u2019t worry,\u2019 he seems to be saying with a resigned shake of the head. \u2018It\u2019s fine, we all do it \u2013 even me.\u2019 Except Wenger had the prettiest wife, and the prettiest concubine, right there resplendent in his trophy cabinet. Sure, the line still included him \u2013 it\u2019s just that he was right, as evidenced by the evidence. \u2018Do worry,\u2019 he\u2019s really saying with a patronising pat on the head. \u2018It\u2019s fine, you\u2019re an idiot, I am the best \u2013 and oh, by the way, have you ever wondered whether your missus is objectively attractive?\u2019 2) Craig Bellamy on John Terry, 2010 For many, the art of the insult \u2013 and it is an art \u2013 is workshopped in classroom and playground, venues in which nothing is unsayable. But, though techniques tend to be of the Brutalist school, they are not without sophistication: \u201ceveryone says you\u2019re a dick, and they\u2019re right, you are,\u201d is as beautifully crafted a formulation as exists, and one employed to devastating degree by Craig Bellamy. On 27 February 2010, Manchester City and their natty away shirts visited Stamford Bridge. In theory, the plan was to engage Chelsea in a game of association football; in practice, this was mandatorily subsumed by the overriding contest of NARRATIVE. A month earlier, the world had learned that JT: captain, leader, married, had conducted an affair with the ex-girlfriend of Wayne Bridge \u2013 a team-mate at the time. Bridge was upset by this, while Vanessa Perroncel quickly engaged the services of Max Clifford. Knowing, as they did, the finer details of the various relationships involved, the nation\u2019s sages determined to lecture Terry about morality and fidelity, his lack thereof profoundly pertinent to his ability to do his job as a footballer \u2013 as evidenced by his consistently superb performances. \u201cThere is now a strong belief among fans that Terry may have caused irreparable damage to England\u2019s chances of success at the World Cup in South Africa in June,\u201d calculated the Daily Mail. No sooner was the story allowed to break \u2013 of course, Terry attempted to injunct \u2013 than he responded in inevitably awful and brilliant fashion, will-powering in a late winner against Burnley. Then, at full-time, he celebrated by slapping the crest on his jersey, as if to say, \u2018you know, all that other stuff, that\u2019s irrelevant; I do everything for this, this is all that counts\u2019. And, in a way, he was right. By this time, Bridge had departed the Bridge. The archetypal half-decent English player available for obscene money to an altruistic oil baron, he signed for Mark Hughes\u2019s Manchester City in January 2009. Thirteen months later, City, fourth in the table, arrived at Chelsea, top of the table; the country settled down for a thriller. However, the country\u2019s hype-men decided that the country was actually agonising over whether Bridge would shake Terry\u2019s hand, during the pre-match proof that the Premier League is not the vicious corporatist sham it might sometimes seem, rather a bastion of the good, honest, old-fashioned English values that delivered monarchy and colony. He did not. Next, the nauseating distraction of a classic game. Goals from Frank Lampard and Carlos Tevez just before half-time were followed by another for Tevez and two for Bellamy, before Lampard\u2019s late penalty left a final score of 2-4. Interviewing City\u2019s scorers in the tunnel, Geoff Shreeves was understandably keen to revel in the superb entertainment and shocking result. \u201cHow much today were Manchester City galvanised by Wayne Bridge,\u201d he enquired of Tevez, in the way one might ask one\u2019s goldfish to pr\u00e9cis Kant\u2019s distinction between transcendent and transcendental. Naturally, Tevez mouthbreathed with stupefaction, laughed, and departed, leaving Bellamy to respond. \u201cI know what JT\u2019s like,\u201d he said. \u201cNothing surprises me about it, I think everyone in football knows what the guy\u2019s like.\u201d            Bellamy was described by Bobby Robson as the most truculent player he ever worked with, a man who played for so many clubs partly because they come in handy if ever you fancy whacking someone. Earlier that season, he  slapped a fan already restrained by four stewards, and, though he has since revealed a softer side, represented a scholarly voice when it came to the identification of a bad lot. So, he began from a personal perspective, inherent authority bolstered via the use of a nickname; he and Terry know one another. And, to further reinforce our belief in his testimony, he employs a tone of such casual certainty as to suggest a point so obvious as to scarcely need making. Bellamy was not surprised by what happened, oh no, and as such, neither should YOU be. But there\u2019s not even any need to take his word for it, because \u201ceveryone\u201d knows \u2013 and not just any old \u201ceveryone\u201d, either, but \u201ceveryone\u201d in the august, privileged world of Football. A world to which Bellamy is our guide and with which we, now his co-conspirators, reckon to be familiar, without ever quite being sure. So by playing on his expertise, he teases our imagination and aspiration, encouraging us to reminisce about the stories we\u2019ve heard and fantasise about those we haven\u2019t, our milieu the dressing room chatter of which we\u2019d love to be part. Imagine Dorothy Parker with the benefit of a classical Cardiff education! 3) Patrice Evra on Lilian Thuram, 2010     Lilian Thuram: shot down by Patrice Evra Photograph: Fred Dufour/AFP/Getty Images    Humming, coughing and gobbing, rudeness, disdain and intimidation; tatty tie, battered pumps and leather jacket, coffee, Regal and White Horse. Verily, there\u2019s no joy as intoxicating as that of a supply teacher. To a schoolkid. To international footballers \u2013 to world and European champion footballers \u2013 less so. So, when Raymond Domenech was appointed manager of France, eyebrows were plucked, on account of a largely undistinguished playing career followed by a mainly inauspicious managerial career. And, even worse, he went about like Claude le Clochard on a bad day; fine if you\u2019re Michel Platini, not if you\u2019re not. At the start of his term, France struggled out of their qualifying group for the 2006 World Cup, but thanks only to the eventual help of Zinedine Zidane, Lilian Thuram and Claude Mak\u00e9l\u00e9l\u00e9, coaxed and bullied out of international retirement. All continued to the finals in Germany, though Robert Pir\u00e8s was omitted from the squad \u2013 according to some, because he was a Scorpio. Though Domenech always denied that accusation, he was fond of astrology, and basing team selection on the signs of the Zodiac \u2013 ! \u2013 would have at least explained a peculiar decision, preferable to the silence that justified the exclusions of Ludovic Giuly and Philippe Mex\u00e8s. In Germany, draws with Switzerland and South Korea left France in trouble. But they beat Togo to escape the group, before, in the knockouts, Zidane dredged the dregs of his genius to conjure the wins over Spain, Brazil and Portugal that secured Domenech\u2019s position for a further cycle. France qualified for Euro 2008 second behind Italy, who then sealed their elimination at its group stages; they finished bottom of their group with one point from three games. This left Domenech with no option: on the pitch at full-time, what else could he do but ask his girlfriend to marry him, to her mortification and everyone else\u2019s aggravation? Still, though, he kept his job, expertly steering his team to the 2010 World Cup finals thanks to a play-off and a cheating of a majestically brazen hue. The draw then billeted them with Uruguay, Mexico and South Africa, while Domenech finalised a squad that could find no use for Karim Benzema or Samir Nasri. With the players already unhappy with the regime, defeat to Uruguay followed by a draw against Mexico sparked a ruckus between Domenech and Nicolas Anelka; Anelka was expelled from the squad the next day. Patrice Evra, the team captain, soon took exception, and a training ground row with Robert Duverne, the assistant manager, remained verbal only because Domenech intervened. So the players stalked back to the bus, lost their final game, and departed South Africa in humiliation. In France, there was both sympathy and fury. The squad had not rebelled against the manager because he was good; assuredly, he was not, and they were justifiably concerned about his effect on their careers \u2013 and, who knows, perhaps even the hopes and dreams of their countrymen, too. But, at the same time, they had also behaved like, er, mards, when they might simply have done their best. Five players were summoned to appear before the French Football Federation, and as the country discussed the situation, Thuram announced that Evra, responsible for a team that had awoken an underlying racism in French society, should never play for his country again. An impassioned extrovert, Evra was never going to absorb shade of that ilk for the sake of dignity; after all, there\u2019s not much to be found in being publicly rinsed, even less in letting it slide. So he didn\u2019t. \u201cI called him to ask for an explanation,\u201d he said. \u201cHe didn\u2019t respond. I then left him a strong message and he sent one back pretending he didn\u2019t understand. He is free to say what he wants, but he should have tried to have a chat with me first. In an interview later on he repeated his remarks and said that he had tried to call me and that I had not replied. This is false.\u201d \u201cLilian thinks he\u2019s the new coach, the president of the FFF and the president of France. He sullied my name without knowing what had happened. What we did in South Africa was serious. Why put oil on the fire? He said that Les Bleus are contributing to increasing racism. It is time Lilian stopped playing a role that isn\u2019t his to play.\u201d All fairly reasonable and standard \u2013 exposition, followed by a generic teacher\u2019s diss and an obvious observation that Thuram, already speaking from ignorance, was making absurd connections. But in the event, this was barely noticed, thanks to the surgical wonder of the deconstruction that followed. \u201cWalking around with books on slavery in glasses and a hat,\u201d he said, \u201cdoes not turn you into Malcolm X.\u201d Like so many great insults \u2013 \u201ccalzone with legs\u201d, say, or \u201clump of foul deformity\u201d - it is sneeringly, ruthlessly gratuitous in its skewering of appearance. But like only the very best, it parlays that into a searingly witty and original personal attack; looking like an idiot is one thing \u2013 after all, who doesn\u2019t \u2013 but going to trouble to not look like an idiot and looking like an epochal idiot is something else entirely. More profoundly, though, Evra is saying that Thuram\u2019s appearance forms part of an attempt to construct an image, his attempts so to do transparent, facile and vacuous \u2013 the precise opposite of the intended effect. All this time, Thuram thought himself serious about something serious, but in confusing the superficial with the substantial, he revealed a phoney, a fraud, a spoofer and a fake; a joke. Basically a smarter version of 2Pac telling Biggie \u201cYou claim to be a player, but I fucked your wife\u201d, it\u2019s hard to conceive of a better insult. 4) Roy Keane to Mick McCarthy, 2002     Mick McCarthy (right) and Roy Keane during a World Cup training session in Saipan, 2002. Photograph: Kirsty Wigglesworth/PA    Though Roy Keane is celebrated principally for his startlingly consistency at club level, arguably his finest performances came for his country. Not since Diego Maradona has one man done so much to elevate those around him. To qualify for the 2002 World Cup, Ireland had to escape a group that included Holland and Portugal; that they did so was thanks largely to Keane\u2019s ability to subjugate proceedings to the force of his talent and will. Their campaign began in Amsterdam, with a 2-2 draw \u2013 a more than decent result. But with 20 minutes remaining, Ireland had been two goals ahead, and talking after the game, Keane set the tone for those that remained: \u201cWe have to start giving ourselves a bit more credit and realise that we have got some good players,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sick to death of this old saying that the Irish will have a good time no matter what the result. I think we have got to aim a little higher. We\u2019ve got to win matches.\u201d They responded with another draw, but in Lisbon, backed up by wins at home to Estonia and away in Cyprus, where Keane dragged the team to victory, also opening and closing the scoring. Next, Andorra were beaten twice, before another Keane goal and performance gave Ireland the advantage when Portugal visited, the match eventually finishing 1-1. Then came the crucial tie at home to Holland, his dominance underpinning a 1-0 win, before he scored the final goal in the final game to complete a freakish set of contributions, unbelievable in all but fact, and earning Ireland a play-off against Iran. They won the first leg 2-0 and lost the second 1-0 \u2013 without Keane, absent injured. Ireland were through to the World Cup finals. But qualification was not solely down to one man; the manager, Mick McCarthy, was instrumental in cajoling the maximum from less celebrated players, even if perhaps he was lax in contriving to be not got on with by his captain. It is true that Keane was not always easy, and also that there was previous from when the two were team-mates. \u201cCall yourself a professional?\u201d chided McCarthy, after Keane\u2019s hangover caused a team coach to wait. \u201cCall what you\u2019ve got a first touch?\u201d corruscated back the rejoinder. Keane\u2019s antipathy towards McCarthy appeared to be captured by a photo taken at full-time of the decisive Holland game, McCarthy leaning over to shake hands as Keane walked off the pitch. Already past him, Keane neither turned nor looked, thrusting back an arm to grasp fingers rather than palm, face set somewhere between disregard and disgust. Quite what happened when Ireland travelled to Saipan for their World Cup preparation is hard to discern for sure, but what is not in doubt is Keane\u2019s vocal displeasure as to the arrangements. Various conflicts ensued, until, eventually, McCarthy called him out in front of the squad \u2013 either as a last resort, or to provide him the rope with which he would hang himself. Keane being Keane, he deliberately did exactly that \u2013 but not before he\u2019d sliced, diced and iced McCarthy. Opening with some yeah, aiyo, uh-uh, check it scat which took the form of \u201cyou\u2019re a fucking wanker\u201d, he then spat a rhythmic, anaphoric masterpiece of which Eminem, his twin brother from another mother, would be proud. Though temper was lost, focus remained, and the staggering purity of his contempt revelated a crowd already confident in its conception. \u201cI didn\u2019t rate you as a player, I don\u2019t rate you as a manager, I don\u2019t rate you as a person.\u201d Despite Keane\u2019s frequent depiction as a lunatic, these were not mindless rantings, but coherent thoughts, honed, refined, ordered and sharpened through a period of a years and body of evidence. Delivered face-to-face and in public, neither refuge nor validation was sought in the nebulous \u201ceveryone\u201d of Wenger and Bellamy, the source of wisdom \u201cI\u201d, \u201cI\u201d and \u201cI\u201d; Keane was speaking on his behalf alone, because what other behalves were there? The best sentences, the best punchlines and the best one-liners are all delivered in as few words as possible, but even so, this is a savage economy; 21 words is all that it took to comprehensively demolish all that McCarthy thought he was. Compared to Keane, he\u2019d been no sort of player, and decent managers control decent players by virtue of being decent men; what had he left? Keane being Keane, that wasn\u2019t it \u2013 he wasn\u2019t stepping down until he was done stepping to, freewheeling and freestyling with glorious, gratuitous abandon. \u201cYou\u2019re a fucking wanker and you can stick your World Cup up your arse,\u201d he posited. \u201cI\u2019ve got no respect for you. The only reason I have any dealings with you is that somehow you are the manager of my country! You can stick it up your bollocks.\u201d In the end, all present parties lost out. Ireland and McCarthy had to do without their best, most influential player \u2013 upon whom they could\u2019ve relied, at the very least, to score a penalty in a shoot-out. Keane, meanwhile, missed the World Cup of his peak years, though was left to console himself with a rich linguistic legacy: \u201cSaipan, verb. To mercilessly and publicly demolish someone with venom, \u00e9lan and consummate skill. \u2018Bejaysus, Roy saipanned the everloving bejaysus out of Mick there! I\u2019m glad that wasn\u2019t me!\u2019\u201d 5) Steve Collins to Chris Eubank, 1995 Chris Eubank was the most interesting and thrilling British sportsman of his generation, charismatic, skilful and original both inside and outside the ring. His persona \u2013 he\u2019d say his personality \u2013 was unique in the fight game, a dandyish riff on the obligatory macho swagger that underlined an unshakeable confidence. Because of this, Eubank was no stranger to disputation. His epochal fights with Nigel Benn and Michael Watson were preceded by vitriol and rancour, while his win over Dan Sherry came when he threw a backheader as the two returned to their corners at the end of a round. Sherry collapsed and could not continue, but even after a two-point deduction, Eubank was far enough ahead on the scorecards to win anyway. By the time he was matched with Steve Collins, his record was a spectacular 41-0-2, and as such, he was a strong favourite to retain his title. Six weeks out from the fight, the two met in Dublin for a press conference \u2013 not exactly to Eubank\u2019s taste, given that he was the champion, but no big deal. Even when Collins turned up an hour-and-a-half late, Eubank was sanguine \u2013 \u201cIt\u2019s just a trick, no problem. You are where you are and I am who I am\u201d, he remembers thinking with typical clarity and composure. Collins then proceeded to conduct his interview in Gaelic, but again, Eubank was unperturbed, easily able to rationalise the situation. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he told himself, \u201cbecause when the referee says \u2018box\u2019 there is only one way to go\u201d. Next, Collins switched to English to compliment Eubank on his achievements \u2013 hardly likely to faze someone so savvy. \u201cWhatever you say, you are still Steve Collins,\u201d recited the internal voice. Perhaps so, but he knew Eubank far better than Eubank knew him \u2013 and, in one aspect, better than Eubank knew himself. Because, out of nowhere, he first championed his own financial contribution to the wider Irish cause, then accused Eubank of \u201cforgetting his African roots\u201d. \u201cHe is of African origin and seems to have forgotten that,\u201d the audience were informed, \u201cinstead he pretends to be an Englishman\u201d \u2013 and via a manner and image that epitomised \u201cEnglish uppishness\u201d. Eubank duly lost it. He informed the Lord Mayor that he could \u201cfuck his city\u201d, and Collins that it was now \u201ckill or be killed\u201d \u2013 telling words from a man who, in the aftermath of the second Watson bout, rode out points decisions, understandably unwilling to unload. Then, at the weigh-in, Collins revealed that he had been working with a hypnotist, and would be entranced before the fight in order to take his powers of focus and endurance beyond the normal limits. Again, Eubank was spooked, refusing to compete and only relenting the night before the contest, during which he again missed the chance to finish, eventually finding himself on the wrong side of the scorecards to lose his belt and unbeaten record. History recorded the hypnotism disquiet as the principle cause of his defeat, but Eubank is adamant to the contrary. \u201cI lost the fight at that moment,\u201d he recalls of Collins\u2019s press conference performance. \u201cThe fight was just a formality. I\u2019d lost it at that moment. There were so many things to answer; I couldn\u2019t talk to the tabloids because they want me to talk in soundbites, yet he asked me what do I do for the Africans and I didn\u2019t even know where my ancestors are from.\u201d Or, put another way, where Evra ridiculed a central plank of Thuram\u2019s identity, Collins made Eubank doubt the elemental axioms of his \u2013 not something he needed to do before the pair engaged in a fistfight, let alone one for a world title. Quite whether Collins deems his racism \u2013 because, deliberate or not, like it or not, that\u2019s what it was \u2013 as worth the belt, only he knows. 6) Terry Neill to A. Player, at some point The intense nature of team sport \u2013 lots of bodies, lots of emotion and lots of adrenaline, all of the time \u2013 breeds a familiarity and wit which inspires an environment different to that in other walks of life. Footballers live a hyperreal existence, and accordingly, there exist untold examples of exceptional, exhibition rudeness, many of them famous. So, here\u2019s one that\u2019s not. One morning during his time as manager of Arsenal, Terry Neill called across the pitch to one of his charges: \u201cYou - every day in training you play worse than the day before.

Their conclusion? It\u2019s a draw. By collating almost every twin study across the world from the past 50 years, researchers determined that the average variation for human traits and disease is 49% due to genetic factors and 51% due to environmental factors. University of Queensland researcher Beben Benyamin from the Queensland Brain Institute collaborated with researchers at VU University of Amsterdam to collate 2,748 studies involving more than 14.5 million pairs of twins. \u201cTwin studies have been conducted for more than 50 years but there is still some debate in terms of how much the variation is due to genetic or environmental factors,\u201d Benyamin said. He said the study showed the conversation should move away from nature versus nature, instead looking at how the two work together. \u201cBoth are important sources of variation between individuals,\u201d he said. While the studies averaged an almost even split between nature and nurture, there was wide variation within the 17,800 separate traits and diseases examined by the studies. For example, the risk for bipolar disorder was found to be 68% due to genetics and only 32% due to environmental factors. Weight maintenance was 63% due to genetics and 37% due to environmental factors. In contrast, risk for eating disorders was found to be 40% genetic and 60% environmental, whereas the risk for mental and behavioural disorders due to use of alcohol was 41% genetic and 59% environmental.  Benyamin said in psychiatric, ophthalmological and skeletal traits, genetic factors were a larger influence than environmental factors. But for social values and attitudes it was the other way around.  However there was no single trait in which the contribution of genetic factors was zero, Benyamin said. \u201cGenetics contribute to all traits \u2013 the difference is, by how much.\u201d The studies were published between 1958 and 2012 and used \u201cclassical twin design\u201d which compared the similarities of identical twins who share all their genes to those of non-identical twins who only share half their genes. Traits that correlated more closely in non-identical twins compared with identical twins indicated a greater influence of environmental factors.

Based on what\u2019s called a \u201ccandle-flame standard,\u201d it requires that items not ignite when they come into contact with a candle flame. Blum, a vocal opponent of flame-retardant chemicals in consumer products, thinks using flame retardants on the outer casings of electronics is unnecessary and puts consumers\u2019 health at risk. Consumers are often unaware of all the flame-retardant chemicals in and on electronics. While flaming laptops and even iPods \u2013 and recalls from manufacturers such as Dell, Apple, Lenovo, Toshiba and, more recently, Sony over fire safety fears \u2013 might help make the case for coating circuit boards with flame retardants, fierce debate is raging over whether they are necessary on the external plastic casings of items like televisions, stereos, computers, video game consoles and cellphones. While public health advocates are fighting to reduce the use of flame retardants in electronics, flame retardant manufacturers routinely recommend international standards that would increase use of the chemicals across all types of electronic products. One such standard was recently defeated by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), an international industry standards group that sets voluntary standards for the electronics industry. But another is up for a vote this summer by both the IEC and the European standards commission (CENELEC). If it passes, Green Science Policy Institute research estimates it could increase the use of flame retardants in electronics by hundreds of thousands of tons. Companies are not required to disclose which chemical flame retardants they use, or how much, so it\u2019s unclear how much is used in electronics today. But 816m pounds (roughly 370,000 metric tons) of the stuff is sold in the US annually, for use primarily in the construction, electronics, automotive and aerospace industries.  \u201cWe think coating plastic casings is a completely unnecessary use of these chemicals, and it\u2019s one that directly impacts consumers,\u201d says Simona Balan, who heads the electronics standards initiatives for the Green Science Policy Institute.   Related: Quest to eliminate chemical flame retardants from Californian homes is far from over, experts say    From 2002 to 2013, the flame retardants most commonly used in electronics, polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), were banned or phased out in Europe and the US after researchers linked the compounds to neurotoxic effects and hormone disruption. Because electronics manufacturers do not disclose which flame retardants they use, scientists have only recently ferretted out the chemicals that have replaced PBDEs by analyzing currently available electronics. Ana Mar\u00eda Ballesteros-G\u00f3mez, an analytical environmental chemist at VU University Amsterdam, studied 13 products made since the phaseout and found one common flame-retardant chemical in all of them: a new, triazine-based brominated flame retardant that appears to have replaced polybrominated flame retardants. Although neither the US nor the European Union have declared this new compound toxic, researchers caution that it is very similar in structure to PBDEs and thus warrants further study. Blum has been pushing for regulation of the entire class of brominated flame retardants to avoid this sort of substitution of one, banned chemical, with another of similar structure that likely carries similar health risks. Two of the more commonly used flame retardants \u2013 tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA) and tetrachlorobisphenol A (TCBPA), chemical cousins to bisphenol A (BPA) \u2013 are used internally on circuit boards and externally on plastic casings, and were recently deemed to be obesogens \u2013 which disrupt endocrines and promote obesity \u2013 by University of Houston researchers. According to the study, about 150,000 tons of TBBPA and 10,000 tons of TCBPA are produced every year. Study author Maria Bondesson found that zebra fish exposed to doses of the chemicals for eight days developed more fat cells and were chubbier than those not exposed, despite a high-cholesterol diet for both groups. The dosed fish also remained fatter a month after exposure. While the fish were exposed to higher doses than humans commonly would be, Bondesson, a research assistant professor of biology and biochemistry, said the size of the dosage was balanced out by the exposure time. According to the Bromine Science and Environmental Forum, however, TBBPA have no health impacts on humans. Its fact sheet on the chemical states: \u201cEuropean Union studies twice have shown that exposure to TBBPA from consumer products is insignificant, or not detectable, depending on the application.\u201d Roughly a dozen flame-retardant chemicals are commonly used in electronics, according to the American Chemical Society. According to the North American Flame Retardant Alliance, part of the American Chemistry Council, all of them are safe. \u201cConsumers should know that flame retardants, like other chemicals, are subject to review by the Environmental Protection Agency and other regulatory bodies for safety,\u201d the Alliance wrote in a recent statement about proposals to reduce the use of flame-retardant chemicals in various products. \u201cFlame retardants have been scientifically proven to help stop or slow the spread of fire, and they help save lives. NAFRA believes in strengthening fire safety and supports the use of flame retardants in those products where the chemistries can provide an important, added layer of protection.\u201d But while the chemicals are evaluated for safety, electronics manufacturers do not have to disclose which chemicals they use or how much of any one chemical, which public health advocates say makes it difficult to tell whether the chemicals are being used according to safety limits. Both the European Union and the US have regulations governing materials used in the components of electronics, but there\u2019s currently very little regulation of any chemicals coating those components. Since the internal circuit boards of electronic devices pose a real fire danger, there\u2019s little desire within the industry to reduce the amount used, even on external casings. With little government or corporate incentive, Blum and Balan are focusing on two issues: defeating standards that would require the use of more flame-retardant chemicals, and raising consumer awareness \u2013 both of which are likely to be long battles. \u201cIt took years to develop consumer awareness around flame retardants in furniture, and I don\u2019t think most people know now that their TV cases contain flame retardants, too,\u201d Blum says.

Increasing numbers share their homes (Airbnb), cars (Relayrides) and rides (BlaBlaCar), and people are also now sharing boats, tools, gardens, pets and clothes.  This week in Paris entrepreneurs, innovators, regulators and academics will come together at OuiShare Fest, a major three day celebration of the new sharing economy. But the sharing economy is controversial, because it can lead to more precarious jobs and induce unfair competition. Many of its practices are illegal in some jurisdictions. We believe that smart regulation can solve many of these current controversies. However, we first need to understand what the sharing economy is - and is not.    Related: Why the sharing economy could be the internet\u2019s most divisive revolution yet    Defining the sharing economy Discussions about the sharing economy lack clear definitions. This bogs public debate down in platitudes and slogans, voiced by both proponents (\u201cyou cannot stop innovation\u201d) and opponents (\u201cthis isn\u2019t capitalism, it\u2019s worse\u201d). Two of us have previously defined the sharing economy as consumers granting each other temporary access to under-utilised physical assets (\u201cidle capacity\u201d), possibly for money. By parsing this definition into three elements, we can clearly distinguish the sharing economy from other economic forms.   Sharing is about consumer-to-consumer (C2C) platforms and not about renting or leasing a good from a company (business-to-consumer). In the latter case we would speak of product-service economy, where a consumer gains access to a product whilst the service provider retains ownership. An example is car-rental (see Figure 1). Sharing is about consumers providing each other temporary access to a good, and not about the transfer of ownership of the good. Thus, the sharing economy does not include the second-hand economy, in which goods are sold or given away between consumers (as occurs on online platforms such as Ebay or Facebook). Sharing is about more efficient use of physical assets and not about private individuals delivering each other a service. After all, physical goods can go unused, but people cannot. internet platforms that bring consumers together to provide each other with services represent the on-demand economy. An example of such a platform is Taskrabbit, through which you can hire people to carry out work around the house.       Figure 1 - The sharing economy and other related economic forms     Take the example of a drill. Consumers can avoid buying a new drill by using one out of the four platforms: you can buy a second-hand drill from an individual (Ebay), you can rent a drill from a company (Home Depot), you can hire someone on-demand to drill the hole in your wall (Taskrabbit), or you can ask an individual to share a drill (Peerby). For cars, the same logic applies. You can buy a second-hand car using a site (Ebay), you can rent a car at a car-rental company (Car2Go), you can hire on-demand an individual to drive you (UberX), or you can rent a car from a private individual (Relayrides). Increasing criticism There is little doubt that the sharing economy can make a contribution to a more sustainable economy. While sharing used to be limited to a small circle of family and friends, the internet platforms allow us to share with anyone in society. This means that physical assets can be used more efficiently, and less energy and materials are needed in our economy. At the same time, the sharing economy has come under fire. Critics have pointed to undesirable effects, such as platform monopolies, privacy violations, exploitation of labour, and unfair competition. Our scheme can be used to place the various criticisms in the context in which they engage. The first two critiques (monopoly, privacy) are not specific to the sharing economy, but are problems associated with all sorts of internet-based businesses, including search engines (Google), social media (Facebook) and data storage (Dropbox). All platforms that enable interactions between people are characterized by network effects: the more people participate, the more attractive it becomes for others to join. For this reason, monopolies emerge and privacy-sensitive information gets concentrated in the hands of the businesses concerned. Concerning new forms of exploitation, many point to the increased flexibility and precariousness of work for freelancers who work for a platform (for example, UberX drivers). This criticism applies to the on-demand economy and not to the sharing economy as we have defined it. The last criticism is that of unfair competition between the new platforms and existing businesses. Individuals providing their goods or services to others are competing with existing providers but are not necessarily bound by the same rules and regulations. Despite growing criticism, most platforms don\u2019t seem eager to take the responsibility and to respect regulations. Notably, Uber has continued offering UberX despite court bans in various countries, and Airbnb only barely cooperates with municipalities in their aim to collect taxes and to help combat illegal hotels. The need for smart regulation Regulation will determine whether businesses like Uber and Airbnb will be integrated into the sharing economy or not. An illustration is the regulatory process that the Dutch municipality of Amsterdam has initiated with Airbnb. The municipality wants to ensure that people only occasionally rent out their house whilst away (sharing economy), rather than run a permanent, unregulated hotel (not sharing economy). It has chosen to allow its residents to rent out their homes for up to 60 days per year. Customers are also supposed to pay tourist tax via Airbnb, although its enforcement leaves much to be desired (not least because Airbnb does not want to share its data with the municipality). The philosophy of the policy is important here: it is trying to regulate the rental of homes in such a way that it becomes part of the sharing economy as previously defined. Without this regulation, Airbnb would create an incentive for illegal renting with negative consequences for the local residents (higher rents, nuisance and speculation). In the case of Uber, regulation is still largely lacking. Many options for regulating UberX are possible. The debate tends however to be narrowly focused on what requirements UberX drivers must meet compared with regular drivers - that is on regulating Uber as a provider of taxi services. But where a company like Uber presents itself so prominently as a \u201csharing\u201d service, regulators could encourage the company to organize its services as such. In Uber\u2019s case, that would mean doing away with the on-demand taxi model it has now and becoming a supply-driven ridesharing platform such as BlaBlaCar. On this type of platform, drivers post trips that they are going to make anyway, and other people can join these rides.  The risk of monopoly in the sharing economy is a real one. As with any other market, regulations are required to ensure sufficient competition between platforms. The key here is to empower users vis-\u00e0-vis the platform. For example, new rules are needed to let users switch easily between platforms, and to take with them their personal reviews and ratings from one platform to the other. This stops users from getting locked in in one platform which can then extract most of the value generated by platform interactions and transactions. Most of all, the ownership of data generated by users through use of sharing platforms should be a major issue of regulatory concern.

The chancellor used his first speech of the new government to promise devolution to cities, but with one crucial condition \u2013 they must elect a mayor. Greater Manchester is to be the blueprint, as part of Osborne\u2019s plan to create a \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d to rival the economic prowess of London. It will elect a mayor in 2017. And of course, the capital will also be gearing up for its mayoral election next May. Already, candidates for the next mayor have started to come forward with visions of what London should look like. But a group of citizens have got their own ideas \u2013 and they want them in the manifestos.   Related: George Osborne offers devolution route to cities with elected mayor    The campaign has already begun, with today the deadline for applications to become Labour\u2019s mayoral candidate. As we went to press, Diane Abbott, Tessa Jowell, Christian Wolmar, David Lammy and Sadiq Khan had declared. Policing and crime commissioner Stephen Greenhalgh has announced he will bid for the Conservative nomination, while the other parties have yet to begin their nominations process. But disappointment and a perceived lack of ambition shown by outgoing mayor Boris Johnson and his predecessor, Ken Livingstone, has led to the creation of a grassroots effort to get the ideas of Londoners on to the manifestos of the new round of candidates. Since November 2013, more than 1,000 people have been part of Changing London, a project to crowdsource ideas for London\u2019s next mayor. Entirely coordinated by volunteers, the idea first occurred to David Robinson, an east Londoner and founder of charity Community Links, in the summer of 2013. A lifelong community worker and Labour party member, he became frustrated by speculation about candidates for the post. \u201cThis seemed to me to be far too early to be talking about who, when we should have been be talking about what,\u201d he says. \u201cThe \u2018world\u2019s most competitive city\u2019 is not an aspiration with which many can identify.\u201d Robinson and policy researcher Will Horwitz, who collaborated on the project, invited Londoners to create a vision for the capital. They encouraged contributors to bring solutions, not problems, and to leave behind ideas that required a heavy cash injection. The home of the project was an online blog, where any Londoner was invited to submit an idea. Social media was crucial for finding contributors, as well as coverage in the press and \u201cold-fashioned word of mouth.\u201d Robinson and Horwitz gathered the ideas together last summer into a series of \u201cLondon papers\u201d, debated at a number of consultation events and published as a book on Monday. Robinson and Horwitz believe that both Johnson and Livingstone have missed an opportunity. They don\u2019t say the mayors lacked ideas; indeed they point to Boris Johnson\u2019s Vision 2020 as \u201cexpansive and comprehensive.\u201d \u201cWe found plenty to support but we still have a fundamental problem with Vision 2020. We didn\u2019t think of it.\u201d Central to the project is Robinson\u2019s belief that policy should be developed from the ground up \u2013 that if the policy-making process starts with citizens, rather than politicians, it can better reflect their experiences and draw in \u201cthe passion and creativity of people who are otherwise quite docile in the democratic process\u201d. \u201cManifestos are largely dreamt up behind closed doors with the occasional consultation event.\u201d says Horwitz. \u201cWe wanted to start with a blank sheet and see where it leads.\u201d Yet Robinson is clear that Changing London is neither a policy document nor a manifesto. Run entirely by volunteers on minimal resources, he says that although they would like to see similar projects run elsewhere, it does require more sophisticated research in order to be truly representative. Changing London has produced not one vision, but five. Each has a different focus \u2013 children, neighbourhoods, inequality, democracy and health \u2013 and is packed with ideas. Some are predictable: there are calls for stronger unions, measures to cap high pay and safer cycling routes. But others surface that you would be hard-pressed to find in any political manifesto or thinktank report. One such idea is for \u201cplay streets\u201d, closed off for children. It was submitted by hospice worker Sally Muylders and comes from her own memories of playing out as a child: \u201cFor us it was fresh air, friends, games. For our parents it was a community, an excuse to chat, a sense of shared responsibility. Now children don\u2019t play in the streets and that sense of community is often gone.\u201d         A campaign fought by children in Amsterdam for a play street in 1972    Muylders points to Amsterdam, where children ran a successful campaign for a permanent play street and to those in Bristol and Hackney in east London. Other contributors called for ideas that prioritise the needs of children and make London \u201cthe best place in the world to grow up\u201d. They call for advertising to be banned near schools, for the return of the Child Trust Fund and for \u201ca cultural guarantee\u201d: a list of experiences with the capital\u2019s arts scene, from seeing a play to writing with an author, that all children would have to complete as part of their schooling. A group of 30 children aged six to 11 from schools in Newham participated in a focus group. Most struggled to point to London on a map of the UK, but they had ideas \u2013 from improving the provision of sweet shops to increasing public transport. \u201cWhy can\u2019t London be more like Sunderland?\u201d asked another contributor, lamenting the rising social isolation in the capital. Robinson is passionate that the project is not just a catalogue of ideas but is about the process as much as the product. \u201cPeople who have experience of an issue are best placed to advise on how it might best be resolved. We need to draw that wisdom into the policy-making process \u2013 not just in London, but all across the UK,\u201d says Robinson. Much of Changing London has been inspired by mayors around the world. These include Calgary\u2019s Naheed Nenshi, a Muslim born to South African immigrants, who was elected mayor of one of Canada\u2019s largest and most conservative cities in 2010\u2013 despite being at only 8% in the polls six weeks before the election.     Anne Hidalgo, the mayor of Paris, who allowed citizens to decide how \u20ac20m of public money was spent. Photograph: Benoit Tessier/Reuters    Nenshi\u2019s promise was to deliver \u201cpolitics in full sentences\u201d, to involve voters involved in complex discussions and empower them to create their own ideas for change. During his campaign, supporters hosted Nenshi at coffee parties in their homes to discuss detailed ideas. Once he assumed office, he launched three things for Calgary, inviting citizens to create three ideas for their community. It went viral and three years later he was re-elected with three-quarters of the popular vote. Many other mayors have taken an outward-looking approach to their role. San Antonio\u2019s former mayor Julian Castro asked voters to contribute ideas at large-scale events before setting up a charity to help them be realised. Bogota\u2019s former mayor Antanas Mockus asked citizens to pay a 10% voluntary tax and 63,000 obliged. Oklahoma\u2019s overweight mayor Mick Cornett took his diet public, asking the city\u2019s residents to join him on a weight loss campaign to lose a collective one million pounds. In Paris, mayor Anne Hidalgo gave citizens the opportunity to vote on how \u20ac20m for 2014-15 \u2013 5% of the city\u2019s investment budget \u2013 was spent; they could choose from pop-up swimming pools to mobile rubbish collection points. But does an outward-facing mayor make for a more effective way of running a city? Osborne believes so. His plan \u2013 to be laid out in full in the Queen\u2019s speech next week \u2013 is to devolve powers for local transport, housing, skills and healthcare to groups of cities, starting with Greater Manchester in 2017. In return, local authorities must be prepared to work together as combined authorities and act under an elected, executive mayor. In the UK, the mayoral model was established in 2000 with London\u2019s first election and the Local Government Act, which empowered all councils to switch to the new model. There are now 17 directly elected mayors, all in England. But in a series of referendums in 2012, voters in nine cities (Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle, Nottingham, Sheffield, Wakefield, Coventry, Leeds and Bradford) rejected the model, while Bristol and Salford voted for it. \u201cEngland has ended up with one of the most centralised governments in the world,\u201d says Wyn Grant in the Warwick 2012 commission on elected mayors and city leadership .\u201cThat seems to have demobilised the electorate in many localities and one of the underlying thrusts of the localism agenda is to reinvigorate the local body politic by giving power to the elected mayors.\u201d However, the system can be unpopular with city councillors, such as the leader of Plymouth council, Tudor Evans, who argues that the local council often has a better understanding of local needs and that \u201cthere is no word about city or county regions.\u201d   Related: The Guardian view on elected mayors | editorial    Others fear that smaller cities and towns will be swallowed up by bigger cities and that Osborne\u2019s plans leaves little opportunity for rural regions that would struggle to come up with an elected mayor that had legitimacy. But, says researcher Clare Holt, \u201cif elected mayors are going to be the future, cities are a good place to start,\u201d pointing out that in Manchester, the mayor represents greater Manchester, not just the city. George Ferguson, the mayor of Bristol \u2013 another city that Changing London draws inspiration from \u2013 says that the model has been \u201ctransformational\u201d for Bristol and has led to greater community engagement. \u201cIt has much more authority because the mayor is elected by citizens across the city rather than appointed by the council. It doesn\u2019t mean that everybody loves me \u2013 I\u2019m probably Marmite, but at least people associate change with me.\u201d According to a report by the universities of Bristol and the West of England, in 2012, 24% of people said the city had visible leadership. By 2014 the figure rose to 69%. Among civic leaders in the community, voluntary and business sectors, it soared to 97%. Critics suggest that the system affords mayors too much power and encourages egocentric candidates \u2013 in Birmingham, the no campaign was called \u201cVote no to a power freak\u201d. Jenny Jones, the Green candidate for London mayor in 2012, remarked at a hustings for that election that the room was \u201cfull of testosterone\u201d. Of the 17 areas that currently have elected mayors, only four are women. Lutfur Rahman, the former mayor of Tower Hamlets, was recently found guilty of multiple corruption charges. In 2013, a Lord Ashcroft poll showed that Boris Johnson is the most recognisable politician in the country after the prime minister. Tom Gash, from the Institute for Government, says: \u201cIn areas where there is likely to be single party dominance you have real questions about whether you have mayors who are likely to be elected over and over again and don\u2019t need to be that accountable\u201d. Now the book has been published, Robinson wants to get Changing London\u2019s ideas on to the candidates\u2019 agendas. Most of the Labour candidates have seen the book and will discuss the ideas at a series of public events this summer. The objective, says Robinson, is to raise citizens\u2019 expectations. \u201cThey don\u2019t think the post is particularly relevant to their lives. This reflects the limited and unimaginative way in which the powers of the mayoralty have been applied so far. We are trying to persuade both voters and wannabe mayors that there is potential to want more and do more.\u201d", "sentences": ["Now children don\u2019t play in the streets and that sense of community is often gone.\u201d         A campaign fought by children in Amsterdam for a play street in 1972    Muylders points to Amsterdam, where children ran a successful campaign for a permanent play street and to those in Bristol and Hackney in east London."], "title": "Cities have it all to play for.

In 1971, several New York newspapers ran ads for a \u201cone-woman show\u201d that Ono was presenting at the museum. But anyone who came down to West 53rd Street would have seen no show at all, only a man with a sandwich board outside the museum entrance. Ono, the man explained, had released a number of flies in the sculpture garden; they could be in the museum now, or anywhere in Manhattan. In the catalogue she published, she appears in the garden with a large glass bottle full of the creatures, but on inspection it\u2019s clear that even the release of the flies never happened. It was just a photomontage. Who knows whether Ono ever thought she would really get the retrospective she faked in 1971. But now, at the age of 82, her first (or is it second?) one-woman show really has opened at MoMA, and it goes a long way to revalorising one of the most misunderstood artists of the last 60 years. Her massive fame, and maybe her heal-the-world rhetoric too, has obscured the groundbreaking contributions she made to the art of the 1960s and beyond. At last, the art world has come round. This show \u2013 finely curated by Christophe Cherix, the museum\u2019s head of drawings and prints; and Klaus Biesenbach, its chief curator at large \u2013 is no guerrilla occupation.

Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters    Much of the early work on display here is drawn from a major gift MoMA received in 2009 of artworks, correspondence and documentation related to Fluxus, an impish and fluid movement with which Ono was partially associated. The Fluxus artists, notably George Brecht and George Maciunas, favored performances and publications with a prankish tone. Ono\u2019s art was pithier, and dreamier. Her essential 1964 book Grapefruit \u2013 the typescript for which is displayed here page by page \u2013 consisted of nothing but terse, open-ended instructions for readers to follow. Some could actually be executed: \u201cCut a painting up and let it be lost in the wind.\u201d Others went far beyond any rational applicability:  SMELL PIECESend the smell of the moon.1953 autumn COLLECTING PIECE IIBreak a contemporary museum into pieces with the means you have chosen. Collect the pieces and put them together again with glue.1963 autumn  Many years before the \u201cdematerialization of the art object\u201d \u2013 the critic Lucy Lippard\u2019s phrase for the turn away from objects and towards ideas in American art of the late 1960s \u2013 Ono was creating artworks that could exist as mere instructions, to be executed once, multiple times, or never. A solo show in 1961 consisted of sumi-ink paintings on unstretched canvas, executed according to simple directions: one is burned, another placed on the ground, another drips with water. (Ono has recreated the paintings for this show.)  Cut Piece, her most famous artwork, began as a score as well: sit alone on a stage with a pair of scissors before you, and let audience members snip off bits of your clothes one by one. She performed it twice in Japan in 1964, and a recording here of a later iteration at Carnegie Hall shows Ono seated on the floor, back ramrod straight, face expressionless. A man with a dumb smile comes on stage and slices her blouse, exposing her bra. She looks forward, impassive. Another cut. She crosses her arms to keep her bra from falling, but the face never changes. She is utterly victimized, but unyielding.            Cut Piece remains one of the most vexing works of performance art of the 1960s, and it now stands as a precursor to whole swaths of feminist and body-centered art. Not less importantly, it also expresses the deep influence of Zen Buddhism, or at least western promulgations of it, on the art of the 1960s. (Last year she told the Guardian\u2019s Jonathan Jones that when she created Cut Piece, \u201cI was originally thinking of the Buddha and how he gave everything up.\u201d) MoMA\u2019s curators touch on this only lightly: in the same gallery as Cut Piece, they have included ephemera from an all-night event she staged in 1964 at Nanzen-ji, a Zen Buddhist temple in Kyoto. Yet Zen was a near obsession of artists, writers and composers of the mid-century American avant garde, from Robert Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns to Allen Ginsburg and especially John Cage \u2013 a frequent collaborator whom Ono befriended as early as the 1950s.  Ono, both in her Japanese education and her American artistic formation, drew parallels between spiritual and religious practices (mostly Buddhist, but at times Christian) and artistic creation, and saw her own art as less a means of representation than a portal to a new, freer mindfulness. \u201cAt this point,\u201d Ono wrote in 1966, \u201cwhat art can offer \u2026 is an absence of complexity, a vacuum through which you are led to a state of complete relaxation of mind.\u201d Ono\u2019s Zen-like instructions and performances of the early and mid-1960s are far more compelling than her sculptural work, which tend to cuteness and one-liner-ism. Half a Room (1967) is just that: a chair, a suitcase, a space heater, each slashed in half and painted white. Three Spoons, from the same year, consists of a Plexiglas pedestal that contains not three but four spoons. These mid-60s works are pretty twee, though one in particular has historical significance: a stepladder, painted all white, above which Ono hung a framed piece of paper on which she typed the single word YES. You can\u2019t climb the ladder now, but you could in 1966, at the Indica Gallery in London. John Lennon did \u2013 and soon Ono became, in Lennon\u2019s phrase, \u201cthe world\u2019s most famous unknown artist\u201d.     Yoko Ono: Zen-like instructions.  Photograph: Jewel Samad/AFP/Getty Images    Everything changes after that. Cherix and Biesenbach have done their best work in this second half of the show, correcting the most enduring falsehood surrounding Ono\u2019s career: that she was some avant garde harpy who glommed on to Lennon\u2019s fame, turned him into some far-out conceptualist, and (have you heard?) broke up the Beatles.  In fact, Lennon influenced Ono as much as Ono influenced Lennon, in ways that improved both of their careers. If her best art before Lennon encouraged a Zen-like dissolution of thought, after Lennon she attached that refusal of distinction and dualism to a greater campaign for world peace, waged not in galleries but in the mass media.

I brought with me a notebook, pen and camera and walked the streets from the station down to the sea, found a spot that felt right and took a great many photographs of quite staggering dullness. In retrospect, the expedition was probably little more than an exercise in procrastination. As with so many first novels, the central character was not unlike my teenage self, the house and town not dissimilar to where I had grown up, and the day might just as usefully have been spent looking at old photographs, or even writing. Still, it felt important to make the journey, find the address and trace the character\u2019s route from that house to the pier so that I could place pins in a map and know \u201chere\u2019s the house, the takeaway, the pub, it all happened right here\u201d, even if it hadn\u2019t really happened at all. Little of that research found its way on to the page directly. Reading the novel now, through the gaps in my fingers, there is nothing you could call descriptive prose and the fictional address I attributed to the house, 16 Archer Street, sounds horribly made up. But if the expedition was a little foolish and pretentious, it still felt important to go, because wasn\u2019t this what proper writers were meant to do?   Related: David Nicholls: 'I didn't want to write a dodgy disappointment'    Cut to 12 years later and I\u2019m writing my fourth novel, Us, in which the narrator, Douglas Petersen, is hurtling towards Bologna airport in order to catch a flight to Madrid, where he hopes to be reunited with his estranged son. I have never visited Bologna but a few clicks of the computer mouse bring me a thousand images of the railway station, inside and out. The online website has already told me the train\u2019s arrival time on the day of the fictional events, and a few more clicks will bring up a map of the fastest taxi route to the airport. Zooming in on the station, I can take the hand of the little unisex figure in the right-hand corner, drop it in the ticket hall and, in view mode, click through the doors and find a taxi. These images were captured on an overcast day, but it\u2019s not beyond my imagination to picture August heat as I click through the route, looking left and right, along a nondescript urban ring road to the small airport, which is close to the city and looks like almost every other small airport I have ever seen. In the finished novel, this journey will take up four sentences. My virtual mapping of the route will have almost no discernible impact on the prose that I\u2019ve already sketched out \u2013 as adjectives go, \u201cnondescript\u201d doesn\u2019t paint much of a picture \u2013 and, once again, what I justify as research might just as easily be dismissed as the writer\u2019s tendency to arse around. It\u2019s certainly less costly and time-consuming than visiting Bologna, but it still feels a little like cheating. What if I\u2019ve missed something? Isn\u2019t being there part of the job?      *** Not for all writers, no. Kafka never saw Amerika, Bellow wrote Henderson the Rain King before visiting Africa and EL James stumbled on no red rooms in Seattle, exploring on the internet instead. Stef Penney\u2019s fine Canadian-set novel The Tenderness of Wolves was researched in the reading room of the British Library, a fact that was much reported at the time, as if not visiting was somehow dishonest. That novel is set in the 1860s, and for writers of historical, fantastical or futuristic fiction, physical distance is just part of the challenge; a train ticket, a notepad and camera won\u2019t help you much if you\u2019re trying to conjure up Wolf Hall, Westeros or the Republic of Gilead. Besides, precision is not always the desired aim. Muriel Spark\u2019s Edinburgh, Peckham and Kensington are specific and detailed right down to the bus routes, yet one of her most brilliant and unsettling books, The Driver\u2019s Seat, follows her central character from the \u201cnorth\u201d on a holiday to a kind of generalised \u201csouthern\u201d every-city. There\u2019s a Metropole hotel, a post office, public squares, a museum with \u201cancient pavements\u201d, but the setting really might be Athens or Rome, Palermo or Barcelona. Simultaneously vivid and vague, the effect is disorientating and absolutely appropriate for that queasy and unsettling story.     \u2018Hardy\u2019s Wessex also lies outside of time\u2019 \u2026 Carey Mulligan in Far from the Madding Crowd. Photograph: REX Shutterstock    The success of such imagined, unvisitable worlds might argue against the necessity of first-hand experience. After all, the reader has an imagination, too, and merely to write the word \u201cBologna\u201d or \u201cSouthend\u201d or \u201c42nd Street\u201d will call up an image from the innumerable mental picture postcards we carry with us. Even on the page, the streets and squares of Shakespeare\u2019s Verona feel distinct from his Venice or Vienna, despite the minimal description. If the reader can supply the characters with a face and voice then surely they\u2019re capable of painting in the background? Yet even when the reader\u2019s imagination can be relied on, there\u2019s still the author\u2019s anxiety about getting it horribly wrong and, like Shakespeare, marooning the characters on Bohemia\u2019s non-existent coast. Take the (apocryphal?) author who mistook the map\u2019s ring-road for some mighty river and sent his characters walking there. Besides, research is not just a matter of fact-checking. A novelist\u2019s deep immersion in a place is often part of the appeal, the sense that not only were they there, but things happened to them, and it\u2019s impossible to read about Mavis Gallant\u2019s Paris, Isherwood\u2019s Berlin or any number of locations in Conrad and Greene and not feel as if that environment has been both observed and experienced at first hand; fiction as first-class travel-writing, with the author as our man in Havana.      Meanwhile, other writers create familiar worlds that are precisely conveyed, mappable almost, while remaining overtly fictitious; Middlemarch, Cranford, Barchester and on through Tilling, Hardborough and Ambridge. It\u2019s an approach that works better for self-contained provincial communities than city life. A renamed shadow-London, Moscow or Rome might run the risk of seeming absurd \u2013 what would you call it? What are its landmarks, its history? How could you begin to make it up? Consequently when those provincial characters leave their fictionalised homes to travel, the real-world locations seem to materialise around them. In Great Expectations, Dickens\u2019s London locations are characteristically precise and significant, so that Jaggers lives on the south side of Gerrard Street, Wemmick\u2019s castle is in Walworth and Estella resides on Richmond Green, but further from the capital the specifics disappear and we enter the \u201cmarsh country\u201d; vividly conveyed, geographically obscure, it\u2019s enough to know that Satis House is \u201cuptown\u201d. A little digging places the model for that famous churchyard in real-life Cooling, Kent, but once outside London there are many fewer pins in the real-world map. Perhaps no author has played these geographical games with more enthusiasm than Thomas Hardy, not just creating a fictional town but reimagining an entire region as a stage-set in which to play out his dramas, the region expanding with the number and scope of the stories. He describes Wessex \u201ca partly real, partly dream country ... which people can go to, take a house in and write to the papers from\u201d, but that \u201cdream\u201d element is essential in fiction that is sometimes a recreation of the realities of rural life \u2013 its farming practices, rituals, superstitions and dialect \u2013 sometimes fanciful, romanticised and melodramatic. In contrast to Dickens, Hardy\u2019s landscapes start to blur as we approach London. Try to imagine Bathsheba or Tess or Jude on Regent Street; they become harder to envision, like stage actors disappearing into the darkness of the wings. Why go to London anyway? \u201cThere was quite enough human nature in Wessex for one man\u2019s literary purpose.\u201d Adding to this sense of self-containment, Hardy\u2019s Wessex also lies outside of time; a novel like Far from the Madding Crowd is stripped of current events and topical references; even the dates on the gravestone are missing. Hardy was amused and flattered by readers\u2019 attempts to find real-life addresses in a highly fictionalised world \u2013 \u201cI do not contradict these keen hunters of the real\u201d \u2013 and cheerfully open about his inspiration, approving the publication of A Handbook to the Wessex Country of Thomas Hardy by his friend Hermann Lea. If Hardy was ever obliged to make adjustments to the reality, he was quick to own up, confessing in his introduction to Madding Crowd that \u201cEverdene farm has taken a witch\u2019s ride of a mile or more from its actual location.\u201d Later editions of the Wessex novels even came embellished with a map, because what could be more authoritative and informative than a map? Like family trees at the start of a novel, maps contribute to that sense of a carefully constructed alternative reality and \u2013 even better than a map of Middle Earth or the Seven Kingdoms \u2013 the Wessex map allows the reader to overlay the ghost- and real-worlds, so that the Hardy enthusiast can spend a wonderful holiday re-enacting Tess Durbeyfield\u2019s treks, though in more appropriate footwear and with less tragic consequences. It\u2019s an enjoyable conceit, a game between author and reader; feel free to imagine the streets and landmarks of Dorchester, Winchester and Salisbury, but let\u2019s agree to call them something else. Of course there are approximations and variations, and the map is not suitable for use by pedants; it would be too much to rename Stonehenge, but if Wintoncester is Winchester, why is Southampton, further west, still Southampton, Bristol still Bristol, Bath Bath? Because, Hardy answers, those large towns lie outside the outline of the traditional kingdom. They are offstage, and while a character might visit Bristol, Bath or London, the reader can\u2019t follow them. It almost seems as if the characters have a fictionalising effect on the settings, so that if Tess were to meet her end in Southampton rather than Wincanton, that city would acquire a new name, too.     \u2018The most obvious inadequacy of this approach is that if the author doesn\u2019t leave their desk, then nothing happens to the author\u2019 \u2026 David Nicholls. Photograph: Hal Shinnie    One of the unintended consequences of these overlapping worlds is tourism. After following in Tess\u2019s footsteps, why not track Mrs Dalloway around Bloomsbury or Leopold Bloom around Dublin on Bloomsday? The phenomenon is particularly apparent outside the most famous postal address in fiction, 221B Baker Street, an address that did not exist in Conan Doyle\u2019s time. Perhaps he was wary of inconveniencing the residents, anticipating the thousands of tourists who now queue to enter the Sherlock Holmes Museum, seemingly indifferent to the fact that the current holder of the fictional address actually stands at No 239. An even stranger example of our desire to mark fictional events on a map can be found in a dark, cramped courtyard in Verona, where hundreds of tourists congregate beneath Juliet\u2019s balcony. Who cares that it was attached to the building in the 1930s, that the house never belonged to a Capulet family, that Shakespeare probably never came here and that the play\u2019s text doesn\u2019t even mention a balcony? It\u2019s now part of the itinerary for those who would like to think \u201cit happened right here, or somewhere like it\u201d, to recite the lines and write something sentimental on the wall in the space provided. In Us, Douglas Petersen stumbles on this spot by accident on a sweltering August afternoon and rails against the ridiculous artifice of it all, unaware that he doesn\u2019t really exist either. *** While there\u2019s clearly no agreed method for an author to acquire a sense of place, I\u2019ve always wanted to know a location at first hand, and have always been able not only to place a pin in the map but also to specify a date and time, so that the flat on Rankeillor Street in Edinburgh where Emma Morley and Dexter Mayhew wake on 15 July 1988 is the same sublet flat that I shared with 15 other students during that summer\u2019s fringe festival. This is not to say that the events are autobiographical \u2013 that\u2019s rarely the case \u2013 but experience provides a sort of sense-memory, an authenticity that hopefully finds its way on to the page, because if the background is tangible and real, then hopefully events in the foreground will seem more plausible, too. Mapping and timing the journeys also seems important, and while writing One Day I stomped from Rankeillor Street up Arthur\u2019s Seat then down to the New Town and on to the point on Hanover Street where the final conversation takes place. I can\u2019t claim that the re\u2011enactment had a huge effect on the text; the only detail I remember lifting from life was the cock-and-balls graffiti that someone had scrawled in green Sharpie on the trig point on Arthur\u2019s Seat. Did they bring the pen with them with this in mind? I wondered, and had Emma wonder this, too. Us is a kind of road movie by rail, a disastrous grand tour of Europe during which Douglas tries to save his marriage and salvage his relationship with his son. Douglas is an obsessive planner and it seemed appropriate that the novel should also function as an itinerary, so that it might be perfectly possible to retrace the final holiday of the Petersen family, see the same paintings, catch the same trains, sit on the same benches but without suffering the same emotional breakdown. The settings were to include cities I knew quite well \u2013 Paris, Venice \u2013 others, like Bologna, that I didn\u2019t know at all and a few that I\u2019d visited just once, many years before. It seemed safe to assume that Siena hadn\u2019t changed a great deal since 1992, but nevertheless a certain amount of time was spent Googling my way around Europe in the name of research and at times this was very helpful indeed. There\u2019s a set-piece in which the novel\u2019s hero tries to see all of Florence in the 45-minute gap between trains, and it was reassuring to stand a virtual Douglas outside Santa Maria Novella station then set him running, clicking through the streets at something approaching his manic pace, looking up and down to answer certain questions along the way. How much of the Duomo can you see from the corner of Via dei Rondenelli? Can you glimpse the Ponte Vecchio from Piazza della Signoria? As a way of experiencing Florence this was, of course, entirely inadequate, a fish-eyed lens view with no sounds or smells or interaction, but it provided confirmation, and in the same way I was able to find the precise spot where Douglas proposes marriage to Connie, see the view from the Accademia bridge, sit on a particular bench outside the Prado and know that I wasn\u2019t too far off, that it was still as I remembered.     Anne Hathaway and Jim Sturgess in One Day, with Edinburgh in the background. Photograph: Allstar    The most obvious inadequacy of such an approach is that if the author doesn\u2019t leave their desk, then nothing happens to the author. Some writers have fun with this mingling of personal and fictional experience, and I enjoyed both Ben Lerner\u2019s Leaving the Atocha Station and Geoff Dyer\u2019s Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi, books where a blurring of author and narrator invites the reader to think, my God, did this stuff really happen? Even when the work is unequivocally fictional, the author wants to bring something home from the journey, a useful souvenir. Visiting a book fair in Moscow I found myself sharing a table in the hotel\u2019s breakfast room with some noisy and self-confident armament manufacturers and this encounter, heavily fictionalised, found its way into Us, as did the smallest hotel room in Venice, a heavy, salty meal in Munich and the sleepless night that followed, an awkward encounter with the bikers outside a bar in Amsterdam. There\u2019s that familiar feeling: this is an awful experience, maybe I can use it. For other episodes in the novel, clicking was clearly not going to be enough and so between first and second drafts I made a number of frantic journeys to fill in some gaps, experiencing Douglas\u2019s exhaustion on a long hike around the Louvre, taking the train from Paris to Amsterdam and from Munich across the Alps to stand beneath that ridiculous balcony in Verona, and while these journeys undoubtedly improved the sketched-out versions, I hope I\u2019ve avoided another potential pitfall of \u201cbeing there\u201d, the tendency to cram all the research on to the page. \u201cHe found his seat on the train, 47C, the fabric of which was of a vibrant cobalt blue striped with chlorophyllic green, soft to the touch but statically charged and still carrying a trace of the previous occupant\u2019s floral eau de cologne. He opened his newspaper and noted how the page\u2019s proportions differed from the familiar ...\u201d Every detail declares authenticity but it\u2019s the literary equivalent of looking at someone\u2019s holiday snaps. The best writers of place, I think, are those that select a few choice details or a single image, and for me the model for this kind of economy must be Penelope Fitzgerald, equally good on places that she knew at first hand and foreign, historical settings; the household washday that instantly establishes 18th-century Germany in The Blue Flower or the laundry frozen hard enough to knock out a tooth in The Bookshop\u2019s windblown Suffolk town \u2013 place and time established with a single stroke. ***      Geographical details in a fictional world allow the reader to fix a spot and believe \u201cit happened here\u201d. Many writers fight this kind of literalism, obscuring detail or creating unvisitable worlds, while others create an inbetween world, a place the reader can recognise without knowing the co-ordinates. My own inclination is to continue to go there if I can, to find points on the map and take those dull, dull photographs, because the research is often as much about reassuring the author as convincing the reader. Like a director scouting for film locations, the author can look around, take it in and stage the scene. The fictional can be grounded, just so long as everything is right. In 1921, James Joyce wrote to his aunt Josephine Murray in Dublin and asked her to do some research on his behalf. \u201cIs it possible for an ordinary person to climb over the railings of No 7 Eccles Street, either from the path or the steps, lower himself from the lowest part of the railings till his feet are within two or three feet of the ground and drop unhurt? I saw it done myself but by a man of rather athletic build. I require this information in detail in order to determine the wording of a paragraph.\u201d We now live in an age where possession of a stranger\u2019s postcode allows us to peer into their windows, and a quick search on the internet reveals that No 7 Eccles Street, Leopold and Molly\u2019s house, has long gone, and all that remains, the old front door, is now on display at the James Joyce Centre. Were Joyce writing now, he could have jogged his memory without leaving Paris, but it\u2019s reassuring to note that even someone as steeped in a city as Joyce still felt the need to take a look \u2013 still needed confirmation that he had got things absolutely right. \u2022 David Nicholls\u2019s Us is out in paperback from Hodder.", "sentences": ["Visiting a book fair in Moscow I found myself sharing a table in the hotel\u2019s breakfast room with some noisy and self-confident armament manufacturers and this encounter, heavily fictionalised, found its way into Us, as did the smallest hotel room in Venice, a heavy, salty meal in Munich and the sleepless night that followed, an awkward encounter with the bikers outside a bar in Amsterdam.", "For other episodes in the novel, clicking was clearly not going to be enough and so between first and second drafts I made a number of frantic journeys to fill in some gaps, experiencing Douglas\u2019s exhaustion on a long hike around the Louvre, taking the train from Paris to Amsterdam and from Munich across the Alps to stand beneath that ridiculous balcony in Verona, and while these journeys undoubtedly improved the sketched-out versions, I hope I\u2019ve avoided another potential pitfall of \u201cbeing there\u201d, the tendency to cram all the research on to the page."], "title": "David Nicholls: Google v old-fashioned legwork -  how to research a novel", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/may/23/david-nicholls-one-day-us-google-street-view-novels-location", "tags": ["Fiction", "David Nicholls", "Creative writing", "Books", "Culture", "Google Street View", "Technology"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-05-24T06:00:04Z", "article": "It felt like we\u2019d been cycling for hours when we stopped for lunch in Epping Forest, on the north-eastern edge of London.

But with newly-launched Beespoke Tours, things are a bit different: the journey is the holiday. So the pace is relatively slow, with plenty of breaks and time to take in the view. There is a support vehicle to carry the bags. And, crucially, the starting point is in central London and the end point is in central Amsterdam.     Rachel\u2019s group prepares to set off from King\u2019s Cross, London    We set off from King\u2019s Cross station. Of the three others on this inaugural trip, one was an experienced cyclist, one was a hobbyist who averaged 25 miles at weekends, and one was, like me, a cycle commuter with no long-distance experience. Simon and his partner Clarissa (who drove the van) are eager to show that anyone who is reasonably active can cycle long distances; it\u2019s not just for the Lycra brigade. Simon, a keen cyclist who used to work for an investment bank, noticed that lots of people now own quality bikes thanks to schemes like Cycle2Work, but don\u2019t get much chance to use them. He had the idea of offering trips where participants ride their own bike (road or hybrid recommended) from London to Amsterdam, Paris or Bruges.   Related: Top 10 cycling holidays in Europe    Until that first lunch stop, we\u2019d ridden through back streets of Islington and Hackney, and along canal towpaths further east. The going was easy but stop-start, as roads and pedestrians got in our way \u2013 which is why it took us so long to cover 15 miles. For the rest of that day and all the next, we were on Essex country lanes, picking up speed over rolling hills, exhilarated to have escaped the city under our own steam. We saw pheasant, grouse and rabbits; cycled past bluebell woods; and rode through idyllic villages with \u201cWarning: ducks crossing\u201d signs \u2013 and even saw some ducks actually crossing.     Refuelling station \u2026 breakfast, lunch and snacks are vegetarian, and usually organic     There was some traffic as we skirted Chelmsford, but all was peaceful again when we stopped for dinner at the Jolly Sailor in Heybridge Basin near Maldon, overlooking the Blackwater estuary. I thought we were spending the night here, so it was a bit of a shock to have to climb back on the bike and cycle another couple of miles to Osea Meadows campsite, where we were all sharing a huge lodge tent. I had my own canvas room and a proper bed, and was anticipating a good night\u2019s sleep after cycling about 50 miles, but regretted not having built up the wood-burning stove before going to bed, as it was freezing cold. The next day, we faced the same distance again, all the way to Harwich. Again, we were on country lanes, with a few main roads around Colchester. My legs felt surprisingly fresh, but the stops were welcome and well-chosen: a country park, the banks of the Colne at Rowhedge, a pretty churchyard. We giggled our way through Fingringhoe, and again as we passed a sign for a \u201csecret nuclear bunker\u201d. We drank tea on a village green next to an old red phone box that had been turned into a book swap. But it wasn\u2019t all ye olde England. In Essex, the car is king: we were honked at by more than one impatient driver, and some of the overtaking was too close for comfort. It was a relief to arrive in Harwich, where we ate fresh crab and dover sole at the brilliant Alma Inn.     A churchyard the party came across in eastern Essex    It was a completely different story in the Netherlands. After a comfortable night in a cabin on the ferry to Hoek van Holland (cycling on and off with all the lorries is great fun, like going round a Scalextric track), we rode straight on to a cycle path and stayed on it, more or less, all the way to Amsterdam. The first stretch took us along the coast, with unexpectedly beautiful wide sandy beaches and impressive dunes. The Netherlands\u2019 non-motoring infrastructure is incredible: at one point, there was a cycle lane, a footpath and a bridle path side by side \u2013 and all three were well-used, by people of all ages. Simon and Clarissa are committed to green travel, and the whole trip had reflected that ethos. Breakfast, lunch and snacks were vegetarian, and often organic and locally sourced (dinner was a matter of personal choice).     Tulip fields were greeted by cheers from the cyclists    Of course, there is a carbon cost to the support vehicle and ferry crossing, so some of guests\u2019 money goes to Trees for Life, a charity working to restore 1,000 square miles of Caledonian forest in Scotland. Even the company website is hosted by a wind-powered provider.   Related: How Amsterdam became the bicycle capital of the world    Skirting the Hague, we turned inland, through farming country. Our first tulip field raised a cheer, as did each windmill. The wind was behind us and we flew towards Haarlem, freewheeling for long stretches. Sixty-five miles just flew by and after a beer break in Haarlem we had just 15 miles to go. This was the hardest section, through saddle-soreness, knotted shoulders and just the knowledge that we were nearly there. But finally we were cycling through leafy Rembrandtpark and bike-clogged city streets to our eco hotel, Conscious Hotel Vondelpark.     Finishing line \u2026 the cyclist-friendly streets of Amsterdam Photograph:  /Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar    I had planned to spend a day seeing Amsterdam before taking the train and ferry home (while Clarissa and Simon took the bikes back to London) but as it turned out, I was too exhausted to do more than the Rijksmuseum. That first evening, though, we all felt a little giddy at our success in getting from one capital to another by our own efforts (with a little help from a big boat). When we arrived, one member of the group stripped down to his bib shorts for celebratory photographs; another had to be talked out of getting a bee \u2013 for Beespoke Tours \u2013 tattooed on his bottom. The champagne flowed, and those tough first and last 15 miles were forgotten. In the Netherlands, there are no cyclists \u2013 just people who cycle. It felt good to be one of them. \u2022 The trip was provided by Beespoke Tours (07766 073545, beespoketours.co.uk), whose three-night London-Amsterdam tour costs \u00a3650pp, including accommodation, ferry crossing from Harwich (return trip from Amsterdam not included), breakfast, lunch, support vehicle, luggage transit and bike return", "sentences": ["Suddenly the idea of cycling 160 miles from London to Amsterdam over three days seemed rather daunting.", "Many people cycling from London to Brighton, Paris or, indeed, Amsterdam, are taking part in a charity challenge.", "And, crucially, the starting point is in central London and the end point is in central Amsterdam.", "He had the idea of offering trips where participants ride their own bike (road or hybrid recommended) from London to Amsterdam, Paris or Bruges.", "After a comfortable night in a cabin on the ferry to Hoek van Holland (cycling on and off with all the lorries is great fun, like going round a Scalextric track), we rode straight on to a cycle path and stayed on it, more or less, all the way to Amsterdam.", "Related: How Amsterdam became the bicycle capital of the world    Skirting the Hague, we turned inland, through farming country.", "Finishing line \u2026 the cyclist-friendly streets of Amsterdam Photograph:  /Sportsphoto Ltd/Allstar    I had planned to spend a day seeing Amsterdam before taking the train and ferry home (while Clarissa and Simon took the bikes back to London) but as it turned out, I was too exhausted to do more than the Rijksmuseum.", "\u2022 The trip was provided by Beespoke Tours (07766 073545, beespoketours.co.uk), whose three-night London-Amsterdam tour costs \u00a3650pp, including accommodation, ferry crossing from Harwich (return trip from Amsterdam not included), breakfast, lunch, support vehicle, luggage transit and bike return"], "title": "Capital transfer: a cycling trip from London to Amsterdam", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/may/24/cycling-trip-london-amsterdam-beespoke", "tags": ["Cycling holidays", "Cycling", "London holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Amsterdam holidays", "Netherlands holidays", "Green travel", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-05-26T05:55:41Z", "article": "It\u2019s not a recent initiative, but as far as unusual \u2013 and effective \u2013 measures to improve road-traffic safety go, mime is still hard to beat. In the mid-90s, Bogot\u00e1\u2019s then-mayor, Antanas Mockus, employed more than 400 mime artists to stand guard at pedestrian crossings, showing wordless displeasure to reckless pedestrians and drivers who violated traffic rules and put lives at risk. The experiment was included on the list of 100 Promising Practices on Safer Cities, a collection of global initiatives commissioned last year by UN-Habitat \u2013 the branch of the United Nations which looks at how to make an increasingly urbanised world work best. In recent years, however, various initiatives introduced in Bogot\u00e1 to make walking and cycling safer have slipped. Bogot\u00e1 is by no means the world\u2019s safest city. So where is? The first thing to consider is that safety isn\u2019t just about how likely you are to be a victim of violent crime. In many cities, more visible crimes have fallen: in New York in 1990, the homicide rate peaked with 2,245 murders; last year it saw a record low of 328. But new risks are emerging: terrorism is a serious concern for any major city, and cyber crime is a growing threat \u2013 as cities increasingly rely on technology and connectedness, everything from traffic lights to air-traffic control, even sewage systems, could be vulnerable to hackers.     In many cities, more visible crimes have fallen while terrorism and cyber crime are growing threats. Photograph: EPA/Andrew Gombert    According to the Safe Cities Index, put together by the Economist\u2019s Intelligence Unit (EIU), the title of world\u2019s safest goes to the city that is also the most populous: Tokyo.  The EIU looked at a wide range of factors when putting together the index. It examined digital security, and considered the number of cyber attacks and how they were tackled. It looked at the obvious area of personal safety, but also infrastructure security \u2013 sanitation, roads, and management of natural disasters. In the health security category, it looked at quality of healthcare (for instance, how many hospital beds and doctors there were per 1,000 people), but also at issues such as pollution. As the report puts it, \u201cLiving in a safe and healthy urban environment can make a real and measurable difference to city inhabitants.\u201d In the index\u2019s top 25 cities, average life expectancy is 81; in the bottom half, it is 75. Tokyo scored highly across all categories. The report highlights its low crime rate, and how city planners improved quality of life by banning diesel cars to reduce pollution, and pedestrianising large parts of the centre. Before you start packing your bags, however, the conclusions aren\u2019t simple: Tokyo also happens to be considered the world\u2019s riskiest city, in part because of the huge number of people who would be harmed in an inevitable future earthquake. Nor does the report actually say which city is safest for you. From an individual\u2019s point of view, as opposed to the municipal officials responsible for the smooth running of a city, isn\u2019t personal safety more important than the threat of cyber crime? In that case, maybe you should look at Singapore instead. And what if health security is your priority, but you\u2019ll take your chances on the streets? Move to Zurich: first for health, 13th for personal safety.     In 2011 and 2013, Amsterdam was ranked safest for cyclists by urban planning consultancy the Copenhagenize Design Company. Photograph: David R Frazier Photolibrary/Alamy      Tokyo might be one of the safest cities but it also happens to be one of the riskiest    Other studies have revealed other issues that might be of personal importance. Amsterdam, for instance, is \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2013 a good place to be a on a bike. In 2011 and 2013, the Dutch city was ranked safest for cyclists by urban planning consultancy the Copenhagenize Design Company, using criteria such as bicycle facilities, drivers\u2019 attitudes, and political will to promote cycling. The sheer proliferation of cyclists helps \u2013 cycling in the city, notes the report, is \u201cabout as mainstream as you can get\u201d \u2013 as does cycling infrastructure and a 30kph speed limit. There is no exhaustive ranking of the safest cities for women, but one survey last year looked specifically at how safe women were on public transport. Up to 500 women were polled in 15 of the world\u2019s capitals, plus New York. They were asked about their experiences of being verbally harassed or assaulted by men, travelling at night, the likelihood that other passengers would come to their aid, and whether they trusted that officials would investigate reports of violence. Of the cities surveyed, New York came out best, with Bogota, Mexico City and Lima faring worst; London was ranked fourth safest.     London was ranked fourth safest for women using public transport. Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    But is it really possible, or even desirable, to rank cities according to their safety? \u201cWe are quite wary of doing that,\u201d says Dr Michele Acuto, principal investigator for UCL\u2019s City Leadership Initiative, which is working with the UN on how to improve urban safety. \u201cRankings pit cities against each other. If you say London is safer than Manchester, it\u2019s a blunt generalisation. You can say London has a lower crime rate than Manchester \u2013 that would be correct \u2013 but making judgements on safety is perception-based.\u201d   Related: Earthquakes, hurricanes, cyclones and tsunamis: the world's 10 riskiest cities    How do you make a city safer? Nobody wants to live in a police state. \u201cYou have to reduce crime, but it\u2019s also things like improving safety of transport. If you make a city more sustainable, with more bike lanes, for instance, you can redesign it so that it\u2019s also safer for pedestrians.\u201d The wealth gap also has an important effect on a city\u2019s safety: \u201cThere is no safer-city agenda that can proceed without a social-equality agenda,\u201d says Acuto. And if there\u2019s one factor you might want to consider as a sign of how safe your city is likely to be in future, look to the immigration rate. Studies in the US have shown that, far from what the anti-immigration lobby would have us believe, a city with more immigrants has lower crime rates. A study by Robert J Sampson, professor of social sciences at Harvard University, found that first-generation immigrants were 45% less likely \u2013 and second-generation immigrants 22% less likely \u2013 to commit violence than third-generation Americans. As Sampson has summed it up: \u201cIf you want to be safe, move to an immigrant city.\u201d ", "sentences": ["In 2011 and 2013, Amsterdam was ranked safest for cyclists by urban planning consultancy the Copenhagenize Design Company.", "Amsterdam, for instance, is \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2013 a good place to be a on a bike."], "title": "Which is the safest city in the world?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/may/26/what-is-safest-city-in-the-world-crime-immigration-tokyo-amsterdam-new-york-bogota", "tags": ["Cities", "US crime", "Crime", "UK news", "US news", "World news", "London", "New York", "Women", "Life and style", "Migration"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-05-26T12:25:41Z", "article": "Spring blossom; a row of decapitated heads; a black ship on a dark sea. One thing leads to another in the 58 drawings currently at the Drawing Room in south London: a constellation of discs, a cake, a self-portrait. There seems no end to it. What connects drawings made in Poland in the late 1940s and 50s, in Amsterdam in the 1980s and in Antwerp from the late 70s to today isn\u2019t clear, though there are affinities and echoes everywhere. The mind skips from one thing to another. The exhibition DE.FI.CIEN.CY brings together the drawings of Andrzej Wr\u00f3blewski (1927-57) and contemporary artists Ren\u00e9 Dani\u00ebls and Luc Tuymans. The title is disjointed, just like the broken narratives and fragments the works themselves present in an exhibition first shown in Pozna\u0144. Wr\u00f3blewski is at the heart of it. As a young boy, he witnessed the death of his father, who suffered a heart attack when the Nazis searched the family home. Wr\u00f3blewski went on to make numerous drawings and paintings called The Execution, based both on his own childhood trauma and the many public executions perpetrated, and photographed, during the German occupation of Poland.   Related: Japanese cannibals and German executions: Luc Tuymans goes over to the dark side    The executioners are often absent from the works. Exhibition curator Ulrich Loock suggests that the artist is the executioner, playing on the idea that he, after all, is the one who executes the work, and that painting itself is a kind of disruption and mutilation, a negative as much as it is a positive act. Wr\u00f3blewski\u2019s figures are often left headless, or with their torsos inverted. Near one such drawing is a figure by Dani\u00ebls, made in 1983, in which a man is cut in half at the waist and reassembled upside down. Where Wr\u00f3blewski\u2019s work is despairing, Dani\u00ebls\u2019 drawing is comic, almost joyous. Between these two hangs a recent work by Tuymans depicting a winged, flying monkey. The image is partly derived from a memory of a scene in The Wizard of Oz, but Tuymans also relates it to depictions of monsters in the middle ages. We look in vain for a signature style in this fascinating exhibition, losing ourselves among monstrousness and delicacy, private jokes, offhand cartoonishness, diagrams, abstractions and precise self-portraiture. Many of Tuymans\u2019 drawings are preparatory works for paintings, or \u2013 as a kind of reversal \u2013 made after the paintings. They have, typically, the look of some worn-out, faded and discarded image, resurrected as a faked pictorial document, what Tuymans calls \u201cauthentic forgeries\u201d. One of the paradoxes of Tuymans\u2019 work is the degree to which his evident technical competence and pictorial inventiveness is disguised, as though he were acting the part of an amateur, or adopting various personas in the making of works that range from a delicate and precise watercolour of a naval officer, to what looks like a stencil for patterned wallpaper, not so much cut from a piece of card as chewed by mice. Another drawing, made specially for the show here, has been drawn directly on the wall. In it, Tuymans has used photocopies of earlier works to produce a degraded image that contains the heads of Nazi officers, someone hanged on a scaffold, and a bier of flowers. The grainy blacks of the drawing and the blank flare of the photocopier\u2019s light have reduced the image to something incomprehensible.     Composition No 47 by Andrzej Wr\u00e9blewski. Photograph: Andrzej Wr\u00e9blewski Foundation    One sometimes thinks that this exhibition could have been made by 20 people rather than three. The shifts in Wr\u00f3blewski\u2019s art were determined by both the larger social and political circumstances under which he worked in postwar Poland and by his own changes in belief \u2013 a utopian, modernist abstract artist who became a dedicated communist, then renounced his political faith. Had he lived longer, who knows what he might have achieved. A number of drawings depict the interior of a bus, heading towards a distant vanishing point. We might as well be driving towards a wall; the bus is going nowhere. In several of Dani\u00ebls\u2019 drawings, a tree is covered by words rather than leaves. Along one branch the phrase \u201cPlaces, buildings, where feelings are closely related to fright \u2026\u201d has been written with a brush (the phrase continues but it is not decipherable). Sometimes Dani\u00ebls switches to Dutch or French, just as, in a single drawing, a shape twists from being a diagrammatic rendition of an intersection between two walls, to a butterfly, to a bow tie. This became a familiar motif in his rich and lively art, whose forms mutate and multiply and turn about themselves, depending on their context. Born in 1950, he became well known during the 1980s for paintings that used both abstraction and figuration, and words and images, in ways that were both extremely personal and contained an implicit critique of the fashionable, image-based neo-expressionism of the time. His development was cut short by a brain haemorrhage in 1987 from which he has never fully recovered.     Bullfight (1985) by Ren\u00e9 Dani\u00ebls. Photograph: Peter Cox/Paul Andriesse    Dani\u00ebls\u2019 pictorial language games \u2013 a tree might also be a view of roads, a map of his familiar cycle routes or divergent paths through a city \u2013 are a kind of chart of possibilities. This can lead to an image of a lone pianist playing in the dark or to a skein of telegraph wires festooning the evening sky. We are never certain whether we are looking at a direct or innocent image or a symbol for something darker. I can\u2019t look at a drawing of cut-up carp by Andrzej Wr\u00f3blewski without thinking of the sliced bodies in his executions images. Each image has a story behind it, and there are other stories \u2013 the things the artist meant and the ones you invent. All three artists have, in different ways, a conflicted relationship to modernism, to figuration as well as abstraction. For all three, the idea that making art is an expression of some essential self, and that style is somehow innate, is inconceivable. There is a palpable suspicion of the supposed power of images on display here. How much do the drawings reflect the tropes of weariness and wariness? Doubts about the efficacy or ability of a medium to tackle large subjects can lead one to stop making images altogether; or to work as if inside some larger fiction, as though one were a character in some story. That is how it feels for the spectator, too. Going from image to image \u2013 from the eager eyes of pigeons to a red goitre on a woman\u2019s neck, from a bullring to an execution \u2013 we invent our own plot, tracing the storyline, following the broken branches of great and small histories.

Liverpool are on the right, Leeds are on the left. Among the players in white is Albert Johanneson, a South African who is about to make history. He is to become the first black player to play in the FA Cup final. Except, he wants to be back in the dressing room, away from the abuse. His confidence is drained, his body is shaking. He spends much of the time before the game in the toilet vomiting and suffering from diarrhoea. He asks Don Revie if he can be dropped. The Leeds manager refuses. Waiting to go out on to the turf, he is approached by someone who says: \u201cYou\u2019ve got no chance looking like you do. Our fans will murder you.\u201d This was not what Johanneson had expected when he first came to England in January 1961. Before his arrival, he saw the country as a place where he could live out a dream, where he could earn enough money to provide for his family, where he could escape the racism of apartheid South Africa. That last one was key. Johanneson\u2019s youth in Germiston was characterised by racism and violence. There was one event he remembered vividly. One day, aged no more than six, he was playing with his friends on a street corner. A car stopped near him and a white boy of the same age leaned out and spat in Johanneson\u2019s face. Johanneson did not move. The boy giggled and did it again. Then the driver of the car reached out and whipped Johanneson across his neck with a cane. His friends ran when the man got out of his car. Johanneson could not. He was on the ground in pain. The man kicked him and drove off. Understandably scarred by incidents like this, Johanneson was of a nervous disposition. He was the retiring type, far more bashful than boisterous. As a child, football did not interest him. In the suffocating climate of a South Africa (he was born in 1942 and was six years old when the country introduced apartheid), he liked the freedom that running afforded him. He was talented and would beat friends with ease. In his teenage years, a friend told him he could go even faster should he improve his technique. Johanneson took his advice and started practising with old tennis balls. He would spend hours each day controlling them, kicking them, flicking them and running along rocky roads with the ball at his feet. After a while he became so good the locals would come watch him and bet on whether or not he could perform particular tricks. One day when he was practising, Johanneson was approached by a man from a local team. They were a player short and asked did he fancy getting involved. Johanneson had not played football in a long time and was reluctant at first \u2013 memories of being kicked around the pitch by a roughhouse full-back came rushing back \u2013 but he eventually agreed. With no boots, he played bare-footed. He set up one goal, scored another and left the pitch in the arms of his team-mates. Athletics was forgotten about and football became his teenage passion. From this local team, he moved to play for Germiston Coloured Schools and from there he joined Germiston Caledonian Society Amateur Football Club. It was there he was scouted by a local school teacher named Barney Gaffney. It was Gaffney who informed Johanneson that people from Newcastle were coming to watch him and it was Gaffney who would organise a three-month trial for him with Leeds United in January 1961. Johanneson\u2019s introduction to Leeds was tough. There was a layer of cold, soft snow on the ground and plenty of tough, ugly tackles laid on him in training. Nonetheless, once he settled, his skills and speed impressed all around him, including Revie. On 5 April 1961, he became the newly-appointed manager\u2019s first signing for the club and in the drab world of England\u2019s Second Division football, he would light up a city more concerned with rugby league and a football side built on pragmatism.     The Leeds players watch on as Johanneson performs some tricks. Photograph: Evening Standard/Getty Images    \u201cI had heard of him but never seen him play,\u201d said Johnny Giles, who joined Leeds two years after Johanneson. \u201cHe played on the left wing, very quick, good control, good goalscorer. He was outstanding.\u201d Billy Bremner was similarly enthusiastic about Johanneson\u2019s talents. \u201cWhen he joined Leeds the rest of the team stood open-mouthed, drooling over his trickery. He was a bloody excellent player and had so much pace and strength, he was a great athlete.\u201d Jock Stein, the great Celtic manager, agreed with Giles and Bremner about Johanneson\u2019s ability but believed that the South African \u201chad no balls\u201d and that \u201che wasn\u2019t tough enough\u201d. The scars across Johanneson\u2019s legs would suggest otherwise and Giles had little doubt about his resilience. \u201cIf he got a kick, he [would get up and] would go again\u201d \u2013 and George Best did too. \u201cIn those days, Albert was quite a brave man to go on the pitch in the first place, wasn\u2019t he?\u201d That bravery was exhibited in his debut against Swansea three days after signing his contract. He first heard racist abuse coming from the opposite dressing room and then from the stands. The fans made monkey noises and jumped up and down. Johanneson didn\u2019t score but he did make a mockery of the full-backs, time after time using his quick feet and deft touch to leave them stuck in the mud and looking foolish after they had rushed in to try clatter him. He also set up several chances for Jack Charlton one of which was a perfectly weighted cross that led to a goal as Leeds drew 2-2. After the match, Johanneson, a man forever uncertain of his place, was unsure if he could bath with his white team-mates. They stripped him, picked him up and threw him in. There was no escaping the abuse around the away grounds but the supporters at Elland Road worshipped Johanneson. \u201cAlbert was a hero to the Leeds fans,\u201d Giles says, \u201cthey loved him.\u201d Paul Eubank, who watched Johanneson from the terraces and has worked to preserve his memory, agrees.  \u201cMy dad used to take me to Elland Road in the 1960s so I saw Albert play and I never saw someone with such skill before. So, apart from my father, Albert instantly became my hero. When I was playing football as a kid in the streets, I never wanted to be Bobby Charlton or George Best or Denis Law, I always wanted to be Albert.\u201d     Albert Johanneson of Leeds United, with fans at the Hendon\u2019s ground in London during a training session before the FA Cup final against Liverpool in 1965. Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images    In that first season of 1960-61, Johanneson played his part as Leeds avoided relegation but for much of the following term, he was replaced by John Hawksby. He scored his first goal for the club in January 1962 in an FA Cup match but only featured once before a crucial mid-April match against Walsall. By that stage of the season, Leeds were, once more, contenders for the drop into Division Three and every point was vital. At Fellows Park, Johanneson scored as Leeds came away with an important 1-1 draw. Two weeks later, Leeds were playing away to a mid-table Newcastle United. Johanneson stole the show, scoring once and setting up another as Leeds won 3-0. Leeds would survive relegation by a mere three points. In 1962-63 Revie\u2019s side finished fifth, four points short of an automatic promotion place, as Johanneson became a more regular and more important fixture in the Leeds side. In one match, according to Ian Guild in the Yorkshire Post, he was so good he was applauded by his team-mates on his way to the dressing room. However, it was during the following season that Johanneson played his best football for the club. Once again his skills and style were to the fore but now he also added goals to his repertoire and he finished the season as the club\u2019s joint top scorer in the league with 15 goals. Thanks in no small part to Johanneson\u2019s efforts, Leeds won the league and promotion to the top flight. Leeds\u2019 first season back in the top division saw them finish second in the league (on goal difference) and reach that 1965 FA Cup final. This was a major event for the club and the city. Leeds had never reached the final before and the headline on the souvenir edition of the Yorkshire Evening Post read, in big, block, capital letters: \u201cWembley at last!\u201d Johanneson, like the rest of the Leeds players, spent the week signing autographs and being showered with free meals, drinks and compliments. A far cry from the time some restaurant owners would ask him to sit elsewhere in case he put the customers off their food. It should have been the biggest moment in his career but, instead, the racist abuse he suffered before the game left him a nervous wreck.     Liverpool\u2019s Roger Hunt is denied by Leeds United\u2019s Bobby Collins during the 1965 final. Photograph: PA Photos    Those pre-match Wembley words were aimed to put one of Leeds\u2019 danger men off his game and they worked. The abuse would get no better outside. \u201cWhen we walked out,\u201d Johanneson told Paul Harrison, who has written a book about Johanneson called The Black Flash as well as a play about his life, \u201call I could hear was a cacophony of Zulu-like noises coming from the terraces. It was dreadful, I could barely hear myself think for those screams. I wanted to run back down the tunnel. The famous turf itself made things worse. In Revie\u2019s words, it was a \u201cshit pitch for fancy football.\u201d He advised his winger to use his pace \u201crun like the wind and don\u2019t let the jungle bunny chanting get to you\u201d. But, of course, it did, as did Liverpool\u2019s tackling. Johanneson was chopped down early in the game and hit with a few sly punches. He disappeared from view and in the words of Giles, \u201cdid not contribute\u201d. \u201cHe had a very, very bad match,\u201d adds Giles. Indeed, the only mention he received in Eric Todd\u2019s match report for the Observer was in the team box. Liverpool won in extra-time and Revie approached Johanneson after the game. \u201cAlbert,\u201d he said, \u201cyou let yourself and your family down today, you went hiding.\u201d Many observers see that match as the turning point in Johanneson\u2019s career but Giles believes that match merely confirmed what he had already suspected. \u201cAlbert was brilliant in the second division,\u201d he says, \u201cand when we got promotion at Swansea, I remember going back on the train and there was a group of us in the carriage. Leeds were a young team ... many had never played in the first division. I\u2019d played in the first division and Albert asked me, \u2018what\u2019s the first division like?\u2019 I said: \u2018it\u2019s great, you go Old Trafford and Anfield and there are the big crowds\u2019. But Albert sort of shook his head. And I remember thinking: \u2018that\u2019s not good\u2019. I think in his head, it was too much for him ... he didn\u2019t play well in the first division at all.\u201d And he did not play much for Leeds in his four years at the club after that final. There would be the odd game here and there against the smaller sides and the odd sparkle of his old talent \u2013 he scored a hat-trick against DWS Amsterdam in the Fairs Cup as well as one against Spora Luxembourg \u2013 but injuries and a taste for alcohol took over. As did Eddie Gray. Hours before a game against Burnley, Johanneson had been drinking heavily. At one point in that match, the footage shows Johanneson lying on the turf in the opposition box. The play goes on around him. From his prone position, he watches as Gray picks up the ball wide on the left and dances his way through the Burnley defence before scoring one of the most memorable goals in Leeds\u2019 history. Johanneson remembers looking at Gray and realising that at that very moment his career at Elland Road was over. He was right. He would never play for Leeds again.     The grave of Johanneson. Photograph: Gary Calton    Johanneson\u2019s marriage dissolved along with his career. He moved to the fourth division and York City in 1970 but two years later, overweight and over drinking, they let him go. He moved back to South Africa for a season but was soon back to Leeds, where he worked some odd jobs including washing dishes in a Chinese restaurant. When he was broke he would approach people with a telegram that informed him of his father\u2019s death. He would show it under the pretext of raising cash for a flight home. It was a ruse. His father had died years before that. People tried to get him clean but Johanneson ended up in a squalid flat drinking cider, eating sausages and watching Hawaii Five-O on a black and white TV. He would die in that flat, his body undiscovered for days. Johanneson\u2019s gravestone is engraved with some words from a Maya Angelou poem. \u201cI rise I rise, I rise,\u201d it says. The words provide a fitting tribute to a man who rose from the South African dust to blaze a trail and begin football\u2019s long journey against racism.", "sentences": ["There would be the odd game here and there against the smaller sides and the odd sparkle of his old talent \u2013 he scored a hat-trick against DWS Amsterdam in the Fairs Cup as well as one against Spora Luxembourg \u2013 but injuries and a taste for alcohol took over."], "title": "Albert Johanneson: first black footballer to play in the FA Cup final", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/may/28/albert-johanneson-first-black-player-fa-cup-final", "tags": ["FA Cup", "Leeds United", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-05-29T11:40:51Z", "article": "This week\u2019s top city stories from around the web take a look at bike share schemes facing trouble, an addictive interactive mapping project from New York City, and how Beirut is ready to reveal the scars of its war-torn past.

Big Apple time capsule Have you ever wondered what your city street looked like a century ago? Well if you live in New York City, there\u2019s a simple way to find out. Software engineer Dan Vanderkam recently launched OldNYC, a collection of some 40,000 images of the Big Apple dating back to the 1920s and even earlier, each plotted on an interactive map at their point of capture. The images come from New York Public Library, where Vanderkam has been working with library staff since early 2013. Users of OldNYC click on a point on the map to bring up a list of images showing what was once there. The software engineer told CityLab that he hopes that users will flag up inaccuracies and add their own anecdotes about the snapshots on the map, crowdsourcing personal insight into the city\u2019s history. His only guides were the original typewritten notes on the back of each photograph. Beirut is ready to embrace its scars Almost 25 years after the Civil War ended in Lebanon, Beirut\u2019s built environment is still marked by reminders of war. In this NextCity feature, David Lepeska explains how, in the years following the conflict, the government sought to leave the trauma behind: \u201cpost-independence history is not taught... textbooks never mention the civil war due to fears of sectarian tensions\u201d, he writes. \u201cThe silence shaped Beirut\u2019s built environment as well\u201d.     Beirut\u2019s Holiday Inn stands as an abandoned reminder of the country\u2019s civil war. Photograph: dpa picture alliance archive/Alamy    The piece reveals how, after the government\u2019s raze-and-rebuild ethos demolished as much as 80% of the city\u2019s architectural heritage, Beirut is finally finished hiding its battle wounds and is working to preserve what\u2019s left in a city where the past has been erased. Berber brutalism When thinking about brutalist architecture, certain examples might spring to mind \u2013 Montreal\u2019s Habitat 67, Marseille\u2019s Cit\u00e9 Radieuse, and the suburbs of Russia\u2019s great cities, perhaps.

The man who has produced and worked with most of the western world\u2019s biggest music stars, from the Who, the Rolling Stones and Queen to Madonna, Bob Dylan and Luciano Pavarotti, said the biggest problem was a dire lack of major new bands to succeed the old ones.    The festival circuit has peaked. There's too many of them and there are not enough big acts to headline them  Harvey Goldsmith     \u201cThe festival circuit has peaked,\u201d he said, speaking at the Hay literary festival in Powys, Wales. \u201cIt really peaked about two years ago. There\u2019s too many of them and there are not enough big acts to headline them. That is a big, big problem in our industry. And we are not producing a new generation of these kind of acts \u2013 the likes of the Rolling Stones, Muse, even Arctic Monkeys \u2013 that can headline.\u201d There were about 900 music festival events in the UK between May and September last year, he said, and there is no way they can all continue. \u201cMusic festivals have probably run their course. What is going to happen is a growth in events where it isn\u2019t just music, [but] like this one, with poetry or books or magic shows. There will be lots of small combination festivals that give something plus \u2013 not people standing around in a massive great field unable to go to the toilet because they might miss the band.\u201d Clearly the way music is being delivered has changed, he said. \u201cPeople don\u2019t seem to want to listen to a body of work, an album, any more. And most rock bands built a reputation on a body of work \u2013 they might take three albums to really hone their art, to become great, but young people don\u2019t want that. They home in on a track, a sound, then ping off again to the next one. Pop pervades, not that there\u2019s anything wrong with pop. I think it will come round again, but it will take time.\u201d Goldsmith, 69, also revealed that he has teamed up with Robin de Levita, the Dutch producer of the Who\u2019s 1970s rock musical Tommy, at a new 1,100-seat theatre in Wembley which is due to be finished in time for the first stage adaptation of the phenomenally successful teen book and movie series The Hunger Games in June 2016.     Music promoter Harvey Goldsmith, who has staged events for many of the world\u2019s biggest acts. Photograph: Karwai Tang/WireImage    De Levita would, said, Goldsmith, be bringing his experimental SceneAround concept to the capital \u2013 theatre that puts the audience seating on a turntable that rotates round a series of scenes built around its circumference, accompanied by projections on panel screens. The concept was pioneered in an aircraft hangar outside Amsterdam and has proved hugely successful. Goldsmith, who is already planning to bring a production of the Anne Frank story to the as-yet-unnamed venue, said: \u201cIt\u2019s a whole completely different way of producing shows.\u201d During his Hay appearance, the impresario also revealed some of the \u201caccess all areas\u201d secrets of his long career in the music industry, talking about Keith Moon putting dynamite down a Sydney hotel room toilet in an effort to unblock it and witnessing the paralysing stage fright that gripped John Lennon just before an appearance at Madison Square Garden in 1974 and led to him being dragged, vomiting, out of his dressing room and shoved out on stage. \u201cIt\u2019s the most bizarre thing really how common that is among artists. It\u2019s odd how stricken with fear they\u2019ll get, but as soon as the first chord is hit, they\u2019re fine,\u201d he said. He also laid to rest a long-running rock\u2019n\u2019roll mystery: why Elvis Presley never performed outside North America. Presley\u2019s long-time manager, Colonel Tom Parker, admitted to him over tea, he said, that the real reason why Goldsmith\u2019s attempts to bring the singer to London had failed was Parker\u2019s own uncertain immigration status. \u201cHe explained that it was because he was an illegal [Parker was Dutch]. He didn\u2019t want to risk leaving the US \u2013 it was him, not Elvis,\u201d said Goldsmith. And his ultimate rock\u2019n\u2019roll performer? \u201cFreddie Mercury had to be our most powerful stage performer, the best live performer we\u2019ve ever had. At Live Aid he went out and saw that audience and just grabbed it.\u201d But the next Queen was still far from being formed, he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not producing a new generation of this kind of act. Coldplay is probably the last one to come up and that was 10 years ago. There isn\u2019t much out there that looks like it is forming the next generation of heritage artists. \u201cSo with no big acts to headline, there are no big shows. Glastonbury has got to the point where it can\u2019t find any more big acts and that\u2019s the pinnacle of the festivals.

Below is a roundup of some of your favourite cycling cities: those with great infrastructure, those which actively support and encourage cycling, or even those cities not traditionally thought of as cycle-friendly that are taking steps forward to improve things for cyclists. Basel, Switzerland             nikolar    05 May 2015 8:03pm  Basel, Switzerland is true bicycle city. Cycles are used by old and young alike no matter what gender or social strata or how cold the winter might be. Multitudes of paths to surrounding areas, ease of navigating busy crossroads and car drivers show great respect for bicycle riders - always a good sign. Finding a place to park your bike can be a challenge at times, but if that's the worst of it I'll take it any time.      M\u00fcnster, Germany  We have more traffic by bike (40%) than by car (36%). Where once was the city wall there is now a ringroad exclusively for bikes and pedestrians. Every big road has bike lanes. Normally it is a more or less good coexistence of bike, car and pedestrians, although it\u2019s is a kind of folklore to mock each other. One problem is drivers from elsewhere that are not used to the massive bike traffic, especially HGV drivers. - OriginOfStorms  Portland, US           Morning commuters cycling onto the Hawthorne Bridge   I am a bicycle photography blogger and I wear a camera on my helmet pointing backwards to capture still photos Portland, OR. This image shows a herd of cyclists crossing onto the Hawthorne Bridge during morning rush hour. Note the two lanes for bicycle traffic. The lane on the left was added to accommodate the large groups of cyclists who enter the bridge all at one, jockeying for position. This helps keep cyclists out of motorized traffic lanes as we pass one another. My blog is bicyclehead.com if you&#39;d like to see more photos of Portland from a cyclist&#39;s point of view.

My own local city, Pozna\u0144, is close to a cyclist\u2019s dream. Because of its communist infrastructure, the roads are very wide and thus cycling routes are pretty much everywhere.

Cycles are banned from the roads but pavements are wide( rather like country roads ) and shared by pedestrians and cyclists. This results in cyclists bring careful and thoughtful of pedestrians . Extensive (even multi-storey) bike parks a re provided. The result is a city where shoppers, commuters, children and the older generation all feel safe riding around.

Took a holiday there a few weeks ago and was absolutely gobsmacked by the total difference from any British city I've cycled inin. It's set out differently, sure, but the most obvious difference was in attitude. Drivers, cyclists, pedestrians - all being considerate of each other, waiting for green lights, overtaking safely, and generally behaving themselves.It'd never work here.

For somebody like me who has been cycling here in this city for almost 40 years, the cycling infrastructure has become a lot better. But there are so many bikes now, that if you try to cross Christianshavn to get to Amager during rush hour, or are riding in the other direction, trying to get into the center of the city, you are going to be in the middle of a vortex of cyclists. Of course, the route goes quicker on a bike than in a car, but our local politicians are working on making even better bike routes and building up alternative routes to busy streets so that people who don't want to be crushed in the vortex of cyclists while inhaling car exhaust can ride safely away from the rush hour heavy traffic.  One of the biggest problems I encounter is young people with fast reflexes who insist on looking at their phones in traffic or texting or changing their music while looking at the phone either while riding or when stopped at a red light. There is a generation of Danes who think that they are The Only Person in the Universe and unfortunately, the police don't have the time or energy to give them the fines that they ought to be getting. A lot of people seem to feel that they have no responsibility to be aware in traffic and for those of us whose reactions are not as quick as they once were, these people are dangerous.      Utrecht, Netherlands Utrecht, another popular city for cycling, was praised for its infrastructure, but one reader explained that infrastructure is not always enough for a successful cycling city:           Cycling in Utrecht   Cycling in Utrecht is so great. It&#39;s an unique experience. Relaxed, safe and fun. No, it&#39;s not differen to Cycling in Amsterdam. But Utrecht has its own style. Tiny, beautiful and authentic. Wow.        Sent via GuardianWitness    By  dutchit   5 May 2015, 21:51        I live in Utrecht and I even owe my job to it\u2019s pioneering approach to cycling. But I get worried when people talk about Utrecht as the shining example about how to approach cycling infrastructure, because they are pioneering and things are far from perfect. People park their bike where it suits them not thinking about in who\u2019s way it may be. Utrecht to its credit builds bicycle storage facilities that people can use for free. I work in one. However last week I couldn\u2019t even get to work without removing about 40 bicycles away from the entrance of the bicycle storage before I could get in. Inside we still had room for at least 200 more bikes.  Lesson: If you wan\u2019t to make your city a \u201ccycling city\u201d make sure you have enough suitable parking space, have parking rules and enforce them, just like you would with cars. Our famed cycling-paths are dreamed up by people thinking of the idyllic 40 bikes in the picture instead of the 4000 that go over them at peak hours. It\u2019s the wild west out there. The only rule any one seems to be aware of is the right of the strongest. Lesson: If you want to make your city a cycling city. Don\u2019t underestimate the infrastructure and the traffic rules needed to facilitate save cycling on a massive scale. Oh...and enforce those rules. - Xaffax Darkstar  Other cycle-friendly cities suggested by our readers included: Bologna, Inssbruck, Cambridge, Groningen, Lille, Dublin, Madrid, Aarhus, Quito, Canberra, Bremen, Ravenna, Zurich, Calgary, Bordeaux, Freiburg, Adelaide, Derby, and Lyon.

Or dominant) we at Guardian US thought we\u2019d run a series of articles for newer football fans wishing to improve their knowledge of the game\u2019s history and storylines, hopefully in a way that doesn\u2019t patronise you to within an inch of your life. A warning: If you\u2019re the kind of person that finds The Blizzard too populist this may not be the series for you. It\u2019s quite possible that a footballing genius from Argentina will dominate the Champions League final this weekend. \u2018Twas ever thus. The current generation will tell you that Barcelona forward Lionel Messi is the greatest player in the history of Europe\u2019s No 1 club competition, and perhaps the greatest player of all time. They may have a point. Then again, quite a few older folk will tell you how Alfredo Di Stefano would have had something to say about that. Di Stefano was the first star of the European Cup. Uefa launched their new competition \u2013 the European Cup would morph into the Champions League in 1992 \u2013 back in 1955. Chelsea, the English champions, didn\u2019t bother entering, because the big cheese of the Football League, Alan Hardaker, was a myopic little-Englander fool who couldn\u2019t (or didn\u2019t want to) see what was happening on the other side of the English Channel. Hardaker went on to launch the League Cup in an attempt to see off Uefa\u2019s new continent-wide midweek club competition, and that illustrates his judgment perfectly. Anyway, Chelsea meekly followed orders not to bother going toe-to-toe with Johnny Foreigner. Their decision looks daft now, but perhaps it was just as well. Ted Drake\u2019s champions could only finish 16th in the league the following season; chances are they\u2019d have gotten steamrollered by Di Stefano\u2019s Real Madrid. Real Madrid dominated the early days of the European Cup, winning the first five finals, and Di Stefano \u2013 who wore the number nine shirt as a nominal striker, but in fact roamed wild and free \u2013 was their main man. Not that Real always had it easy. The very first final proved a hell of a struggle. It was a minor classic. Real faced Stade de Reims of France, and found themselves two down within 10 minutes. Reims\u2019 star playmaker Raymond Kopa was pulling the strings, Michel Leblond scored the first-ever goal in a European Cup final after six minutes, and Jean Templin added another. But Di Stefano quickly grabbed a goal back. Real equalised. Michel Hidalgo \u2013 who would go on win Euro 84 as France boss \u2013 put Reims ahead again just after the hour, but Marquitos levelled for Real on 71, before Rial tucked away a Francisco Gento cross with 11 minutes left. Di Stefano, a month away from his 30th birthday, went home and spent his win bonus on his first car.     Real Madrid\u2019s Alfredo di Stefano celebrates Real\u2019s sixth goal as Eintracht Frankfurt goalkeeper Egon Loy appeals to his defenders for help Photograph: SMG/Press Association Images    Di Stefano was unstoppable. (Bobby Charlton has him down as the greatest player in history, even if he never played at a World Cup.) He scored again in the 1957 final victory over Fiorentina, the 1958 win over Milan, and the 1959 triumph against Reims. The best was saved for last, though. The 1960 final between Real Madrid and Eintracht Frankfurt is the most storied European Cup final of all, Real winning 7-3 in front of 127,621 spectators at Hampden Park in Glasgow. (A young Alex Ferguson was in the crowd, jaw agape at what Real were up to against a side which had battered his childhood favourites Rangers 10-4 on aggregate in the semis.) In truth, the 1960 final wasn\u2019t much of a contest, more an exhibition of absurd brilliance. Eintracht took the lead through Richard Kress on 18 minutes, but Di Stefano responded with a quickfire double, and the great Ferenc Puskas (some forward line, this) made it 3-1 before half time. Di Stefano went on to complete a hat-trick, while Puskas helped himself to four. At one point, Erwin Stein pulled a goal back to make the score 6-2; Real countered by kicking off, stringing five quick passes together near the centre circle, then sending Di Stefano away on a determined run, the ball eventually sent whistling into the bottom-right corner from distance. Perfection. Real Madrid finally got knocked out of Europe for the first time by \u2013 who else could it be? \u2013 Barcelona. The Catalans reached the 1961 final, but lost to the new European powerhouse Benfica. The Lisbon club\u2019s flame only burnt briefly, however. The great Eusebio turned up the season after, and inspired a second-half comeback as Benfica beat Real Madrid, for whom Puskas had scored a hat-trick, 5-3. Puskas remains the only player to have scored three times in a final and yet end up on the losing side. Benfica, meanwhile, are still waiting for another European trophy. Benfica lost the 1963 final to Milan. The Italians had arrived, and would shape the narrative of the decade. Milan\u2019s city rivals Internazionale, a thoroughly modern defensive outfit, won the next two finals against Real Madrid and Benfica. It wasn\u2019t that they didn\u2019t sparkle in attack when it suited them \u2013 Sandro Mazzola and Jair were no mean partnership \u2013 but their signature tactic was catenaccio, a five-man defensive lock designed by their brazenly cynical manager Helenio Herrera. This no-nonsense style turned Inter into the pantomime villains of Europe, a state of affairs which set up the 1967 final in Lisbon nicely. They faced Jock Stein\u2019s swashbuckling Celtic, and the tale told was a pure roundheads-versus-cavaliers romp. Inter took an early lead, decided to sit back, and were utterly pummelled by Stein\u2019s side, who came at them from all angles. They took 42 attempts at goal. Inter managed five. It took a while, but Inter eventually buckled in the second half, Celtic winning 2-1, one of the great romantic victories. Real Madrid had, in winning the previous year\u2019s final against Partizan Belgrade with 11 Spanish players, become the first home-grown team to win the European Cup. Celtic\u2019s Lisbon Lions ramped it up: they were all born within 27 miles of Parkhead. Scottish football\u2019s high-water mark, without any shadow of a doubt. And it was the first time the trophy had been spirited away from Latin Europe, the north rising. Manchester United lifted the trophy in 1968, a delicious end to Matt Busby\u2019s bittersweet quest, which had begun in 1956, United refusing to buckle to the small-minded pressure that had done for Chelsea and heading off for a European tour. Understandably, that quest had became an emotional obsession after the tragic loss of the Busby Babes at Munich in 1958. George Best scored the signature goal of the 68 final, sashaying through to land the decisive blow at the start of extra time, Benfica subsequently crumbling to a 4-1 defeat. Eusebio really should have won it at the end of normal time, mind you, but clean through, he shot straight at Alex Stepney. United\u2019s reign as European champions ended at Old Trafford in the following season\u2019s semis against Milan, though they\u2019ll always tell you that Denis Law\u2019s shot crossed the line. Milan went on to thrash Ajax of Amsterdam in the final, 4-1, Johan Cruyff\u2019s side not quite perfecting the old Total Football just yet.     Johan Cruyff views with Francesco Morini in 1973. Photograph: Stewart Fraser/Colorsport    The 1970s began with Feyenoord\u2019s shock 2-1 win over Celtic, but this decade was all about imperial phases. Cruyff and Ajax finally got themselves up to speed, and won three on the bounce between 1971 and 1973, Panathinaikos, Inter and Juventus vanquished. Ajax\u2019s performance during the first 20 minutes of the 73 final against Juventus is legendary, one of the most mesmeric passages of play in history, total domination. They scored just the one goal, though, before appearing to get a little bored of their own brilliance. A 1-0 win would do, but there laid bare was the germ of the problem that cost Holland victory in the 1974 World Cup final. Then it was the turn of Bayern Munich: Franz Beckenbauer, Gerd M\u00fcller, Paul Breitner, Uli Hoeness, Sepp Maier, all that. They\u2019d win three in a row, too, though they very nearly didn\u2019t manage the first. Atletico Madrid \u2013 not for the last time, as we shall see \u2013 were seconds away from victory in the 1974 final, only for Georg Schwarzenbeck, a central defender, to desperately try his luck from 30 yards. Atl\u00e9tico keeper Miguel Reina \u2013 father of 2007 Liverpool finalist Pepe \u2013 stood rooted to the spot, and the final went to a replay for the first and only time. Bayern thrashed Atl\u00e9tico 4-0 in the second match, the high point an exquisite lob from the majestic M\u00fcller. Bayern saw off Leeds United in 1975 \u2013 controversially so, as Peter Lorimer scored what would have been the game\u2019s opener, only for it to be ruled out for a questionable offside call on Billy Bremner \u2013 and Saint-\u00c9tienne in 1976. At which point the English hove into view. So far, Manchester United were the only English team to win the trophy. That was about to change in some style, as England won seven of the next eight finals. Liverpool \u2013 boasting the buzzing menace of Kevin Keegan, and one of the most underrated midfielders of all time in Terry McDermott \u2013 dismissed Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach with panache in 1977, then held onto their trophy a year later by beating Club Brugge. Keegan had gone, but no matter: Graeme Souness and Kenny Dalglish had arrived, the former setting up the latter for a can-opener of a winner. Liverpool were hot favourites to match the hat-trick feats of Ajax and Bayern, but they had their hands prised off the big cup by Brian Clough\u2019s Nottingham Forest, who went on to win back-to-back cups themselves. Forest stand tall as the smallest club to win the European Cup, and the only one to win Uefa\u2019s big prize more often than their own domestic league championship (it\u2019s two to one on that score). That takes some doing. Bob Paisley and Carlo Ancelotti both have three European Cup wins to their name, but pound for pound, Clough was surely the European Cup\u2019s greatest manager. Even if the actual finals, one-goal wins over Malm\u00f6 and Kevin Keegan\u2019s Hamburg, were rather forgettable (though the goal scored by tobacco\u2019s John Robertson in the latter is worth seeking out). Liverpool reclaimed the cup in 1981, full-back Alan Kennedy the unlikely scorer of the winner, chipping in from an acute angle with eight minutes to go against a non-vintage Real Madrid. Kennedy was the hero again in 1984, as Liverpool beat Roma on penalties in Roma\u2019s own back yard of the Stadio Olimpico; Kennedy scored the decisive spot-kick. This was almost certainly Liverpool\u2019s signature performance in Europe, Souness wandering the midfield with a haughty strut, letting nothing pass. Check out his penalty in the shoot-out, whipped into the top-right corner. Imagine possessing the stones to execute that one.         Graeme Souness: now that\u2019s how to take a penalty.    In between those Liverpool wins, Aston Villa beat Bayern in 1982, the Bavarians beginning what would become a long tradition of freezing in the final, while Hamburg saw off Juventus in 1983. After it, in 1985, came the horror of Heysel, as 39 supporters, nearly all of them Juve fans, were crushed under a collapsed wall, Liverpool fans having charged at them across the crumbling terraces of a stadium that was never fit for purpose. Michel Platini scored a penalty that was awarded for a trip outside the box, Juve won 1-0, and nobody much cared. English clubs were asked to stay away for a few years. RIP the 39. Barcelona hoped to win their first-ever European Cup in 1986, but missed all of their penalties in a slapstick shoot-out against Steaua Bucharest, who became the first eastern Europeans to make off with the trophy. Bayern lost another final in 1987; they were 13 minutes from victory against unfancied Porto when Rabah Madjer scored with an impudent backflick, one of the iconic goals, and soon enough shipped a second to go down 2-1.          Rabah Madjer: cheeky.    Then a run of fairly miserable finals. PSV Eindhoven beat Benfica on penalties after a spirit-sapping goal-free final in 1988. The great Milan team of Marco van Basten, Ruud Gullit and Frank Rijkaard steamrollered Steaua 4-0 in 1989, a one-sided non-event, then squeaked past Benfica in 1990. Neither victory fairly represents the sheer magnificence of that Milan side, but back-to-back European Cups are back-to-back European Cups. Nobody\u2019s managed it since. The 1991 final matched 1988 as a total misfire, which was a shame, as eventual winners Red Star Belgrade were a class act when on song. Red Star defender Miodrag Belodedici became the first player to win the European Cup with two clubs, having done so with Steaua four years earlier. It was the only noteworthy point of the match. Red Star beat Marseille on penalty kicks. Then the last-ever European Cup final, before the tournament was rebranded as the Champions League. Seeing Real Madrid had so dominated the early years, it was perhaps fitting that Barcelona got a sniff of the old-school action before it was too late. Ronald Koeman swept home an extra-time free kick at Wembley to see off Sampdoria \u2013 and so to Uefa\u2019s fancy new tournament: the Champions League. We\u2019re 23 years in now, and still no team has done what Real Madrid, Benfica, Internazionale, Ajax, Bayern Munich, Liverpool, Nottingham Forest or Milan did during the European Cup years, and win two finals in a row. So imperial phases have been harder to come by. A lot of clubs have given it a good go, though. Italy tried its best in the early days. Milan contested three finals in a row between 1993 and 1995, losing two of them, in 1993 to Marseille and Louis van Gaal\u2019s young Ajax in 1995. But those defeats sandwiched a 4-0 thrashing of Barcelona which stands as the most dominant display of the modern era, Dejan Savicevic scoring one and making the other three. That Barca side contained Ronald Koeman, Pep Guardiola, Hristo Stoichkov and Romario \u2013 and hardly got a kick. Juventus were the next to try their luck, also making three finals in a row. They took Ajax\u2019s title off them in 1996, but lost the next two despite starting both matches as favourites. The 1997 final was a memorable romp, Borussia Dortmund registering a 3-1 shock, Lars Ricken raking one in from 40 yards, Alessandro del Piero back-flicking a saucy consolation goal in the Madjer class. The 1998 final wasn\u2019t so great, but did end Real Madrid\u2019s 32-year wait for a seventh title, and so marks the beginning of the super club era, where organisations such as Real began growing into the modern behemoths they are today. Alex Ferguson\u2019s greatest Manchester United side \u2013 built around that midfield of Giggs, Scholes, Keane and Beckham \u2013 should probably have dominated around the turn of the millennium, but they had to settle for a single victory. Still, what a victory: that night in Barcelona, Teddy Sheringham and Ole Gunnar Solskjaer scoring in the final minutes of the 1999 final to turn certain defeat against Bayern Munich into the most widescreen of wins. It was definitely the most dramatic. The first final between two teams from the same nation occurred in 2000, Real Madrid seeing off Spanish rivals Valencia with ease, 3-0. Steve McManaman scored a typically insouciant effort in that game, and at the time plenty of folk wondered if a goal scored by their former charge would be the closest Liverpool, down on their luck after being once so dominant in Europe\u2019s top competition, would ever achieve anything in the new Champions League. Hmm. Valencia lost the final again in 2001, Bayern Munich finally managing to see the job through after those failures against Aston Villa, Porto and Manchester United. Real Madrid revisited Hampden in 2002, and produced something almost as memorable as 1960, Zinedine Zidane skelping home a spectacular volley of angular precision to see off Bayer Leverkusen. Poor Neverkusen, who managed to come runners-up domestically in both league and cup that season as well. Their star turn Michael Ballack also managed to get himself suspended from that summer\u2019s World Cup final.         Zinedine Zidane scores a screamer in 2002.    A couple of fairly mundane finals followed. A defensive grind in 2003 between Milan and Juventus, straight outta the 1960s, saw the former prevail on penalty kicks. A one-sided nonsense between Porto and Monaco, 3-0, is chiefly remembered now for Jos\u00e9 Mourinho announcing himself in the big league. But it was worth waiting: 2005 would prove to be the craziest final in history, Milan thoroughly dominant as they romped to a three-goal lead against Liverpool, only for Steven Gerrard, Didi Hamann and Jerzy Dudek to have the games of their lives. More on that here; Field Notes simply doesn\u2019t have the room or energy to tell the story again.   Related: The miracle of Istanbul    This sparked a period of English domin\u2026 well, no, not quite domination, not like the late 70s and early 80s. But Premier League clubs did start reaching a lot of finals again. Arsenal were 14 minutes from the title in 2006, despite Jens Lehmann having been sent off early in the first half, but Barcelona turned it round late on. Milan took their revenge on Liverpool in 2007, winning 2-1 in Athens; you could argue that the better team lost in both of their finals. All fair enough, then. The first all-English final came along in 2008. Manchester United\u2019s victory on penalties over Chelsea wasn\u2019t up there with their previous two iconic wins, the game\u2019s one memorable moment being John Terry\u2019s risible technique-free attempt to win the cup from the spot, a slip that cost the Londoners everything. You have to admire their fans\u2019 subsequent chutzpah in belting out that Steven Gerrard number. Short memories.     John Terry in 2008: gutted. Photograph: Tom Jenkins/Guardian    United were simply brilliant in the defence of their title in 2009 against Barcelona. For 10 minutes. But Cristiano Ronaldo couldn\u2019t put away his early chances, and Samuel Eto\u2019o\u2019s 10-minute goal turned the tide. Barcelona won 2-0, and when the pair met again two years later, the Spaniards declared at 3-1, Ajax-73 style, utterly dominant, the job done. Messi scored in both final appearances; you wouldn\u2019t bet too much against him making it three from three against Juventus this weekend. But United were a force of nature under Alex Ferguson for the best part of two decades; a return of just two European Cups during that period seems awfully low. But then it goes to show just how hard it is to win the damn thing in the first place. Meanwhile, it was back to bad habits for Bayern, who were thoroughly outplayed by Mourinho\u2019s Internazionale in 2010, then had their pockets picked on their own doorstep in 2012, Chelsea finally bringing the trophy to London after 57 years after their former player Arjen Robben missed an extra-time penalty. Robben eased his and Bayern\u2019s pain 12 months later, scoring the late winner to see off Borussia Dortmund. Bayern\u2019s fifth win meant only Real Madrid and Milan had won more European Cups and Champions Leagues. Only Benfica and Juventus have lost as many finals (five). It\u2019s a strange record Bayern boast. This time last year, Real Madrid won their 10th trophy, whipping it from under the noses of city rivals Atl\u00e9ti, who in a callback to 1974 once again conceded a late, late equaliser when the cup was all but theirs. On Saturday we\u2019ll find out whether Barcelona will replace their great enemy as European champions, joining Liverpool and Bayern Munich on five wins. Juventus meanwhile look to join Inter and Manchester United on three wins, and avoid becoming the least successful finalist of all by suffering a record sixth loss.

When she came across the real del Cossa, who painted frescoes for the magnificently named Palazzo Schifanoia or \u201cPalace of Not Being Bored\u201d in Ferrara, Smith found the germ of a character who would help her write a book in which time is not so much chronological as layered \u2013 a metaphysical comfort for those who, like George, have lost loved ones or, like Francesco, lost themselves. Francesco\u2019s consciousness erupts into the 21st century, in a great rush of appropriately stream-of-consciousness prose, to remember a life of gender disguise and artistic endeavours, and observe George, in modern-day galleries, staring back through the centuries at Renaissance art. George\u2019s iPad, with which she can capture and create thousands of images in an hour, seems to Francesco born of a time when pictures were painstakingly created for those who could pay, \u201ca holy votive tablet\u201d. Throughout the book Smith yanks together consciousnesses and sense impressions that are separated by half a millennium, and takes the reader delightedly along with her. It\u2019s a playful, serious, deep and whimsical book, and a wonderful achievement.", "sentences": ["The title piece, in which a teenager has a tender first lesbian experience on the Amsterdam sex tourism trail, was an early example of her talent for quiet surprises."], "title": "Ali Smith's joyful curiosity about language, love and everything else", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/03/ali-smith-baileys-fiction-prize", "tags": ["Ali Smith", "Books", "Culture", "Awards and prizes", "Baileys women's prize for fiction 2015", "Baileys women's prize for fiction", "Fiction", "Women's prize for fiction"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-06-05T11:00:13Z", "article": "Recently the writer and literary critic Ruth Franklin, author of the forthcoming biography of the writer Shirley Jackson, wanted to take her nine-year-old daughter out of the city for a while. She chose the unassuming Catskills town of Hobart, New York, as her destination.  With six bookstores, an art gallery, a coffee spot that serves breakfast and lunch, and the recent purchase of a building that\u2019s to be renovated into a proper English pub by the new owners, the town has undergone an unlikely transformation into something akin to an English village. \u201cAt first we were a little disappointed that it was smaller than we expected,\u201d Franklin told the Guardian by email. \u201cBut as soon as we started looking in the bookstores, we got pretty excited. My daughter picked up copies of the Green, Yellow and Rose Fairy Books, which she had never encountered before.\u201d  Her daughter browsed the children\u2019s sections; Franklin found a first edition of Shirley Jackson\u2019s We Have Always Lived in the Castle from Adams\u2019 Antiquarian. \u201cWe spent around $100 and came home with about two dozen books,\u201d Franklin added, a respectable haul.  Surrounded by red barns, silos and pasturing animals, and nestled between verdant hills and the west branch of the Delaware River, the main street of Hobart runs parallel to the former railway line turned into the meandering Catskills Scenic Trail. According to Hobart\u2019s one-man booster squad (and real estate investor and bookstore owner), Don Dales, the only business open in Hobart in 1999 was a diner run by an eccentric woman who would duck down behind the counter and turn off the lights if she saw a stranger approaching her establishment. \u201cHobart was essentially a ghost town,\u201d he says. Over the years, Dales began buying up the inexpensive retail storefronts in town, explaining: \u201cI\u2019ve got a bee in my bonnet to do something with Hobart,\u201d and began giving retail space away. But even a year of free rent didn\u2019t lure businesses and many of his renters didn\u2019t pay their electricity bills. Enter Diana and Bill Adams, a lawyer and a physician, respectively, married New York City residents who drove through Hobart on a weekend trip in 2000, and then again visited the area in 2001 for a wedding. Despite having demanding full-time jobs, they saw a retail space (not owned by Dales) on Hobart\u2019s Main Street and rented it on the spot. Then they made an offer on a house up the road and closed on it the week before 9/11.  \u201cIt was spontaneous,\u201d says Diana Adams of their entry into Hobart and professional book-selling. The Adamses Antiquarian bookshop opened in 2002. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know what we were doing. Now retired from their previous careers, and New York City, Bill Adams adds: \u201cOur aim was to buy books and afford to travel and buy new books.\u201d  A few years later Dales decided to get into the book-selling business himself. \u201cThe way the Adams tell the story, I was sitting down there having tea one day and said: \u2018Well, no one is renting these stores for free, so dammit, I\u2019ll do it myself.\u2019\u201d The Adamses confirm his story. Dales opened two bookstores and when two other bookstores were added to the mix in 2005 Hobart Book Village was born. Since then the bookstores have come and gone, been bought and sold, and merged and melded. Dennis Lauchman, owner of Butternut Valley Books, who sells much his selection online and at books and ephemera shows, was convinced to open his Hobart location last year by the Adams. \u201cSelling online is more efficient, but this is much more fun. And the Adamses do so much promotion for the town, it makes it worth it,\u201d he says.  Now celebrating their 10th anniversary a book village, there are six bookstores, a book village dog and two book village cats, and business has grown every year since the village\u2019s founding. At the Adamses Antiquarian Book Shop, there are three browsable floors of fine books at a variety of price points. The Adamses regularly make buying trips to England, and their special focus is on rare Greek and Latin books. \u201cTo say we\u2019re becoming known for them is an overstatement, but they represent a high percentage of our sales,\u201d says Diana Adams.  At Blenheim Hill Books, co-owned by retired Rutgers professors, Barbara J Balliet and poet Cheryl Clarke, the selection is more general, with some collectibles on subjects ranging from gardens to photography. \u201cWe bought the stock and weeded it down,\u201d says Clarke. \u201cWe also have a barn that\u2019s full of books.\u201d Clarke and Balliet are also the organizers of Hobart\u2019s annual Festival of Women Writers, with Clarke\u2019s sister, the writer Breena Clarke. In its third year, the festival takes place the weekend after Labor Day and in 2014 drew more than 100 writers to the village. Liberty Rocks Books opened in 2014 and has a newly renovated 5,000 sq ft space, a broad selection of used and antiquarian books, an art gallery, a small display of contemporary fine press publications from Brooklyn\u2019s Ugly Duckling Presse, and a wing called the Hobart Booksellers Emporium, with shelves available to be rented out by other dealers. One of the first occupants of the wing is a micro-bookstore of six shelves of books by and about James Joyce.  There are more specialized stores, too. Around the World with Books and Cooks is a bookstore cooperative run by three other sellers and carries foreign language books for adult and children and vintage cookbooks in English. Butternut Valley Books is a small but jam-packed store full of old books, maps and paper ephemera. Lauchman lives 40 miles away, and spent many years selling books outdoors in Haarlem, Amsterdam. Mysteries &amp; More is owned by Don Dales himself and is stocked with vintage mysteries, suspense, thrillers and science fiction. It\u2019s also home to Big Red, the detective cat. Like the other bookstores Dales has owned in Hobart, he notes that Mysteries &amp; More is for sale. One of the things that both delights and worries the booksellers of Hobart is the frequent comparison to the much larger and well-established book village of Hay-on-Wye in Wales on the English border. They don\u2019t want to disappoint visitors. Even though they took loose inspiration from the village when they started opening bookstores, and like Hay, they added a festival and lecture series to its offerings, the scale is much different and always will be (Hay-on-Wye has a population of 1,900, and over 20 bookstores in town as well as other businesses). Its festival draws thousands. Hobart is a village of 441 and still is seeking a variety of businesses to help fill out the Main Street, like the planned English pub, to truly become a weekend destination. Despite being three and a half hours from Brooklyn (and a healthy drive beyond the reach of ongoing hipsterfication of Kingston and other similar Catskills towns like Phoenicia and Woodstock), Diana Adams says a significant percentage of their visitors are from Brooklyn, many of whom do make the tie to the Welsh book village.  Adams concurs: \u201cYou just can\u2019t imagine how much like England it is. It\u2019s beautiful and it\u2019s changed our lives.\u201d", "sentences": ["Lauchman lives 40 miles away, and spent many years selling books outdoors in Haarlem, Amsterdam."], "title": "Welcome to Hobart, New York: America's burgeoning book village", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/jun/05/hobart-new-york-book-village-hay-on-wye", "tags": ["New York", "Books", "Culture", "New York holidays", "Wales", "UK news", "United States holidays", "US news", "World news", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-06-05T11:26:00Z", "article": "The first time Luis Su\u00e1rez went to the Camp Nou he sneaked in through an open door and took a picture of the empty stadium while his girlfriend, Sofia, nervously urged him to hurry up. Then they dashed off before anyone caught them. The last time Luis Su\u00e1rez was at the Camp Nou, six days ago, there were pictures taken too but this time was different. There were 98,000 people there, no hurry and they were feted not furtive, surrounded by photographers and joined by their children Delfina and Benjam\u00edn. They were joined too by the Copa del Rey, the second trophy of Su\u00e1rez\u2019s first season at FC Barcelona. On Saturday night, he will seek his third against Juventus in Berlin, as many major trophies in nine months as in the rest of his nine-year European career combined. Su\u00e1rez has won the Uruguayan league, the Dutch Cup, the English League Cup and the Eredivisie \u2013 a title Ajax clinched five months after he had departed for Liverpool. Player of the Year in Holland and England, Copa Am\u00e9rica champion and Player of the Tournament in 2011, much has happened since he first crossed the Atlantic in December 2003, but not really club success. It has taken him a long time for him to get where he wanted to be. Su\u00e1rez was 16 and still two years from his Nacional debut when he first visited Barcelona and left vowing to return. He is 28 now. Sofia\u2019s family emigrated to Catalonia that October, setting up home in Castelldefels on the coast just outside the city and, heartbroken, Su\u00e1rez determined to play in Europe to be near her. Twelve years later, via Groningen, Amsterdam and Liverpool, they too live in Castelldefels, in a rented house by the beach. And Su\u00e1rez, desperate for success, fearing that time was slipping away, has reached his first Champions League final. \u201cThis is incredible,\u201d he says. \u201cHaving come to this stadium since I was very young, it\u2019s a dream.\u201d On the face of things, it might have appeared set to be a nightmare. As the semi-finals ended, familiar men awaited. Not the Liverpool team-mates Su\u00e1rez was convinced he would meet at some stage, but two men who have arguably marked his career more than any others.              As it turns out, a season that did not start until late October because of the three-month ban for biting Giorgio Chiellini at the World Cup will not now end with them meeting again, because the Italian has suffered a calf strain. Patrice Evra will be there, though. Chiellini forgave Su\u00e1rez quickly, even criticising the ban, while Evra insisted that he had no problem shaking Su\u00e1rez\u2019s hand but that he would ensure he \u201cfeels me on the pitch\u201d. Su\u00e1rez himself has said nothing, choosing not to give interviews before the final. This week Javier Mascherano spoke for him. \u201cFor Luis, that\u2019s the past,\u201d the Argentinian said. \u201cHe is old enough that you do not need to say anything to him about it. He is responsible for his behaviour, and this game is not special for him because of the players he has in front of him but because it is a final, his first.\u201d It is not just a first final; before this season, he had played only 10 games in this competition \u2013 including qualifying rounds \u2013 and none in the knockout phase. No one anticipated this season ending like this, with a double won and a European Cup final to come, nor with Su\u00e1rez playing such a significant role, even at \u20ac81m. The ban conditioned his debut season. Unable to train with his team-mates until the court of arbitration for sport modified the sanction, he worked alone in two city gyms and ran along the seafront and through the hills. He did not make his debut until 25 October and, although he provided an early assist for Neymar, Barcelona were defeated in the cl\u00e1sico against Real Madrid. Su\u00e1rez had started on the right and his role was ill-defined. It took him six games to score, against Apoel in the Champions League, and seven league games before he got off the mark. In late autumn he finished matches exhausted and frustrated, his effort appreciated but not always effective, nor reciprocated. And although he was providing assists, the goals were missing. With Lionel Messi going inside and Su\u00e1rez seeking space out of his way, the pieces hadn\u2019t fallen into place. By the turn of the year, Su\u00e1rez had scored just three times. Since then, he has scored 21. He scored the winner against Real Madrid, a goal that set up the title. He scored twice in Manchester against City and twice in Paris against PSG, both of them superb goals preceded by brilliant nutmegs. He provided two assists for Neymar in Munich, and laid on another in last week\u2019s Copa del Rey final. His statistics going into the final read: 42 games, 24 goals, 21 assistst is more than that, too. Su\u00e1rez provides the aggression and work-rate that was not always there before, his attitude and movement contagious, leading the pressure to get the ball back quickly and creating space for others. He has never been a static striker; now less than ever before. Among the many words that describe him, \u201cmomentum\u201d is among the most important. There\u2019s a touch of Samuel Eto\u2019o about him, the forward line now closer to Henry-Messi-Eto\u2019o than any of those that followed. For a footballer who may be among the best five in the world, Su\u00e1rez plays like a footballer who considers himself among the worst five in the world. \u201cWe may not be the best technically but we know that for balls no one can beat us,\u201d he says of the Uruguayan footballing culture. It is different from the Barcelona model but necessary too, even if he has been moved to apologise for his touch in training sessions. Johan Cruyff once claimed that he signed Hristo Stoichkov for his \u201cbad milk\u201d, that touch of nastiness and competitiveness his team lacked, and Su\u00e1rez is similar. \u201cHis character is useful for a team like us, which is colder,\u201d Luis Enrique said. Su\u00e1rez embodies the shift in style that had Pep Guardiola describing Barcelona as the \u201cbest counterattacking team in the world\u201d. For much of the season that was seen almost as a betrayal, but not any more. Now it is seen as the nuance, the variation, that Luis Enrique claims it to be. Now, Su\u00e1rez is seen as vital, a huge success, fundamental for the collective functioning. The trio is the image of this team now. Last Saturday night, the photograph everyone wanted to capture was of Messi, Neymar and Su\u00e1rez with the Copa del Rey. They had sought out the same shot after the game that clinched the league title, even with Su\u00e1rez sitting it out through injury. And on Saturday, they\u2019ll hope to complete the set. Three by three. With Messi going back towards the right and Su\u00e1rez into the middle \u2013 a decision the Uruguayan attributed to Messi \u2013 the three have found their roles interlocking perfectly, the ideal complement to each other. Off the pitch, the relationship is good too. Su\u00e1rez is a team-mates\u2019 team-mate. He, Messi and Mascherano share mate together, the bitter green tea so beloved of Argentinians and Uruguayans, Messi\u2019s and Su\u00e1rez\u2019s kids go to the same nursery, and soon the family will move into a new home near Messi. \u201cHaving those three up front absolutely conditions the way you play,\u201d Xavi said this week, quickly adding: \u201cand that\u2019s a good thing of course.\u201d If some doubted that before, most agree now. Xavi calls them \u201cbeasts\u201d. Piqu\u00e9 describes the basic idea like this: \u201cget them the ball.\u201d \u201cSu\u00e1rez has a vision, touch and an instinctive way of moving that is incredible,\u201d Messi says. \u201cAll three of us offer something different and that makes us better together.\u201d Together they have scored 120 goals, more than any other trio in Spanish football history, and won the double. A third may await. Su\u00e1rez has taken his time and a tortuous route, but he\u2019s here now.", "sentences": ["Twelve years later, via Groningen, Amsterdam and Liverpool, they too live in Castelldefels, in a rented house by the beach."], "title": "Luis Su\u00e1rez\u2019s European journey finds its apex at last in Champions League final", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/05/luis-suarez-champions-league-final-berlin", "tags": ["Luis Su\u00e1rez", "Barcelona", "Champions League", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-06-05T19:13:29Z", "article": "Last spring, when one US dollar got you a paltry \u20ac0.72, Americans visiting to Paris needed to fork out $17 for a \u20ac12 entrance ticket to the permanent collections of the Louvre. Today the same ticket will set them back barely $13. Likewise, a reasonable three-star hotel in Rome: perhaps $350 last year, more like $275 this. Or three courses for two \u2013 plus a few beers \u2013 in one of an Amsterdam eetcafe: about $100 just 18 months ago but $75 now.  \u201cEurope feels like it\u2019s on sale this year for Americans,\u201d said Barrie Seidenberg, CEO of Viator, a US-based company that allows tourists to pre-book entrance tickets to the big attractions and small-group \u201cjump the queue\u201d tours before leaving home. As the euro currency sinks ever closer to parity with the dollar, the fact that a European vacation is now about 25% cheaper than it was last year has not escaped the attention of US holidaymakers. Although for some of the old world\u2019s more popular attractions, that could cause problems.  Over the last bank holiday weekend, the Wall Street Journal reported, the Palace of Versailles \u2013 despite recently investing \u20ac15m to revamp its entrance hall \u2013 was forced to post a message on its website asking tourists not already armed with an advance ticket to postpone their visit, or at least to confine it to the gardens. Versailles, the resplendent centre of French royal power until the 1789 revolution, drew more than 7.5 million visitors to its palace and gardens in 2013.  But even that was comfortably exceeded by the world\u2019s busiest museum, the Louvre, which is expecting to welcome well over 9 million people this year. Seidenberg said searches and bookings on the company\u2019s site for attractions like the Louvre and the Sistine Chapel in Rome were up by 60%, while advance sales for the Eiffel Tower had soared by 170% this year.  \u201cParis is on fire,\u201d she said. \u201cBut really any place in Europe that people feel is iconic, that they have to see, and especially any place they fear there might be queues ... Much as people want to see the Sistine Chapel, they don\u2019t want to queue for five hours in the Roman sun first.\u201d Savvier American visitors have already learned that advance booking is now essential. \u201cWe planned it all online months ago from the US,\u201d said Cindy Sohn, who is from southern California and visiting Paris with friends.  \u201cWe spent two weekends meeting up over a bottle of wine deciding what to do, then I spent a day on museum websites booking everything for scheduled time slots.\u201d Add to the surging US influx the growing number of Asian (particularly Chinese) holidaymakers eager to tour Europe\u2019s most famous attractions, and it is hard to see how the visitor experience at many of Europe\u2019s more venerable \u2013 and overcrowded \u2013 landmarks is not going to suffer.     The Palace of Versailles recently asked prospective visitors, who had not bought an advance ticket, to consider postponing their visit. Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters    Some tourists plainly have a miserable enough time already. \u201cThe lines are total chaos with little help from the staff and I couldn\u2019t really advance purchase in this case: the website is terrible,\u201d a recent US visitor to the Eiffel Tower wrote on the travel site Tripadvisor.  Another agreed: \u201cLines were crazy, people trying to get you to buy things everywhere, trapping you and begging.\u201d Of the Louvre, one Las Vegas tourist recorded that despite going late in the day, \u201cIt\u2019s chaotic and a madhouse inside. It\u2019s very disorganised too, even if you have the map.\u201d  A visitor from Virginia said the museum was \u201ctotal and utter chaos\u201d and that to see its main draw, the Mona Lisa, visitors should expect to \u201cfight your way through a frenzied crowd pushing and shoving just to get a glimpse of it.\u201d  According to Atout France, the French tourism development agency, a record 3.2 million US tourists visited the country in 2014, encouraged by the euro\u2019s gradual weakening over the course of the year. The number is expected to increase further this year. Anne-Laure Tuncer, director of the agency\u2019s New York bureau, said early indications were that reservations for some categories of flights to France from the US were up by as much as 7% this April compared with last year. \u201cIt\u2019s an indication of the way things are going,\u201d she said. Tuncer added that a recent Gallup poll showed 82% of Americans had a broadly favourable image of France and the strong dollar-euro exchange rate was \u201ca real bonus\u201d.  The impact should be felt not just in increased tourist numbers, she said, but \u201cin upgrades \u2013 people tend to book more excursions, for example, or a better class of hotel. They\u2019re easier with their money.\u201d      Rome\u2019s Sistine Chapel now stays open until nearly midnight for one day each week to help deal with its 6 million visitors a year. Photograph: Musei Vaticani/Ansa/Claudio Peri/EPA    In Venice, Florida-based tour organisers Randall and Dorothy Smith said their business had done well this year because the trips it runs, booked a year in advance with prices locked down in euros, are paid for only 30 days before they begin. \u201cThis year has been a banner year,\u201d Randall said. \u201cThere\u2019s money to be made.\u201d For tourist attractions, there is also money to be spent. The Louvre is currently in the throes of a major \u00a340m renovation programme aimed at helping it handle up to 14 million visitors a year \u2013 more than three times the number it was getting at the turn of the century.  According to the museum, up to 40,000 people a day now jostle to see the Mona Lisa alone \u2013 funnelled towards it by a visitor flow system redesigned last year specifically to reflect the fact that, for many visitors to the Louvre, the enigmatic smile is all they really want to see. In Amsterdam, the celebrated Rijksmuseum reopened last year after a monumental \u00a3275m revamp that should allow it to cope with up to 5 million visitors a year. Along with several other major museums, it is also considering extending its hours (the Louvre, currently closed on Tuesdays, is thinking about staying open seven days a week).  In Rome, the Sistine Chapel, expected to pull in 6 million visitors this year, is now staying open until nearly midnight one day a week. Even attractions outside city centres are also noticing a rise in US visitors. The Fondation Claude Monet, which runs the impressionist\u2019s house and garden in Giverny, west of Paris, saw 625,000 visitors in the seven months it was open last year, 20% of them from America. \u201cThis year, the number of US visitors has already risen \u2013 and it\u2019s around 27% of our total so far,\u201d a spokesman said. Italy Just outside of Giolitti, one of the oldest gelaterias in Rome and a top tourist attraction, students Navi Atwal and Julia Spencer, both from California, admitted it was the favourable exchange rate that encouraged them to travel in Italy after their study abroad programme in Spain ended for the year. Spencer said she fully realised just how much the weakened euro helped her finances while she was studying in Spain: her monthly rent in euros stayed the same, but the dollar cheques she was receiving from her parents were buying her more and more. \u201cI would feel like I had more money by the end of the month \u2013 $50 to $70 a month,\u201d she says. \u201cComing here, I knew I had to be really careful with my money. But then later, as the price went down, I could be a little more flexible,\u201d she said. Tennessee newlyweds Kevin Maggard and Sharmaine Hunt say they did not come to Italy especially because of the exchange rate, but noted that lots of people at home had mentioned to them that it was a \u201cgood time to go. You feel like you can spend a little more money,\u201d Hunt said. On their first day in the Eternal City prices at lunch seemed \u201creasonable\u201d and they calculated that an \u20ac8 dish would only set them back about $10 In Venice, Pam Sammartino, from Denver, Colorado, said the exchange rate had definitely helped her budget, allowing her to stay at a nicer hotel \u2013 one with a pool \u2013 than she otherwise would have. But Franco, a gondolier, said whatever the exchange rate, people were spending less money than they used to. The day of long lunches and gondola rides have been replaced by take-out pizza by the slice and public transport, he said. France Like hundreds of others, Scott Sohn, a building contractor from southern California and his wife, Cindy, had been queuing for over half an hour to climb the bell tower of Notre Dame Cathedral. \u201cWe got here well before opening time to stand in line because in the afternoon the line is twice as long,\u201d he said.  The Sohns and their fellow holidaymakers, the Phillipses from Palm Springs, are seasoned travellers from previous trips spent fighting the crowds in Rome. They had seen scores of pre-planned sights from the Normandy D-day beaches to their special queue-jumping pass and guide at the Louvre.  \u201cThere were such crowds in front of the Mona Lisa that you had to push and shove to get close,\u201d Cindy said. \u201cIf I was a first time visitor from the US and I went there on my own, I\u2019m not sure what kind of impression I\u2019d have. There\u2019s a lot of pushing and a lot of tight corners,\u201d Cohn said. At the Louvre, the crowd in front of the Mona Lisa is now almost as famous as the painting. \u201cI took a photo of people taking photos of the Mona Lisa,\u201d said Jon Gabrielson, a major in English and history.  Further back in the queue, Rachel Tierney, an English major from Oshkosh, Wisconsin, said the impressionists at the Mus\u00e9e d\u2019Orsay had proved tricky due to the wall of people taking selfies in front of the works of Degas. \u201cYou couldn\u2019t see anything, we were 30 feet away from the pantings.\u201d  Maggie Finch, an English major in the same group of friends, had been \u201cvery surprised\u201d in London to have to queue for half an hour to get a picture of platform nine and three quarters at Kings Cross station.

They were losing 3-2 with two minutes of normal time remaining. Yet in a finish as wild as it was improbable, the US pulled off their first ever win over Holland. J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann famously likes to set his players stiff challenges. But with another friendly against Germany coming up next week, sending a roster missing many key names to face two of Europe\u2019s top teams seemed to be courting the risk of severe embarrassment. On Friday at the Amsterdam Arena, though, it was Guus Hiddink\u2019s side that was left looking foolish. While the US back line was repeatedly breached by a home side that ought to have scored at least twice more, the visitors did not cave and produced a spirited second-half comeback that exposed the Dutch defence as lackadaisical and disorganised.   Related: Holland 3-4 USA \u2013 as it happened    If at times their attacking play was almost irresistible, even without the injured Arjen Robben, at the other end of the field the Netherlands looked every inch a nation that is languishing in third place in their Euro 2016 qualifying group, five points adrift of second-placed Iceland. Revitalised by late substitutions and some unlikely heroes, the US took advantage and will be in buoyant mood for the exhibition against Germany in Cologne on 10 June, and, surely, their defence of the Concacaf Gold Cup, which starts next month on home soil. As the head coach ponders his options for that tournament, several fringe players enhanced their reputations while the team as a whole showed a stubborn streak that helped compensate for some tactical and technical deficiencies. Though Klinsmann was without the likes of Clint Dempsey, Jozy Altidore, Geoff Cameron and Omar Gonzalez, there was little indication in the early stages that the US would be overmatched by the side that finished third in last year\u2019s World Cup. Michael Bradley hit the post with a shot from the edge of the box after 19 minutes, then Brek Shea found space on the left but aimed his effort too close to goalkeeper Jasper Cillessen. The warning signs for the US were evident though, with orange-clad forwards afforded too much space on almost every attack. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar duly gave the Netherlands the lead after 27 minutes, heading past Brad Guzan after defenders John Brooks and Ventura Alvarado failed to track him tightly enough. The advantage was short lived, as Fabian Johnson\u2019s 34th-minute cross from the right found Gyasi Zardes arriving at the far post, and his surprisingly powerful right-footed stab at the ball squeezed past the goalkeeper. The 23-year-old Los Angeles Galaxy forward\u2019s celebration was strangely low-key, as if he scored goals at this level all the time, but it was his first goal for USA on his sixth appearance. Perhaps the reaction was an attempt to show that performing on a high-profile stage does not faze him. His lively overall display indicated that might well be true. While the US looked promising going forward, the quality of defending was a worry, albeit against such accomplished players as Memphis Depay, Robin van Persie and Huntelaar. Holland pushed hard to regain the lead in the early stages of the second period and Klinsmann\u2019s side cracked within four minutes. Huntelaar scored again with his head, powering the ball high through Guzan\u2019s outstretched arms. After 53 minutes he claimed a hat-trick, crushing a shot from distance that deflected off Depay and went in off the post. But Depay\u2019s inadvertent contribution was so significant that it seemed likely the strike would be credited to Manchester United\u2019s new signing. At this point it seemed probable that the Dutch would go on to burnish the scoreline even farther. But they did not so much take their foot off the gas as apply the handbrake, turn off the engine and throw the key out of the window. The US were rewarded for their persistence with a 70th-minute breakaway goal for John Brooks\u2013- an easy finish to cap a sharp team move, and his first for his country since the fondly-recalled 86th-minute winner against Ghana in Brazil almost a year ago. It prompted a ridiculously open final phase. Cillessen thwarted substitutes Bobby Wood and Jordan Morris, the Stanford University student, before Reading\u2019s Danny Williams claimed his first international goal in the 88th minute via a deflection off Luuk de Jong. Seconds after the restart the PSV Eindhoven forward forced a great save from Guzan with a header, then hit the woodwork on the rebound. The drama was not done, as Morris crossed for Wood, alone in the six-yard box, who scored the winner from close range.", "sentences": ["On Friday at the Amsterdam Arena, though, it was Guus Hiddink\u2019s side that was left looking foolish."], "title": "Holland 3-4 USA | International friendly match report", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jun/05/usa-sink-holland-bobby-wood", "tags": ["USA", "Holland", "Football", "Sport", "US sports"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-06-05T21:57:44Z", "article": "J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann took charge of his 65th game for the USA against the Netherlands with yet another new-look line-up. Here\u2019s what we learned from a wildly entertaining 4-3 victory: 1. It\u2019s all about the result Despite the friendly nature of the contest, Klinsmann had insisted he was concerned as much with the result as the performance, and that it was time for his charges to make some of the top nations sit up and take notice of America\u2019s potential. \u201cThese are the games where we learn the most,\u201d claimed the German coach, and there was plenty for him \u2013 and future opponents \u2013 to take on board in an even-handed first half that finished 1-1, despite the 69-31% possession advantage to the Dutch.   Related: Holland 3-4 USA | International friendly match report    The second period initially yielded a more salutary lesson in the basics of defending and finishing, and all the promise of the opening half evaporated in the space of five minutes shortly after the re-start. But Klinsmann deserves enormous credit for rebuilding from the wreckage of 3-1 down on the fly and his team ultimately showed more clinical poise in front of goal and caused a hesitant Netherlands defence all kinds of problems. Despite being out-shot 27-19 \u2013 a dizzying enough statistic on its own \u2013 the US were never overawed by the team that finished third in last year\u2019s World Cup and fully merited the couple of slices of good fortune off the woodwork that went their way in the closing stages. 2. A striking success Without regular choices Jozy Altidore and Clint Dempsey up front, Klinsmann opted for an adventurous 4-3-3 formation that gave each of Aron Johannsson, Gyasi Zardes and Fabian Johnson a chance to stake a claim. For 33 minutes, it seemed the absent duo had little to fear of losing their places as the rookie attacking trio huffed and puffed, but failed to blow the Dutch house down. But then Johnson served up a delicious right-wing cross and Zardes converted his first international goal with some aplomb. Zardes could have gilded the American lily with an excellent 63rd-minute chance but instead shot straight at the keeper, when a more experiences head like Dempsey\u2019s might have found the inviting spaces to either side. Bobby Wood was then given a chance in place of Johannsson in the final 25 minutes, but it was defender John Brooks who initially showed him the way with a classic counter-attacking goal as the US refused to throw in the towel. A cameo appearance from encouraging college prospect Jordan Morris served notice to an increasingly uncertain Dutch backline, but it was Wood who put the emphatic exclamation point on a stunning comeback, ensuring Klinsmann has plenty of attacking food for thought for this summer\u2019s Gold Cup.   Related: Holland 3-4 USA \u2013 as it happened    3. A defensive nightmare While the US looked comfortable and creative on the ball, the back four creaked, groaned and were split asunder far too easily on more than half-a-dozen occasions, aside from Klaas-Jan Huntelaar\u2019s two emphatic headers and his deflected shot that went in off Memphis Depay and the post. The American right flank was repeatedly exposed and the centre-back pairing of Brooks and Ventura Alvarado discovered that a moment\u2019s hesitation results in a world-class striker like Huntelaar filling his boots. Things went from bad to worse in the second half as Michael Orozco replaced Alvarado and was immediately victimised for Huntelaar\u2019s second, while yet another cross paved the way for the Dutch third and showed an alarming propensity for Klinsmann\u2019s rearguard to dissolve under pressure from out wide. A hastily-reshuffled back four deserve credit for weathering the storm but there were still far too many alarms for goalkeeper Brad Guzan and, ultimately, the likes of Omar Gonzalez, Matt Besler and Geoff Cameron all improved their prospects of Gold Cup playing time by not being in the environs of the Amsterdam Arena. 4. Re-writing the usual story Much of the narrative since last summer\u2019s World Cup has been on the team\u2019s inability to keep the opposition off the scoreboard in the closing stages \u2013 and a susceptibility to costly late-game collapses. Not in Holland. From 3-1 down after 53 minutes, Klinsmann\u2019s men dominated the final 20 and showed far more intensity and hunger to salvage something from the game, earning the final reward of victory when their swarming approach unhinged a febrile Dutch defence. The recovery hinged on Klinsmann initially looking just to stem the tide of home attacks, bringing on DeAndre Yedlin for Brek Shea and reorganising his back four, with Johnson reverting to left-back. It had the galvanising effect of injecting a more attacking threat down the right flank as Tottenham\u2019s little-used full-back enjoyed far more success as an attacking midfielder, and the US coach \u2013 as well as Mauricio Pochettino back in north London \u2013 will have garnered plenty of food for thought. 5. Replacing Tim The US has used no less than five different goalkeepers since Everton\u2019s Tim Howard announced he was taking a year\u2019s international sabbatical following Brazil last summer. None have staked an overwhelming claim to the position, but Brad Guzan, the presumptive successor to the feted Howard who has been limited to just four appearances in the past 11 internationals, did his prospects no harm in Amsterdam, despite having to pick the ball out of the net three times. The Aston Villa stopper was blameless in any of the Dutch strikes, and actually pulled off a series of impressive saves in the face of what seemed an orange barrage on his goal at times. More importantly, with the likes of Nick Rimando, Bill Hamid and the untried but highly promising Tyler Deric of Houston Dynamo, goalkeeper is a position where Klinsmann has abundant options, and all of them have plenty of upside.

Today, it is impossible to scroll through any timeline without encountering other people\u2019s lunches, and, worldwide, there is an increase in dishes that appear to be deliberately engineered to get you snapping before tucking in. Take the Carmel Winery in Israel with its Foodography tasting menu, featuring as many flowers and twiddles as you can shake a tweezer at, and its \u201cLimbo\u201d crockery that incorporates a mobile-phone stand.

Photograph: Ashley Palmer-Watts    It has been going on for a few years now. In 2011, Heston Blumenthal created his \u201cmeat fruit\u201d, a chicken-liver parfait coated in jelly and fashioned into a startling facsimile of a tangerine. This coincided with a massive spike in Twitter usage and, lo, the delicately dimpled orange was everywhere. In the US, Frankenstein creations such as the cronut were tweeted like the second coming. Earlier still, then-young gun David Chang\u2019s nascent empire was fuelled by fans gibbering about his pork buns online. He played to the crowd, and suddenly everyone knew about Taiwanese-style buns. Soon diners were working as unpaid marketeers for their favourite restaurants, a paradigm fully exploited in the UK by clued-up new restaurateurs such as Russell Norman of Polpo and Scott Collins of MeatLiquor. Now everyone\u2019s at it. Are these chefs and restaurateurs pulling our strings? The more serious, cerebral types will deny there is any such manipulation at play. When the Chiltern Firehouse landed in London, a new star was born: chef Nuno Mendes\u2019 crab doughnuts. Did he know that they were going to be as much of a draw as the chance of clocking Kate Moss?

Nuno Mendes\u2019 abade de priscos, or pork fat pudding. Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram    Most of the chefs and restaurateurs I speak to are coy about the idea that they would do anything so calculated. When I ask Jonathan Downey, the orchestrator of a sprawling street-food collective, if any of his team deliberately creates dishes in the hopes of online cult status, he laughs. \u201cMy God. I thought I was cynical, but you \u2026\u201d Most profess to be taken aback by the sudden stardom. A contender for the most-Instagrammed dish in the UK at the moment must be Shackfuyu\u2019s kinako french toast; general manager Alina Sann says the sheer popularity of this simple dessert took them completely by surprise. \u201cWe have quite a small menu and kitchen, so we wanted something easy to make \u2013 but it has taken us way beyond what we ever expected,\u201d she says. So why the fandom? \u201cIt looks quite cool, especially with the matcha soft-serve on the side. People started posting pictures \u2026 it started getting all the hype, and it\u2019s an easy sell for our waiters because they know everyone will love it.\u201d The spectacular confit potatoes at the Quality Chop House are another internet smash (and something I\u2019m guilty of Instagramming more than once). Chef Shaun Shearly also credits necessity for their genesis: \u201cThey were born on the back of really wanting to stay away from a conventional chip \u2013 mostly because of space in my little kitchen, and because people expect that fried carb.\u201d What are the downsides of having such a labour-intensive \u201cstar\u201d dish? \u201cWith potatoes being so variable in water due to their starch levels, they need constant attention. And I can never take them off the menu, despite them being a complete pain in the arse during service. We can only cook three portions at a time, and they take about four minutes to cook. Most tables order at least three portions at a time.\u201d     Confit potatoes at the Quality Chop House. Photograph: Patricia Niven    So it\u2019s all a happy accident, right? Speak to the publicists, however, and a different story emerges. When I ask Hannah Norris, the PR for a number of the capital\u2019s hottest restaurants, if she advises chefs to deliberately devise dishes to grip the internet by the throat, she says: \u201cYes, I\u2019d encourage it for sure. Content is key \u2013 and having a \u2018hero\u2019 dish to shout about is often the difference between a stonking launch and a lukewarm one. If a restaurant asks me to do their PR, one of the first questions is, \u2018What\u2019s the glory dish? What\u2019s our Duck &amp; Waffle?\u2019 If there isn\u2019t one, I often make my excuses and scurry away.\u201d With all the chefly coyness, it is refreshing to speak to Stevie Parle, the owner of the newly opened Craft in Greenwich, who is pragmatic about the value of the cult dish. His clay-baked duck actively encourages sharing, not only over dinner but, with his hypnotic video of the bird\u2019s serving ritual, online too. \u201cThe duck [served in clay to be smashed at the table] was very conscious,\u201d he says. \u201cMost chefs have always thought about \u2018signature\u2019 dishes and generally end up hating them, but now there is an added element of them going viral too.\u201d So they are stuck with them? Yes, says Parle: \u201cI love the duck but it isn\u2019t ever going to be able to come off the menu. And people get really cross if I start smashing it before they\u2019re ready with their cameras.\u201d            Franco Sotgiu of Solita in Manchesteralso acknowledges the internet effect. \u201cIt pains me to say, but when creating specials I\u2019ve learned that anything with \u2018big, fried, bacon or cheese\u2019 in the title sells well. The better they look in a photo on Twitter and Facebook, the more RTs and likes they get, the better they sell.\u201d He is rueful about the side-effects: \u201cIn Manchester, \u2018dirty\u2019 still sells well, and even though I\u2019ve tried relentlessly to push more grill items and less calorific dishes, the stuff that looks sloppy-great in a photo can often achieve 500-plus RTs on Twitter. So it makes sense from a business point of view to lead with these.\u201d It is as simple as bums on seats, then. Instagram snaps are the restaurant\u2019s equivalent of an Amsterdam-style shop window. Viewers scroll through pic after pic, the squelchier, more drooling meat juices on show the better, frequently tagged \u2013 ugh \u2013 #foodporn.

The anonymous Clerkenwell Boy, a hugely followed Instagrammer whose account has contributed to the fetishisation of what is frequently dubbed *that* burger or *those* wings, says: \u201cI think there is something fundamentally satisfying about sharing a photo of a brilliant dish with others. I\u2019m no psychologist, but it probably also has links to \u2018social proof\u2019 \u2013 so posting photos of *that* dish is like providing (and receiving) a universal seal of approval. I guess you could liken it to the way that tourists react when they see a major landmark in a foreign city. Just like the Eiffel Tower or Big Ben, a photo of *that* signature dish means that you\u2019ve arrived.\u201d What does he think it is that captures the imagination so fiercely? \u201cPeople suffer from massive food envy and fear of missing out. Ordering *that* dish becomes a failsafe way to ensure we don\u2019t make the wrong choice.\u201d Not only is there the serotonin rush from watching the likes mount up, but there is the chance of catching the celebs\u2019 eye: a #followoftheday from Nigella or a regram by Jamie. (Nigella\u2019s Instagram of Stevie Parle\u2019s clay duck video has, at the time of writing, more than 2,300 likes.) It creates a circle of validation: the restaurants get the punters, the punters get the likes \u2013 behavioural economics. The problem, of course, is that social media is driven by the thrill of the new. Tweeters move on to the next big thing without a backward glance. Six months down the line, there\u2019s a chorus of \u201cwe\u2019ve all seen that bloody pithivier\u201d, a mindset that compels chefs and restaurateurs to reach ever more attention-seeking heights, dreaming up the culinary equivalent of Kim Kardashian\u2019s bottom to penetrate the noise. The internet\u2019s appetite for the food rush is insatiable; and if you don\u2019t post that snap of your Crumbs &amp; Doilies cupcake, or doughnut from St John, it might not taste as sweet. Eight of the best cult dishes 1. Stevie Parle\u2019s clay-baked duck, Craft     Clay-baked duck. Photograph: PR    Parle wanted a duck dish to rival the canard \u00e0 la presse at Otto\u2019s in terms of occasion and fun. Based on an ancient Celtic cooking technique, it is glazed in honey, and wrapped in cabbage leaves and hay before being roasted in a clay wrapper, then delivered on a bed of pine twigs. It is then smashed open at the table and served with broad bean and barley miso, and salted carrots. Much videoed. 2. Shaun Searley\u2019s confit potatoes, Quality Chop House      Confit potatoes. Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram    Thinly sliced potatoes, baked like pommes anna but with dripping instead of butter, then sliced, fried and drizzled with mustard vinaigrette \u2013 as delicious as they are complex. Apparently, Shearley played about with a version featuring tunworth cheese and shaved truffle, the sort of thing that may cause one to emit a small moan. The subject of many posts captioned *those* potatoes. 3. Wild muntjac biryani, Gymkhana      Wild muntjac biryani. Photograph: PR    It is the all-action videos of this ravishing creation that add to its shareable appeal. It arrives with a flaky, domed dough lid, studded with kalonji, to be slit open at the table, releasing the bewitching aromas of spiced deer and buttery basmati rice. If only there were Smellagram too. An uncommon, upscale cult dish. 4. Blood cake, Bao     Blood cake. Photograph: PR    Another one Instagrammed by Nigella, thereby assuring its must-eat status. This is a traditional Taiwanese streetfood made from pig\u2019s blood and glutinous rice. Instead of the usual peanut and coriander condiments \u2013 which feature in their classic bao \u2013 it is topped with a just-wobbling, soy-cured egg yolk. The Bao owners welcome their dishes\u2019 \u201cInstagrammability\u201d, saying it provides immediate, important feedback. But they insist taste is paramount. 5. Bacon naan, Dishoom      Bacon naan. Photograph: Marina O'Loughlin/Instagram    This beauty more than deserves its online fame: a pillowy, gently charred bread stuffed with crisp bacon, cream cheese and tangy chilli-tomato jam. Some add an egg. (A fork piercing yolks in slow-motion is a meme: there are currently 63,307 Instagram post for #eggporn. Sigh.) 6. Duck and waffle, Duck &amp; Waffle      Duck and waffle. Photograph: Karen Robinson/Guardian    Nothing ensures hero status so much as calling your whole restaurant after one dish. If diners at this City smash aren\u2019t tweeting the view, they\u2019re Instagramming the crisp, fluffy waffles, flanked with confit duck and fried duck egg, the whole to be drenched with mustard maple syrup. The restaurant goes through a reported 7,000 duck legs a month. 7. The dead hippy, MeatLiquor      Dead Hippy burger. Photograph: MeatLiquor/Instagram    From the early days of Yianni Papoutsis\u2019s MeatWagon burger van in London pub car parks to ambitious worldwide burger domination with MeatLiquor, this is a tribute to \u2013 depending on who you believe \u2013 In-N-Out Burger\u2019s secret, off-menu \u201cdouble double cheeseburger animal-style\u201d or, more prosaically, the Big Mac. No looker \u2013 this brute is downright ugly \u2013 but wow, it does the job. One of the UK\u2019s first cult burgers. 8. The parmo, Solita      Parmo. Photograph: PR    A cult north-eastern booze partner (there is even a Teesside-based @loveparmo Twitter account), this bastardised, vaguely Italianate chicken item (parmo = parmesan, although it rarely features, making this the Asbo offspring of veal parmigiana) has reached new heights at Solita. Not given to restraint, their version is fried in parmesan-laced panko breadcrumbs, topped with bechamel and melted cheese, loaded with meatballs marinara and stuffed into a brioche bun. With chips. And garlic mayo. \u2022 Got a great food image? Marina O\u2019Loughlin\u2019s new column will be tracking the best of the food web.

(The alleged conman, Gregory Reddick, is suing over his arrest.) The commuter boat across New York Bay from Manhattan has been free since 1997, when mayor Rudy Guiliani removed the 50\u00a2 fare to court Staten Island voters ahead of his successful bid for re-election that year. \u201cI don\u2019t want to sound like a curmudgeon, but we do have concerns,\u201d said a spokeswoman for the Staten Island Ferry Riders Committee at the time. \u201cWill it attract more homeless? And what about kids who just want a free boat trip?\u201d But perhaps the allegedly swindled tourists were so easily fooled because the whole concept of a free ferry seems so fundamentally un-American; the idea that it might cost $400 for you and your companion to get across the water and back is actually almost more plausible than the notion you could take the trip for free. In fact, though, the free ferry is just one aspect of a surprisingly socialist side to a city better known as an engine of unfettered free trade and cutthroat commerce: communal on-street facilities to wash your clothes, a bike-share system that would be the pride of Amsterdam, enormous free outdoor swimming pools such as the one in Highbridge Park, a pay-only-what-you\u2019re-able-to admission fee at the city\u2019s most prestigious museum (\u201cFrom each according to his ability, to each according to his need\u201d), rent controls or rent stabilisation on over a million apartments, central heating that is switched on from October to May and then switched off from May to October, just like in Soviet Moscow.

Just as he did in Amsterdam last Friday night, the underrated Hawaiian found the late winner as USA stunned Germany, the world champions, in Cologne. Klinsmann had tweaked his previous line-up, giving New England\u2019s Juan Agudelo time up front to make his case for Gold Cup selection. But Wood must surely now be the frontrunner for the position after another outstanding performance \u2013 and another winning goal.   Related: Germany 1-2 USA: international friendly \u2013\u00a0as it happened    Mix Diskerud and Danny Williams slotted into the midfield in place of Kyle Beckerman and Alfredo Morales, while Fabian Johnson was pushed to left-back. With a number of key selections injured or being rested, German coach Joachim L\u00f6w continued his regeneration of the world champions. However, for every Antonio R\u00fcdiger and Sebastian Rudy in the starting 11, there was also a Mario G\u00f6tze and a Bastian Schweinsteiger. Perhaps the most remarkable \u2013 or at least remarked upon \u2013 omission was that of home-town hero Lukas Podolski. When you can bring in a player like Patrick Herrmann, however, who really cares? The Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach forward was superb from the beginning, dominating the right side and sending in one dangerous cross after another. And just as the visitors began to make some forward runs of their own, Herrmann countered with a dribble and cross to G\u00f6tze, and Brad Guzan was picking the ball out of his net. Only 12 minutes had elapsed. The big German names \u2013 in particular Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle and Mesut \u00d6zil - then came to the fore, and began to weave all sorts of shapes through the US defence. It was great entertainment. USA\u2019s biggest problems were of their own making. Attack after attack came undone via poor passing and crossing, but after 41 minutes, from nowhere, it all clicked. Michael Bradley looked up, and put it on the chest of Diskerud at the back post. The Norwegian-born midfielder brought it down and fired past Ron-Robert Zieler for the equaliser. It was the kind of play they had had been struggling to pull off all evening, and good reward for all their efforts, especially for Bradley, who made countless runs from midfield. Aron Johansson and Danny Williams were also notable USA performers in a first half that Germany dominated. Klinsmann brought off Williams, Agudelo and Johnson at the break, replacing them with Kyle Beckerman, DeAndre Yedlin and Brad Evans, and the new faces made an impact almost immediately. Yedlin and Gyasi Zardes, now playing up front, were particularly impressive, and though Germany had their moments, the momentum had swung the way of J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann\u2019s side, and stayed with them for the rest of the night. The best chance came in the 83rd minute, as Bradley and Yedlin blitzed forward and made an expansive one-two that only the outstretched leg of Zieler prevented from breaking the deadlock. Then Evans found Wood, a late substitute, near the D. The Hawaiian killed it with his first touch, spun round, and fired a rocket past Zieler. Khedira almost saved the game for the home side in injury time, only for his header to hit the crossbar. Unusually for a German stadium, there were plenty of empty seats \u2013 the attendance was just over 40,000 \u2013 and so little noise that you could clearly hear the players yelling to each other. There has been concern in Germany that the home side has already gone into holiday mode, and they should be relieved that their Euro qualifier in a few days time is only against Gibraltar. It was their last game before the summer break. USA, meanwhile, now go into the Gold Cup bursting with confidence. Klinsmann\u2019s team hosted \u2013 and beat \u2013 Die Mannschaft in the lead up to the 2013 Gold Cup. It was the first of 20 wins would notch up in the 26 matches until they met again, that time at the World Cup in Brazil. Their form since has been nowhere near as good, but even in a period where Klinsmann is rebuilding his side, they sat at 4-3-4 prior to this game.

Take the footbridge across the water to Bolotny Island and the hipster hangouts clustered round the old Red October chocolate factory, or wander the newly pedestrianised streets north of the Bolshoi theatre, and you could be forgiven for thinking cars no longer ruled the Russian capital. Cycling is cool right now in Moscow and the ranks of those riding bikes is swelling. This year\u2019s Let\u2019s bike it! parade attracted 23,000 riders \u2013 up nearly threefold since it was started three years ago; the city\u2019s fledgling bike share scheme is being expanded for the third year running and the Moscow City Department of Transport has ambitious plans for 700km of bike lanes. Cyclists say things here are definitely changing.         The hipster community are pioneers but many Muscovites remain conservative  Katya Girshina     But stray from those few central streets and the atmosphere is not so cycle-friendly. Some of the worst traffic jams in the world have done little to damage Moscow\u2019s cult of the car, and the city\u2019s reputation as a hostile environment for cyclists remains largely intact. The share of journeys made by bike is estimated at 0.04%, compared with 1% in New York, 2% in London or 40% in Amsterdam.  For the majority of Moscow\u2019s 12 million people who live outside the centre, a cycle commute to work would involve negotiating a string of car-choked highways, some with as many as 12 lanes and crossed only by pedestrian underpasses and bridges. Having to repeatedly stop to slog a bike up and down 30 or 40 steps puts off many, and proves impossible for others.     Typical Moscow evening rush hour traffic. Photograph: Lonely Planet/Getty    It\u2019s intimidating to watch the heavy traffic from the safety of the sidewalk, let alone trying to compete for road space on a bike, so most Muscovites who do ride a bike for transport rarely leave the pavement. Among cycle activists, the optimism of a few years ago is in danger of turning to dissatisfaction, and some fear an opportunity for change could be slipping away. Moscow\u2019s Soviet-era multi-lane radial roads were driven right into the very heart of the city: four concentric ringroads \u2013 the Boulevard Ring, Garden Ring, Third Ring and MKAD \u2013 allow drivers to move from one to another, and there\u2019s another vast new 530km ringroad under construction. Pedestrians were banished to underpasses or overhead walkways so they wouldn\u2019t disrupt the flow (or not) of cars. Yet Moscow\u2019s drivers waste hundreds of hours a year sitting in traffic jams. TomTom\u2019s annual index rated the city the worst in the world for congestion in 2012 and 2013, and ranked it fourth last year, behind Istanbul, Mexico City and Rio de Janeiro. Data from drivers using the company\u2019s satellite navigation systems showed average journey times were 50% longer than they would be if traffic was flowing freely \u2013 rising to 103% during evening rush hour. Before the collapse of the USSR in 1991, only a chosen few could afford the luxury of driving. With liberalisation, however, owning a car became a sign of success, and cycling came to be seen as the preserve of the old and the poor. Katya Girshina at the Strelka Institute for media, architecture and design \u2013 a pavement cyclist herself \u2013 thinks the city\u2019s enduring love for the motor car could be a hangover from Soviet times: \u201cIt\u2019s the attraction of private space, to be separate from the crowd \u2026 None of us had any private space or property before, and now we\u2019re afraid to lose that.\u201d Girshina sees far more cyclists now than she did a few years ago \u2013 some riding fixies or reconditioned Soviet bikes \u2013 but the culture of the car is still strong. \u201cThe hipster community are pioneers,\u201d she says. \u201cBut many Muscovites remain conservative. There are lots of girls who wouldn\u2019t look at a guy unless he had a car. The kind of people who wouldn\u2019t own a car if they lived in London \u2013 young, professional, living near the centre \u2013 would own one in Moscow, even if now some of them might also have a bike.\u201d     Cycling Instagrammer Aygul on Krymskaya embankment   Cars are responsible for an estimated 93% of the 995m tonnes of pollutants pumped into the Moscow air every year, making it the second dirtiest city in Russia after the northern mining centre of Norilsk. Pollution in 2013 was up 5% on the year before and, until the current western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis, Russia\u2019s car market was on track to overtake Germany\u2019s by 2020 as the largest in Europe. The catalyst for change came in the unlikely form of Kremlin-backed bureaucrat Sergei Sobyanin. In 2010, when the mayor of 18 years, Yuri Luzhkov, was unceremoniously sacked and accused of nepotism and corruption, his replacement Sobyanin made a commitment to renewing the city\u2019s public spaces. The \u201chipster culture minister\u201d, Sergei Kapkov, transformed derelict Gorky Park and replaced the Krymskaya embankment\u2019s tarmac with fountains, cafes, art spaces and a bike lane; Sobyanin hired Maxim Liksutov to tackle the city\u2019s traffic problems.     Moscow\u2019s 2020 cycle lane masterplan: yellow indicates existing lanes, green the proposed \u2018green ring\u2019, black what is planned by 2020, and dotted for after 2020. Photograph: Moscow Department of Transport    The first bike lane in 2011 was ridiculed as a green-painted obstacle course, frequently blocked by gates and parked cars, but Moscow\u2019s cycle activists could sense change. When Anton Polsky, known by his street artist name Make, crowdsourced the city\u2019s first cycle map, USE/LESS, it got a huge response. And when Vladimir Kumov organised the Let\u2019s Bike It! parade through closed city streets in 2012, more than 8,000 people turned up to show their support for pedal power. Litsukov brought one of the activists, Alexey Mityaev, into the transport department as an adviser and things really began to happen. The city launched its bike share scheme in the summer of 2013 with 550 bikes and 79 stations. The scale may have been small by international standards \u2013 there were 63,000 rentals in the first year in Moscow, compared with 1m in first 10 weeks of London \u2013 but by the end of this summer it will have grown to 2,700 bikes at 300 locations. The scheme, which is packed away from November to February when the harsh winter and dirty streets discourage all but the hardiest few, now offers better quality Smoove bikes that can be accessed using the same Troika card used to pay for the metro, bus and car parking. Crucially, the Department of Transport says more people are using hire bikes for transport, rather than simply for a pleasant ride in the park: 46% last year, from 18% the year before. The city has installed more than 3,000 bike racks, introduced parking charges in the centre, and changed the law to allow cyclists to use the city\u2019s few bus lanes. There are now 170km of bike paths \u2013 critics say almost all are in parks or along the river \u2013 and another 50km are planned for this year, eventually growing to a network of some 700km. Bike share data has been opened up to Google and to the Russian search firm Yandex, both of which are working on incorporating information into their maps; there are more bike signs, and even a counter display at Park Kultury to encourage more cyclists. A lane of traffic will be taken out to create a bike lane to the north of the centre, following a similar scheme in the south last year, and in 2016 the Department of Transport will start work on the Green Ring, a series of bike lanes connecting existing parks and open space between the Third Ring and MKAD motorways. It\u2019s not popular with many activists but Mityaev says it could allow some cyclists to cross from one slice of Moscow\u2019s pizza pie layout to another in under five minutes, a journey he says might take 15 minutes on the metro, or 25 in a car.    We\u2019re experimenting. In order to win the battle you need some working examples  Activist turned transport adviser Alexey Mityaev     A survey by the Department of Transport last year found the most common problems putting people off cycling were the lack of bike lanes and the perceived danger of riding in the road. Next on the list was the length of the average commute. In an attempt to address that, the city introduced free bike travel on buses and trams (and the metro with a folding bike), and plans to install secure bike storage boxes at suburban train stations later this year: so a commuter could, for example, cycle from home to the station, catch a train to the centre, and use a hire bike for the final leg to work. This year, a bike lane will be opened along the Boulevard Ring, a chain of picturesque, tree-lined roads developed in the 1820s which form a horseshoe around Moscow\u2019s historic \u201cwhite city\u201d. The original plan to create space for a raised bike path by taking away a car parking lane has been watered down \u2013 replaced with a scheme to reduce the width of car lanes and paint a bike track on the road. Mityaev admits the original 2011 bike lane was an unmitigated disaster but remains confident that \u2013 combined with lower speed limits and re-timed traffic signals favouring cyclists and pedestrians \u2013 the scheme is moving Moscow in the right direction: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to solve this problem right away because we don\u2019t have the money for it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re experimenting. Let\u2019s put in a temporary solution \u2013 paint, signs, counters and all the other measures \u2013 and get some evidence. In order to win the battle you need some working examples.\u201d     Vladimir Kumov on a Let\u2019s bike it! parade    Not much of that impresses Let\u2019s Bike It! founder Vladimir Kumov as he takes me on a cycle tour of the best and worst of the city streets. \u201cParts of the centre are nicer now, but outside the Garden Ring you see a very different Moscow,\u201d he says. \u201cKrymskaya may be working but it\u2019s only one example. I hope the Boulevard Ring will attract some cyclists, but it\u2019s very short, and of course it won\u2019t help most people get to work.\u201d Kumov was inspired to start the parade in 2012 when an expected 40-minute taxi ride home from the airport took four hours. He didn\u2019t have a budget for advertising, but word spread on social media, and he was stunned when 8,000 cyclists turned up \u2013 four times the expected number. For the fourth parade in 2014, the Department of Transport agreed to close the entire Garden Ring in one direction. The latest parade last month followed the same format, and 23,000 cyclists took part. We venture on to some of the centre\u2019s eight-lane highways and a take slightly hairy ride along a section of the inaptly named Garden Ring, sticking tight to the right-hand side as executive saloons and large 4x4s stream past. Being a Sunday, the traffic is bearable and drivers give me more space than I\u2019m used to in London, but it is fast: the speed limit is 60kph in the centre, and locals tell me there is a 20kph leeway before police would even consider taking action. Cutting the speed limit is top of Kumov\u2019s wish-list, closely followed by a desire to see more bike lanes, \u201cand not ones that start nowhere and lead nowhere\u201d. Let\u2019s Bike It! activist Vadim Semenovych, who cycles 40km to work and back from his home in outer Moscow, joins us for the ride. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s so dangerous as long as you are a confident rider and you have some skills,\u201d says the young engineer, who takes me through the Arbatskaya tunnel, one of the most hazardous parts of his commute. There\u2019s not much room for error and I feel it would be an altogether scarier proposition during peak times, but he says he hasn\u2019t had so much as a near miss since he started cycling three years ago.         The first clips show cycling along the Krymskaya Embankment by the side of the Moskva river on a sunny Sunday afternoon. Later clips show Tverskaya St (one of Moscow\u2019s busiest roads) in morning rush-hour and being forced to take an underpass to avoid the Arbatskaya tunnel    Keen to get a proper taste of rush hour, I head back out on to the highways the next working day, braving the busy Bolshoy Kamenny bridge, multi-lane Tverskaya Street and the highway south of the Kremlin, which always seems crammed with bumper-to-bumper traffic. The volume of cars is certainly intimidating and I can feel the polluted air bite at the back of my throat, but I don\u2019t feel in danger so long as I hug the right-hand side and don\u2019t expect drivers entering from side roads to let me have right of way. It\u2019s a different story if you want to turn left, though, or if a multi-lane road filters in from the right: that means a two-minute wait at a pedestrian crossing, or it\u2019s off the bike for a slog down and up the steep steps of an underpass. Even in the centre that happens a lot. During two hours on the bike I see maybe 20 cyclists \u2013 only three of them using the main roads.    Five years ago, cycling was seen as something for students or those without money. That\u2019s not the case any more  Vladimir Kumov     But even Kumov remains cautiously optimistic that the situation is improving for Moscow cyclists: \u201cThe hipsters have been a good thing for cycling, helping to change how people think about bikes. Five years ago, cycling was seen as something for students or those without money. That\u2019s not the case any more.\u201d He worries, though, that the Department of Transport is too afraid of motorists to take away car lanes and build radial bike paths: \u201cI do think Moscow can become a more bike-friendly city. Now that cycling is trendy it\u2019s a good moment for the Department of Transport to create bike infrastructure \u2013 but if they don\u2019t act now, then in two or three years\u2019 time it may well go out of fashion.

For Harper, the road to the bigs began after graduating high school \u2013 the Las Vegas-born outfielder was drafted No 1 overall in 2010 by the Nats and given a signing bonus of $9.9m, before joining the traditional route to salary escalation, one that typically matures over six or seven seasons before a player reaches free-agency.

Tanaka spent some seven years toiling in Japan with the Tohoku Rakuten Golden Eagles, and was the target in a bidding war that ended with a transfer fee for his NPB club and a multi-year deal for the pitcher worth $155m.

Because players from the Dutch Caribbean outpost are not subjected to the amateur draft, Gregorius, unlike Harper, was born into free-agency, and thus had the ability to sign with any team he liked \u2013 at age 17 he inked his deal with the Cincinnati Reds. Many players from Latin America sign as early as 16, while those in the draft up north and in Puerto Rico must have completed their senior year of high school before becoming eligible for draft selection. With over 25% of the players making up MLB rosters coming from outside the United States, the variety of entry-routes players take to reach the bigs remains a warm topic for debate, especially in a week when 30 teams are busy plowing their way through some 40 rounds (there have been as many as 100!) of amateurs from the United States, Canada, Puerto Rico and other US territories only. Is it finally time for MLB to institute an all-encompassing international amateur draft? New commissioner Rob Manfred says yes.  I\u2019ve long been a believer that it makes sense for everybody to enter the game through the same mechanism. I think there\u2019s a fundamental fairness to have everybody enter the game through the same system.  That\u2019s an angle into a complex situation that seems to add up. Why should different rules apply to players based on their country, when no other major North American league has such a complex, multi-faceted set-up?  Another potential side-reason to include international players could be to counter the \u201cbuscones.\u201d Independent scouts are usually the first to sign aspiring Latin ballplayers, who often house, clothe and feed young talent while they\u2019re developed. In recent years, buscones and team scouts have been linked to corruption that includes performance-enhancing drugs and baseball sweat factories \u2013 MLB has been pressuring governments to regulate the buscones for several years and perhaps an international draft could accelerate reform on that front.  Regardless of Manfred\u2019s desire to achieve that \u201cfairness,\u201d implementing a draft featuring international players will not be easy. For one, there have only been a handful of Japanese-born players who signed with MLB teams without playing professionally there \u2013 if MLB started drafting Japanese players wholesale it could set off a firestorm in Asia. It\u2019s worth noting that the quadrennial World Baseball Classic requires the cooperation of Japan\u2019s national league, NPB, in addition to the Korean Baseball Organization, to ensure their participation. Overall, MLB\u2019s desire to draft players from countries such as the Dominican Republic, Venezuela, Colombia, Panama, Mexico (which also has a professional league) and Cuba, in addition to the Asian nations, is shaping up to be a significant component of what\u2019s projecting to be a more contentious negotiation over the next collective bargaining agreement between the MLB Players Association and big league top brass. The current CBA expires on 1 December 2016. The battleground exists for several reasons, but the main sticking point is that an international draft would ultimately cut down player costs while restricting player movement. Unless dramatic changes were made to MLB\u2019s salary structure, while boosting the current range of signing bonus pool money available to draftees, (which involves salary slots for each pick based on drafting order), an international draft would eliminate deals for elite Cuban players such as Rusney Castillo, who hauled in $72.5m with the Red Sox upon signing with Boston. Yes, there are currently spending restrictions on clubs who eclipse their allotted pool (another complicated slotting formula) but the penalties are not severe enough to stop teams from breaking the bank on international free agents. A draft, in theory, would prevent teams from splashing out, but could actually help some of the players on the lower end of the totem poll \u2013 Jeff Passan of Yahoo Sports recently pointed out that David Ortiz was signed for just $10,000. Still, MLBPA, arguably the most powerful union on the planet, are in the business of making sure their players can make as much money as possible. The union will need to be convinced that a drafting system that already stymies the signing bonus while restricting player movement would be better for its foreign-born players.  Aside from the cost-cutting concerns, is an international draft even remotely viable from a cultural standpoint? In the US, young players mostly approach the game in a similar way \u2013 a structured development system that begins roughly at the age of five to high school, where he has a choice to be drafted, or continue on to college before the player can be drafted again. Many of those structured options simply don\u2019t exist in countries such as the Dominican Republic or in Venezuela on a level they exist in the US, so how can all the players be put into the same pool? Then there is the threat that an international draft could have on the sport in Latin nations. A well-circulated New York Times article examined the decline of the sport in Puerto Rico since its players entered the first-year draft, one which may have helped lead to the eventual closure of its long-standing winter baseball league. The current free-agency set-up in Latin America ensures investment into the sport, mostly via academies \u2013 that could decline as clubs are less likely to spend millions of dollars on facilities when the end-product could wind up with another team. During a time when youth baseball is struggling to compete with soccer in the United States, a push against the game Latin America could be devastating for the sport. It\u2019s a move the game can\u2019t afford to take, even if it means inequality on a big-league level.

Mind you, Sunday\u2019s victory over France in Paris was mighty impressive, with Belgium royally outclassing their hosts \u2013 technically, physically and even tactically \u2013 waltzing into a 4-1 lead before easing off and allowing France to hit two late goals that did not really save their honour. All of which could be seen as a little ominous for Wales. True, Marouane Fellaini, who scored twice in Paris, suffered an injury that will make him miss the match in Cardiff, but Nacer Chadli is a decent replacement even if he does not carry the same sort of menace as Fellaini. And the outstanding performance of Radja Nainggolan offered more evidence that this Belgium team could cause Wales even more problems than they did in November\u2019s 0-0 draw in Brussels, when Chris Coleman\u2019s side delivered a highly accomplished away performance but still needed Wayne Hennessey to produce a couple of splendid saves. James Chester was also superb in Brussels and that has been the encouraging thing about the Welsh campaign so far: their excellent first half of it has been down to much more than just Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey. Wales are a proper team with real fluency, method and spirit as well as a sprinkling of rare class, so while they face a big challenge this weekend, so do Belgium, and both countries look strong bets to qualify for the finals irrespective of Friday\u2019s result. PD 2) Hodgson shuffling his pack without Sterling? Roy Hodgson warned Raheem Sterling that he will need to toughen up after the England winger was booed during the deathly 0-0 draw with the Republic of Ireland last Sunday. Sterling\u2019s reputation has taken a few dents in the past few months after the way his relationship with Liverpool has broken down in public and with that in mind, could Hodgson decide to take him out of the firing line against Slovenia? England have replacements ready and waiting, principally Theo Walcott, who was in outstanding form for Arsenal at the end of the season. Walcott scored a hat-trick in the 4-1 win over West Bromwich Albion on 24 May and followed that up by banging in the opening goal in Arsenal\u2019s victory over Aston Villa in the FA Cup final. However Walcott should not be used as a direct replacement for Sterling. Arsenal used him as a central striker rather than a wide forward and Hodgson would have to tweak his attack, perhaps move Wayne Rooney into a deeper role, if he turns to Walcott. JS 3) Trouble Dutch The new expanded finals format has taken much of the jeopardy out of qualifying but one of the continent\u2019s big beasts is under pressure and worth keeping an eye on. The hangover after getting within a couple of missed penalties of the World Cup final in 2014 has been a bad one \u2013 a full-on alka-seltzer-and-stay-under-the-covers morning after the night before. First came defeat against the Czech Republic, followed by a scrambling late fightback to come from behind to beat Kazakhstan in Amsterdam. A 2-0 defeat to Iceland followed and though they bounced back with a 6-0 win over Latvia, it took a 92nd-minute Klaas-Jan Huntelaar equaliser to rescue a point at home against Turkey. It has left them lagging behind the Czechs and Iceland in third place and looking nervously over their shoulders at Turkey. They should swat aside Latvia again, but the eastern Europeans have already held Turkey at home and, last time out, the Czech Republic in Prague. It could be a nervy night in Riga. Meanwhile \u2026 JA     Dutch players Stefan de Vrij and Robin van Persie during their team\u2019s training session in Katwijk. Photograph: Koen van Weel/EPA    4) A summit meeting in Group A Iceland have already stunned Holland and Turkey in Reykjavik in this qualifying campaign. Are the Czech Republic next? It could happen, even though they beat Iceland 2-1 in November. Iceland\u2019s improvement in recent years has been startling and Lars Lagerback, the experienced former Sweden coach, has coached his young team well. They have been open and attacking in possession, while making sure not to give anything away at the back. Only Belgium have a better defensive record than Iceland. Second in Group A and a point behind the Czechs, Iceland will need Gylfi Sigurdsson to continue his excellent form. The Swansea City midfielder is their top scorer with four goals in five matches. JS 5) O\u2019Neill needing to find right attacking approach It was by beating Scotland in a vital European qualifier in 1986 that Jack Charlton truly established his formula for success with the Republic of Ireland; now is the time for Martin O\u2019Neill to do likewise. Ireland executed a flawed strategy when they were deservedly beaten by the superior Scots in November, and it will be fascinating to see how O\u2019Neill tries to atone for that. A draw might be satisfactory for Scotland, though you feel another win is well within their grasp if they go for it, but nothing less than three points will do for Ireland so O\u2019Neill must find the right method of attack this time. He has an array of options, none of them surefire hits. There is a strong case for starting Shane Long ahead of Robbie Keane again even though that did not work in Glasgow (Keane is obviously more clinical but Long\u2019s finishing is not so erratic that it merits him being dropped in favour of a formerly wonderful player who no longer has the mobility to stretch solid defences), but what about the rest? Will Jonathan Walters get another go at trying to barge through the Scottish defence? Or will O\u2019Neill deploy Daryl Murphy up front in the hope that he will profit from Robbie Brady\u2019s usually exquisite set-pieces (which, as it turned out, were anything but exquisite in the last qualifier against Poland) or will he play Wes Hoolahan off Long (or Keane) and prioritise a more brainy approach? Brainy, that is, in the context of a game in which \u2013 irrespective of personnel and formations \u2013 guts, hearts, shoulders and maybe elbows will be essential kit inclusions. PD 6) A surreal evening in Split There is talk of Antonio Conte dispensing with the 3-5-2 formation he favours and setting his side up in a 4-3-3 when Italy play Croatia in Split on Friday night. It promises to be a fascinating encounter, albeit one with a surreal backdrop \u2013 the match will be played in an empty stadium after Croatia were given a one-match stadium ban after racist chants by their fans during a 5-1 home win over Norway in March, which came on the back of incidents they caused during the 1-1 draw against Italy in Milan last November. A trip to Croatia is usually an intimidating experience but it is unlikely to be as daunting for Italy this time. Home advantage will not be as significant, yet Croatia will still be confident. They are top of Group H, after all, and Italy have injury worries, with Gigi Buffon a doubt and Marco Verratti ruled out. Another factor will be how Italy\u2019s Juventus contingent respond after losing the Champions League final last Saturday. Will Italy be happy to take a point? JS 7) A propaganda coup for the Little Guy A powerful blow could be struck for tiddlers this weekend. Every round of international fixtures is accompanied by the squeals of naysayers who insist that there are too many puny so-called nations whose existence serves only to clutter up the calendar. Such teams gain nothing from being routinely clobbered by the big boys, and the big boys do not even gain satisfaction from administering the clobbering, only relief if they manage to avoid injury against goofs whom they should never have to meet. So what a propaganda coup it would be for the Little Guy if the Faroe Islands completed a competitive double over Greece this weekend. The Faroese caused a sensation when they triumphed in Athens in November and it was no fluke, as Joel Edmundsson\u2019s goal ensured victory went to the team that performed better on the night, a result that incited the Greek FA to sack manager Claudio Ranieri on the spot. Greece regained a smidgin of dignity in their next qualifier, drawing 0-0 in Hungary, while the Faroe Islands produced another valiant display before going down 1-0 at group leaders Romania. Since their admission into Fifa in 1988, the Faroe Islands have beaten only two countries twice in the same qualifying competition \u2013 San Marino in the qualifiers for Euro 96 and Malta in the run-up to 1998 World Cup. Doing the double over the former European champions on Saturday would be a startling demonstration of a small nation\u2019s ability to progress. And of Greece\u2019s decline. PD 8) A key night for Israel in Zenica Although Israel were demolished by Gareth Bale in March, they remain hopeful of qualifying. They are third in Group B, two points behind Wales and Belgium, and they can put daylight between themselves and Bosnia-Herzegovina if they beat them in Zenica. Israel will fancy their chances given that they beat them 3-0 at home in November, a defeat that led to Bosnia sacking Sufat Sasic after a disappointing start. Sasic\u2019s replacement, Mehmed Bazdarevic, picked up a win and a draw in his first two matches, but the real test begins here. JS     Bosnia-Herzegovina coach Mehmed Bazdarevic speaks during a training session in Zenica. Photograph: Dado Ruvic/Reuters    9) Slovakia\u2019s Group C mastery continuing? England, twinned with Slovakia. The only two countries with 100% qualifying records in Europe at the halfway stage could go a long way to securing their passage to the finals this weekend, and that would be an especially laudable achievement for Slovakia, who have made remarkable progress since Jan Kozak was appointed as manager in 2013. They are currently three points clear of Spain at the top of Group C and have already won away at third-placed Ukraine. They also won 2-0 in Macedonia, whom they host this weekend. PD 10) Germany taking it out on Gibraltar The world champions against the continent\u2019s newest minnows. Last time they met we expected a landslide but Gibraltar\u2019s 4-0 defeat in Nuremberg in November was arguably their best result in qualifying so far. This time around, though, they face a German side smarting from a 2-1 loss against the USA \u2013 the Mannschaft\u2019s third defeat since lifting the World Cup last year. It could get ugly.

It comes with fine sourdough and springy, oily focaccia from the excellent Troves in Levenshulme. \nThen, lots of little dishes: purple sprouting broccoli, almost crunchy from its frying with chilli and shallot, a throbbing bass of a plateful. Lamb shawarma, the meat \u201cpulled\u201d into a chewy tangle and served with harissa so fierce it\u2019d put hairs on the back of your throat \u2013 its yoghurt useless in the face of such full-on, fruity fire. Monkfish, ceviched with lime and chilli, the acidity calmed by coconut milk and the pearly freshness of the fish. Hanger steak, black and pink, showing off all the fibrous minerality of this cut, with homemade chips, both regular and sweet potato.

For Blofeld, and countless cricket fans, many of whom have never set foot in south London, the looming skeletal frame of the gasometer is not just part of the landscape but of the atmosphere of the ground on match days.     A vintage 1893 illustration of the cricketer WG Grace at the Oval cricket ground shows the gasometers in the background. Photograph: Popperfoto/Getty Images    The Oval gasometer, like others that have outlived their use across the country, is under threat of demolition, its presence measured in the hyper-inflated value of the land on which it stands rather than its historical or architectural significance. When demolition plans were announced by Southern Gas Networks in 2013, Blofeld reacted in characteristically lyrical fashion. Cricketing legends such as WG Grace and Jack Hobbs had played in its shadow, he noted: \u201cIn comparison, pulling down the Victoria Memorial in front of Buckingham Palace would be child\u2019s play.\u201d In 2013, though, National Grid announced plans to demolish a total of 76 gas holders across England, and Southern and Scottish Gas networks followed suit with their proposal to get rid of 111 over the next 16 years. That process will leave the urban landscape denuded of what, since Victorian times, has been one of its defining elements. As I write, that landscape is already being altered by the removal, section by section, of the solid-type Battersea gas holder near the iconic power station, a landmark for generations of Londoners on their daily commute by train into and out of south London. The novelist Will Self describes its disappearance as \u201cjust another casualty of the relentless spatialisation of international capital flows that is London\u2019s new skyline\u201d. Likewise, Christopher Costelloe, director of the Victorian Society, which has campaigned for the preservation of several historically important examples: \u201cGasometers, by their very size and structure, cannot help but become landmarks. [They] are singularly dramatic structures for all their emptiness.\u201d     The solid-type Battersea gas holder near the iconic power station is currently being removed section by section. Photograph: Alamy    It was the late Scottish poet Edwin Morgan who most successfully caught their mutable character. \u201cI have seen your stark ring taking sunlight till you were something molten, vanishing, magical...\u201d he wrote in Gasometer, which also celebrated the unremitting modernist thrust: \u201cYou don\u2019t care about the wildness of the sky,/ my old gasometer!.../ You cannot hide where your strength comes from./ You are constructivist to the core.\u201d With all gasometers, whether solid or telescopic (their inner cylinders rise and fall inside the steel frame as gas is pumped in and sucked out), form follows function. That last phrase was coined in 1896 by the pioneering American modernist architect Louis Sullivan, based in turn on the Roman architect Vitruvius\u2019s belief that a structure must be solid, useful and beautiful. Vitruvius would surely have approved of the gasometer.     Gas Tanks 1983-92 by Bernd and Hilla Becher. Photograph: Courtesy the artists and Spr\u00fcth Magers    In the 1960s, the stark, functional beauty of gas holders inspired Bernd and Hilla Becher, founders of the Dusseldorf School of Photography, whose students included Andreas Gursky, Thomas Struth and Candida H\u00f6fer. The Bechers spent 40 years chronicling the industrial buildings of Europe, Britain and America: water towers, blast furnaces, factory facades, water tanks and, inevitably, gas holders of every kind. Their obsessive, formalist approach \u2013 each structure was photographed in monochrome from the same distance and angle on a large-format camera \u2013 led to a series of typologies in which multiple photographs of each subject were presented in grids to further emphasise the uniformity of their design. The Bechers\u2019 work has become one of the touchstones of contemporary landscape photography. For all its austere formalism, though, it was founded on Bernd Becher\u2019s nostalgia for the fast-disappearing industrial landscape of his native Ruhr which gathered pace during Germany\u2019s postwar economic boom. He realised that the same process was inevitable elsewhere in Europe and began photographing water towers and gas holders. Decades later, the British artist Idris Khan made a work entitled Every\u2026 Bernd and Hilla Becher Prison Type Gasholders, in which he overlaid photograph after photograph until a blurred, composite image emerged: a kind of ghostly shadow structure that, as the actual gas holders disappear, becomes ever more haunting.     Inspired by the Bechers\u2019 series, Idris Khan\u2019s ghostly composite Every\u2026 Bernd and Hilla Becher Prison Type Gasholder. Photograph: Victoria Miro Gallery, London    As they fade into history, gasometers are also inspiring a growing network of amateur enthusiasts. Sarah O\u2019Carroll, a software engineer from London, spends her spare time photographing gasometers. (She refers to them, as the gas networks do, as \u201cgas holders\u201d, which seems altogether less poetic.) \u201cI\u2019ve always loved them as structures,\u201c she says, \u201cbut, about a year and a half ago, when I realised most of them were coming down I started going out to track them down. People only appreciate them when they go and then, after a while, they are not remembered at all. So, I am keeping track of them and their disappearance for posterity. O\u2019Carroll sees the gas holder as a symbol of the city itself. But surely, I suggest, it is the nature of a modern city to constantly reinvent itself. \u201cI know all the arguments \u2013 they are expensive to maintain, we need the land for development \u2013 but they are part of our character as well as our industrial heritage. It was, after all, gas that helped build the modern city of London.\u201d Costelloe agrees: \u201cGasometers were crucially important to the growth of London as a modern city and to Britain as an industrial and post-industrial nation. The use of gas in street lighting, for instance, is a central element in the creation of the modern city and these amazing floating structures are where the gas was eventually stored. They are important as scientific as well as architectural icons and we should preserve the best of them.\u201d     The Bethnal Green gas holders in 1858\u2026 Photograph: SSPL via Getty Images    Gasometers appeared on the British urban landscape in the first half of the 19th century to store the gas produced in adjacent gasworks. In 1824, the first floating or telescopic gas holder was built in Leeds. It used an external circular frame supported by columns of a fixed height which allowed the enclosed container to rise and fall on a floating water reservoir. As gas from coal was pumped in, the giant domed container would silently rise inside the cylindrical steel frame. Visual poet Victoria Bean imagined one thus: A great grey lung suspended insidea rusty lace cage that rises and falls when I\u2019m not looking.     \u2026 and the Bethnal Green gas holders today. Photograph: Alamy    It was this strange, imperceptible movement that mesmerised the young Will Self. \u201cAs a child, their mysteriousness \u2013 at once of this world and the netherworld \u2013 ushered me into the world of engineering delights. When my father explained how they worked, with them sinking back down into the ground as the gas was siphoned off, I was thrilled: this was an astonishing fusion of the built environment and our quotidian fuel. If natural gas was the stuff of life, the gasometer was its cradle.\u201d What price childhood wonder against the march of capital? Can the gasometer find a new function in our globally corporate age? The current wave of redevelopment transforming London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross may suggest a possible answer. For decades, several gasometers stood silent and towering near the railway lines and the canal. Charlie Chaplin grew up near the Cheney Road gasometers and they were the backdrop to a scene in Ealing comedy The Ladykillers (1955), in which the gang of bumbling crooks led by Professor Marcus (Alec Guinness) rob a security van. They were also a constant landmark for generations of clubbers and cinephiles on their way to parties and raves in the deserted goods yards near York Way or the all-nighters at the nearby Scala cinema. In the 1980s, I attended several pre-rave warehouse parties there, and have fond memories of another nocturnal London altogether darker, dirtier, and much more edgy. The gasometers were the backdrop to all kinds of seediness: the dealers, pimps and prostitutes who congregated around the station and along the side streets off York Way as well as the bands of dissolute revellers that straggled home as daylight broke. Somehow, in the new King\u2019s Cross, the gasometers have survived.     Gasholder No 8, which has been dismantled, refurbished and rebuilt on the other side of Regent\u2019s Canal at King\u2019s Cross, where it now encircles a new park and live events space.    Originally built in the 1850s, the ornate Grade II-listed Gasholder No8 was painstakingly dismantled a few years ago and transported piece by piece to Yorkshire to be restored by specialists. Returned to London, the reconstructed frame will soon encircle a new park and a space for live events designed by Bell Phillips architects and situated on the north side of the Regent\u2019s canal. Morwenna Wilson, an award-winning mechanical engineer \u2013 and, fittingly, the great-granddaughter of Brunel \u2013 has been appointed to oversee the remaining renovation of the area around King\u2019s Cross station, which was built in his lifetime.

In Tokyo, giant gasometers have been customised by commissioned graffiti artists, making them seem suddenly contemporary. In the 1960s, the combative critic and writer on urban England, Ian Nairn, likened the location of a gasometer in suburban Stepney to \u201ckeeping a hippo in a patio garden\u201d. And he was an enthusiast. Gasometers do tend to divide opinion among the general public, as a glance at any of the blogs, Twitter feeds and Instagram accounts devoted to them attests. For every amateur enthusiast championing their preservation and celebrating their overlooked formalist beauty, there is a curmudgeonly voice against.

Last month, we met for a coffee and a smoke at Bethlehem University and chatted about our respective parishes. It\u2019s a golden rule that, when two clergy get together to talk, they start comparing numbers. He has about 350 families in his parish \u2013 about 1,200 people \u2013 as well as involvement from the Orthodox and Arab Maronite communities. And his was the village where the shepherds of the gospel of Luke first proclaimed the good news of Jesus\u2019s birth. This is where Christianity began. Some of his parishioners are descendants of those first shepherds, he said. I raised a sceptical eyebrow. Nonetheless, in the game of ecclesiastical top trumps, he had blown me away on all counts. But, for all of this, Father Iyad is fighting an uphill battle. His community is shrinking, with many younger Palestinian Christians leaving Beit Sahour to find jobs elsewhere in the world. The Israeli occupation has left them with little prospects in their home town. Soon, he says, there won\u2019t be any Christians left. People will come here on air-conditioned coaches to look at buildings like the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, but what he calls the \u201cliving stones\u201d, ie the local Christian community itself (a reference to 1 Peter, chapter 2), are ignored, as if they don\u2019t exist.     Ani, the ancient capital of the Armenian empire, Turkey, now in ruins (August 2013). Photograph: Linda Dorigo    This book from photographer Linda Dorigo and journalist Andrea Milluzzi, Italians working in the Middle East, give faces to these living stones, away from touristic locations. Their new book \u2013 poignantly titled Rifugio (\u201crefuge\u201d or \u201cshelter\u201d) \u2013 is a visual record of those who have, through poverty or defiance, refused to become a part of the Christian diaspora and now struggle to live out their faith in an increasingly inhospitable land. \u201cDuring New Year\u2019s evening Mass in 2011, an explosion destroyed the Saints Church in Alexandria [in Egypt]. Twenty-one Christians died. The story appeared in western newspapers and on television, but, after a few days, the media\u2019s attention faded. We felt the need to know more. So we left to discover stories, families and villages in their everyday lives. We were looking for the heirs of the evangelists and the first pilgrims,\u201d they explain. When the US launched its invasion of Iraq in 2003, there were 1.5 million Christians living in the country. Saddam Hussein\u2019s foreign minister, Tariq Aziz, was a Christian \u2013 demonstrating the relative religious tolerance under that regime. But, by igniting sectarian violence between Sunnis and Shias, the US invasion was a disaster for indigenous Christians, who Muslims associated with the hated crusaders. Now Christians are being slaughtered by Islamic State. Between 2003 and now, three quarters of Iraq\u2019s Christians have been driven from their homes or killed. It\u2019s a story that has repeated itself throughout the Middle East, although, to be fair, it long pre-dates the US invasion. When, a century ago, the Ottomans drove Armenian Christians from Turkey into the Syrian desert to die of starvation, there was a 13% Christian presence in Turkey. Now, they have been all but wiped out. In Egypt, some 600,000 Christians have left during the past 30 years.

And Dorigo and Milluzzi have done important work showing us their faces and giving us an emotional connection to their struggle for survival. Many of these communities have existed since the first century. Some of them still pray in Aramaic, the language that Jesus himself prayed in. Now they are approaching extinction.

The announcement is part of the travel guide publisher\u2019s Best in Europe 2015 roundup, which puts Kent ahead of destinations including County Kerry, Ireland, Normandy in France and the wild Black Forest in south-west Germany. Destinations are selected by Lonely Planet\u2019s pool of travel experts, who are briefed to sniff out the most compelling destinations for this summer. Kent was praised for the host of \u201copportunities it offers curious young minds\u201d, including the retro fun of Broadstairs beach, the footpaths along the White Cliffs of Dover and, of course, the much anticipated Dreamland amusement park in Margate, which reopens this weekend.  The publisher also highlighted a resurgence of Kent\u2019s coastal towns as another reason why the region was deserving of its top spot. Whitstable and Margate are both referenced, with the latter becoming \u201cgentrified without losing its personality\u201d.

However, despite Lonely Planet\u2019s homing in on the county\u2019s affordable, family-friendly credentials \u2013 it boasts eight major castles and the award-winning Port Lympne wild animal park \u2013 the region has been experiencing a regeneration that has far broader appeal.  The county\u2019s culinary scene has been developed, with discerning foodies making trips to enjoy local treats, such as oysters in Whistable or elite cooking at placesincluding Michelin-starred Indian restaurant The Ambrette.  Turner Contemporary, which opened in 2011, has helped transform Margate into an emerging destination for the arts, while new hotels, such as the Albion House in nearby Ramsgate, cater for visitors looking for boutique-style accommodation.  For the local tourist board \u2013 already excited by the spike in press interest due to Dreamland \u2013 the news of Lonely Planet\u2019s recognition is a vindication of years of development in the region.      Albion House Hotel, Ramsgate    \u201cFrom our perspective there\u2019s been a decade of work and investment and it\u2019s starting to bear fruit,\u201d said Sinead Hanna, PR manager for Visit Kent. \u201cThe renaissance of the east Kent coast and Margate has been all over the press this year and it will be even more so this weekend, with the opening of Dreamland. \u201cSeaside kitsch has always had an appeal, but in Margate it\u2019s got that with a modern twist. It has helped turn it into a nice family destination.\u201d  Suzy Humphries, co-founder of Ramsgate Arts, which was set up in 2009 to find ways in which culture could support the regeneration of the town, says the decision by Lonely Planet just confirms the experience of residents. \u201cFrom the perspective of someone who has a shop on Ramsgate harbour and co-runs an arts festival, the news just confirms everything you\u2019re seeing,\u201d she said. \u201cFrom about the first the weekend of February, there\u2019s a constant stream of people coming down. And there\u2019s a buzz; people are visiting and we want to offer more to those who come. I\u2019ve certainly seen the difference in the last year, with new businesses and events setting up. People here feel much more energised.\u201d  For Bibi Morelli, director of Broadstairs\u2019 iconic ice-cream parlour, Morelli\u2019s Gelato, the retro charm of Kent\u2019s coastal towns is a major draw.  \u201cFor families in particular it\u2019s beautiful, it\u2019s affordable and it\u2019s nostalgic,\u201d she said. \u201cBroadstairs is very quaint: there\u2019s Punch and Judy, there\u2019s a bandstand, you can go for a walk on the beach and enjoy a knickerbocker glory.

Six months ago, residents in the small Herefordshire village learned of plans to install two huge chicken sheds nearby. Almost immediately, the community of 177 households mobilised and battle commenced.  But what leads people to unite with their neighbours in protest? And why do some communities take to the streets while others remain silent?    Related: Education is key to the future of social action    Civic mobilisation has won considerable academic interest over recent decades, from the fields of sociology and anthropology to political science and social psychology. Among the many explanations to emerge, three themes echo loudly through the literature: grievance, efficacy and social embeddedness. Grievance \u2013 the external threat \u201cNearly all protests are about imminent threats,\u201d says Jacquelien van Stekelenburg, a sociologist at VU University Amsterdam. \u201cWhen people perceive that something will affect them, that\u2019s when they are most willing to go on to the streets.\u201d  The winners of this year\u2019s Goldman Environmental Prize, an award for grassroots activism, testify to that. From mega dams in Myanmar and Honduras to polluting mines in Kenya and Canada, all the winners \u201csaw something that threatened their homes or their communities\u201d, says David Gordon, chief executive of the prize.  So whydon\u2019t all communities react similarly when faced by the same threats? The answer lies in large part in how the grievance is perceived. The impact of a construction might not always be clear and sometimes the trade-offs might be appealing. For instance, companies may cosset their projects in promises of new jobs or a new village hall. Framing the argument becomes vital in such situations \u2013 community activists have to present their grievances in a way that resonates with their fellow citizens. If not, they won\u2019t join the cause.  Also, some grievances are materially, as well as perceptibly, relative. Markus Kr\u00f6ger, a specialist in conflict studies at the University of Helsinki, gives the example of a Suzano pulp mill in the remote Brazilian state of Maranh\u00e3o. Local people weren\u2019t wowed by the prospect, but the mill was set to replace a highly polluting charcoal plant. Hence, the pulp project was seen as the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d.    Related: How time banking is creating a new generation of volunteers    Efficacy \u2013 the will to win No community will engage in a fight it knows from the outset it cannot win. Some prospect of success \u2013 what the literature refers to as \u201cpolitical opportunity structure\u201d \u2013 has to exist for people to get out of their armchairs to protest. Good political and judicial governance are also important. In relative terms, UK citizens are better off than most. If local residents object to a broiler shed, then there\u2019s a formal planning process, an ombudsman and \u2013 if necessary \u2013 the law courts to which they can turn. The citizens of Dorstone are pinning their hopes on at least one of these proving good. Where the state is absent or collusive in community abuses, or where corruption restricts individuals\u2019 political liberties, the prospect of success shrinks. In these situations, direct action is a step forward. Think roadblocks, boycotts, e-petitions and publicity stunts \u2013 and the rise of social media has revolutionised the scope of such activities.  But whatever the political environment, people\u2019s confidence increases massively if a network of community groups exists to support them. An individual or group of individuals can shout only so loud. Tap into other activist groups, however, and there lie resources, strategic advice, emotional support and \u2013 potentially \u2013 political clout. Social embeddedness - a sense of community  Alberto Melucci, the Italian sociologist and social movement theorist, was one of the first to identify the centrality of collective identity in protest participation. Research shows that merely categorising people by a simple criteria such as belonging to a blue or red group leads to their being inspired to feel, think and act as members of the group. The more genuine these bonds, the more likely their sense of self will steer towards \u201cwe\u201d rather than \u201cI\u201d. And with that comes notions of shared fate, shared emotions and a desire to be a good group member \u2013 all of which spurs to group action. An adjunct to this traditional theory is the notion of social embeddedness. The idea stems from the concept of social capital \u2013 benefits (economic or not) that are gained by cooperation and collaboration of individuals. Social capital \u2013 especially when it\u2019s structurally reinforced by community groups and networks \u2013 becomes friendship, trust, awareness raising and, ultimately, a greater disposition towards cooperative behaviour. It is in these social networks where, as van Stekelenburg puts it, \u201cpeople talk politics\u201d and can mobilise social action.  Dorstone is an archetypal \u201cembedded\u201d community. Civic groups abound, from the Women\u2019s Institute and Shop Association to the playgroup and Young Farmers Club. It\u2019s a place where everyone knows everyone. And where few, it would seem, like broiler chickens.  Scholars of social mobilisation are also preoccupied with other questions. How do community groups organise, for instance? What protest strategies do they adopt? How do they achieve success (if indeed they do)? Yet all these are ultimately consequent to a fundamental one: what gets people off the couch and on to the street in the first place?

Answer: they\u2019ve both been filmed eating a raw onion. A whole one. In fact, Abramovi\u0107 ate three. \u201cThe first time, the light on video wasn\u2019t so good. The second, sound was lousy. Third, I couldn\u2019t speak or talk, my throat was burning.\u201d The Onion is one of 13 self-portraits at the beating heart of Private Archaeology, a new exhibition of Abramovi\u0107\u2019s work at Mona, the Museum of Old and New Art in Tasmania. Filmed between 1975 and 2002, these extreme video close-ups show the artist furiously brushing her hair, gnawing her cuticles, meditating, being strangled by a boa constrictor, and lying: under a pile of crystals, in shallow water, or upside down. \u201cGood art is never made in studio,\u201d Abramovi\u0107 says. \u201cGood art I make in life.\u201d    Related: Marina Abramovi\u0107 in new Australian tour: 'she's like the Beatles'    The show is not a retrospective. Both Mona and Abramovi\u0107 are quite clear about that. Instead, it mixes recordings of her live performances \u2013 some solo, others made with the one-time love of her life, Ulay \u2013 with installations and interactive exercises from her Method, a series of mindfulness exercises developed at the Marina Abramovi\u0107 Institute in New York. There are also four cabinets filled with photos and notes from the artist\u2019s personal archive in Amsterdam (the archaeology of the show title). It\u2019s Saturday morning of the opening weekend at Mona. The atmosphere around the site is almost nuptial. Glasses are being polished and four pigs are roasting on a spit in the car park. Yesterday\u2019s press view, today\u2019s launch and tonight\u2019s public party (Mona owner David Walsh always invites the whole island) feel a bit like the rehearsal dinner, service and reception of a wedding. \u201cIs the day!\u201d announces the bride, sweeping into the backroom of the museum, clad head to toe in black (Dries Van Noten), her hair and make-up professionally done. Is she nervous? Always. \u201cIf I\u2019m not nervous, I\u2019m nervous. You never know how people are going to receive the work.\u201d  I\u2019m nervous too, I say, to finally meet Abramovi\u0107. It\u2019s a rare performance artist who has such celebrity status, whose fans will camp out all night to be first in line for her exhibitions, as if she were a new Apple product or Wimbledon.     \u2018It\u2019s always happening. It\u2019s always now\u2019: Marina Abramovi\u0107: Photograph: Remi Chauvin/Mona    In 2010, I caught her Moma blockbuster, The Artist is Present, on the last day of a New York visit, but couldn\u2019t queue up to sit opposite her because I was late for my flight. I missed her 2014 Serpentine show, 512 Hours, too, thanks to another plane, this time taking me to a new job in Australia. (I don\u2019t mention how I first came across her work: in Sex and the City, when Carrie and the Russian visit her installation, The House with the Ocean View, at 2am on their first date). To be sharing a sofa with Abramovi\u0107 now, here in Tasmania, close enough that I can see the cracks in her shimmer eyeshadow, well, life is strange, I guess. \u201cWhen I think about my life, the early works, you know, always you learn as a young artist to have a style you can follow, a certain line,\u201d Abramovi\u0107 says. \u201cBut I didn\u2019t do that. I had this enormous urge to make different works. And some of them, I didn\u2019t see any kind of connection. I didn\u2019t know where I\u2019m going. But now, looking 45 years back, everything had perfect sense. It\u2019s like a straight line.\u201d At the same time, she makes sure to resist nostalgia. \u201cI change so many houses and places where I live; I change them like I change socks. I don\u2019t have this absolute, kind of, how you say, attachment. My brother, if he just has to go to holiday to sleep in different bed, for him it is a disaster. I can sleep under this table or in a five-star hotel, I don\u2019t care.  \u201cThe idea of being in the right place in the right time is most important.\u201d    I change houses like I change socks       Right now, that place is Australia, three decades on from her first visit for the 1979 Sydney Biennale. It was after that trip that Abramovi\u0107 negotiated \u2013 through land rights activist Philip Toyne, who died last week \u2013 a seven-month stay with the Pitjantjatjara and Pintupi people of the Western Desert. The experience was transformative, she says, something I hear her repeat many times to many people over the course of the weekend. \u201cIt was a big base of my performance art \u2013 the idea of here and now \u2013 because their Dreamtime and songlines are not something that\u2019s happening in the past or the future. It\u2019s always happening. It\u2019s always now. And that\u2019s the same as time-based art; it\u2019s immaterial. Only what matters is the present.\u201d  She learned the same lesson in different ways, she says, from the monks of Tibet and the shamans of Brazil.     Waterfall (2003), a video projection of 108 images of Tibetan monks and nuns Abramovi\u0107 filmed chanting in meditation. Photograph: MONA/R\u00e9mi Chauvin/Marina Abramovi\u0107 Archives and LIMA    But it\u2019s this kind of logic (or lack of it) that tends to drive Mona\u2019s David Walsh bonkers. When the pair share a stage on Sunday for a spirited public Q&amp;A \u2013 Abramovi\u0107 in black jeans and biker boots this time, wearing her wry Slavic wit on her sleeve \u2013 he acknowledges as much: \u201cYour sparkling magical thinking and my unpolished reductionist reality, these aren\u2019t world views that coincide.\u201d Abramovi\u0107: \u201cI believe in everything by the way.\u201d Walsh: \u201cAnd I don\u2019t believe in anything.\u201d Abramovi\u0107: \u201cAnd this is our main connection here.\u201d Walsh goes on to tell the Woody Allen joke from the end of Annie Hall about the guy whose brother thinks he\u2019s a chook: \u201cI would turn him in but I need the eggs.\u201d Perhaps we all do. Abramovi\u0107\u2019s approach and profile has transformed in recent years from the avant garde artist who cut, starved and endangered herself at will to some sort of spiritual godmother (a label she rejects) for celebrities such as Lady Gaga and Jay Z and for the public who queue in their thousands for her shows.           Have you got what it takes to follow the Abramovi\u0107 method? Link to video    Australians are getting the Method twice over in 2015. Mona visitors are invited to don lab coats and count rice in a one-room recreation of the Marina Abramovi\u0107 Institute. Then in Sydney, the artist will be resident for 12 days at Pier 2/3, mentoring young Australian performance artists and leading the public in five exercises taken from the Serpentine show. \u201cI really like that my work pass the border from being for \u2018art public\u2019 and go to every life,\u201d she says of the project, organised by arts philanthropist John Kaldor. \u201cIf someone comes \u2013 housewife, politician, farmer, teacher or the child \u2013 they can actually experience this work and take something home ... but please dress warm because it is long time. The jackets with a feather, please.\u201d What would happen, I wonder, if all of Canberra came \u2013 if we prescribed the Method to Abbott, Brandis, Shorten, Bishop, the lot? Marina reaches for her handbag (Givenchy) and gets out an iPad. \u201cCome and sit next to me,\u201d she says, tapping the sofa and then her screen. \u201cI show you image that really touch me.\u201d Up pops a photo of a family \u2013 mother, father and son, eyes closed, hands held \u2013 taken during 512 Hours in London. \u201cJust people, British people, and they are touching each other!

The one Marina is very heroic. I just go for it. I don\u2019t care how much pain inside. Then we have second Marina \u2013 very different, very spiritual, very emotional. Too emotional.

From a young age he was fascinated by dissecting angles, understanding shapes and, above all, how best to utilise space. He was also fascinated by movement: how balls bounce in certain ways when a particular spin is put on it and how to control every situation. Outside his childhood home, just off the A10 motorway in the east Amsterdam suburbs, Bergkamp spent hours kicking a ball against a wall below his bedroom window. Understanding the physics, teaching himself. \u201cMost of the time I was by myself, just kicking the ball against the wall, seeing how it bounces, how it comes back, just controlling it,\u201d he recalls in Stillness and Speed. \u201cI wasn\u2019t obsessed, I was just very intrigued by how the ball moves, how the spin worked, what you could do with spin.\u201d It is apt, then, that a spin \u2013 of both the ball and his body \u2013 is the lasting image of his career.   Related: World Cup: 25 stunning moments \u2026 No10: Dennis Bergkamp's wonder goal | Rob Smyth    Bergkamp, now an assistant coach at Ajax, has always said his last-minute wonder goal against Argentina in the 1998 World Cup was his best. It was an exceptional moment and he, albeit with a touch of reluctance, has previously described it as perfect. For a man whose career was spent striving for perfection and abided by a mantra of constant improvement, his use of that word says a lot. But for all the magnificence of those three touches it ultimately did not result in success for his team. Holland were beaten on penalties in the semi-final by Brazil, subsequently finishing fourth behind Croatia, and he probably should not have played against Argentina having escaped a sending off for a nasty stamp on Yugoslavia\u2019s Sinisa Mihajlovic in the previous round. That is why there is a case for his other piece of individual brilliance, the pirouette goal away to Newcastle in March 2002, to be considered his best. It spurred Arsenal on to two pieces of silverware. Newcastle were title challengers that season, spending Christmas on top of the table, but Arsenal\u2019s 2-0 win \u2013 the second was scored by Sol Campbell, predictably assisted by Bergkamp \u2013 knocked the stuffing out of them and Bobby Robson\u2019s team stuttered to the finishing line and dropped to fourth. The following weekend the sides met again in the FA Cup quarter-final and though it finished 1-1, Arsenal won the replay 3-0 at Highbury when Bergkamp scored again.  The league goal was the catalyst for a bulldozing end to the season and ensured both Tony Adams and Lee Dixon signed off with a double. \u201cIt was very important because Newcastle were doing well at that time,\u201d Bergkamp said at the end of the season. \u201cNobody really expected us to take the points at that stage. To score the first goal, to me that was one of the most important goals.\u201d           Bergkamp\u2019s 1998 World Cup goal against Argentina, the brick-by-brick replay.    This was a man who changed a club and some might say English football. When Bergkamp arrived at Arsenal as a \u00a37.5m club-record signing following a miserable two seasons at Internazionale in June 1995, some of his new team-mates bowed at his greatness and chanted only semi-sarcastically \u2018We are not worthy\u2019 at the training ground. However, it was not until Ars\u00e8ne Wenger replaced Bruce Rioch and they rapidly transferred from boring, boring Arsenal to an attacking machine that combined power with flair, that Bergkamp was fully appreciated. Together they formed a dream partnership. In Bergkamp, Wenger had a player with the quality to base a game-plan around and a platform to build on. Simultaneously in Wenger, Bergkamp had a manager who would allow him freedom to express himself The galvanising effect Bergkamp had on a squad still stuck in the days of play hard, work hard when he arrived has lived long in the memory. \u201cDennis Bergkamp was a really big name, we couldn\u2019t wait to see him,\u201d Ray Parlour says in Football\u2019s Greatest. It took a few games for Bergkamp to bed in but soon his class became apparent and with Wenger\u2019s arrival the following season Arsenal were awoken from their slumber and embarked on the club\u2019s most successful period.  Ian Wright, whose relationship with Rioch was so fractured the striker asked for a transfer but stayed and ended up becoming the club\u2019s all-time top scorer in no part thanks to the Dutchman\u2019s assists, says Bergkamp is the \u201cbest signing Arsenal have made and ever will make\u201d. Wright used to refer to him as the \u201cmessiah who is going to save us\u201d. Thierry Henry loved \u201cevery single thing\u201d about Bergkamp and concurs with Wright by saying he is the greatest he has played with despite taking to the same pitch as Lionel Messi at Barcelona. So to St James\u2019 Park and a decisive Saturday evening meeting between title challengers. Newcastle started strongly but the Arsenal defence weathered the storm, fighting off a succession of early attacks. Then, with pretty much their first chance, Bergkamp strikes. The fervent home support were silenced, their team carved open by a move of such quality that even the world\u2019s greatest defenders were never going to stop the juggernaut. Due to the individual brilliance of the goal, the buildup play is often under-appreciated. Or at least, it is not given the praise it deserves. It was a quintessential mid-Wenger era counterattack: blisteringly incisive, 15 seconds after Newcastle lose possession 10 yards from the Arsenal box, the ball is in the net. It begins with Patrick Vieira gaining possession in midfield and gliding forward, his long legs galloping ahead with that familiar deceptive grace. Vieira gives it to Bergkamp who, after a cursory glance around picks out Robert Pires on the left wing near the halfway line. Pires dribbles forward menacingly while Newcastle, who had committed too many forward in search of a deadlock breaker, desperately retreat. At the bottom of the screen, you can see the top half of Bergkamp\u2019s body as he charges forward, right arm raised, bellowing at Pires, who by now had lured two barcoded shirts, to give a return pass. The Frenchman looks up and spots his team-mate reaching the edge of the area with only Nikos Dabizas as protection for Shay Given in the Newcastle goal. He plays an exquisite 30-yard pass straight to Bergkamp, whose back is to goal when he receives it.     Nikos Dabizas can only watch on as Bergkamp gives Arsenal the lead. Photograph: Reuters    At this point the magic happens. Look at the positioning of his body: he anticipates Dabizas\u2019s movement as Pires dispatches. Bergkamp has previously stated the goal had an element of luck on account of Dabizas standing a yard off him and because of that some, bafflingly, argue that it was not deliberate. \u201cTen yards before the ball arrived, I made my decision to turn the defender,\u201d Bergkamp said in an interview with Four Four Two in 2011. He puts his left boot out and manipulates the ball in a way that it spins in a perfect arc around Dabizas\u2019s right as Bergkamp turns on his left. Martin Keown, the defender who Bergkamp regularly took great pleasure in winding up in the changing room, describes him as a ballet dancer due to his balance and flexibility. \u201cI remember playing against Dennis [for England] in 1992 at Wembley against Holland and he scored an amazing goal and I thought he surely didn\u2019t meant that, it was a bit flukey. But then when I got to work with him every day I realised he meant every bit of it.\u201d  \u201cI thought the ball was a little too much behind me so I had to turn to control it,\u201d Bergkamp says of Pires\u2019 pass. \u201cThe quickest way to turn the ball was going that way. It looked a bit special or strange or nice but for me it was the quickest way to the goal. The finish: it was just trying to get it past the goalkeeper in such a way he cannot reach it.\u201d   Related: Dennis Bergkamp on Arsenal, aesthetics and a blueprint for British coaching    Bergkamp\u2019s insouciance only adds to its legendary status. Few would have pulled off such a nonchalant finish after producing a breathtaking piece of skill. Many would have fluffed their lines but not Bergkamp. He steadies himself after spinning the ball, displaying impressive strength to hold off Dabizas after turning, before coolly side-footing past a helpless Given. \u201cUsually when you do something amazing you get carried away,\u201d Henry said. \u201cHow many times did you see a guy do a great control and then rush the finish? Dennis did something amazing but then stayed composed. That\u2019s the difference between great players and normal players.\u201d Some of those sat inside the ground did not fully appreciate it. The move was so rapid, so instinctive that it was not until replays were shown that the beauty was fully appreciated. There was a whiff of disbelief in Martin Tyler\u2019s commentary until he was given a second chance to look at it. \u201cIt\u2019s Bergkamp, it\u2019s magnificent,\u201d he says, before finally getting a fuller sense of how unique the move it was. \u201cThe move, then this,\u201d he adds, placing quite a significant emphasis on the this, almost flabbergasted by the audacity of the first touch. It is like he had never been seen and while imitations have been plentiful, such a clean manoeuvre has not been executed at an elite level since. It was voted Arsenal\u2019s greatest goal in 2009 and considering some of those scored by Henry, not least the Frenchman\u2019s turn and volley against Manchester United in October 2000, that is quite the feat.  But why were people shocked in the first place? That Bergkamp was able to improvise in such a manner should have been no surprise. He had a long history of producing unexpected, daring moments in games. There was the drag back and outside of the boot flick to Freddie Ljungberg against Juventus in the 2001 Champions League, coming from another counterattack started by Vieira. There were many deft lobs to leave goalkeepers looking foolish and the dream-like assists are countless. Yet the statue of Bergkamp outside the Emirates depicts his first touch for Holland against Argentina rather than him spinning Dabizas. There had been attempts to model the pirouette but the designers said it was too complicated to replicate. \u201cThe whole move was inch perfect. It could have gone completely wrong but that time it worked,\u201d Bergkamp said the following summer.  Amazingly Bergkamp says when he watched the footage of the goal it was unlike how he had remembered it at the time. \u201cIt looks quite different to what was in my mind. On TV you see the defender. I knew he was there, but I never saw him. I felt him a little bit, his presence, and I knew he was on this side,\u201d he recalls in Stillness and Speed. \u201cGenerally, though, I don\u2019t like tricks \u2026 it\u2019s really not something on my mind.\u201d Quite the self-effacing statement from a man whose trick remains, possibly, the most memorable in Premier League history.

From Geneva to Madrid and Copenhagen to Vienna, train enthusiasts will hope to put pressure on European rail providers and politicians to reverse a decision they say will annihilate arguably one of the most efficient, environmentally sustainable and convenient ways of travelling. Protests kicked off on Friday morning in Geneva, where demonstrators turned up in their pyjamas at 7am, and will continue throughout the weekend at the central stations of Madrid, Berlin, Vienna, Paris, Dortmund, Copenhagen, Odense, Basel and Hamburg. The demonstrations are due to culminate in Berne on Sunday in a late-night pyjama party to which protesters will bring camp beds.

Night-time services cancelled last year included those running from Amsterdam to Copenhagen, Basel to Copenhagen, and Paris to Berlin, with more to follow.   Related: End of the line for Europe's iconic night trains?    Campaigners say the companies have failed to invest in the night services to offer an attractive alternative to flying. Features such as restaurant cars and comfortable sleeping quarters for all budgets have been cut.  The Caledonian (London to Scotland) and the Night Riviera (London to Penzance) sleeper services, often praised for bringing some of the old-time romance back to rail travel in Britain, as well as Chinese and Russian rail operators, who have invested heavily in their night train services in recent years, are cited by campaigners as the role models for how European operators might make sleeper trains attractive alternatives to air travel.  Additional challenges include the fact that sleeper carriages, once standardised and able to switch between multiple track gauges, are now largely incompatible with each other.  Campaigners bemoan the lack of political will to scrap the VAT that applies to international ticket sales, from which airline operators are excluded, which rail services say puts them at an unfair disadvantage. Bernhard Knierim, from Bahn f\u00fcr Alle (Train for All), who is due to take part in Friday evening\u2019s protest in Berlin, said the EU did little to encourage joined-up, cross-border rail travel across the continent.

Appearances across the country by authors including Antony Beevor, Jonathan Sacks and Helen Macdonald will mark the ninth Independent Bookshop week, but the shutters are still being pulled down as Amazon, ebooks and supermarkets take their toll.  Last year almost twice as many bookshops closed down as new ones opened. There are 939 independents left in the UK and Ireland, compared with more than 1,500 a decade ago, according to the latest count by the Booksellers Association. Among the survivors, though, there are signs of a renaissance. Booka in Oswestry, Shropshire, which was recently crowned independent bookshop of the year by trade magazine the Bookseller, is one of the retailers leading the fightback. Carrie and Tim Morris opened Booka in 2010, during the depths of the economic downturn when high street shops were closing and banks had stopped lending. Cheap books were everywhere: on the internet and on supermarket shelves. E-readers were just taking off, sparking endless conversations about the death of the paperback.     Carrie and Tim Morris, owners of Booka bookshop. Photograph: Jon Super for the Guardian    \u201cI think some people thought we were mad,\u201d says Tim Morris, who gave up his job as a town planner to become a bookseller. \u201cPeople used to say \u2018you are very brave,\u2019\u201d adds Carrie, a former primary school teacher. Five and half years later, Booka has confounded sceptics and the wider trend of failing high street bookstores. Not only has the Oswestry shop increased its turnover each year, it has become a mecca for book lovers in the Midlands and Welsh borders, drawing in visitors from as far away as Manchester to hear writers such as Michael Morpurgo, Jon Ronson and Martin Bell. On a midsummer evening the shop is crowded with people, who have come to listen to three authors talk about their latest work over a glass of prosecco. The conversation zigzags over the books\u2019 themes: the London riots, religious cults, family and the search for belonging, and the audience ask the authors about their writing routines. \u201cIt is a way to connect with you readers, you won\u2019t do that on Amazon,\u201d says David Whitehouse, who is promoting his second novel, The Mobile Library. Amid fizzy wine and applause, the renaissance of independent bookselling is certainly a seductive thesis, but ongoing closures remain a worry.     Book lovers attend an evening with Picador authors Rebecca Wait, David Whitehouse and Sarah Butler at Booka. Photograph: Jon Super for the Guardian    Speaking to the Guardian about Independent Bookshop Week, children\u2019s author Philip Pullman said he was concerned about the industry\u2019s predicament. \u201cThey simply cannot compete on price with Amazon, and yet their presence in a town is a sign of civilisation that we really ought to look after.\u201d For publishers, the loss of thousands of shop windows damages the book industry as a whole. Francesca Main, editorial director of Picador, the literary arm of the Macmillan publishing group, says the closure of independent bookshops is a threat to the range and diversity of books published. \u201cIt does worry me because shops are the best way to discover authors,\u201d she adds.    There was a sense that bookshops were doomed \u2026 but we have turned that conversation round  Meryl Halls, Booksellers Association     Independent booksellers were among the first to champion The Miniaturist, a story of secrets, intrigue and sugar in 17th-century Amsterdam by Jesse Burton \u2013 propelling the debut novelist up bestseller lists. \u201cIn the early days, it was handselling from dedicated booksellers that helped the book get noticed,\u201d says Main. \u201cAmazon is just a giant sea of books, unless you are on the right algorithm you won\u2019t be found.\u201d Despite the heft of Amazon, Meryl Halls at the Booksellers Association is hopeful that more high streets will be graced with independent booksellers in 10 years\u2019 time. \u201cThere was a sense that bookshops were doomed \u2026 but we have turned that conversation round,\u201d she says. \u201cConsumers really value a diverse high street and value book stores as part of that.\u201d Halls is heartened by the recovery of independent booksellers in the US. Since hitting a nadir in 2009, membership of the American Booksellers Association \u2013 the best proxy for store numbers \u2013 has grown by 22%. Philip Jones, editor of The Bookseller, also sees reasons for optimism. \u201cMomentum is back on the high street and being led by very well established and very good booksellers who have had to learn the new skills to compete in the market place.\u201d    Established and very good booksellers \u2026 have had to learn the new skills to compete in the market place  Philip Jones, The Bookseller     The only concern he sees is that selling coffee may be more lucrative than shifting copies of the latest Ian McEwan. \u201cThe business of actually selling books through bookstores is perhaps not as lively as the business of being a bookshop,\u201d Jones says.  It is not just good coffee and entrepreneurial flair working their magic: independent sellers are also boosted by the resilience of paper books, slowing takeup of e-readers and the lift from an economic recovery. The appeal of an indie vibe also helps. Waterstones \u2013 undergoing its own revival under the leadership of veteran bookseller James Daunt \u2013 has opened a self-styled \u201cquintessentially local bookshop\u201d in the seaside town of Southwold in Suffolk. Tellingly, this Waterstones outlet will not bear the company name. When Penguin Random House, the world\u2019s largest publisher, launched a social network-cum-book-buying website, it chose the title My Independent Bookshop. A small proportion of the takings go to independent shops.     Veteran bookseller James Daunt, the chief executive of Waterstones.

All kinds of independent book stores are doing well nonetheless, she says. \u201cThey are all embedded in the community in some way.\u201d But what about those customers who browse boutique shelves, linger over a flat white \u2013 and then go home to order a batch of titles on Amazon. The author of the bestselling novel One Day, David Nicholls, recently described such behaviour as a \u201cgenteel form of shoplifting\u201d. Robertson is sanguine. This kind of shopping is a fact of life, she says, although she is convinced most of her customers are buyers, as well as browsers. \u201cI think people are beginning to realise we are providing some kind of service \u2026 and join the dots,\u201d she says. High street story Household names such as Woolworths and Borders may have vanished from the British high street, but independent retailers have actually increased their presence. \u2022 The number of independent shops has risen each year since 2010, although recent growth has slowed. \u2022 Whereas the old high street was held together by the butcher, the baker and the newsagent, today\u2019s mainstays are the barber, the beauty salon and the e-cigarette retailer. \u2022 In 2014 a net total of 346 independent shops opened, reflecting huge churn among small businesses. According to a recent survey by the Local Data Company and the British Independent Retailers Association, 15,762 shops opened for business, while 15,416 shut their doors for good. \u2022 The biggest growth has been among service providers that do not face competition from the internet, such as tattooists and hairdressers. Restaurants, bars, cafes and betting shops have also increased their presence, although not as rapidly as previous years.

A meeting of eurozone finance ministers broke up after little more than an hour of discussions over a new offer from the government of the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras. However, while negotiators said the proposals on budget surpluses, pensions and tax represented a good basis for discussing a last-ditch deal, the move came too late for a definitive breakthrough at an emergency summit of EU leaders on Monday evening. Expectations of a broad agreement were raised, however, after Greece\u2019s economy minister, Giorgos Stathakis, told the BBC he expected eurozone leaders would reach agreement over the Greek bailout, allowing authorities in Athens to unlock \u20ac7.2bn (\u00a36.3bn) of financial aid. An EU official on the creditors\u2019 side described the Greek proposals as the first \u201cdetailed and credible\u201d plan that they had seen in five months of deadlock.  Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister, who chairs the group of 19 eurozone countries, said that the European Union institutions needed time to look at the Greek proposals with the aim of reaching an agreement later this week. The Greek plan was \u201ca basis to really restart the talks again and really get a result\u201d, he said, although officials needed to assess whether \u201cthe economic reforms [proposed] are enough for the economy to take off again\u201d. Greece submitted concessions overnight in response to creditors\u2019 key demands including raising VAT and making changes to the country\u2019s pension system that would eventually raise the retirement age to 67. Several eurozone finance ministers complained of confusion after the Greek government sent two versions of the proposals, but Dijsselbloem dismissed it as \u201cno big problem\u201d.  An EU official involved in the talks on the creditors\u2019 side said of the proposals:  \u201cI am not sure if they will fly, but they are a good basis for discussion.\u201d  He also confirmed that the Greeks had made meaningful concessions on VAT rates and pensions reform, two of the main sticking points. The Greeks wanted to keep a three-tier system of VAT, but the lowest rate, which the creditors want abolished, would only apply to a \u201ccouple\u201d of items, believed to be books and medicines. Eurozone ministers are expected to meet again on Thursday \u2013 their third meeting in eight days \u2013 in yet another attempt to end the deadlock which has brought Greece to the brink of bankruptcy.  Meanwhile, the Greek prime minister, Alexis Tsipras, was still due on Monday night to meet German chancellor Angela Merkel, French president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande and other eurozone leaders to discuss the latest plan.  The emergency meeting of EU leaders is being seen as a victory for Tsipras, who has long argued that a breakthrough can only be made at the highest political levels.   Negotiators are promising debt relief for Greece but officials have stressed that a breakthrough will depend on a positive response from Tsipras. Greece\u2019s international creditors are looking at a deal that would extend the country\u2019s bailout by six months and supply up to \u20ac18bn (\u00a312.9bn) in rescue funds. Greece urgently needs funds ahead of a \u20ac1.6bn payment to the International Monetary Fund due on 30 June. The six-month rescue extension being considered would unlock the \u20ac7.2bn in Greece\u2019s bailout fund that is yet to be disbursed as well as \u20ac10.9bn already lent to Athens but earmarked for recapitalisation of its weakened banks. The latter sum could be quickly transferred to the government to help debt repayments. Earlier on Monday, as finance ministers arrived in the pouring rain in Brussels for their meeting, many played down hopes of an imminent breakthrough, saying they had not had enough time to study the plans..   Membership Event: Guardian Newsroom: Should Greece leave the Euro?     Alexander Stubb, Finland\u2019s finance minister, complained that finance ministers and eurozone leaders had \u201cwasted a lot of air miles\u201d over Monday\u2019s meetings. As the talks broke up he tweeted: \u201cWork continues. Institutions assess proposals.\u201d  \u201cWe need a deal in the coming days,\u201d said the European commissioner responsible for the euro, Valdis Dombrovskis.  Jean-Claude Juncker\u2019s head of cabinet, Martin Selmayr, said the Athens proposal offered \u201ca good basis for progress\u201d, though he described the talks as a \u201cforceps delivery\u201d, underscoring the exertions to prevent Greece leaving the eurozone. EU leaders had been reluctant to discuss Greece at this Thursday\u2019s summit, where the packed agenda includes the humanitarian migrant crisis on Europe\u2019s borders, a controversial trade deal with the US and the UK\u2019s demands for treaty change. Tsipras met his three main creditors \u2013 the European commission, the IMF and the European Central Bank (ECB) \u2013 on Monday morning, after getting an initially positive reaction to his compromise plan.   Related: Greek crisis: last-ditch bid to avert default - live updates    Talks between Greece\u2019s leftist government and its creditors have been deadlocked for five months and the country is fast running out of money. But hopes that an agreement might be reached sent shares across Europe surging today, with the Greek stock market rising 9%. The German DAX leapt by 2.5% and the French market was also up over 2%. In London, the FTSE 100 index jumped by 75 points, or 1.1%. Italian shares were up by 1.8%. Italy\u2019s prime minister, Matteo Renzi, urged the two sides to seize a \u201cwindow of opportunity\u201d, saying that all conditions were in place for them to reach a \u201cwin-win accord\u201d. The Greek financial system was given a boost ahead of the crunch talks, when the ECB agreed to extend emergency funding to Greek banks. A banking source told Reuters that the ECB\u2019s decision-making governing council had raised the amount of emergency funds available to Greece\u2019s cash-starved banks and was ready to convene again any time it was needed. Underlining the growing concern beyond Greece, several thousand demonstrators gathered in Brussels on Sunday and several hundred in Amsterdam to plead for solidarity with the cash-strapped country. In Athens itself, more than 7,000 people took to the streets for the second time this week to protest austerity with banners reading \u201cA different Europe with Tsipras\u201d and \u201cYou can\u2019t blackmail the people, the country is not for sale\u201d.

Its owner, islander Seltsouk Atakli, is laughing and joking with customers. \u201cKeep smiling is what I always say,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cBut sometimes a smile is not enough.\u201d As the latest proposed deal to avoid Greece\u2019s bankruptcy threatens to unravel,  a row is raging on Rhodes and several other Greek islands over fears that they are being unfairly targeted. To the surprise of locals, one of the government\u2019s proposals to its creditors is to get rid of the special lower VAT rate that applies to a number of Greece\u2019s far-flung islands \u2013 not just the famous tourist destinations of Mykonos and Santorini, but scores of little-known smaller islands with ageing and depleting populations.   Related: Tsipras summoned to Brussels for emergency talks over Greek bailout deal    Greece has thousands of islands scattered over a vast area, fewer than 250 of which are populated. Some of those furthest from the mainland have long depended on a special VAT rate 30% lower than elsewhere, which offsets the high cost of having to ship basic everyday goods long distances. Rhodes, Greece\u2019s fourth largest island, is a case in point, along with all the other Dodecanese islands scattered at the country\u2019s furthest south-eastern point between Crete and Turkey. Sunbathers on Rhodes can contemplate the nearby Turkish coast from their loungers, while Athens is more than 230 nautical miles away. Everything from milk to medicines has to be transported here. Many other countries have similar reduced VAT schemes to support isolated territories, such as Spain\u2019s concessions to the Canary Islands. Indeed, for years the special rate for far-flung Greek islands was considered untouchable.  In January\u2019s Greek election, the radical left party Syriza topped the poll in Rhodes, where islanders believed the special lower VAT rate was protected. A Syriza spokesman this week acknowledged that scrapping the special VAT rate would have a repercussion on island residents. Syriza\u2019s coalition partner, the rightwing Independent Greeks party \u2013 keen to court voters on islands \u2013 has vowed this week to oppose any abolition of the special island rate \u201ceven if the government falls\u201d. In his restaurant, Atakli says: \u201cAt least 90% of my supplies have to be brought in from the mainland. Vegetables are grown here but all milk, cheese \u2013 even olive oil \u2013 has to be shipped very far, it\u2019s expensive. I\u2019ll have no choice but to absorb this VAT rise myself. I\u2019m not going to put up prices in the restaurant. It\u2019s more important for me to keep my customers. I\u2019ll take a cut on profits.\u201d      Night in the old town. Photograph: EyesWideOpen/Getty Images    But his profits are already down after years of crisis. He has cut staff, negotiated staggered payments for his many unpaid bills and is spending less on his family, clothes and supermarket shop. His restaurant, which has been going for 25 years, once flourished. \u201cThat seems like a fairy tale now,\u201d he said.  The VAT issue is about more than economics; it\u2019s about keeping Greece\u2019s islands populated. Atakli, a proud islander from a Muslim family going back generations on Rhodes, is a symbol of its centuries-old multiculturalism. Islanders across Greece are crucial to the country\u2019s rich cultural identity. With many of the poorer and smaller islands losing services, jobs and seeing their younger generations leave for the mainland, there are fears that their populations will gradually decline, leaving ghost villages and tourist ghettos. Politically, Greece has always seen it as important to keep up the population of the Aegean islands that face Turkey. Rhodes, which has a healthy population of 100,000 and welcomes around 2 million visitors a year, is at the richer end of the island spectrum. It has always been famous for a range of tourism, from world heritage sites to drunken teenage bar crawls. But tinier islands face harder challenges and could be far worse hit by the VAT proposals. Beyond Rhodes is the small remote island of Halki, with an ageing population of only a few hundred that swells slightly with tourists in the summer months. It relies on all products coming in by boat, even drinking water, which arrives by tanker every week. Many islands in Greece are particularly difficult to reach, most do not have airports, and sea connections can be cut off by bad weather in winter.    Membership Event: Guardian Newsroom: Can Greece be saved?     In her Rhodes hardware store, Maria Kantarzoglou wears a T-shirt saying: \u201cAll is fair in love and war.\u201d But there is no fairness being applied when it comes to taxation for islanders, she says.  \u201cPeople here feel forgotten by Athens. Everyone will be affected by this, and life here is already more expensive than on the mainland. It costs me more to travel to Athens than it costs a tourist to come from Amsterdam to Rhodes for a week with everything included. \u201cI love my island and I\u2019d never leave,\u201d she adds, but her brother, feeling the economic squeeze at the start of the crisis, has already moved to the Netherlands and found work in a spare-parts company.   Tourism is Greece\u2019s biggest industry and Rhodes is one of the country\u2019s largest tourist destinations. If VAT goes up, it could have repercussions on the holiday trade. Already, amid uncertainty over a bailout deal, tourist numbers to Rhodes have slightly declined. Holidaymakers also generally spend less than they used to.  In the warren of shops and tavernas of Rhodes\u2019s old town, cheap prices are a key draw. \u201cNot expensive!\u201d shout waiters outside restaurants. Bars proudly display their \u201ccheap drinks\u201d list. The tanks lined up for fish pedicures and the shops selling novelty T-shirts with slogans such as \u201cI don\u2019t need Google \u2013 my wife knows everything\u201d also claim to give tourists a better deal than elsewhere.  Islanders point out that other countries competing with Greece for tourism, including Italy, Spain and France, already have special lower tourism VAT rates, and nearby Turkey and Cyprus have an even lower sales tax. Rhodes business leaders warn of a \u201ctriple blow\u201d to the island because the bailout proposals also include other potential VAT rises on the restaurant sector and hotels.   At a vast hotel and spa along the coast from Rhodes town, the manager, who does not want to be named, says: \u201cThe situation is still vague and we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen. It\u2019s frustrating because this is the time of year we carry out our tendering for next season \u2013 we\u2019re unable to prepare our price lists for next year because we don\u2019t know how VAT will change. It\u2019s difficult. Most people won\u2019t have any choice but to put their prices up. We\u2019ll have to find a way to survive.\u201d   Greece map    Pappou Ioannis, president of the Chamber of Commerce and Industry of the Dodecanese, tells the Guardian that the special lower VAT rate in the Aegean islands is \u201cnot a privilege but a necessity\u201d. Abolishing that rate, he says, will prove to be \u201cthe tombstone of any productive activity in our islands\u201d.  Ioannis warns of sabotage against the tourist industry and says entrepreneurship on the island \u201cwill be the equivalent to a crime\u201d.  Crucially, he says, a VAT change will have a massive and \u201ctragic\u201d effect on the lives of islanders themselves.  \u201cLife for the islanders is very difficult due to the particularities of island territory,\u201d he says. \u201cEven islands that are considered rich have huge gaps in key areas such as health, education and infrastructure. The increase in VAT rates will further complicate islanders\u2019 lives. The increase in cost for crucial items and services will be a heavy blow, especially for the vulnerable social groups \u2013 the people with lower income, pensioners and the unemployed.  \u201cThe damage to the economy and to Rhodes society will be tragic, as none of the industry sectors will remain unaffected. Unfortunately, recent years have proven that this is a road that can only lead to even greater recession.\u201d     Faliraki beach. Photograph: Linda Nylind    Without businesses absorbing the costs themselves, a VAT rise on far-flung Greek islands could see the price of holiday packages rise by approximately 10%, according to Michael Arghyrou, reader in economics at Cardiff University. \u201cThat is not a negligible amount of money, particularly since there is strong competition from tourism in countries such as Spain, Portugal or Turkey,\u201d he says.  Arghyrou would rather see reform of the most bloated non-essential areas of Greece\u2019s public sector than VAT rises that push up prices for everyone, regardless of wealth.  Wandering through Rhodes old town, Liina Tiiter, an engineer on holiday from Estonia, says she is drawn to the island by the sunshine and the historic sites.

It is significant because it is the first painting to be sold from the enormous stash of paintings hoarded by the German recluse Cornelius Gurlitt.

Then along comes Thursday, the carefree kid from interstate who everyone wants to sit next to at little lunch. Is it too late for Friday to make its charge? All those Carlton games and whitewashes in the first half of the season certainly didn\u2019t help but tonight\u2019s subtly enticing meeting of Sydney and Richmond kicks off a fortnight in which both Friday games (Collingwood and Hawthorn meet next week) are of genuine interest. The Eagles stopped Richmond\u2019s stellar month-long winning streak last weekend and they\u2019ll face a refreshed, post-bye Sydney, but with the defensive capabilities to control the likes of Lance Franklin and Kurt Tippett, the Tigers aren\u2019t without a chance if they can manage the miniscule margin for error in midfield duels at the SCG.  Nathan Gordon and former skipper Chris Newman return for Richmond and Kane Lambert debuts, while the sagging fortunes of Steven Morris have continued with the hard nut receiving the chop. Flint-hard Zak Jones is a handy \u2018in\u2019 for the Swans. At ANZ Stadium last year the Tigers won this game \u2013 the craziest and most joyful of all their victories in that utterly bonkers run home to the finals \u2013 so how could you totally rule out an upset from the only side to defeat Fremantle this season?

At football. Now half of them couldn\u2019t get a kick in a stampede and people are putting aside their theories that the coach might be a terrible bloke in favour of the more pressing issue that he\u2019s potentially a terrible coach.  The general malaise is proving hard to shake for the 13th-placed Bombers, who enter this game against the Hawks at least having managed to avoid defeat on their bye weekend. Injured Paul Chapman is one of five omissions from the side that lost to West Coast two weeks back but the bigger \u2018out\u2019 is that of pacey ball-winner Travis Colyer with a foot complaint. He\u2019s been one of few shining lights this season. As all that\u2019s been happening, Hawthorn has managed to recover from its indifferent start to the season, easily accounting for Gold Coast, St Kilda and Adelaide either side of the bye. The Bombers have genuinely challenged them in the last few meetings but this time around it\u2019s easier to see them dish out the kind of pounding that characterised this rivalry from 2011-13. You can never place much stock in these things but the sight of Michael Hurley at centre-half forward in Essendon\u2019s selected side \u2013 sheer desperation aside \u2013 comes with the more alarming rider of James Gwilt being slotted into his place at the defensive end alongside Jason Winderlich. I have a hunch that Jack Gunston won\u2019t mind forcing them to stride out and chase him up the ground. Adelaide will be back in the winner\u2019s column There\u2019s been far worse 6-5 sides than seventh-placed Adelaide, who enter Saturday afternoon\u2019s Gabba encounter with Brisbane after a creditable loss to Hawthorn last week. The thing I love most about the Crows (oh geez, did I really just say I love them?) is the amount of sentences that new coach Phil Walsh starts with the words, \u201cI\u2019ll sound like a bit of a weirdo, but\u2026\u201d  This week it was the world of art from which he was drawing unique inspiration and with more effortlessly quote-worthy results. \u201cWhen I was in Amsterdam I did go to the Van Gogh Museum and I\u2019m not an art critic \u2026 there\u2019s a man with great frustration,\u201d he started. \u201cI looked at that painting Sunflowers and for a bogan from Hamilton like myself, I could actually see the beauty in that frustration.\u201d  \u201cSo although our fans are frustrated, we\u2019re frustrated, we like to think there\u2019s some masterpieces still to be painted this year.\u201d   How could you not love this man? Let him run the entire league I say. Imagine the game-day experience of watching Marina Abramovic stare out Walsh\u2019s former team-mate John Gastev in the middle of the MCG. Picture a football world in which the rules of the game were administered not by Mark Evans, Leigh Matthews and John Worsfold but David Lynch, Ai Weiwei and Damien Hirst. Even the Brownlow count could be spiced up with the winner stepping on stage in scenes of jubilation only to be given an atomic wedgie by Banksy.  What helps Walsh\u2019s side in a football sense this week is that they\u2019ll be facing a truly dismal Brisbane outfit whose nearest artistic metaphor at the moment would be Marcel Duchamp\u2019s dirty urinal, only if it was one that had also seen heavy abuse from an entire week\u2019s worth of nightclub revellers. If Adelaide lose this one the only honorable thing is for Phil Walsh to chop off an ear. The Bulldogs must take St Kilda seriously In most pre-season analyses it didn\u2019t seem unreasonable that St Kilda were being spoken of with something close to pity, merely a rebuilding side who\u2019d pump games into the kids and get flogged more often than not. That\u2019s held true against a few of the top sides but for everyone else the Saints have proved a trickier prospect. Melbourne, Brisbane and Gold Coast have all slipped on the banana skin, as did this week\u2019s opponents the Bulldogs in round six, when they squandered a 55-point lead as David Armitage and a host of Saints midfielders ran rampant. Of interest here is the fact that following the bye, St Kilda has actually dropped three players \u2013 Luke Delaney, Blake Acres and Cameron Shenton \u2013 who featured in the thrilling win over Melbourne a fortnight back. Into the side in their place come Adam Schneider, Sam Fisher and Dylan Roberton while the Dogs welcome back Dale Morris. Luke Beveridge\u2019s side is right in the finals hunt this season \u2013 unexpectedly so \u2013 but if they drop another one to the Saints they make that job far more difficult than it ought to be. Masochists queue here Like an Adam Sandler film or a trip through the KFC drive-thru, games of football like Carlton\u2019s clash with Gold Coast this weekend are not the kind of activities you want to be caught engaging in, but one imagines that a certain number of diehards will still perform the thankless task of half-filling Etihad Stadium on Sunday.  The Blues fans among them can enter the game with renewed confidence, to be fair. That thrilling win against Port Adelaide last week was actually foreseeable in a lot of ways and outright favoritism in this one is certainly an improvement on the shambolic first two months of the season. Vital to that has been not only the winds of change floating through Princes Park but the emergence of the staggeringly talented, possibly bionic Rising Star shoo-in Patrick Cripps. Would it be outlandish to say that after nine games of league football he\u2019s already Carlton\u2019s best player?  Bryce Gibbs is one of only a handful who\u2019d disagree, but he\u2019s missing this week on account of his controversial suspension and Andrew Walker is out with a knee injury, so others will need to step into the void. Stephen May and Harley Bennell return for the Suns but Gary Ablett didn\u2019t quite get up, so this still qualifies as a \u2018hit and hope\u2019 mission for Rodney Eade\u2019s poorly side.

Related: Uber backlash: taxi drivers' protests in Paris part of global revolt    Paris In some of the most violent protests against Uber, 3,000 taxi drivers this week blocked main roads in Paris, including routes to airports, and burnt tyres. Taxi drivers also protested in Marseilles and other French cities. Bernard Cazenueve, France\u2019s interior minister, declared Uber illegal and said Uber\u2019s refusal to stop operating was cynical and arrogant. He said: \u201cWe are in a state of law and the law will rule.\u201d In March, police raided Uber\u2019s Paris offices to seize 1,200 mobile phones, computers and documents as part of an investigation into the UberPop service, which connects private drivers with passengers, and its use of customer data. London Up to 5,000 black-cab drivers blockaded London\u2019s city centre in a protest against Uber last year. They argue that Transport for London lacks a clear policy on taxi-booking apps, and point out that that Uber\u2019s drivers lack \u201cthe knowledge\u201d \u2013 the gruelling test on London\u2019s streets taken by aspiring cabbies. Boris Johnson, the mayor of London, was abused by a cab driver over Uber operating in the city this month. Johnson said this week it was not fair that black-cab drivers had to spend four years acquiring the knowledge and suggested Uber drivers could be made to pass language and geography tests. Delhi The Indian capital banned Uber in December after a woman said she was raped by one of the company\u2019s drivers. The incident provoked outrage at Uber\u2019s failure to check whether the driver had a clean police record. Uber claims that it has tightened the ways it carries out background checks on drivers and improved safety measures. Delhi\u2019s transport department complained earlier this year that Uber was still operating, despite the ban. This month, police started enforcing the ban more rigorously by hailing cars from Uber and confronting them when they arrived. About 300 drivers from Uber and other banned services protested that the ban threatened their livelihoods. San Francisco The family of a six-year-old girl, struck and killed by one of its drivers in the company\u2019s home city of San Francisco, is suing Uber and calling for a jury trial on charges including wrongful death and negligence. Uber deactivated the driver\u2019s account after the crash and said he was not making a trip on the Uber system at the time. The family\u2019s lawyer said: \u201cUber, though touting itself as the future of transportation, endangers public safety and has thrown transportation back into the wild-west era.\u201d The company said it sympathised with the girl\u2019s family but \u201cdid not cause this tragic accident\u201d. Uber shut down its service in Kansas after state lawmakers voted through legislation that would force the company to carry out background checks on its drivers and carry additional car insurance. Members of a Chicago taxi drivers\u2019 union circled City Hall for four hours in February, but refused to pick up passengers in protest against Uber, which they said siphoned 2m rides a month away from traditional cabs. Chicago has licensed Uber after it agreed to security measures for passengers, but established cab drivers said the rules favoured Uber. Hangzhou After a confrontation between Uber drivers and local cab drivers in the regional capital, Uber instructed its drivers not to get involved in disputes and said it would monitor them electronically and fire those who disobeyed.  Taxi drivers across China have protested against what they say is unfair competition from Uber. Following raids in Guangzhou, Chinese police last month visited Uber offices in Chengdu in a widening investigation into the company\u2019s operations in China, where authorities have banned drivers of private cars from offering services through ride-hailing apps. Amsterdam Uber drivers have been blocked by taxi drivers and one reported having his tyres slashed. A Dutch court banned UberPop in December and some unlicensed drivers have since been fined. Madrid After the Madrid taxi association complained about Uber, a judge ordered the company to stop operating in Spain because drivers were unauthorised and taking part in unfair competition. Brussels Uber is illegal in Brussels and some of its drivers claim their cars have been vandalised. Brussels has announced plans to legalise Uber next year, but under strict regulation. Montreal The Canadian province of Quebec regards Uber\u2019s service as illegal and the city\u2019s taxi bureau has cracked down, seizing cars from drivers. Sydney Uber made itself unpopular when it increased fares during the Sydney hostage crisis last year. The New South Wales government declared Uber\u2019s service illegal. \u2022 This article was amended on 3 July 2015.

The Davies Airports Commission appointed by the government is expected to report on Wednesday and favour Heathrow expansion, subject to assurances on air quality. The government is likely to respond in the late autumn. The presence of Goldsmith, the most likely Conservative candidate, will complicate the government response. Thomas, MP for Harrow West, is seen as an outside bet for the mayoralty, but his intervention shows the extent which airport expansion will move to the centre of the political debate within Labour in the next few weeks. It will be the dominant economic issue of the campaign, Thomas said, adding there was no point Labour electing a pale imitation of Goldsmith. The issue is likely to reveal divisions between enviromentalists in Labour and those who believe the party has to show it is determined its relations with business.  Thomas also warns his party that the electorate would be looking for strong leaders, and not people who flip-flop over the big issues. Thomas did not specify to whom he was referring, but Sadiq Khan, the former shadow justice secretary and one of the frontrunners for the mayoralty, has recently come out against expansion at Heathrow even though he previously supported it. Khan has cited the impact on air quality, saying \u201cthe extra air pollution would not just make it near-impossible for us to meet legal standards, it would damage the health of thousands of Londoners\u201d. Khan\u2019s switch may have lost some him support with Unite and GMB members who support expansion, but his stance may neutralise Goldsmith. It could also open a flank against Tessa Jowell, the frontrunner in the Labour contest. Jowell has said she will wait for publication of the Davies Commission\u2019s report on airport expansion and has an open mind on the issue. Her response this week will be critical to her campaign. The commission has shortlisted three options \u2013 a third runway or lengthening an existing runway at Heathrow, or building a second runway at Gatwick. If the government postpones its response to Davies to the autumn, the issue will reach boiling point by the time of the mayoral election itself next spring, Thomas said: \u201cWe already face intense competition from other airport hubs around the world, many of which have more runways than we do at Heathrow. The option of doing both [at Heathrow and Gatwick] would keep London competitive. Thomas said he believed a third runway at Heathrow could meet all the objections concerning noise air quality and climate change, adding \u201cit would be madness to turn our backs on 40,000 jobs and 10,000 apprenticeships\u201d.  Thomas said, \u201cI think Londoners support airport expansion and understands the number of jobs it can bring to the area. There is a vociferous minority opposing expansion, but I am not sure they representative of what most Londoners think .\u201d By positioning the new runway further west it would be possible to keep more planes flying higher over London, Thomas said.  He added that the government\u2019s committee on climate change has said airport expansion would not cause the government to breach its reduction in CO2 targets, partly because modern planes were reducing emissions.  The committee is due to publish its annual progress report on how the government is meeting its climate change targets next week.

My favourite source for the birdsong recordings that I embed into my stories is Xeno-canto. This online community, which recently celebrated its tenth anniversary, hosts a large database filled with hundreds of thousands of crowdsourced bird sound recordings that are freely available to the public as uploads or embeds.  Xeno-canto, which translates as \u201cstrange sound\u201d, was launched on 30 May 2005 by Bob Planqu\u00e9, a mathematical biologist at VU University Amsterdam, and Willem-Pier Vellinga, a physicist who now consults for a global materials technology company. Xeno-canto began as a small project focused on South American birds. \u201cThe main reason to start XC [Xeno-canto] was that it was very hard back in 2005 to identify birds by sound\u201d, wrote Professor Planqu\u00e9 in email. \u201cIt is very difficult to use CDs for this purpose, since you have to go through each recording and listen to it. We thought a web database might solve two problems\u201d, wrote Professor Planqu\u00e9 in email. \u201cIt would allow everyone to contribute to a hopefully large dataset, with many species and song types covered, but it would also make it easier to put names to songs.\u201d Ten years on, Xeno-canto hosts bird sounds from all continents and daily receives new recordings from some of the remotest places on Earth. Its current archives include more than 240,000 recordings from more than 9300 species of birds, making it the most comprehensive collection of bird sound recordings on Earth.      Lynette Rudman records her subjects using a camera and a microphone. Ms Rudman, an avid birder, is a new contributor to Xeno-canto. She mostly records bird sounds in South Africa. Photograph: Pam Kleiman/courtesy of Lynette Rudman    \u201cXC is a sounds-only project\u201d, wrote Professor Planqu\u00e9 in email. He noted that there are plenty of websites that index images or videos, but \u201csounds have received much less attention\u201d because making sound recordings is not easy.  \u201cBy limiting ourselves to sounds, we have built a very focussed and dedicated group of sound enthusiasts; ornithologists, birdwatchers, bird guides, conservation biologists, ecologists, and so on. It is much less mainstream than making photos of birds. If we had included photographs, the sounds would have been snowed under\u201d, wrote Professor Planqu\u00e9 in email. Further, creating sonograms of sound recordings requires some programming skills.  Sonograms, also known as spectrograms, spectral waterfalls or voiceprints, are a visual representation of sound, with time on the horizontal axis and frequency or pitch on the vertical axis. For example, the first ten seconds of this simple bird song can be visualised in its accompanying sonogram:     Sonogram of the first 10 seconds from a sound recording of a singing great tit, Parus major. Recorded by Nikolay Sariev in Bulgaria.   Sonograms allow for a quick visual inspection of sounds for identification purposes as well as detailed inspections so auditory differences that humans cannot hear can be identified visually. \u201cFor instance, XC provides sonograms of recordings, visual representations of sounds. We find it much easier to glance through lots of sonograms than to listen to many sounds. This makes it easier to find a sound that you might have heard or recorded\u201d, wrote Professor Planqu\u00e9 in email. In addition to a sonogram, each bird sound recording is accompanied by precise location data on a map that highlights geographical variation.     Screenshot of the webpage index of some of the sounds recordings produced by one bird species, the western yellow wagtail, Motacilla flava. Illustration: Bob Planque/Xeno-canto    Not only is the sound collection expansive, but it also has great depth, often including many sounds produced by numerous individual birds recorded at different locations and elevations within each species\u2019 range. For example, a search of recordings of the sounds produced by the great tit, Parus major, reveals 60 pages, each of which indexes 30 sound files. \u201cCompared to a field guide, where you can quickly glance through illustrations, recordings are difficult\u201d, said Dr Vellinga. \u201cYou need to hear many cuts individually before you find a match, and there is no easy search strategy available.\u201d Adding to the confusion are those bird species that sound very similar to each other. \u201cRelated birds often have very different songs, and quite unrelated birds may sound similar\u201d, explained Dr Vellinga. Additionally, Xeno-canto often hosts audio recordings of bird species that are new to science, and includes recordings of bird species that are still awaiting formal description. \u201cXeno-canto also has a very active forum where people discuss identification, recording and equipment experience, and solve each other\u2019s mystery sounds\u201d, said Professor Planqu\u00e9.  And there are plenty of experts available: with over 20,000 members, Xeno-canto hosts the largest community of bird sound enthusiasts in the world.     The basic kit used by bird sound recordists. This includes a microphone and a sound recording device, and may also include a parabolic dish to collect and concentrate weak sounds.  Photograph: Andrew Spencer    \u201cA web database, using Creative Commons licensing to maximise the potential for re-use of the material, seemed a big improvement over published CDs or cassettes\u201d, said Dr Vellinga. These recordings are freely available under Creative Commons licensing, and thus, they have been used in a tremendous variety of ways. For example, Xeno-canto recordings have been featured in hundreds of scientific publications, and they are also used on websites, in radio shows, museum exhibits, mobile phone apps, and in online newspaper and magazine articles. \u201cWe also work with computer scientists who try to find names to recordings using recognition algorithms\u201d, said Dr Vellinga. \u201cWe hope such tools will also allow us to get a better picture of what can actually be found in the Xeno-canto collection\u201d, said Dr Vellinga.     Tayler Brooks recording birdsong in the field. Ms Brooks is one of the top recordists at Xeno-canto. Photograph: Andrew Spencer    These recordings of bird sounds are created by 2400 recordists of all stripes, from amateur enthusiast to professional ornithologist. Approximately 300 recordists share new material each month. Throughout the last decade, Xeno-canto has amassed some truly remarkable bird sounds. For example, the recently discovered Sichuan bush warbler, Locustella chengi, was identified as a new species by Per Alstr\u00f6m and his colleagues on the basis of its unique song (read more about this):     Sonogram of the first 10 seconds from a sound recording of a singing Sichuan bush warbler, Locustella chengi, recorded by Per Alstr\u00f6m in Sichuan Province, China.

The recording is nearly 80 minutes long, and showcases both the stamina and the phenomenal variation in the song of marsh warblers:      Sonogram of the first 10 seconds from a sound recording of a singing marsh warbler, Acrocephalus palustris, recorded by Volker Arnold in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany.

The microphone in that photograph was just out of the bird\u2019s pecking range, and was used to capture this recording:     Sonogram of the first 10 seconds from a sound recording of a call of a male dusky grouse, Dendragapus obscurus. Recorded by Daniel Lane in Colorado, USA.   One of the strangest sounds in Xeno-canto\u2019s vast collection is the song of the Capuchinbird, Perissocephalus tricolor. These birds were recorded by Fabrice Schmidt in Guyana:     Sonogram of the first 10 seconds from a sound recording of a singing Capuchinbird, Perissocephalus tricolor. Recorded by Fabrice Schmitt in Guyana.   Although the Xeno-canto collection contains recordings of nearly 90 percent of all bird species, it is far from complete -- and surprisingly, many species that are not represented in the collection have large ranges. For example, sound recordings have not been uploaded for the lesser yellow-headed (or savannah) vulture, Cathartes burrovianus, the fasciated tiger-heron, Tigrisoma fasciatum, or for Wilson\u2019s storm-petrel, Oceanites oceanicus. \u201cAbout 1000 species are still missing, and many of those are not rare at all. Especially in Africa there are still plenty of wide ranging species that are not represented yet\u201d, said Dr Vellinga.  For example, whilst researching a story that I am working on, I was surprised to discover that the cuckoo weaver-finch, Anomalospiza imberbis, a widely-ranging grassland species that occurs south of the Sahara in Africa, is not represented in the Xeno-canto archives.  \u201cApart from that, for many species there are currently only one or two recordings. Many bird species have a large repertoire, or may show dialects\u201d, said Dr Vellinga. \u201cFor the majority of species, the extent of such variation is essentially unknown.\u201d This website is overseen by the Xeno-canto Foundation for Natural Sounds, chaired by Dr Vellinga. The Naturalis Biodiversity Center, the main research centre for biodiversity in the Netherlands, sponsors this project by covering its server costs. Thus, Xeno-canto is operated by a very small international team, which also includes Sander Pieterse, who is the project manager in the Department of Education at Naturalis, and who serves as Xeno-canto\u2019s Secretary. In addition to donating recordings of bird sounds, other community members also make significant contributions to the project. Xeno-canto user Jonathon Jongsma, a software engineer in the USA, has volunteered to completely rebuild Xeno-canto from the ground up. But all of the work that goes in to building and maintaining Xeno-canto is a labour of love. \u201cAll of us, and that includes all 2400 recordists, work on XC on a volunteer-only basis\u201d, Professor Planqu\u00e9 pointed out in email.  But Xeno-canto has broader applications than just documenting the incredible variety of bird sounds throughout the world. It currently serves as a testing ground for computerised voice recognition technologies.      \u201cOne of the exciting prospects that is slowly building momentum is to integrate algorithms into XC (or into a future XC app) that allows automatic identification\u201d of bird sounds, said Professor Planqu\u00e9.  To this end, Xeno-canto is providing 30,000 recordings of Brazilian birds to LifeCLEF, an international workshop that is building computer algorithms and using the collection to learn how to correctly identify birds on the basis of their sounds. Xeno-canto\u2019s goal for this collaboration is to eventually integrate these tools into their user interface. Although birds are the first, they\u2019re certainly not the only taxon that the Xeno-canto community has plans for. \u201cWe also hope that XC will branch out to other taxa, such as frogs, crickets or other animals. The main obstacle is to find people with a good background in the taxonomy of those groups.\u201d     Recording birdsong is so much fun that this king penguin, Aptenodytes patagonicus, wants to give it a try too.

If not, he may soon learn: Channel 4, it was reported over the weekend, may soon be asked to pack up its bags and move to Birmingham. Partly, that\u2019s for the \u00a385m that the government could claw back from the sale of C4\u2019s headquarters in the heart of Westminster. But there are bigger reasons: if Channel 4 were to leave London, the thinking goes, it could help stimulate the creative economy outside of the capital \u2014 and give another boost to Britain\u2019s second-biggest city. As the Bullring is to shopping outside of the capital, so Carr and co may be to broadcast media. If it does happen, it\u2019ll be another piece of evidence that the movement to decentralise the British economy is gathering pace \u2013 and if it works, it may raise the question: just how much more impact could London\u2019s biggest landmarks have if they dared to cut their ties to the capital? With endless talk of the \u201cnorthern powerhouse\u201d, the argument for a bit of cultural redistribution has never been stronger. Throw in the idea that the Houses of Parliament might be forced to relocate by the prohibitive costs of fixing the Palace of Westminster and you can begin to see a blueprint for a very different country. \u201cA lot of decisions are driven by the image that investors form of a place,\u201d says Dr Michael Leary-Owhin, co-editor of The Routledge Companion to Urban Regeneration. \u201cIf the Houses of Parliament were up north it would massively change the way they were viewed, or if a big museum were to relocate to somewhere not noted for art \u2013 it just pings on investors\u2019 radar.\u201d   Related: Goodbye London: why people are leaving the capital    And, after all, there are plenty of countries that scorn our concentration of eggs in an oligarch\u2019s basket. Washington might be the US\u2019s legislative capital, but economic and cultural life are dominated by New York and Los Angeles; so it is in Australia, where Sydney and Melbourne cede governmental authority to Canberra without letting everything else go with it. The Hague and Amsterdam split Dutch duties perfectly well; Pretoria, Cape Town and Bloemfontein all have distinct roles in South African life. So why can\u2019t we do the same? \u201cMost countries aren\u2019t centrist in that way,\u201d says Tom Bloxham, founder of Urban Splash, a property development business that focuses on urban regeneration. \u201cIt\u2019s much healthier to have more cities that aren\u2019t the capital but have an important purpose.\u201d Things are already moving that way. The establishment of the BBC\u2019s new northern base in Salford is a key example \u2013 despite the \u00a32m annual bill for ferrying staff and guests back and forth to London. Meanwhile, the blooming of major museums outside of the capital has at least started to tilt the balance of cultural power away from the south east. If these moves don\u2019t seem to have changed things much yet, have patience, counsels Paul Swinney, chief economist at the Centre for Cities. \u201cThere\u2019s a cultural change that needs to happen and it won\u2019t just change overnight,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople need to start thinking of moving from Blackburn to Manchester instead of Blackburn to London. There\u2019s a very long timeline for these kinds of things.\u201d And, he cautions, cultural outposts don\u2019t work in a city that isn\u2019t thriving in the first place. \u201cFirst you have to get the economics right,\u201d he says. \u201cWe can\u2019t be captured by the idea that if you get the culture and institutions in place the rest will take care of itself.\u201d In any case, there\u2019s lots more to do \u2013 and if the examples of Channel 4 and parliament show anything, it\u2019s that major institutions with deep ties to London aren\u2019t nearly as immovable as they might seem. So, once we\u2019ve sent the Guardian back to Manchester, how else should we redistribute London\u2019s landmarks? 1 The Houses of Parliament \u21fe Wigan If only, politicians often lament, there were some means of bursting the Westminster bubble. Well, actually, there is: the Palace of Westminster needs repairs, and keeping MPs there will make it more expensive. So why not move them out? At a stroke, parliament would be removed from its incestuous relationship with the apparatus of government. If the move is to be permanent, as Ian Jack argued in this newspaper pages, the new home will need to be somewhere closer to the geographic centre of Britain, with good travel times to the whole country: it has to be Wigan. 2 British Museum \u21fe Liverpool From Tate St Ives to the Imperial War Museum North, many London landmarks have outposts elsewhere. And, says Philip Long, director of the V&amp;A Museum of Design, Dundee, that can have a huge impact: \u201cIt\u2019s contributing to a new confidence,\u201d he says. \u201cIt tells everyone that this is a city that can do ambitious things.\u201d But why not go further and ask one of our flagship institutions to put a vote of confidence in the rest of the country by moving wholesale? The British Museum seems symbolically apt, and the idea already has the imprimatur of the thinktank Civitas, which proposed that the museum could head north along with the Royal Opera House and the House of Lords. And with so many of the museum\u2019s treasures the spoils of the British empire, it would make sense to move to the city that was one of the great ports of the empire and the world: Liverpool.

Photograph: Andrew Couldridge/Action Images    4 Chelsea FC \u21fe Guildford London\u2019s ritziest football club, Roman Abramovich\u2019s plaything, is also the one whose removal would send the clearest symbolic message that the country was changing \u2013 and they have been struggling for years to find space in super-expensive west London to build a new stadium. Since so many Chelsea fans are based in Surrey, Guildford seems a good bet. The county has a million people and no football league team \u2013 and most of the players live in the stockbroker belt anyway. 5 Heathrow \u21fe East Midlands The argument for airport expansion has been won comprehensively by London, with Gatwick and Heathrow squabbling over the spoils with little concern for the rest of the country. But while most airports have grudgingly accepted this, there would be serious downsides for their future: if one of these two airports does get a new runway, it won\u2019t be possible to expand elsewhere and meet the UK\u2019s emissions targets. Then there\u2019s the subtler impact of telling foreign visitors that London is all we have to offer. So relocate Heathrow as a British hub airport \u2013 and stick it in the East Midlands, where a perfectly good airport is already hoping to more than double passenger numbers by 2030.

Here\u2019s another way: move a bank out of London, a mecca for angry young men, with strip clubs, skyscrapers, and class-A drugs in abundance. HSBC is sending its retail branch to Birmingham already, and announced the possible departure of its headquarters. But instead of Hong Kong or New York, why not try the beautiful Welsh capital? And ideally, it should move from high-rises to an out-of-town office park. That\u2019d calm them down a bit. 7 Hyde Park \u21fe Manchester London has tons of green space, and not enough housing. Manchester is in dire need of a proper city centre park. So why not concrete over one of the capital\u2019s verdant bits of greenery (Hyde Park would do, but whichever you like \u2013 just ignore the carping of locals like me), cover it in new homes, and use the money made to give Manchester the lung it so desperately needs?

In a keynote speech in Sydney during her 12-day residency for Kaldor Public Art Projects, Abramovi\u0107 \u2013 in good health at 67 \u2013 read out her manifesto, concluding that \u201can artist should die consciously without fear\u201d and that \u201cthe funeral is the artist\u2019s last piece before leaving\u201d. Revealing her own funeral scenario (\u201cYou should think about everything\u201d), she said an artist must give instructions \u201cso everything is done the way he wants\u201d. \u201cI want to have three Marinas,\u201d she said when an audience member pushed her for details. \u201cOf course, one is real and two fake because you can\u2019t have three bodies. But I want these three Marinas buried in the three cities which I\u2019ve lived [in] the longest, which is Belgrade, Amsterdam and New York.\u201d Nobody would know where the real body was interred, she added. Abramovi\u0107 was motivated to plan her service after attending the funeral of her friend, the author Susan Sontag, at P\u00e8re Lachaise cemetery, Paris, in 2004. \u201cIt was the saddest funeral I\u2019ve been to in my life and she is one of the greatest human beings I have ever met. She was full of life, curious and just an incredible writer,\u201d said Abramovi\u0107. \u201cI went back to New York and went straight to the lawyer and said my funeral is going to be like this. And then I made an entire script.\u201d   Related: Marina Abramovi\u0107: 'The planet is dying. We have to be warriors'    Mourners would be made to dress in the artist\u2019s trademark black \u201clike a cockroach\u201d, she joked, before revealing she would actually insist on bright colours, \u201ceven\u201d pink.  \u201cI want Antony [Hegarty] of Antony and the Johnsons, who is a great singer and friend of mine ... to sing I Did It My Way. He never said yes but I think he will be so sad that I die he will probably do it.\u201d Hegarty and Abramovi\u0107 starred opposite each other in Robert Wilson\u2019s show The Life and Death of Marina Abramovi\u0107, at the 2011 Manchester international festival, and Abramovi\u0107 was in the audience of Hegarty\u2019s recent show at Dark Mofo festival in Hobart after launching her exhibition, Private Archaeology, at Mona. Her funeral plans echo a recent interview in Tasmania where she talked about the three parts of her personality: \u201cThe one Marina is very heroic. I just go for it. I don\u2019t care how much pain inside. Then we have second Marina \u2013 very different, very spiritual, very emotional ... And then there is third one who really like bullshit.\u201d In Sydney she spoke of the genesis of her art, the time she spent with Indigenous communities in the Western Australian desert, and her plans for the as-yet-unbuilt Marina Abramovi\u0107 institute in Hudson, New York \u2013 her \u201clegacy\u201d \u2013 where she will teach mindfulness exercises to the public. The institute will include a \u201cblood bank\u201d, a collection of blood samples from 250 of the most inspirational artists, philosophers, scientists and people from indigenous cultures, which will once a year be re-energised by a Brazilian shaman. The project was as yet \u201cunrealised\u201d, Abramovi\u0107 said. \u201cNow I have this long career of 45 years, I never look back,\u201d she told the Sydney audience. \u201cI only look in the future because when I look back, I think I should be dead by now.\u201d", "sentences": ["But I want these three Marinas buried in the three cities which I\u2019ve lived [in] the longest, which is Belgrade, Amsterdam and New York.\u201d Nobody would know where the real body was interred, she added."], "title": "Marina Abramovi\u0107 reveals plans for her funeral, 'the artist\u2019s last piece'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/01/marina-abramovic-reveals-plans-for-her-funeral-the-artists-last-piece", "tags": ["Marina Abramovic", "Sydney", "Performance art", "Art", "Art and design", "Antony and the Johnsons", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-07-01T21:30:00Z", "article": "The Whitworth in Manchester has been named the UK\u2019s 2015 Museum of the Year after a \u00a315m transformation hailed as \u201cone of the great museum achievements of recent years\u201d.

Stephen Deuchar, the director of the Art Fund who chaired the judges, said: \u201cThe transformation of the Whitworth \u2013 architecturally, curatorially, and as a destination \u2013 has been one of the great museum achievements of recent years.\u201d He praised the galleries, the collections, the community engagement, and the visitor experience. \u201cAnd in a wider sense, the Whitworth has changed the landscape; it truly feels like a museum of the future.\u201d The Whitworth opened its doors 126 years ago supported by 60 eminent Mancunians, including CP Scott, the Manchester Guardian editor and the man who came up with the phrase: \u201cComment is free, but facts are sacred.\u201d The gallery\u2019s one aim was to act for \u201cthe perpetual gratification of the people of Manchester\u201d. By 1908, it had world class collections of British watercolours and drawings, 266 given by Manchester Guardian owner, John Edward Taylor, and textiles. It has added enviable holdings of modern art and wallpapers since then. It was the first public collection to buy a Picasso, in 1922, and by the late 1960s, as it championed artists such as David Hockney, it was being nicknamed \u201cthe Tate of the north\u201d. The gallery closed for redevelopment in the autumn of 2013 and reopened in February of last year \u2013 transformed. Judges for the prize said its \u201creinvention \u2026 has redefined the way it engages with its public\u201d, citing the connection between the building and surrounding park to create a space with a strong sense of openness and invitation. \u201cIt is a truly modern building that has established its place at the heart of the city.\u201d They also praised the team leading it, not least its dynamic director Maria Balshaw who took charge in 2006 and also leads Manchester Art Gallery in the city centre.

Do read her blogpost about the essential Vegas literature \u2013 from Fear and Loathing to recent fiction about the struggles of life in the city beyond the Strip \u2013 but are there ever enough books in a list? Our readers had plenty more to contribute, and here are their picks.       1. Super Casino: Inside the \u201cNew\u201d Las Vegas by Pete Earley (2001) Journalist and author Pete Earley wrote this book which mixes the history of the city\u2019s gambling business and character sketches and vignettes of life. In the words of the author:   I wanted to discover what draws people there so I went \u201cinside\u201d the Luxor, a billion dollar, pyramid-shaped casino on the Strip. I tell the story through the eyes of the people who I met \u2014 a workaholic casino boss, a seasoned blackjack whiz, a showgirl \u2014 even a teenage hooker who dreams of someday becoming a casino dealer.  understruck recommended it: \u201cIt delves into the history and current mechanics.\u201d          2. Vegas: A Memoir of a Dark Season by John Gregory Dunne (1974) This long-out-of-print novel was the first from Dunne, aka Mr Joan Didion. According to a review in Kirkus: \u201cIn the middle of his thirty-seventh year and first nervous breakdown, reading obits of college pals in the alumni rag, the husband-author manque of Joan Didion rents an apartment in the town that\u2019s always open. In between sleeping and TV quiz shows he gets to know some of the occasionally wealthy but always degenerate desperate citizens: comic Jackie Kasey, who gets $10,000 a week but drives himself crazy with lack of fame and status games like \u201ctaking steam\u201d with Frankie or Sammy or Cosby; Artha the hooker who turned 1203 tricks with 1076 johns in five years, including 54 \u201cmultiples,\u201d 24 S and 1 M; and Buster Mano, the private dick, who traces straying conventioneering hubbies and hustles gambling debts.\u201d Sounds more than promising.  A \u201cwonderful novel\u201d according to ID5882060, despite its low sales and almost unknown status. This Esquire magazine piece dubbed it \u201cthe best Las Vegas book you\u2019ve never read\u201d.       3. The Stand by Stephen King (1978) The master of horror\u2019s The Stand \u2013 published first in 1978 and re-published in 1990 as an \u201cuncut edition\u201d, at 1,100 pages \u2013 is a giant post-apocalyptic novel that is considered one of his most important works by fans and critics. James Smythe wrote in the Guardian: \u201cWhile I knew I loved King before that holiday [where he read it], afterwards I\u2019d have followed him to hell and back. It\u2019s because of The Stand that I\u2019ve read all his work, and that I embarked on this series; it\u2019s because of The Stand that I\u2019m a writer at all.\u201d \u201cFor me, the writing of Stephen King starts and ends with The Stand,\u201d wrote author Richard Thomas on Buzzfeed. \u201cNothing in The Stand is an accident. As much as it\u2019s a novel about the battle between good and evil, it\u2019s also a novel about fate. These people \u2013 the American contingent of the 0.6% of the world\u2019s population who survived Captain Trips \u2013 manage to meet up in Las Vegas, called from all around by dreams. Did they choose to find each other, or was it chosen for them?\u201d continued Smythe. The novel was recommended by reader CoronationChicken.  In quotes from the book:  Who gets to be bexst-liked in any community? Who is the most trusted? Why, the man who does the dirty job, of course, and does it with a smile. The man who does the job you couldn\u2019t bring yourself to do.   Dreams are the psyche\u2019s way of taking a good dump every now and then. And that people who dream \u2013 or don\u2019t dream in a way they can often remember when they wake up \u2013 are mentally constipated in some way.       4. Fools Die (1978) and Inside Las Vegas (1977) by Mario Puzo The author of The Godfather wrote two books set in this city: the novel Fools Die, recommended by banjodsp, and the non-fiction Inside Las Vegas, a \u201cworld-weary account of the place\u201d according to Face56. These are also examples of an author from elswehere (New York in this case, of course) settling in the city for a while and translating the experience into fiction and memoir. Apparently, Puzo himself was a \u201cdegenerate gambler\u201d \u2013 but he believed Las Vegas was an honest, clean city.  In quotes from the book:  Let us be separated by wars and pestilence, death, madness but not by the passing of time. \u2013 Fools Die   The fact of the matter is that I wanted to hold a grudge in some funny kind of way. Against everybody. \u2013Fools Die   It can be argued that man\u2019s instinct to gamble is the only reason he is still not a monkey up in the trees. \u2013 Inside Las Vegas   With the perverse logic of a degenerate gambler he figured God was testing his faith. \u2013 Inside Las Vegas       5. In Nevada: The Land, the People, God, and Chance by David Thomson (1999) Even though this history book covers the whole state, it \u201ccentres very much on the neon heart of the action,\u201d said reader leroyhunter. Flm critic David Thomson\u2019s study of the American West promises to be \u201cpart contemplation of an America both austere and flamboyant, part love letter to the Old West, part idiosyncratic travel guide\u201d and to enlighten readers on why \u201cNevada is the place where Samuel Clemens became Mark Twain, Frank Sinatra became chairman of the board, divorce became an industry and gambling an institution...\u201d Thomson also uses his huge knowledge of film and Hollywood to show how movies like The Godfather, Goodfellas, Casino and The Misfits \u201chave shaped and played upon our preconceptions about Nevada and Las Vegas\u201d, said a New York Times review. In quotes from the book:  Nevada is on the edge, on the wire, off to one side, in the empty quarter, or even in the rest of the country\u2019s head as an idea, a possibility, an alternative. It is an experiment, or a kind of theater ... for America has used Nevada as a testing ground, and not just for weapons and their destructiveness but also for new social ideas, and their explosiveness. What happens if you allow divorce, prostitution, gambling? Can there be community and purpose if you encourage things deep in human nature yet supposedly alien to order and togetherness?            6. About a Mountain by John D\u2019Agata (2010) This unique book is a lyric essay about the proposed Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, an area for storage of spent nuclear fuel (from the entire United States) about 100 miles away from Las Vegas (in the plans of the government since the 80s). When D\u2019Agata helped his mother move to Las Vegas in the summer 2002, the US Congress was going ahead with the plans, and the writer and essayist stayed to look into the history of it all (as well as investigate the mysterious suicide of a boy who jumped off a hotel-casino). The format of the book has also been called \u201ca reporter\u2019s notebook that reads like poetry\u201d by NPR. D\u2019Agata has \u201can encyclopedic understanding of the form\u2019s intricate artistry\u201d, according to the New York Times. It was \u201cwholeheartedly recommended\u201d by Ce_Santiago.       7. The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt (2013) Donna Tartt\u2019s bestselling and Pulitzer Prize-winning novel is partly set in Las Vegas (as well as in Amsterdam and New York City) \u2013 and the city\u2019s presence in the story is very powerful, as our readers explained.   I thought the section of The Goldfinch set in Vegas was very strong, the sort of banality and frustration of trying to live a normal life in its suburbs rather than \u201cblah blah Sin City\u201d... \u2013 benzedrine  The portrayal of Las Vegas brought [the book] to a sort of life (as far as that word can be used) \u2013 the vast desert background, the huge sky and the semi-deserted housing estate, the boys pilfering from shops for food ... It came across as a parched, sterile, hating environment, rife with low-life. Boys growing up here, while parents gambled and stole, didn\u2019t stand a chance of taking the right path. \u2013 JHawkinson Definitely The Goldfinch \u2013 incredibly evocative of the sand blasted emptiness of the suburbs. \u2013 DeputyPeck  In quotes from the book:  Well, is true. I did know. Because if possible to paint fakes that look like that? Las Vegas would be the most beautiful city in the history of earth!   What mattered most, as I came to realize, was who\u2019d lived in Vegas the longest, which was why the knock-down Mexican beauties and itinerant construction heirs sat alone at lunch while the bland, middling children of local realtors and car dealers were the cheerleaders and class presidents, the unchallenged elite of the school.       vegas Photograph: Guardian    8. Leaving Las Vegas by John O\u2019Brien (1990) A scorching novel of alcohol, love, self-destruction and suicide, it was later adapted into an Oscar-winning film, starring Nicholas Cage. Reader DeputyPeck \u201cthought it was heart-wrenchingly sad; no Las Vegas winners in that book.\u201d In quotes from the book:   Casinos \u2026 know that chips are a wonderful, pretty tool, and possess none of the stigma of dollars. Dollars translate too easily into hours or houses or cars or sex or food or everything, and so losing a dollar is a much more tangible experience than parting with a chip, an object that looks more like a midway consolation token than a medium of exchange.      American Tabloid (1995), the first book in the trilogy.     9. The Underworld USA Trilogy by James Ellroy Las Vegas is \u201cjust up the road from Los Angeles\u201d \u2013 in relative, American terms \u2013 as reader mydaray pointed out, so it was only inevitable for the quintessential LA crime writer to base some of his stories in Sin City. This trilogy, formed by the novels American Tabloid, The Cold Six Thousand and Blood\u2019s a Rover, tells a saga of corruption in the late 50s and early 60s and includes real history \u2013 John F Kennedy and Martin Luther King\u2019s assassinations and the Vietnam War among other defining events \u2013 and spans across the country. Las Vegas has a strong presence as the Mafia\u2019s stronghold. It was also recommended by kelso77 and DJKM. A very Ellroy-esque quote from The Cold Six Thousand  Pete pulled the blinds. Wayne hit the lights. There: Sink water \u2013 dark pink \u2013 carving knives afloat. Baked beans and fruit flies on mold. Hair in a colander. Dots on the floor. Dots by the fridge. Pete opened it. Pete smelled it. They saw it: The severed legs. The diced hips. Mom\u2019s head in the vegetable bin.

The son of a second world war veteran, he trained as a teacher in Bendigo before making his VFL debut with Collingwood in 1983. He won the equivalent of the Rising Star award for best young player, and was poached by Richmond the following year. He joined Brisbane in 1987, picking up the club\u2019s best and fairest award. A handy wingman, it was as an old-school coach \u2013 \u201ca hard man, a hard taskmaster,\u201d Adelaide legend Graham Cornes said \u2013 that Walsh left his biggest imprint on the game. He became Geelong\u2019s strength and conditioning coach in 1995, joined Port Adelaide as an assistant coach four years later and then West Coast in 2009. Last year he re-joined Port, before applying for the vacant spot at the Crows and winning it. \u201cHe bloomed, it was the opportunity he had been waiting for,\u201d Cornes said on Friday. This obsessive focus on football left little room for anything else. Asked if he was a good father, he admitted \u201cthat\u2019s a really hard question\u201d. \u201cThe bonus of me taking the Crows job is my son is 26 and my daughter is 22, so the collateral damage isn\u2019t so big. But have I been a good father? To my son, I had a disconnect because of footy,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a selfish way, I taught my daughter to surf, and that\u2019s my release, so when I go surfing, I take her. Now I\u2019ve got my son into it as well and that\u2019s what I should\u2019ve done a long time ago. \u201cA couple of months ago we all went surfing together at Middleton and it was almost the best day I\u2019ve had ... ever,\u201d he said. \u201cWe all got a wave, went to the bakery on the way home, we smiled, and laughed and there was none of this stuff, that I\u2019ve got Melbourne, then the Bulldogs, then Port. Just none of that.\u201d Single-mindedly was the way you played sport in Hamilton, a town set among sheep pastures in Victoria\u2019s west. The grass never got a chance to grow at the Walsh house, trampled by his five hockey-playing sisters and his own backyard heroics. \u201cThose days, you were either playing or training virtually every night of the week, except Sundays, even as kids,\u201d a friend, Brian Guy, told the Adelaide Advertiser. His qualities as a leader were obvious. Walsh was elected school vice-captain at Monivae College, where he is still listed as a wingman in the school\u2019s team of the century. \u201cI\u2019d say Walshy was limited skill-wise, but jeez, he was fit,\u201d former Collingwood team-mate, Gavan Bell said. \u201cThat was his key. He was a good player, courageous, all that stuff. He was a hard working, defensive winger. That\u2019s what he was about.\u201d A near-death experience in Peru in late 2012 \u2013 he was hit by a bus and flown back to Australia for treatment \u2013 had broadened his horizons. \u201cI saw the white light, had the drowning sensation,\u201d Walsh said. \u201cI thought I\u2019d die.\u201d He quit drinking, dedicated himself to mastering Japanese and kept an image of the Peruvian street as his screensaver. \u201cThat\u2019s my wake up call every day, as soon as I turn my computer on,\u201d he told the Herald Sun. \u201cDon\u2019t get too angry, Phil.\u201d Walsh had yet to complete his first year as Adelaide\u2019s coach when he died on Friday, aged 55. The level of esteem he had built over two decades in the coaches\u2019 box was only beginning to be known. \u201cHe spoke at [former Melbourne coach] Dean Bailey\u2019s funeral, and he spoke so beautifully and eloquently and without notes,\u201d Cornes recalled on Friday. \u201cYou gained the sense immediately there there was a depth and a side to this man the rest of the world needed to see.\u201d", "sentences": ["Confessing he sounded \u201ca bit like a weirdo\u201d, last month he mused: \u201cGreat art comes from a level of frustration.\u201d He had been struck, on a recent trip to Amsterdam, by Van Gogh\u2019s sunflowers."], "title": "Phil Walsh: an old-school coach, lifted by grit and inspired by the art of the game | Michael Safi", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/jul/03/phil-walsh-an-old-school-coach-lifted-by-grit-and-inspired-by-the-art-of-the-game", "tags": ["AFL", "Adelaide", "Adelaide", "Geelong", "Australia news", "Australia sport", "Australian rules football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-07-03T05:10:04Z", "article": "Dame Kiri Te Kanawa and Kate Adie: In Conversation7.30pm, BBC4 Before a live audience at the Wales Millennium Centre, veteran BBC journalist Kate Adie interviews the contest\u2019s patron, Kiwi soprano Dame Kiri Te Kanawa.

The US Department of Justice has filed the case in a New York court to recover $300m allegedly paid in bribes to an Uzbek who is not identified by name, but is believed to be Gulnara Karimova, daughter of the despot who has ruled Uzbekistan with an iron fist for a quarter of a century. The indictment refers to a \u201crelative of Karimov\u201d, whom it calls \u201cgovernment official A\u201d. But it goes on to name three people that it says were close associates of the official. The three are known to be close to Karimova. It also says the indicted official held \u201cseveral positions in the Uzbek government\u201d from 2005 to 2011, as Karimova did. Corruption allegations have swirled around Karimova for years. She was placed under house arrest in Tashkent last year, suspected of ties to organised crime, following a Shakespearean family feud and a power struggle that ravaged Uzbekistan\u2019s ruling elite.   Related: Uzbekistan's ruling family feud spills into open with Twitter row    Last year, Karimova was named as a suspect in a Swiss money-laundering investigation. Another inquiry, in Sweden, is examining allegations of dubious payments made to Karimova associates by the Nordic telecoms firm TeliaSonera, which denies paying bribes. The US indictment identifies a company at the heart of the Swedish investigation, Takilant, and its Uzbek owner, Gayane Avakyan, as instrumental in machinations that saw millions of dollars shifted around the world to enrich a hidden beneficiary in an \u201cinternational conspiracy to launder corrupt payments\u201d.  It also names Rustam Madumarov, reportedly Karimova\u2019s boyfriend, as the owner of shell companies involved. Madumarov and Avakyan are in jail for corruption in Uzbekistan. The indictment alleges that two telecoms companies, the Russia-headquartered MTS and Amsterdam-based VimpelCom, paid kickbacks to \u201cgovernment official A\u201d. Karimova, 42, held various government and diplomatic positions until her dismissal as ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva in 2013 as a web of corruption scandals closed around her. Karimova \u2013 who is being held incommunicado in Tashkent \u2013 could not be reached for comment, but has always denied graft allegations.    Karimova's star has fallen far since the days when she was tipped as a successor to her septuagenarian father    The targeted funds lie in Bank of New York Mellon accounts in Belgium, Ireland and Luxembourg. The bank declined to comment, as did MTS. When asked to comment, a VimpelCom spokesperson said the company \u201ccontinue[s] to cooperate with the authorities in their investigation\u201d, a spokesperson said by email. The case is embarrassing for Karimov and his western allies, including London and Washington, which court him despite controversy over Tashkent\u2019s atrocious human rights record. They are eager to secure security cooperation in the volatile central Asian region, bordering Afghanistan, where Karimov \u2013 who rules a secular Muslim-majority state \u2013 paints himself as a bulwark against Islamic extremism. It also tightens the noose around Karimova, once described in a leaked US diplomatic cable as a \u201crobber baron\u201d.

Much better known, however, are the brands this $60bn (\u00a340bn) online giant operates, including restaurant booker OpenTable, hotel finder Booking.com and Manchester-based Rentalcars.com.  The group\u2019s success is based on 14,000 staff in call centres and offices around the world, speaking 42 languages collectively, and is evident in earnings forecasts 10 times the size of of Airbnb\u2019s this year \u2013 yet it receives a fraction of the attention of its more recently hatched competitor. \u201cThe size of our vacation rental business is as big as the whole of Airbnb,\u201d says Priceline\u2019s chief executive, Darren Huston. \u201cWe are a Dutch company so we don\u2019t go in the press a lot, we are less built around hype.\u201d Huston has two jobs, managing the group while also remaining head of Priceline\u2019s largest business, Booking.com, which is headquartered in Amsterdam. The vast majority of the group\u2019s revenues come from outside the US. It employs 2,500 people in Amsterdam, 2,000 in the UK, 3,000 in the US, and the rest are spread around the world, with hubs in Berlin and Singapore, where Priceline\u2019s Asian travel brand, Agoda, is headquartered.     Priceline chief Darren Huston. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty    \u201cVacationing is far more important to Europeans than it is to Americans,\u201d says Huston. \u201cPeople here get five weeks, the average American gets two weeks, and only takes one. If you look at destinations, Europe holds a commanding lead collectively over any other part of the world.\u201d It is reflected in the figures \u2013 Priceline took $50bn in bookings last year, of which nearly 87% was outside the US. Its profits come from charging a commission \u2013 typically 15%. Although its online presence means Priceline is regarded as an internet stock \u2013 it is listed on the Nasdaq in New York \u2013 its defining feature is its big offline presence. The company operates much like a traditional travel agent, with three-quarters of the workforce dedicated to interacting with people \u2013 be they travellers or hotel and restaurant managers. \u201cIt\u2019s not the kind of work that Microsoft would be naturally attracted to, or Google,\u201d Huston says. \u201cThey hope that somebody out there is doing this. They deal with ones and zeros and this is more the laying of the plumbing that allows all of that stuff to ultimately work. Fortunately we\u2019ve found a way to make what we do work. Because we do it at scale.\u201d Using people rather than computers to deal with customers may not be fashionable for internet companies, but Priceline has shown it can be profitable. The group\u2019s revenues were $8.4bn last year, and its income after tax $2.4bn. Type \u201cBooking.com customer service\u201d into a search engine, and the first thing that appears is not the dreaded list of frequently asked questions, but a phone number. During this summer\u2019s peak, Priceline Group will be directly employing about 5,000 people in call centres. And they are not based in Bangalore. In January, a 270-person centre opened in Canary Wharf. It is a 24-hour, seven-day operation, and every employee speaks English plus at least one other language. Priceline telephone operators can hold conversations in Icelandic, Estonian, Catalan, Serbian, Latvian or Slovak.     For 39 days in 2010, Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull sent ash into European airspace, emptying the skies of planes. Photograph: AP/PA    A defining moment for Booking.com came five years ago, when its staff helped manage the travel chaos caused when an ash cloud from the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano in Iceland grounded air traffic across Europe for a week. More recently, staff have been dealing with the fallout from the Tunisian massacre.  Huston says: \u201cPeople say: \u2018What are you thinking, why are you sticking a call centre in Canary Wharf or Amsterdam?\u2019 But what we need is multilingual people from many parts of the world. We can pretty much recruit all 42 languages in London, which you can\u2019t say about anywhere else in the world.\u201d The other half of the business deals with suppliers \u2013 helping hotels, car hire firms and restaurants come online. Its 165 offices around the world are busy signing up restaurants, hotels and car rental firms, handling pricing disputes, and helping small businesses smarten up online. \u201cWe tell them: \u2018You need this many high-definition photos, take a picture of the bathroom, don\u2019t take a picture of the girl lying on the bed with all the rose petals\u2019,\u201d says Huston.     The group has 14,000 staff in call centres and local offices around the world. Photograph: AP    OpenTable, acquired last summer for $2.6bn, is preparing for an international push. It operates in the US and the UK, where most high-end restaurants taking bookings use its software. Sales staff go door to door, visiting six or seven restaurants a day, offering to replace the handwritten reservations book with a computer. Previously this involved hooking up a screen and a small server; today the software is in the cloud and can be accessed from a tablet. Headquartered in Connecticut, Priceline was founded in 1997, during what Huston refers to as the \u201cgimmicky, sock puppet\u201d era of the internet. Priceline\u2019s gimmick was letting the consumer name their price, and then have suppliers bid to meet it. In those days, the company sold everything from petrol to groceries and insurance. After the dotcom bubble burst, it narrowed its scope to airline tickets, hotels, car rentals and holiday packages, but expanded internationally, eventually buying Booking.com in 2005. Priceline.com became a subsidiary of a larger group, in which all six brands are run independently. So independently, in fact, that only 30 staff are employed by the overall group, and Huston spends just a third of his time on group functions as opposed to running Booking.com, which is by far the largest beast in the Priceline menagerie. Having held senior jobs at Starbucks and Microsoft before joining in 2011, Huston took over as group chief executive in January 2014, succeeding Jeffery Boyd, who turned Priceline around after the dotcom bust. \u201cI\u2019m like the guy who got appointed to run the family, but the family runs very independently,\u201d says Huston. \u201cWe haven\u2019t tried to over-integrate our acquisitions. We let entrepreneurs lead these companies for better or for worse. The cost of that is synergy potentially, but we have an allergy to coordinating. Synergy is a great word but it often comes as a distraction from the core purpose.\u201d     The dining area of the Savoy Grill, one of the restaurants bookable via OpenTable. Photograph:   Antonio Olmos    Many of the founders have stayed on. The entrepreneurs who launched Kayak, Agoda, Booking and Rentalcars all still work for the group.  What keeps them in the company? Not just the generous stock options. Priceline may be less famous than its internet peers, but the business has its attractions. \u201cWe are in the consumer internet, in travel.

In an article morosely headlined The Decline of the American Actor, it points out doomily that every leading role in the film Selma, from LBJ to Martin Luther King, was bagged by a Brit. If that totemic American bildungsroman, The Godfather, were remade, it suggests, the most obvious cast would be British: Tom Hiddleston as Michael, Rory Kinnear as Sonny, Romola Garai as Kay. In the crowning glory (or insult), the magazine argues the true heir to Marlon Brando isn\u2019t a Strasberg Institute-trained Yank \u2013 it\u2019s Bristol Old Vic alumnus Daniel Day-Lewis. As Michael Corleone might say: What gives? Sure, UK actors and productions have been making their presence felt in New York since almost before Broadway was Broadway. English stars have been gonged at the Academy Awards since the silent era (best actor at the second Oscars in 1930 was George Arliss, who found success playing Benjamin Disraeli on Broadway before making it to the screen). Courtesy of Masterpiece on PBS, British TV has been required watching for a certain breed of Anglophile east-coaster for decades.  Still, it feels like a moment; or, perhaps, a tipping point. From artistic directors to lighting designers, choreographers to composers, British talent has rarely been so visible on American stages. Any more visible and Manhattan\u2019s theatre district might consider renaming itself to match Chinatown and Little Italy. Little Britain, perhaps.

In search of answers, I make my way to the offices of the entertainment ad agency Spotco, where the decor in reception is a colourful collage of imported show-posters. I\u2019ve come to meet Tim Levy, who heads the American office of the (British) National Theatre. Levy has run NT USA since 2012, having first come out in 2007 to work with the Broadway producers Robert Boyett Theatricals. Much of his job centres on arranging transfers for NT shows to North America, as well as talent-spotting American work that might make the return journey. It\u2019s an exciting time, says Levy, an affable, boyish 36-year-old whose English accent is only slightly softened by nearly a decade in New York. \u201cIt goes in waves, but with Broadway it\u2019s been a brilliant year. Curious is inherently a risky show because of its subject matter \u2013 Mark Haddon\u2019s book isn\u2019t as well-known here as it is back home, and there are no stars in the production \u2013 but obviously we\u2019re delighted. Even better is the fact that if you look at the not-for-profit theatres like the Public, the Atlantic theatre company, New York Theatre Workshop, they\u2019re also full of British work. There\u2019s so much around at the moment.\u201d So why are American producers shopping in the British aisle? One obvious answer is that if a show has proved it has staying power in either the West End or the UK subsidised sector, it\u2019s less of a risk. Putting a new show straight onto Broadway is dauntingly expensive, perhaps three times what it costs in the West End \u2013 by some estimates up to $15m just to get a show up and running. It\u2019s also forbiddingly chancy; most homegrown US productions have usually done the rounds at regional theatres or not-for-profits before they graduate to the Great White Way.  But it\u2019s not just that, suggests Levy: while being careful to praise the scene in his adopted homeland, especially in new writing (\u201cAmerican voices are doing staggering things at the moment\u201d), he hints that British companies and directors are more willing to experiment, particularly in straight drama. Or able to experiment: War Horse, which was developed over five years and ran for two more on Broadway, gave Michael Morpurgo\u2019s novel the whiz-bang production values of a musical. Curious \u2013 devised with dance-movement group Frantic Assembly and a showcase for Bunny Christie and Paule Constable\u2019s lustrous high-tech video design \u2013 was nurtured at the NT\u2019s smallest space before transferring to the West End, long before it took its chances stateside. \u201cIt\u2019s subsidy,\u201d Levy says flatly. \u201cIt goes without saying that if you talk to theatremakers here, they wish there was government subsidy for the arts. It\u2019s not impossible to develop excellent new work, but it\u2019s much harder.\u201d     Hugh Jackman, left, and Laura Donnelly, in The River, first seen at London\u2019s Royal Court. Photograph: Richard Termine/AP    A few blocks north, I call in at the offices of the commentator Howard Sherman, who\u2019s been watching the comings and goings in American theatre for the best part of four decades. Although he\u2019s sceptical about transatlantic rivalry (\u201cI think rivalry is a bit of a misnomer\u201d), he concedes that the British have been riding high for the last few years and are likely to continue: \u201cThere\u2019s a long history of British drama and British actors coming over to the US; it goes back hundreds of years, even before I could be factually specific. And this year a lot of British shows have come at once, as evidenced by the Tonys.\u201d But there is one arena in which the trade deficit is balanced out, he points out: musicals. \u201cLook at the hit musicals in London at the moment, and you realise how many are American. The flow tends to be that plays get success in London and come here, while with musicals it\u2019s the other way round. It\u2019s not just a one-way street.\u201d  Much of this has to do with basic Broadway economics, he explains: producers are increasingly looking to celebrity casting as the only way to sell plays, whether it\u2019s Mirren\u2019s turn as Her Maj or a script written by Larry David. \u201cWould Jez Butterworth\u2019s The River have played Broadway without Hugh Jackman? It\u2019s very questionable. As soon as someone of that calibre wants to be involved, it doesn\u2019t really matter what the material is.\u201d He pauses. \u201cBut then you look at something like Shakespeare, and the overwhelming majority of productions are British, from Maurice Evans after the second world war to Jude Law to the RSC\u2019s residency at the Armory in 2011.\u201d  Why does he think that is? He frowns. \u201cI think history has a lot to do with it.\u201d     Alan Cumming presides over the Broadway production of Cabaret, which started at London\u2019s Donmar Warehouse. Photograph: Joan Marcus/Supplied    A theatrical rivalry As the British are wont to say, that\u2019s a bit of an understatement. Follow the history of American theatre back to its beginnings and you find strong bonds between the two countries, but also a good deal of friction. Though it\u2019s likely that early European settlers brought some forms of drama with them during the 16th and 17th centuries, the first professional troupe to play on American shores was British: the London Company of Comedians, led by an out-of-work actor-manager called Lewis Hallam. Together with his wife and a team of performers, Hallam headed across the Atlantic in summer 1752 on a sloop called the Charming Sally and set up in Williamsburg. Their first show? The Merchant of Venice, long popular back at home. Following Hallam\u2019s death, the troupe refounded itself as the American Company in 1763, wisely seizing on the rebellious atmosphere surging through the soon-to-be ex-colony. Based in Philadelphia, then New York, they even managed to make incursions into the aggressively anti-theatrical stronghold of Newport, Rhode Island (to accommodate their Puritan audience, they offered Othello as a \u201cMoral Dialogue in five parts\u201d).  After independence and into the 19th century, British stars continued to travel across the ocean, attracted by Americans\u2019 riotous enthusiasm for drama (Alexis de Tocqueville, visiting in the 1830s, opined that \u201clove of the theatre [is] of all literary tastes the most natural to democratic peoples\u201d) and the huge fortunes that could be made by even a brief tour.  Nonetheless, these exchanges didn\u2019t always escape the political fissures that divided the two nations. When the brooding star Edmund Kean visited in 1820, he won over a cynical New York press (\u201cthe most complete actor \u2026 that ever appeared on our boards\u201d, gushed the New York Post), but made the mistake of treating the audience in Boston with condescension, refusing to go on as Richard III after being underwhelmed by the size of the audience. Returning five years later, he was astonished to find that Boston remembered the Englishman\u2019s insult only too well: on opening night the audience graduated from catcalls and whistles to throwing food, bottles and other missiles, before \u2013 once the terrified Kean had fled \u2013 turning their wrath on the theatre. It was perhaps the first theatre riot in American history. Researching a book on the history of global Shakespeare, I\u2019ve spent some time in the performance arts section of the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center. Anyone interested in the rivalries between British and American drama would do well to refer to its collections, particularly those covering 1848-9. What they reveal is the darkest day in American theatre history.  The story centres on an Edwin Forrest (1806\u20131872), the first American actor to make a national name for himself. Despite being lionised by the critics when he visited London in 1836 \u2013 they\u2019d never seen anything like him \u2013 Forrest became convinced that the British never took his talents seriously, and when he returned to the UK in 1845, he expressed his frustration by beginning a feud with the greatest English star of the age, William Charles Macready.  Macready himself had a growing reputation in the US. Convinced that Macready was challenging him on home turf, in 1849 Forrest initiated a showdown with his British rival, deciding to play Macbeth \u2013 one of Macready\u2019s favourite roles \u2013 at the Broadway Theatre, while Macready did his own production at the Astor Place Opera House. Amid rabid anti-British press coverage, the performance on 10 May turned violent, with a furious mob inundating the theatre. Militia fired into the crowd. At least 22 people ended up dying, with more than 100 injured.     The first British production of Enron; a hit in the UK, it closed after 12 days on Broadway. Photograph: Donald Cooper / Rex Features    In the musical- and celebrity-heavy world of contemporary Broadway, a patriotic riot provoked by a stage play is hard to imagine (it\u2019s hard enough to believe producers would stage in excess of one production of Shakespeare at once). But transatlantic tensions do linger, as evidenced by the experience of Lucy Prebble\u2019s Enron, which made its way to Broadway in 2010. Rupert Goold\u2019s production was lauded at the Chichester festival and London\u2019s Royal Court theatre for its savvy critique of corporate corruption. The critics were near-unanimous in their praise, particularly given the work\u2019s eerie prescience regarding the arrival of the credit crunch; the Sunday Telegraph declared it a \u201cstrong buy\u201d, and it soon transferred to the West End. Goold and his team were besieged by offers from American producers. It looked a dead cert to be a Broadway smash. Yet when the production opened in New York, recalls Prebble, it fell flat. Preview audiences were jittery; the cast \u2013 Americans rather than the British team back home \u2013 struggled to find their rhythm. There were hisses, walk-outs. When the New York Times review landed, describing Enron as \u201cflashy\u201d and \u201claboured\u201d, those behind the production knew they were sunk. The show closed after just 12 days. Ben Brantley, the Times critic, was irked by Goold\u2019s high-voltage production (\u201call show \u2026 and little substance\u201d), but some suspected it wasn\u2019t just that. The idea of a young British writer taking American corporate malfeasance to task was too much to stomach, particularly just a few miles north of Wall Street. Writing in the Guardian, David Cote of Time Out New York suggested: \u201cIt\u2019s our dirty laundry; we\u2019ll get around to cleaning it. Someday.\u201d  \u201cIt never occurred to me that saying human beings caused the financial crash was contentious,\u201d says Prebble now. \u201cBut of course in the UK, it felt like I was saying humans. In New York it felt like I was saying Americans.\u201d The irony of Enron the play rapidly going out of business isn\u2019t lost on her, she adds: \u201cMaybe a US audience felt as a young British girl coming over there, I couldn\u2019t claim to really know anything of international enterprise \u2013 of greed, of business, of America, of this man [former Enron CEO Jeffrey Skilling] who lost the people around him their jobs and millions of dollars and saw all his work collapse in a few weeks. But I do now.\u201d     James Corden on the opening night of One Man, Two Guvnors at Broadway\u2019s Music Box theatre. Photograph: Cindy Ord/Getty Images    Levy concedes that, while London and New York can seem on the surface like intimate siblings, cultural differences run deep: \u201cThere is an unapologetic passion for success here in all of American culture. That British apology about success \u2013 people don\u2019t buy that here.\u201d There\u2019s no such thing as a dead cert, he adds. Sherman concurs: \u201cTake a show like One Man, Two Guvnors. It did well in New York, but it wasn\u2019t a smash. It was very British humour; part of it was even the title. We think of different things when we say the word \u2018governor\u2019. We don\u2019t think of some upper-class guy.\u201d Whatever the answer, students of Anglo-American relations would do well to turn up at the Lyceum theatre on 45th Street this October, when director Ivo van Hove will bring an all-British cast headed by Mark Strong across from London. The play is Arthur Miller\u2019s A View from the Bridge, set among the tight-knit Italian American community in Red Hook, Brooklyn. Early next year, Van Hove is rumoured to be staging another Miller classic, The Crucible, again with British actors.  A Belgian-born, Amsterdam-based director doing two American classics with British casts, in the centenary of Miller\u2019s birth? I\u2019m not saying there\u2019ll be riots \u2013 but my eyes are peeled for the review in the New York Times. \u2022 Andrew Dickson\u2019s Worlds Elsewhere: Journeys Around Shakespeare\u2019s Globe will be published by Bodley Head in October, and Henry Holt in April 2016", "sentences": ["A Belgian-born, Amsterdam-based director doing two American classics with British casts, in the centenary of Miller\u2019s birth?"], "title": "Broadway's British invasion: history of a centuries-old transatlantic rivalry", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jul/04/british-actors-broadway-rivalry", "tags": ["Broadway", "Theatre", "Stage", "Tony awards", "Culture", "William Shakespeare"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-07-05T09:30:10Z", "article": "Yoko Ono sits at the head of her kitchen table in the Dakota building, sipping a coffee. It\u2019s 9.30am and she\u2019s just woken up after a disturbed night\u2019s sleep; she is upset about the recent death of Ornette Coleman, the avant-garde jazzman. He was a former Ono collaborator; she performed at London\u2019s Albert Hall with him in 1968, and her 1970 debut album Plastic Ono Band includes the song \u201cAOS\u201d, on which Ono\u2019s unmistakable ululating twists eerily around Coleman\u2019s trumpet. Back then Ono\u2019s music and artwork were greeted with mockery, incomprehension and even rage, much like the rest of her artistic practice \u2013 which is unusually wide-ranging, including film, text, sculpture and performance art. At the age of 82, however, Ono has been all but vindicated. Three years ago London\u2019s Serpentine Gallery hosted a major retrospective of her work; over the next 18 months she will have exhibitions in France, Japan, China, Brazil and Mexico. Her exhibition Yoko Ono: One Woman Show 1960-1971, currently at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art, has been lauded by art critics and is a hit with the public. On 21 June, the 50th anniversary of her work \u201cMorning Peace\u201d, and the day of the summer solstice, she appeared at 4am in MoMA to a sell-out crowd and encouraged them to touch one another and watch the sunrise with her. The opening-night party was so packed that the gallery had to be closed. Yet Ono doesn\u2019t like the word \u201cvindication\u201d.            \u201cIt suggests that there\u2019s an enemy there that I\u2019m trying to destroy, but I never thought that way,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s something I might really feel when I\u2019m older.\u201d Ono has lived in the Dakota since 1973, moving from a loft in the West Village to the Upper West Side citadel with her husband John Lennon. On 8 December 1980, Lennon was shot in the back at point-blank range in the entrance to the building, meaning that every time Ono enters or leaves her home, she has to pass over the spot where her spouse was killed. Removing my shoes at the front door, I\u2019m asked not to describe the apartment. Suffice it to say that it\u2019s very grand, but the kitchen is warm, light and homely, boasting both Beatles pictures and a copy of Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s vegetarian cookbook Plenty. There are three assistants around; one comes to sit at the kitchen table to tape the interview in case I misquote her boss. Despite the early hour, Ono is elegantly dressed in a lacy and cleavage-revealing black blouse. As usual, she\u2019s wearing sunglasses, though the frames are small enough for her to peer over and make eye contact. The soft voice is immediately familiar, but as fans of her records know, a much louder and more penetrating one lies within. It proves, says Ono, that: \u201cWomen have a side that they can bring out, which is expressing power.\u201d Some might call it a bit scary, too. Ono laughs. \u201cIt\u2019s scary for guys,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is funny because I wrote this story in Japanese and all the Japanese guys who read it were: \u2018It\u2019s so scary!\u2019 They\u2019re scared.\u201d She laughs again.     Flower power: outside the British Board of Censors in Soho in 1966, after her film \u2018No. 4 (Bottoms)\u2019 was banned. Photograph: Daily Sketch/Rex/Shutterstock    So why are we scared of her? \u201cYou guys had 2,000 years of control of society and that\u2019s about to go now.\u201d However, she says that we males are learning to adapt to the patriarchy\u2019s imminent downfall. \u201cMen are very intelligent, so they\u2019re immediately picking up on how to survive in this society when women are getting so strong, and you\u2019re doing a very good job. Whenever I pick up a magazine I see these very pretty men that we [women] would love.\u201d She believes that the Beatles pioneered this approach. \u201cI think they were the first ones who used their feminine sides,\u201d Ono muses. \u201cNow most popular male figures have a very feminine side, and I think it\u2019s important because that\u2019s how they can communicate with a large, large population called women.\u201d Communication with the world at large has been Ono\u2019s lifelong mission \u2013 even when the world responded with hostility. She\u2019s won the Lifetime Achievement Award in the Observer Ethical Awards for her activism over half a century, most of which is indivisible from her art. Think of the \u201cBed-In\u201d that she and Lennon staged in Amsterdam in 1969, or the billboard posters that announced: \u201cWar Is Over! If You Want It\u201d the same year and her \u201cWish Trees\u201d, an ongoing work started in 1981 where members of the public are encouraged to write their deepest wishes down on labels and hang them from a tree. (Ono never reads the wishes, as she says that they\u2019re private, but Pharrell Williams\u2019s wish, written in a New York installation of the artwork in 2013, was made public by a magazine editor; it read \u201cWishing 4 all who seek to experience the shift of widespread illuminations will have the inner stillness to share in the most momentous aspect of the ether.\u201d) \u201cArt to me is a way of showing people how you can think,\u201d Ono says. \u201cSome people think of art as like beautiful wallpaper that you can sell, but I have always thought that it is to do with activism.\u201d            The simplicity of her artwork may have been derided over the years, but it is exactly that which makes it hugely accessible. Her art and her activism has found a new audience with each successive generation. The apparent naivety of her peace activism is often couched in terms like: \u201cA dream you dream alone is only a dream. A dream you dream together is reality\u201d \u2013 the most famous maxim from her 1962 book Grapefruit. Yet in 2015 its aphoristic style, influenced by haikus, now seems perfect for the internet age, and has easily transferred to Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, where Ono has a large following of people who are interested in her rather than the Beatles. The diversity of her work is, she says, a legacy of growing up in Japan. \u201cI think I have to give credit to Asians. They\u2019re into the tea ceremony, flower arrangement, military education \u2013 they\u2019re not afraid of going into everything. They don\u2019t say: \u2018Well, I\u2019m doing flower arranging so I\u2019m not going to do the tea ceremony.\u2019 I had an incredible desire and curiosity to delve into all sorts of worlds, and I\u2019ve loved it all.\u201d Ono was born in Tokyo in 1933 to a wealthy family; her great-grandfather founded the Yasuda Bank. She suggests that her desire for peace was honed in Japan during the Second World War as bombs rained down. \u201cWorld peace is very important, because the [alternative] is doomsday,\u201d she says. \u201cMost people think: \u2018Well, doomsday\u2019s OK because we\u2019re all going to go together.\u2019 I have been in Japan when the atomic bomb was dropped in Hiroshima by you guys, and I know that it\u2019s a very painful way of going. And I don\u2019t want to see that happening again.\u201d In the early 1950s her family moved to New York, where Ono met her first husband, musician Toshi Ichiyanagi. Over the course of the decade she became involved in the city\u2019s downtown art scene, and by 1961 she and friends like the composer LaMonte Young were staging art events and performances in her loft apartment. After her first marriage broke up, Ono returned to Tokyo suffering from depression; her parents responded by sending her to a mental asylum. An American friend, Anthony Cox, secured her release and became her second husband; they had a daughter, Kyoko, in 1963. In 1971 Cox absconded with Kyoko during a custody battle; Ono did not see her again until 1998.     Making history: the famous \u2018Bed-In\u2019 with John Lennon in 1969. Photograph: AP    By the end of 1966 Ono was in London, where she met Lennon at the Indica Gallery when she was preparing an exhibition. They became a couple in 1968 while Lennon was still married to Cynthia, and Ono rapidly became one of the world\u2019s most vilified women, with the couple roundly mocked for actions like the Bed-In \u2013 though Ono says that such reactions were anticipated. \u201c\u2018Bed-In\u2019 \u2013 that\u2019s like a laugh, you know,\u201d she says, recalling the response at the time. \u201c\u2018Hohohoho, what are they doing in bed?\u2019 And through laughter we\u2019re trying to get people to understand what we can do. In a way \u2018Bed-In\u2019 was totally destroyed in people\u2019s minds. But now it\u2019s coming back \u2013 have you noticed?.\u201d Ono believes that activism can \u2013 and should \u2013 take many forms, and her range of causes is similarly broad: world peace, of course, but also the environment (in 2012 she embarked on a high-profile anti-fracking crusade), gun control and social issues including feminism and same-sex marriage. She donated money after the Japanese tsunami, inaugurated the Yoko Ono Lennon Courage Award for the Arts in 2009 and was designated the first global autism ambassador in 2010.     Enlightened: the annually lit Imagine Peace Tower, a memorial in Reykjavik, Iceland to John Lennon by Yoko Ono made of searchlights with prisms and containing the words \u2018Imagine Peace\u2019 carved in 24 languages as well as 1 million written wishes from her Wish Trees project. Photograph: Arctic Images/Corbis    While early works like \u201cCut Piece\u201d \u2013 in which Ono knelt passively on the floor and allowed an audience to shear off her clothing \u2013 are now revered by art critics, Ono says that the two works she is proudest of are 2008\u2019s \u201cImagine Peace Tower\u201d in Iceland, a column of light which can be seen from miles around, and which symbolises her and Lennon\u2019s hopes for an end to global conflict; and the Courage Award, whose last recipient was Julian Assange. \u201cTo be an artist you need courage, and most people don\u2019t think that,\u201d says Ono. \u201cIt\u2019s an age where people are only interested in entertainment. People are just entertained every day, like crazy, and that\u2019s all they\u2019re doing. And they say: \u2018This is boring \u2013 let\u2019s see something else.\u2019 We are all kings and queens now, asking others to entertain us. It\u2019s a very sad situation, because there are many things that we have to do if we want to survive.\u201d Ono says that even before they met, she and Lennon were activists as well as artists. She cites the Beatles\u2019s banned \u201cbutcher cover\u201d, the 1966 album sleeve for the compilation Yesterday and Today, which depicted the group in white coats covered with raw meat and doll parts, as an example of Lennon\u2019s artistic and political vision. \u201cHe always had the intention to better the world, not just be a pop star, and I was like that, too.\u201d As an instance, she remembers a 1968 action in an opulent hotel lobby in Knokke, Belgium, where she was showing her film No. 4 (Bottoms). \u201cIt would not be called something that most activists do, but I had a black bag and I crawled in.\u201d She laughs. \u201cHotel lobbies are usually not that large but the ceiling was three times more than this \u2013 huge. And in the centre of that lobby I was in that bag with a notice that we should all try to make a peaceful world, and it wasn\u2019t taken too well, actually. Some French girls came along and said: \u2018Let\u2019s find out if Yoko Ono is still in there\u2019 and with their high-heel shoes \u2013 boom!\u201d She mimes them whacking the bag. \u201cI thought: \u2018How could you?\u2019 I said \u2018Argh!\u2019 but I didn\u2019t make a noise, really.\u201d This outward lack of response is typical of her. As the critic Lindsay Zoladz recently pointed out, Ono was making interactive artwork back in the early 60s, often daring the viewer to respond with mockery or even violence and in turn prompting them to explore their own reactions. Even Ono\u2019s Twitter feed, in which she tweets instructions like: \u201cCount the numbers of lights in the city every day. Make a number list and hang it on the wall\u201d was trolled by, of all people, Judy Murray, mother of Andy. Yet Ono never flinches. \u201cI\u2019m a very stubborn person. There\u2019s always something that I have in mind that we have to do, and if I\u2019m going to tell other people that that\u2019s what they should do, then if I\u2019m not doing it [myself] I\u2019m a hypocrite.\u201d Of course Ono has been accused of hypocrisy, too, by those who believe that it\u2019s all very well pontificating about peace and love when you\u2019re rich; American TV personality Glenn Beck\u2019s website challenged her for supporting Occupy Wall Street in 2011 when she is supposedly worth $500m. Such accusations glide over her. These critics, she says, \u201cdon\u2019t even indulge in hypocrisy \u2013 they don\u2019t say: \u2018Let\u2019s do something\u2019 and then not do it. They\u2019re not doing anything.\u201d She was, however, shaken by the response to her anti-fracking campaign, which in 2013 saw Ono and her son Sean, Susan Sarandon and a group of activists visit towns affected by hydraulic fracturing. In December fracking was temporarily banned in New York state, where Ono owns a farm. \u201cThat was very difficult for me,\u201d says Ono of the campaign. \u201cTo be against an oil company is something that most people would not want to do. It\u2019s not something that you can do lightly. Last year there were many signs that showed me that maybe they\u2019re really against me. A lot of things that happened to me last year were very scary.\u201d Can she give an example? \u201cNo,\u201d says Ono, chuckling at her own obstinacy. \u201cI\u2019m just saying those things did happen and I was very lucky \u2013 I came out of it.\u201d     \u2018It\u2019s scary for men. You guys had 2,000 years of control of society and that\u2019s about to go now\u2019: Ono at her exhibition Odyssey of a Cockroach at the ICA, London, in 2004. Photograph: Nils Jorgensen/Rex/Shutterstock    Ono engages with identity politics, too. Recently she wrote an essay on her website titled \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Me!\u201d, calling out her critics\u2019 ageism (they had said her voice was out of tune and the shorts she wore in her \u201cBad Dancer\u201d video were unbecoming for a woman in her 80s). \u201cI was amazed,\u201d she says. \u201cI thought I had conquered racism, I conquered sexism, and there was ageism \u2013 I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d Her solution, as ever, was to carry on regardless. \u201cI ignore that,\u201d she says, \u201cstepping on all those prejudices and still working as if there\u2019s no problem.\u201d Rather than becoming hardened over the years, Ono says that she has always been resolutely singleminded. \u201cI\u2019m afraid in that sense I\u2019m very conservative,\u201d she says, laughing. \u201cI just stick to what I am. Any artist or writer who\u2019s doing creative work wants to try to reach beyond themselves, and I was that way, too. But then when I look at myself, in the past 80 years or something, there\u2019s not that much difference.\u201d The same attitude has inoculated her against the ire of Beatles fans, some of whom still blame her for breaking up the band, even though Paul McCartney denied that in 2012. Did she ever feel that she had to win the fans round? Hardly. \u201cThey should win me round,\u201d Ono replies. Her relationship with the surviving Beatles themselves, she says, is warm. \u201cFrom my side there\u2019s an incredible love towards them because they have done something important for the world and especially for the young.\u201d She suggests that any tension in their relationship has been due to British reticence. \u201cI know that it was very difficult for them, too, but they\u2019re not talking about it. For instance, that classic style of \u2018Let\u2019s keep our chins up\u2019 was typical of John. John and I went through so much difficulty and when that was happening we said: \u2018OK, let\u2019s just ignore it.\u2019 I don\u2019t think the other Beatles had to go through that much, really \u2013 John was the one who was taking it all. But I know that they\u2019re doing their best. I really love them like my brothers.\u201d She and McCartney have had disputes over the years, often about the Lennon/McCartney credit on the songs they wrote, which McCartney would like to reverse on his compositions. \u201cI feel that in some ways we are almost forced to be in a boxing ring, and that\u2019s how people are looking at us, but we\u2019re not doing that,\u201d says Ono. Nonetheless she defends Lennon\u2019s legacy with ferocity. Unsurprisingly, she was upset when the nickname \u201cJihadi John\u201d was given to Isis extremist Mohammed Emwazi by the media; he was part of a four-person British-born terrorist cell nicknamed the Beatles by the prisoners they terrorised and later killed. \u201cI thought that was very distasteful,\u201d says Ono. \u201cThat\u2019s why it\u2019s important to me to not be a couch potato. I have to keep on doing something because the other side will take over \u2013 people who are really not understanding what beautiful things we have in this world and want to destroy it. And I\u2019m not going to let them destroy John or the Beatles.\u201d Against such formidable enemies as Isis, is it really effective to \u201cimagine peace\u201d? Ono says that it is. \u201cI think you can be cynical about those things.\u201d But she points out that in 1971, when the prospect of her having a show at MoMA seemed ridiculous, she imagined her own show taking place there, releasing an imaginary jar of flies in the gallery\u2019s garden (she called the work \u201cMuseum of Modern [F]art\u201d). Forty-four years later she\u2019s here for real. \u201cSo if you decide to do something,\u201d she concludes, \u201cit\u2019s going to work, although it might take some time. I don\u2019t like to use the word \u2018optimistic\u2019, because that sounds like it\u2019s not really true, but I think we\u2019re actually on the road to world peace.\u201d", "sentences": ["Think of the \u201cBed-In\u201d that she and Lennon staged in Amsterdam in 1969, or the billboard posters that announced: \u201cWar Is Over!"], "title": "Yoko Ono: \u2018To be an artist you need courage\u2019", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jul/05/yoko-ono-to-be-an-artist-you-need-courage", "tags": ["Observer Ethical Awards 2015", "Yoko Ono", "Culture", "Performance art", "Music", "Art and design", "John Lennon"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-07-06T10:00:10Z", "article": "One of England\u2019s greatest gifts to the world is soccer. Football, as some of you still call it. Yet for large parts of the English-speaking world, the game is far closer to a curiosity than the obsession it is everywhere else. It\u2019s one of the strange anomalies of the game\u2019s situation, and it applies from the antipodes to North America, via the subcontinent. Perhaps it helps explain some of the experiences Michael Bradley and his countrymen have had across the Atlantic. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that as American players and as the American team, we still fight for respect every time we step on the field,\u201d the USA playmaker told the Guardian before their friendly against Germany in Cologne last month.  \u201cWhen you look at some of the players, some of the coaches, some of the teams that we\u2019ve had over the past few years \u2026 there\u2019d be certain cases along the way where we deserve a little bit more respect. \u201cBut that\u2019s life and that\u2019s football, and the only choice you have at that point is to keep going, to keep pushing, and to show people somewhere along the line what you are all about.\u201d Even at home, respect hasn\u2019t always been forthcoming. It goes with the territory when, like Bradley, you play under your father. But under J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann, his father\u2019s successor as USA coach, he has at last been able to shake off whatever skepticism remained. For consecutive trips to Europe this year, the 27-year-old was chosen to lead the team as captain, albeit it as a stand-in. And it was Bradley who engineered remarkable come-from-behind wins against both Holland and world champions Germany. The win in Amsterdam was all the more impressive when you consider they were 3-1 down with 20 minutes left to play. But Bradley, you may not be surprised to learn, is far from content. \u201cThe real tests are coming,\u201d he says in that distinct style of his. The way he talks is, in many ways, a stark contrast to the way he plays his football. On the field, he is all helter skelter movement, charging box to box with the ball at his feet, driving forward at any reasonable cost. In conversation, he is somewhere between laconic, considered and cautious. \u201cThe real tests are coming,\u201d he repeats. \u201cThere\u2019s the Gold Cup, the World Cup qualifiers in the fall, Copa America next year.\u201d The US won the 2013 Gold Cup without dropping a point. They spent barely 10 minutes in arrears during the entire tournament. It was part of a remarkable run in which they won 12 games in a row, and it all started with a 4-3 victory in Washington against the Germans. By the time they met die Mannschaft again, in Recife at last year\u2019s World Cup, the team had won a remarkable 20 of 26 games. It was a run that also included a vital victory over Ghana that would help the US progress to the knockout stages of the competition. It\u2019s their form since that has been raising eyebrows. Prior to the game in Cologne, their scorecard read four wins, three draws and four losses. Break even figures, nothing more. Bradley puts it down to some post-World Cup experimentation, and letting a few results get away from them. When asked what constitutes a pass or fail in their Gold Cup title defence, he says \u201cthe idea is to win\u201d, but he\u2019s \u201cnot in the business of deciding what\u2019s a pass, what\u2019s good enough, what\u2019s not, what\u2019s a fail. \u201c[It\u2019s not] going to be easy. To start with, the quality from top to bottom in Concacaf has gotten better over the last eight to 10 years. Certainly when you look at the World Cup this last summer, you can see that.  \u201cTo win the tournament, you know, you have to start with the idea that you\u2019re playing three good games in your group, and getting out of your group, and you know at that point it\u2019s a knockout tournament, and that point you are trying to move along on game at a time. \u201cAnd then, obviously, even if you take care of everything you need to along the way, typically a final against Mexico, or a game against Mexico, at some point late In the tournament is always a very difficult game. Certainly on the field, but also in terms of the emotion, the tension and the rivalry.  \u201cSo, look, it\u2019s a big summer for us.\u201d He takes a deep breath, umms and ahhs for a second, then pauses. \u201cWe understand that. But we\u2019re also excited about that.\u201d The result in Cologne certainly shows the potential this side has got. They dominated the world champions throughout the second half, and in the dying minutes, Bobby Wood gave them a well-deserved lead. It was a goal that began with a Bradley run through the midfield.  \u201cCan they win the Gold Cup? Yes, of course,\u201d Mario G\u00f6tze told the Guardian after that match. The man who set up G\u00f6tze\u2019s World Cup-winning goal last year, Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle, went further. \u201c[This is a] very good team. Very powerful. Very aggressive. And very strong in the tackle. And from that, I am certain that they have a good chance of winning the Gold Cup,\u201d Sc\u00fcrrle said. \u201cThere\u2019s quality in the midfield, and they are playing very well.\u201d He sees similarities between the US and his own team, which Klinsmann rebuilt last decade. \u201cThey can stretch and press. With the fast switching and their entertaining approach, you can see the influences of J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann.\u201d Beating the world champs on their home soil won the US plenty of praise. Will it be enough to earn them the respect of the footballing world? As Bradley walks away from his brief post-match interview, he turns and considers the question for a second or two. \u201cThat\u2019s for other people to decide,\u201d he answers. There was the faintest hint of a smile.", "sentences": ["The win in Amsterdam was all the more impressive when you consider they were 3-1 down with 20 minutes left to play."], "title": "Will USA win the Gold Cup?

Originally launched in 2005, this adaptable, cross-platform game engine is freely available to amateur coders and can be bought for just $1500 by small professional studios, allowing both groups to quickly develop new projects without having to build their own underlying 3D graphics technologies \u2013 saving years of work and many thousands of dollars. Consequently, Unity has been a hugely important part of the indie scene, providing the tech behind everything from Gone Home to City Skylines, Pillars of Eternity and Fallout Shelter. But the openness and accessibility of the engine comes at a cost. For many PC gamers, the tech has become synonymous with cheap, quickly produced games, thrust onto the Steam game download service by inexperienced developers. Although the industry recognises the benefits of the engine \u2013 there are now over 4.5m Unity developers worldwide \u2013 consumers are becoming wary. Unity has an image problem.  John Riccitiello, once the boss at mainstream publisher Electronic Arts, is now Unity\u2019s chief executive. During the company\u2019s Unite conference held in Amsterdam in June, he was hugely vocal about the progress of the engine, and about its important role in the re-emergence of virtual reality, allowing developers to quickly produce Oculus Rift prototypes. But what about the issue of how his engine is perceived by PC gamers?  \u201cI think some players have a false perception of Unity and that might be of our own making,\u201d he says. \u201cWe require free users to employ a Unity splash screen [in their games] but professional users are not required to show off the fact their game was made using our engine. Maybe in terms of how the engine is perceived we ought to do that the other way around.\u201d Unifying everything To Riccitiello, the sheer omnipresence of the platform is a mixed blessing. Its affordability and robustness has made it the first choice for small scale projects, but this also means it has become associated with amateur productions. \u201cThe truth is we have millions of developers using our software,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you have that many customers, you are going to have lots of college and high school projects with your engine name attached. Occasionally you get somebody who has clearly got something, but for the most part, a couple of inexperienced developers making their first project won\u2019t usually yield a great outcome. They get a much better standard of product than they would have without using Unity, but it\u2019s still not up to the standards of a high-end commercial game.\u201d Of course it\u2019s fine for college students to make use of the free \u201cpersonal\u201d version of Unity to explore game development. However, one of the bigger issues currently plaguing the perception of the development tool is the way that Steam\u2019s Greenlight service, a sort of peer review portal used to calculate demand for a product on the site, has seen a growing stream of hackneyed game projects. Sometimes these are entirely built using code and graphics taken straight from the Unity Asset Store, a collection of tools, demos and assets uploaded by Unity users and meant as useful tool sets for larger projects. And if some users are ripping stuff from the site and repackaging it as their own game without any original content, is that something Unity needs to address? Sam Beddoes, developer of Unity game Jump \u2018N\u2019 Shoot Attack!, thinks it might be. \u201cIn my eyes, the biggest issue for Unity\u2019s reputation is the asset store,\u201d he says. \u201cThink of it like web development. Designing and coding a great website is a lot of hard work, but a tonne of people go and grab scripts and codes pre-written from other sites and manage to use copy and paste to cobble them together into something which just about resembles a product.  \u201cThe asset store is now diverse enough that if you want to make a game where a guy shoots zombies, you can download zombie graphics, AI scripts for that zombie, the gun graphic, FPS control scripts etc, and cobble the whole thing together in a few afternoons. And people do exactly that. When assets provide tools to cut out almost any of the hard work and required skill, that\u2019s when you get the amateurs trying to blag their way into a game dev career.\u201d Riccitiello, however, is reticent to start policing how Unity games are built. \u201cYou know, I think there\u2019s a great debate to be had about how people who own computers shouldn\u2019t be able to use them to write evil messages to people,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any mileage in that way of thinking about our product. \u201cRealistically, most of what\u2019s put up in the Asset Store comes from third-party developers that want to sell it. After that somebody uses it, it\u2019s really not up to us to police that. Who are we to say they can\u2019t resell it unedited on Steam? I understand what I\u2019ve just said is also a really weak excuse and I will admit I\u2019m not thrilled with the state of our Asset Store and how it is utilised right now. I don\u2019t want to have some kind of liberal police state philosophy for how things from the Asset Store are used, but I think there are issues there that do need to change.\u201d Perhaps the answer would be to have a blanket license on the store that prevented assets from being resold on other sites without significant additions? Riccitiello is unconvinced and sees the responsibility for policing such content lying elsewhere. \u201cI think this is far more Steam\u2019s problem than anything to do with us,\u201d he says. \u201cSteam, with regards to mods and Greenlight, has its own pile of problems to deal with. From our perspective, there\u2019s one thing that gamers are invariably good at: finding the margins within which they can use a system to cheat. \u201cThat\u2019s just the nature of our industry and I don\u2019t think we will ever stop people wanting to work around limitations. There are people who, if told they couldn\u2019t resell an asset pack without editing it, would just mod some hair from blue to green and say they\u2019re done. I don\u2019t know if you can ultimately say that\u2019s not a saleable mod or game at that point. Are we at Unity going to start having to make judgements about how much of a game needs to change before it can be resold? I don\u2019t think so [...] I don\u2019t think that, long term, trying to prevent reselling assets wholesale is a wise policy on our end.\u201d Unity for beginners  Garrett Cooper, currently developing role playing shooter Black Ice, says he experienced some push back from his audience when they learnt his game was made in Unity, yet he sees the benefit in how the engine and the asset store currently work. \u201cI\u2019ve definitely had some players say things like \u2018Gross, not another Unity game!\u2019 during the development of Black Ice, but I think what they were concerned about is mostly the default options they\u2019ve seen in other games. A lot of games made with the free version of Unity 4 look pretty similar, because they use the same user-interface buttons, the same shaders on all the objects, that sort of thing. \u201cThe way it\u2019s set up now, minimum-effort games will always have that Unity splash screen, but quality games almost never will. That said, I think the intention was to show that, hey, anyone can make games with Unity with very little effort. It\u2019s possible that splash hurts them a little, but it also gets more people started making games, which I\u2019m all for.\u201d Unity is in a unique position as a powerful, indie-friendly technology, but there\u2019s a lot at stake. Somehow the company needs average gamers to know that it is behind the likes of Grow Home, Ori and the Blind Forest and Superhot as well as those exploratory projects built with asset store bits and pieces. And if the engine is to become a big part of the exploding virtual reality and augmented reality scenes (which its 5.1 update is clearly aimed toward), managing expectations \u2013 and promises \u2013 will be ever more important.

Then in an instant last fall, it was gone. Many people had complained about the Subway Inn: it had long attracted the wrong types so close to its upscale neighbor, Bloomingdales. It was a glowing eyesore on a prime commercial block, and the declining interior long outweighed the drink value. But when the neon sign disappeared, the overworked, consistently distracted and famously busy city stopped and paid attention. \u201cIn the past few years, we have been able to save three significant signs, and we saved them because all the businesses that had these signs also owned their buildings,\u201d said Jeff Friedman, a craftsman with Let There Be Neon, the go-to rescuer and creator of custom neon in New York. \u201cThe care and interest of these signs is never there when the new owners take over the buildings. \u201cA lot of people were watching that sign \u2013 no one wanted it to go the way of the Kentile Floors sign in Brooklyn or the old P&amp;G Bar sign.\u201d When Earle C Anthony installed his luminous Packard neon sign \u2013 the very first in the United States \u2013 outside his Los Angeles car dealership in 1923, \u201cliquid fire\u201d, as neon was then dubbed, had already spread across Europe but not quite grabbed New York by the collar. Ten years later, the city of New York distributed 3,400 permits for \u201cilluminated signs\u201d, and sign makers from the esteemed EG Clark to a Yiddish-speaking sign painter from Russia named Charles Karsch set to work on re-creating Manhattan\u2019s cityscape. Throughout the Great Depression, a second world war and the baby boom years, neon signs invited patrons to drink, hawked goods and helped weary travelers find their way to the nearest Times Square hotel. In a city with a history of bulldozing and building over its past, however, there remain just a few of these signs left in the five boroughs \u2013 some pristinely preserved over the decades, whether by serendipity or the deep, sincere dedication of the owners who love them. \u201cRuss &amp; Daughters is a New York icon and our neon sign is a part of our history \u2013 not having that sign has never even been a consideration,\u201d said Niki Russ Federman, one of the fourth-generation proprietors of the famous specialty food shop on the Lower East Side. Although no one knows who built the 1951 sign featuring two whitefish in downward-dog pose bookending the store\u2019s vibrant name, when Russ &amp; Daughters opened a cafe down the street in 2014 it chose to \u201cpainstakingly make a new neon sign inspired directly from the original\u201d.     It costs $25,000 a year to keep Nathan\u2019s neon signs lit. Photograph: Adrian Brune    Most neon preservationists who want to revive a sign turn to Let There Be Neon, founded in the early 1970s by New York\u2019s patron saint of neon, Rudi Stern. In addition to establishing a shop in which sign designers, tube benders and chemists could restore and re-create signs, Stern authored three editions of the neon bible which bears the same name as his store, a chronology and a tribute to classic signage. \u201cThere was a time when neon was a trade that demanded design expertise and precision through many stages of a handcraft process,\u201d Stern wrote. \u201cAs artistic feats of technical virtuosity, these electric sculptures were indelible features of our American landscape.\u201d New York had several virtuosos in the early days of American neon. As prohibition ended in 1933, bar owners who had previously kept their establishments underground wanted to make a statement. Prominent sign maker EG Clarke Inc gave John Carway, the Irish owner of the Dublin House bar on West 79th Street, a 12-foot green harp whose red name is visible two blocks away. Meanwhile, downtown, Karsch updated his skill set and started making some of New York\u2019s best known neon pieces: the sign for White Horse Tavern in the West Village; the former P&amp;G Bar at 73rd and Amsterdam; and one of the most technically difficult signs in the city, the Gringer GE Appliances sign on First Avenue and Second Street, commissioned by Philip Gringer in 1953. Although unanimated, experts consider the sign a breakthrough in design due to not only the highly unusual band of yellow lettering at the bottom, but also the swirly blue GE logos \u2013 a feat of technical prowess rarely seen in earlier advertisements. \u201cThe Gringer sign is so loved by the owner, after we refurbished it, he started cleaning the porcelain face with Turtle Wax,\u201d Friedman said. Throughout New York\u2019s boom and bust years, developers have taken down many classic signs as buildings change owners and aesthetic. These include some of Friedman\u2019s favorites: the animated Fuji film sign in Times Square; the Planter\u2019s Peanut sign, also in Times Square; and Monte\u2019s restaurant in the East Village. Outside of Manhattan, animated neon art such as Astoria\u2019s Airline Diner sign \u2013 a staple of the LaGuardia-area neighborhood for more than 50 years and a notable landmark in the Scorsese film Goodfellas \u2013 and Nathan\u2019s 70-year-old hot dog sign face gradual destruction not from zealous new landlords, but from weather and wear. Every time Queens has a hard rain, the neon outline of the flying airplane needs replacing, according to Isaac Paschalidis, one of the owners of the Airline Diner, and electricity bills can run upward of $1,000 a month. \u201cWe have a good name, but the sign helps; people see it from all over and want to come in,\u201d Paschalidis said on a particularly blustery June night, before gesturing toward the sign\u2019s recently busted tubing. Nathan\u2019s has continually extinguished any rumors that developers would take down the signs that adorn the classic hot dog stand on Coney Island. A company spokesperson said the tourists taking photos underneath the signs make the $25,000 a year that the company pays in electric bills worth it. But both Nathan\u2019s and the Airline Diner own their buildings and therefore their signs \u2013 a rarity in Manhattan. Luckily, however, the owners of the Subway Inn paid for its sign and, when forced to relocate to Second Avenue, took it with them, installing the new version in March.  The owners of P&amp;G Bar also paid for their Karsch sign in 1947 and removed it when forced to vacate in 2009.

When it announced its goal three years ago, following a campaign by activist groups including the International Labor Rights Forum, Green America and Global Exchange, some feared that there would not be enough certified cocoa to meet the needs of Hershey\u2019s, Mars, Ferrero and other sustainability-minded chocolate companies.  But supply has grown alongside a rising demand for sustainable cocoa. As JP Bilbrey, Hershey\u2019s chief executive, tells the Guardian: \u201cCapitalism is a wonderful thing. If you demand something, those that supply it to you will provide that particular product.\u201d  The next question is how much of a difference this sustainable sourcing is making in the lives of cocoa farmers. Hershey\u2019s, which had revenues of $7.4bn last year, won\u2019t say how much of its profits have trickled down to suppliers, nor will it say how much business it does with each of its three nonprofit certifiers: Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance and UTZ Certified.  Certification alone hasn\u2019t proven sufficient to lift the incomes of cocoa farmers, who are still poor, according to Han De Groot, executive director of UTZ Certified, a nonprofit based in Amsterdam.  That\u2019s a worry for the chocolate maker and the activists. If farmer incomes don\u2019t rise, there\u2019s a very real risk that the next generation of farmers will give up on the business. \u201cEven with the highest premium paid for certified cocoa, farmers are way deep in poverty,\u201d says Judy Gearhart, executive director of the International Labor Rights Forum.  De Groot agrees. After visiting certified cocoa farmers in Cote D\u2019Ivoire, he wrote: \u201cThere is still too much poverty to have a decent and sustainable life.\u201d  Using demand to supply sustainability Certification is only part of Hershey\u2019s efforts. It also works with several partners, including the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, US AID and Cocoa Action, to support efforts aimed at helping farmers and their families in West Africa. Its projects include Learn to Grow, a program that trains farmers on best agricultural, business and environmental practices, and CocoaLink, which distributes low-cost mobile phones to farmers. Last month, Hershey\u2019s announced plans to distribute Vivi, a peanut-based supplement, to poor school children in Ghana. For now, the Ghanaian nutrition program is charity, but it could evolve into a business, Bilbrey says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to experiment with this, and if turns out to be a good idea, where the kids can get some basic nutrition, as part of their lunch program, we\u2019ll look to expand it.\u201d While these efforts are charitably-minded, they also have a business impact: they\u2019re all aimed at securing a long term supply of cocoa. \u201cWe want to take cocoa farming from being a way for farmers to subsist to being an attractive vocation for the next generation,\u201d says Leigh Horner, vice president for corporate communications and social responsibility at Hershey\u2019s. The trouble is that cocoa farming in West Africa, where more than 60% of the world\u2019s cocoa is grown, is a difficult business. Most farmers work on small farms that have old trees farm practices that have not been modernized. They struggle with low and fluctuating cocoa prices, a lack of farmer organization, insufficient infrastructure, uncertainty over land ownership rights and a lack of market power, according to Cocoa Barometer 2015, a report by a group of nonprofits. The International Labor Rights Forum reported in December that the average farmer with two hectares of land makes about $755 per year in Cote d\u2019Ivoire and $983 per year in Ghana; this translates to $2.07 per day and $2.69 per day, respectively. The report says:  Despite myriad projects aimed at improving education, increasing productivity, and implementing cocoa certification, the collective impact has been limited and the industry has been unable to solve the root cause of the problem: the very low prices paid to farmers.     Related: McDonald's to axe deforestation from its global supply chain    How can farmers be paid more? The challenge for industry and activists alike is how to get more of the value of chocolate to the cocoa farmers. Only one of Hershey\u2019s certifiers, Fair Trade USA, actually guarantees a minimum price to cocoa growers. It requires that farmers be paid a premium of $200 per metric ton, which is about 10% above the market price. \u201cWe believe that a meaningful level of investment, channeled directly to farmers, is needed in order to make meaningful change,\u201d says Elan Emanuel, senior manager of cocoa supply for Fair Trade USA. He acknowledges, however, that competing with other certifiers \u201ccan be a challenge for Fair Trade \u2013 it can be a tougher sell to explain to brands why it\u2019s important to pay a fixed premium\u201d. UTZ Certified and Rainforest Alliance, both of which certify more cocoa globally than Fair Trade, don\u2019t guarantee a premium, but they say that their certified cocoa sells at higher prices because of the growing demand for certified crop. What\u2019s more, they say, their training programs for farmers lead to higher yields and better quality cocoa, which delivers more income to farmers.  A independent study of cocoa farmers in Cote D\u2019Ivoire commissioned by the Rainforest Alliance found that the net income \u2013 defined as a farmer\u2019s revenue from cocoa sales, minus expenses \u2013 was significantly higher on cocoa farms certified by the RA. Certified farms, according to the study, received $403 per hectare \u2013 almost four times the $113 commanded by non-certified farms. Training in best agricultural practices accounted for most of the difference, the study said.  UTZ Certified\u2019s Hans de Groot has argued that guaranteeing cocoa farmers a premium distorts the market by because it removes the incentive for them to adopt better agricultural practices. \u201cIf we want to bring good practices to scale, the market is an important pulling force,\u201d he said. \u201cUsing a minimum price is not helping that practice to grow.\u201d To better understand the issues around certification, the International Cocoa Organization commissioned a study by consulting firm KPMG in 2012. KMPG found that there are \u201cmore advantages than disadvantages of certification at farm, cooperative and also at community level\u201d, but cautioned that \u201cthere is insufficient independent literature focusing on the impact of cocoa certification\u201d. Put simply, we really don\u2019t know whether certification \u2013 or the other farmer aid programs launched by Hershey\u2019s and the rest of the industry \u2013 are doing enough to improve the lives of farmers and make cocoa farming an attractive way to earn a living, in the long term.  There\u2019s no doubt that Hershey\u2019s is trying \u2013 but trying isn\u2019t succeeding.

Our flight home was cancelled due to Lufthansa strike action, even though we were due to depart before the strike began.  An email, informing us the night before our due departure, was extremely brief and stated that more information was available online.  The website simply gave us a number to call. I called it repeatedly for three hours until my phone ran out of battery. My husband then stayed up until 2am trying to get through, and when his call was finally answered he was told that if we could get to Frankfurt by 5am, we could get on a flight, or we would need to wait four days.  Since it was impossible to reach Frankfurt from Cologne in two hours in the middle of the night, we train-hopped across Europe to get a late-night flight from Amsterdam.  Lufthansa has agreed to refund our flights but refuses compensation, declaring strike action is an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d and is therefore exempt from EC rules. However, our flight was due to depart 90 minutes before the strike started, and the strike announcement clearly stated that it would affect flights departing after 12 noon. I know recent court rulings have prevented airlines from arguing that flights affected by strike action after the strike finishes are exempt from compensation, but what about those affected before it begins? SW, Ayton, Berwickshire  The Civil Aviation Authority states that strikes by airline staff (as opposed to air traffic controllers) do not count as an \u201cextraordinary circumstance\u201d unless they are wildcat strikes without advance notice. This is because they are, to some degree, within the control of the airline which can make alternative arrangements. Compensation would therefore be due even if your departure had been scheduled after the strike began. Moreover, Lufhansa failed you by requiring you to wait four days for another flight home.  \u201cWhen a flight is cancelled, airlines are required to offer the choice of a refund or a re-route which has to be in comparable transport conditions and at the earliest opportunity,\u201d says a CAA spokesperson. \u201cHaving to wait four days does not seem reasonable, and Lufthansa could have offered alternative flights on other airlines. It therefore seems there would be a good case that Lufthansa should pay the additional transport costs.\u201d  Lufthansa acknowledges that your flight was indeed outside the strike period. However, it has decided to pay you the statutory compensation specified by EC Regulation 261/2004 of \u20ac250 per person \u201cas a token of our goodwill\u201d and apologises for its poor service. It then asks me not to publish the story in case it \u201cconfuses\u201d readers or raises false hopes in other passengers. As it appears to be the airline\u2019s statutory obligation to pay out, I have ignored this. \u2026 and Ryanair  found it the perfect excuse after a delay My Ryanair flight from Malta to London on 4 May was delayed by eight hours. The check-in staff and captain explained this was due to a technical fault with the aircraft.  In an initial email Ryanair declared the delay as being \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d, therefore deterring people from making a claim for compensation.  Having finally, after 26 days, elicited a reply to my claim, they are now attributing the delay to \u201cweather\u201d and say they are not liable to pay out. All other flights were operating normally that night. AM, London Well, what do you know! As soon as I contact Ryanair it discovers that a technical fault was to blame after all. Although airport and airline staff were fully aware of the reason at the time, Ryanair tells me it was misinformed. \u201cWe rely on our handling agents at our airports to relay the correct information,\u201d a spokesperson says. \u201cIn this case, the cause of this delay was misreported.\u201d It is now going to pay you \u00a3582 in compensation. So far, so heartwarming. But what of all the other passengers on the same flight who were deterred from claiming? Complainants who get nowhere can take their case to the Civil Aviation Authority, but they don\u2019t have the power to impose their findings on airlines.

We decided to discount teams named after saints (because there are so many of them) and those that reside in towns and cities already named after the great and the good \u2013 Milton Keynes Dons, for example. Here, then, are a few of our then-favourites: Vasco da Gama Formed out of a rowing club already named after the famous Portuguese explorer. Willem II The Eredivisie side from Tilburg are named after King Willem II of the Netherlands. Tilburg housed his military headquarters. Newell\u2019s Old Boys Isaac Newell came into the world in Strood, Kent, on 24 April 1853. By the time he left it, on 16 October 1907, he had created what would go on to be one of Argentinian football\u2019s most famous clubs. Club Atl\u00e9tico Aldosivi Another side from Argentina. \u201cThe name originates from the first two letters of the last names of the four original founders,\u201d writes Russell Yong. \u201cAllard, Dollfus, Sillard and Wiriott \u2013 the W changing to a V due to there being no W key on the telegraph that originally announced the club\u2019s formation.\u201d CD O\u2019Higgins Born in Chile, Bernardo O\u2019Higgins Riquelme was the illegitimate son of Ambrosio O\u2019Higgins \u2013 a future governor of Chile and viceroy of Peru, born to Spanish parents in Sligo in Ireland. He grew up to be a leader of the home side in the Chilean War of Independence and is seen as one of the country\u2019s founding fathers. When two clubs in the city of Rancagua merged in 1955 they kept the prefix of one of the clubs, O\u2019Higgins Braden. Club Presidente Hayes One of the few clubs \u2013 if not the only one \u2013 named after a US president. Hayes was apparently very merciful towards Paraguay after taking charge of peace talks after the War of the Triple Alliance (which sounds like it should be in Star Wars, but was actually an exceptionally bloody affair in the 1860s involving Paraguay, Argentina, \u00adUruguay and Brazil). Hayes\u2019s role led to a number of institutions being named in his honour, including this football club from Asunci\u00f3n. CD Luis Angel Firpo The oldest club in El Salvador. Originally named Tec\u00fan Um\u00e1n but changed to CD Luis Angel Firpo in honour of the Argentinian boxer\u2019s epic bout and narrow defeat to the heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey in 1923. Renato Curi Angolana \u201cAn amalgamation of two clubs: dell\u2019Angolana and Renato Curi,\u201d wrote Fergal Hunter. \u201cThe latter was created in honour of Renato Curi who played for Perugia in the 1970s. He was a midfielder who joined them when they were in Serie B, helped get them promoted to Serie A and led them to sixth place. He died in October 1977 of a heart attack on the pitch during a Serie A match with Juventus. He was 24. Perugia\u2019s stadium is also named after him.\u201d Club Atl\u00e9tico Douglas Haig Why would a club from Pergamino, just north of Buenos Aires, name itself after a British first world war Field Marshall? According to the club: \u201cOn 18 November 1918 after the resounding victory of the Allied forces, a group of British workers on the Argentinian central railroad decided to start a club to participate in the local soccer championship. This required the consent and support of the chief of the railway, Ronald Leslie, who, as a condition, requested that the club take the name of General Douglas Haig.\u201d CD Godoy Cruz Antonio Tomba \u201cNamed after not one, but two individuals,\u201d wrote Tim Dockery. \u201cThey are the result of a 1930 compromise when Sportivo Godoy Cruz (named after a signatory of the Argentinian Declaration of Independence, Tom\u00e1s Godoy Cruz) merged with Deportivo Bodega Antonio Tomba (Tomba\u2019s store was a sponsor of that club).\u201d Colo-Colo The only Chilean side to have won the Copa Libertadores were named after Colocolo, a Mapuche chief of the 16th century. The name translates as \u2018mountain cat\u2019. Deportivo Walter Ferretti Ferreti was a Sandinista comandante known as \u201cChombo\u201d who was killed in a road accident in 1991. The old ministry of the interior team (where he used to work) is named after him. Joe Public FC The Trinidad and Tobago club, once home to Kenwyne Jones and former Dundee and Gillingham defender Brent Sancho, is named after, well, everybody basically. WHICH PLAYERS HAVE MOVES NAMED AFTER THEM? \u201cIn France, a powerful acrobatic volleyed goal is referred to as \u2018Une Papinade\u2019 after Jean-Pierre Papin scored many in his time,\u201d observed Nick Dunmore in 2007. \u201cApart from the Cruyff turn, what other moves across the world are named after players?\u201d Many players have lent their names to particular moves, though as you\u2019d imagine, not all of them are cap-doffingly positive paeans like the one afforded to Cruyff. But let\u2019s start with the positives, because we\u2019re all about spreading the love. The sauciest penalty of all - the sort Zin\u00e9dine Zidane so nearly jiggered up in the 2006 World Cup final, the cheeky chip down the middle - is known the world over as a Panenka, after Czechoslovakia\u2019s Antonin Panenka, who clipped the ball straight down the middle at 1mph past Sepp Maier in the final of the 1976 Euros against West Germany. There is real debate, however, when it comes to the 360-degree turn, often referred to as the \u2018Garrincha turn\u2019. As Paul Doyle noted in his Sprechen sie Fu\u00dfball? article of 2006, \u201cPlayStation games refer to it as the Marseille turn, also known in English as the double drag-back, Zidane turn, Maradona turn and, according to earlier computer games, the [David] Rocastle 360. Zidane himself calls it la roulette.\u201d Norwegians meanwhile refer to the \u2018Flopasning\u2019 - literally \u2018the Flo pass\u2019 - named after Jostein Flo, formerly of Sheffield United. \u201cThis was the favourite tactic of the national side in the first half of the 90s,\u201d explained David Glass. \u201cThe move involved one of the full-backs, usually Liverpool\u2019s Stig Inge Bjornebye, hoofing a long diagonal ball up to the giant Flo. He would then knock the ball down to one of the midfielders who would be steaming in. Pretty basic, but quite effective before opposing sides worked out what was going on. The term is still used in Norway.\u201d Jack Robinson, Southampton\u2019s goalkeeper of 1899 vintage, was similarly honoured after showing some Austrians how to tackle low shots by diving to stop or catch the ball. \u201cThat type of save was referred to as \u2018a Robinsonade\u2019 in Austria and some parts of Central Europe until the middle of the 20th century,\u201d explained Pete McAuliffe. \u201cRobinson was also an England international. It is perhaps worth asking whether the term still exists on the continent given the plight of the current England No1, though with a different meaning for any element of hapless goalkeeping.\u201d Whoosh! There goes the love! So we might as well move on to more derogatory terms - and, speaking of hapless goalkeeping, the case of Franck Grandel. Peter de Koning explained: \u201cGrandel, a Guadeloupe-born goalkeeper, made some comical mistakes during his first season in the Dutch league at FC Utrecht. So much so that fans started referring to mistakes leading to goals as \u2018Grandelletje\u2019.\u201d Meanwhile in Denmark, a hospital pass is known as a \u2018rigtig Jesper Olsen\u2019 (\u2018a real Jesper Olsen\u2019). \u201cIt\u2019s named after Olsen\u2019s square ball across his own defence that set up Spain\u2019s equaliser in Denmark\u2019s 1986 World Cup match,\u201d explained Aidan Curran. \u201cHaving been 1-0 down, Spain went on to destroy the Danes 5-1. Sometimes Danish politicians use the term to mock an opponent\u2019s blunder or gaffe.\u201d WHICH FOOTBALL CLUBS HAVE HAD SHIPS NAMED AFTER THEM?  \u0012\u201cOn a recent tour of Rotterdam Docks I noticed a container ship called Borussia Dortmund, painted, of course, in garish yellow and black,\u201d wrote Paul Corrigan, also in 2010.\u201dDo any other clubs have ships named after them?\u201d \u201cAs a seaman, I know of the ship that Paul is referring to,\u201d writes Roland de Boer. \u201cWhilst working aboard another vessel I have passed it in the North Sea on a few occasions recently. I have also encountered the \u2018Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach\u2019 which is green and white, the \u2018AT Bilbao\u2019, the \u2018Kaizer Chiefs\u2019, and the \u2018Juventus\u2019. No doubt there are many others. Vessels are named by their owners or holding companies. Sometimes the name seems random but some vessels are named after famous figures (real, literary or mythical), places, song titles or for family members. Of course, the odd wealthy football fan can also pay homage to his team in this way.\u201d Well let\u2019s take a look at the good ship Borussia Dortmund. Built in 1998, she\u2019s currently stationed in St Petersburg, though seems set to head to Hamburg this week (you can follow her progress on this brilliant tool here). More than 20 photos of her in all her glory can be found here, as she flits from port to port. There\u2019s also the aforementioned Juventus and a couple of Arsenals too. Incidentally, while on the subject of Dortmund, it would be remiss of us not to recall the instance when an investigation by the German consumer TV show Plusminus in 2000 claimed to have found tributyltin - a toxic anti-bacterial chemical that can cause health problems in humans - in the club\u2019s replica Nike shirts. Tributyltin is more commonly used as a paint on ships to protect them from barnacle damage. \u201cWe knew that the substance was still used in coatings for ships, but it shouldn\u2019t be in textiles that people wear,\u201d said scientist J\u00fcrgen Kundke. Dortmund pulled the shirts from their club shop, as did the Kaufhof, Karstadt and Hertie department stores, though Nike were quick to insist: \u201cSmall doses of TBT when used in textiles are not normally dangerous to humans.\u201d Moving on, Michel van der Velde notes that \u201ca towage company from IJmuiden(close to Amsterdam) re-named one of their ships after the local second division football club two months ago. Telstar, whose famous players include Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink, Arjan de Zeeuw, Heinz Stuy and Louis van Gaal, can be seen here [not any more it can\u2019t - Archive Ed].\u201d And Nick Tolerton adds that \u201cthere was a whole fleet of ships named after teams, the Consolidated Fisheries Ltd fleet of deepwater Grimsby steam and motor trawlers\u201d. He goes on to add:  In the 1960s this ran to more than 20 ships named after football teams, and over the decades from the first in the early 1930s nearly 30 clubs were represented. Inevitably there was a Grimsby Town. However, as well as ships named after the more glamorous clubs of the 50s and 60s - an Arsenal, Aston Villa, Everton, Spurs, and Wolverhampton Wanderers (the last of those must have been a tight squeeze to paint up on the stern) - the smaller clubs were well-represented, including an Aldershot, Gillingham, Port Vale, and, generously considering their rivalry with Grimsby, a Lincoln City. The one foreign team, inevitably at that time, was the Real Madrid of 1961.  More information about Grimsby Trawlers of the day, including the Consolidated Fisheries Ltd \u2018football fleet\u2019 and details of them getting in trouble for calling a ship \u201cNotts County\u201d (a schoolboy error) can be found here. Switching to tourist boats, Justin Horton offers word of the Spanish ferry company Iscomar, which \u201crepainted its vessel Isabel Del Mar with the badge of RCD Mallorca as part of a sponsorship deal. It is to be hoped that neither party to the agreement goes down.\u201d And Genoa resident Michael Nimmo adds that \u201cone of the companies (Rimorchiatori Riuniti) where I work, organises boats in the harbour here. A lot of their workers are Genoa fans, and in honour of one of our star players two years ago, Thiago Motta (formerly of Bar\u00e7a and now of Inter) the company called one of their boats The Brazilian, and gave it No88 (his squad number). He came down and signed autographs and had his photo taken, but needless to say he left shortly after.\u201d While we\u2019re on the subject of football\u2019s seafaring links, it is worth digging into the history of Boca Juniors. After losing a play-off against local rivals Boedo for the right to their black-and-white-striped kit in March 1907, Boca agreed to visit Buenos Aires harbour and take the colours of the first foreign ship to come in. The 4,146-tonne freighter Drottning Sophia arrived from Copenhagen, flying the Swedish flag and the rest is history. When the club released a limited-edition 105th anniversary shirt in 2010, it even bore the yellow and blue national flag on the front.

In it, there is a scene set in the grimy, dark kitchen of a ruin of a house, with an amalgam of blood sweat and tears wafting through the stuffy air. Brad Pitt, in his Tyler Durden swagger, stares at Edward Norton writhing in pain, and tells him, \u201cIt is only after we\u2019ve lost everything, that we\u2019re free to do anything.\u201d Memphis Depay turned five that year, and was living in a tiny town on the outskirts of Gouda in the Netherlands. Like so many other kids, he spent most of his time playing football on the street with his friends. One day, he ran inside and plonked himself on the sofa next to his granddad, in time for the football on TV. The 1998-99 Eredivisie trophy was being won by the club a mere 20-odd kilometres away; Feyenoord. Young Depay turned to his grandfather and said: \u201cOne day you will be able to watch me play football on TV, too!\u201d Similar sentences are said in many a sitting room around the world each day but the difference with Depay is that, echoing that Tyler Durden dialogue, he would have to lose an awful lot before he was able to liberate himself from his demons and become the successful footballer that joined Manchester United this summer.   Related: Memphis Depay is \u2018on fire\u2019 and eager to work with Louis van Gaal     Depay was born in 1994, to a Ghanaian father, Dennis, and a Dutch mother, Cora. It was not long, however, before the relationship between the two parents began to fall apart and when Memphis was four, his father walked out on the family. Seeing his father abandon him and his mother left a deep wound in Depay\u2019s psyche. He was just about to start school and his background at home was destabilised. Cora soon met a new partner but the new man made their lives traumatic and though Depay tried to use football as a means to get away, he did not always succeed. Former teachers talk of him as a student who was extremely difficult to handle, with boundless energy but no control. His primary school teacher, Jeanet de Jong reminisced last year about Depay breakdancing and cartwheeling in class. Insecurities occupied Depay\u2019s mind as he wondered why \u201cfathers\u201d in his life seemed to be transient and deleterious. Things were due to change for the better though: soon, Cora and Memphis were abandoned by the abusive boyfriend and moved in with her parents, Kees and Jans. This finally brought some stability. In the absence of another father figure, Depay\u2019s grandfather Kees took up the role. The child\u2019s insecurities remained, and there was a lot for him to overcome, even at his tender age, but at least now he had a guiding figure and stability. Kees \u2013 a big football fan \u2013 introduced Depay to organised football by encouraging him join the local side VV Moordrecht when he was seven. The club chairman, Ton Redegeld, who worked personally with Depay at youth level, told Marco Gerling of the newspaper Algemeen Dagblad that the quick little boy \u201calways stood out\u201d in training and in matches. \u201cHe was fast, agile and strong and I thought: \u2018It\u2019s not going to be long before he is out of here\u2019,\u201d he added. \u201cIn matches where we scored seven goals he would get five of them and set up the other two. And I\u2019m not exaggerating.\u201d In 2003 Sparta Rotterdam came calling and Depay\u2019s mum and grandfather agreed that the distance between Rotterdam and Moordrecht was short enough and that the club would be a comfortable step-up. On the pitch Depay impressed with his innate confidence and sublime touch. Off the pitch was a different matter. Kevin Valkenburg, Depay\u2019s youth coach there, said: \u201cHe had behavioural problems. Usually I\u2019ll get through with that kind of boy but he was difficult to help, as if there was a wall around him.\u201d     Memhis Depay celebrates scoring for Holland Under-17s against Serbia in May 2011. Photograph: Srdjan Stevanovic/Getty Images    When Depay turned 12, a number of clubs scouted him. His grandfather was initially apprehensive about accepting offers that involved the youngster moving away from home. He also thought that, despite being an Ajax supporter, it was not right for Depay to move to the Amsterdam club or Feyenoord, as their academies were demanding. In the end it was agreed that Depay would join PSV Eindhoven, known for their player-centric approach to youth coaching. However, it still meant Depay had to move in with a foster family in Eindhoven. Valkenburg said that in Rotterdam Depay \u201chad remained in his old environment\u201d with the backdrop of the problems he had encountered and that a move away was \u201cgood for him\u201d, adding: \u201cIn that sense, PSV was his salvation.\u201d His foster father, Olaf Heijblom, in an interview with Prive magazine, recalled how Depay struggled initially: \u201cI remember a few weeks after he had moved in with us,\u201d he said. \u201cWe were sitting in the backyard and suddenly I heard Memphis crying from his bedroom on the first floor. I immediately went up and sat down with him. He was sobbing but slowly he started telling his story. My heart then went straight to him, and together with my wife, we showed him that a household and family life can be fun and enjoyable.\u201d As someone who had lost out on a stable family in his formative years, living with the nurturing Heijbloms opened young Depay\u2019s mind. PSV appointed a mentor, Joost Lenders, to work with Depay too. Erik ten Hag, an assistant coach at PSV, said: \u201cHe was so confident about himself. He was sometimes difficult, but I\u2019ve never had problems with Memphis. He also had a very good relationship with [the manager] Fred Rutten, who he trusted. He spent a lot of time with Memphis and knew how to handle him. Because of Memphis\u2019s background, it was necessary.\u201d With the right kind of support, Depay\u2019s behaviour improved and his footballing motivation intensified. Now a promising teenager who impressed in continental youth tournaments, Depay grew serious about his future and progressed through PSV\u2019s youth teams. Then in 2009 his grandfather, Kees, died. The news hit Depay hard. The man to who he had promised he would one day play for Feyenoord would never see him make his professional debut for PSV, or be picked for Holland. Last summer, after Depay scored his first goal for his country, against Australia in the World Cup, he kissed his wrist, where he has a tattoo to honour Kees, and pointed to the skies, acknowledging on TV the pledge he once made in front of it.

Photograph: Marko Djurica/Reuters    In an interview last year with Hart van Holland, his mother, when asked about her son\u2019s aspirations, said: \u201cHe wants to play for Manchester United and then a club in Spain.\u201d The first part of Depay\u2019s dream has nearly been fulfilled. After a hugely successful season with PSV in which he scored 22 goals in 30 league games as the club won their 22nd title, he joined Manchester United for \u20ac27.5m (\u00a325m), possibly rising to \u20ac32 million. He is an example to young footballers, his life trajectory showing that childhood experiences need not define someone, let alone dictate their destiny. He spends his money lavishly, owning a luxury apartment in Rotterdam and a camouflage-coloured car among other things, but his heart remains in the right place. Recently he went back to Moordrecht and surprised his mother by giving her a brand new Mercedes. The present may have been materialistic but the words were emotional. On Facebook, where he had uploaded a video of that moment, he quoted lyrics from Kanye West\u2019s Hey Mama and added \u201cAnd I love you for that mommy!! I hope I made you proud.\u201d The Austrian psychiatrist Viktor Frankl once said: \u201cWhen we are no longer able to change a situation, we are challenged to change ourselves\u201d, and this is what Depay has done. Across his chest is a sprawling tattoo with the words \u201cDream Chaser\u201d, with two wings, symbolising both the fledgling bird he was, and his opportunity to now truly spread his wings and take flight on the international scene. Back in Moordrecht he is already a legend \u2013 there are few boys in Moordrecht without a poster of Memphis plastered to their bedroom walls; he is \u201ctheir\u201d Memphis. Depay\u2019s story is one of a boy who, despite the odds against him, has achieved what he set out to achieve. He lost a lot in those early years but also found himself and a freedom to express himself. Depay is someone who constantly wants to improve and, still only 21, seems worthy of what he proclaims to be: a dream-chaser, now desperate to make his bow at Theatre of Dreams.

As extraordinary as the sight of a 70-ton finback whale aboard a 76ft lorry would have been in 1950s England, the overriding memory, the thing that brings this strange story flooding back to those who were there, was the dreadful stench of sea mammal decomposing. \u201cIt smelled awful,\u201d says the artist Fiona Tan, who has been exploring this odd footnote in European natural history for her latest work, which opens at the Baltic in Gateshead in July. \u201cWhen I explained the project to a technician at the gallery, he said, \u2018I saw it as a kid. I\u2019m positive: I remember that smell.\u2019\u201d But to most people who gathered to gawp at Jonah the Whale as he trundled through Barnsley, Worcester and other British places seemingly impassable for a truck, the memory seems like a dream.  \u201cThe story of Jonah slipped through the cracks,\u201d says Tan. \u201cPeople didn\u2019t think it was important, so it didn\u2019t really get documented. I spoke to people who thought they had made it up, who were laughed at when they mentioned it. There\u2019s only been one small BBC radio programme about it, and one book.\u201d      The story began in Trondheim, Norway, in 1952. A mysterious and as yet unidentified organisation harpooned three fin whales off the Tr\u00f8ndelag coast. The whales were preserved \u201cin vast amounts of formaldehyde\u201d and placed on custom-built refrigerated lorries (said to be the largest in the world at the time) before they embarked on their 20-year odysseys across Europe. The three whales \u2013 Hercules, Goliath and Jonah \u2013 passed through various owners. Sometimes they were presented as \u201ceducational\u201d, sometimes as a freaky sideshow for a circus. For Tan, an Indonesian-born Australian artist who now lives in Amsterdam, the story of Jonah led on from an earlier piece of film footage she discovered while raiding the Netherlands film archive, EYE. \u201cI found this incredibly powerful, and very sad, film of whales being skinned. It\u2019s possibly 100 years old, and my guess is that it is in America, although it\u2019s unidentified.\u201d In the film, which will also be shown at Tan\u2019s Baltic show, a huge whale hangs from a hook in a harbour. \u201cA man with a scythe is splitting it open like he\u2019s done it a million times, like it\u2019s the most normal job in the world,\u201d says Tan. \u201cThe whales\u2019 innards are spilling out, and people are climbing on top to get the blubber off. One man even steps inside the whale.\u201d       It is a dystopian vision of the biblical Jonah, and Tan says it shows how far our attitudes to whales have come. \u201cWhen Melville was writing Moby Dick, whales were still monsters,\u201d she says. \u201cThey were the leviathan \u2013 a dark, unknown, devilish power. Today it is the exact opposite: we see them as these poor, sad, intelligent creatures on the edge of extinction.\u201d Once Tan read about Jonah the giant whale, she set off on her own journey, delving into natural history museums to find out more. \u201cI am very interested in the idea of collections,\u201d she says. (Her previous works include an imaginary museum curated by Marco Polo, shown at the 2009 Venice Biennale, and a film about John Soanes\u2019s museum full of antiquities in London.) \u201cWhat is a collection, and what is someone trying to tell me with it?\u201d wonders Tan. \u201cSome are huge \u2013 the Netherlands\u2019s natural history museum has 37m specimens.\u201d Thinking of Jonah preserved in formaldehyde and glared at by thousands, you are reminded of Damien Hirst and his dead creatures suspended in time. At the Baltic, Tan has built her own version of the 76ft lorry (\u201cquite a logistical challenge\u201d), which will fill the former grain silo. Invitations have been sent out, mocked up like an 18th-century newspaper advert, inviting spectators to come and see \u201cthe monster whale\u201d. But climb inside Tan\u2019s huge lorry and something isn\u2019t right \u2013 there is no whale. Instead, viewers will find 59 \u201cbeautiful glass models of sea anemones\u201d, which Tan has borrowed from a museum, as well as a \u201cmeditative\u201d video installation.       \u201cI didn\u2019t want to recreate that rather ridiculous event that happened in the 50s,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead, I want viewers to feel awe and curiosity, to think about Newcastle\u2019s forgotten history as a major whaling port, and remember how much we still don\u2019t know about whales.\u201d So what became of the real Jonah? Hercules made it as far as Spain, before the smell became too overpowering and he had to be disposed of. Goliath is thought to have ended up in Italy. Jonah, according to Steve Deput, author of the book The Barnsley Whale, ended up in cold storage in Belgium, but is rumoured to have been bought by a UK showman who plans to resurrect him.  Tan won\u2019t be rushing off to track him down, though. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen a whale, and I don\u2019t want to,\u201d she says adamantly. \u201cThis has been one of my strangest realisations. I want to hunt the whale in a different way, so that I don\u2019t catch it. I always want it to escape.\u201d  Fiona Tan\u2019s Depot is at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead, 10 July to 1 November.

Use sustainability as a unique selling pointConsumers are increasingly looking to buy ethically sourced, sustainable products, especially in the food sector. Brands should use their sustainability as a point of difference to encourage sales, argues Rich Clothier, managing director of Wyke Farms. 2. Think long termOne of the main cultural barriers across society is the focus on short-term key performance indicators (KPIs) and budgets. A sustainable business needs to encourage all those it works with to look at, and reward, long-term results. This idea is perhaps most apparent in the construction industry, where the perceived higher cost often blocks the creation of greener buildings. \u201cWhen looking at costs across the lifetime of a building, it really makes economic sense to build a green building,\u201d says Elaine Trimble, urban infrastructure economist at Siemens.  3. Communicate differentlyPeople become involved with sustainable businesses for a variety of reasons. For a graduate, it might be the interesting work or the higher purpose. For an investor, it might be the unique nature of the business and its growth potential. Sustainable businesses should, therefore, tailor the way they communicate with each group, depending on their interests. \u201cBe clear about what\u2019s important to each, and also what sort of language and approach will be most effective,\u201d says David Symons, director of sustainable consulting business WSP Group. 4. Embed sustainability throughout your organisationChanging organisational structures or creating roles, such as sustainability managers, might only act as a bolt-on, when a complete change in business culture and managerial priorities is needed. \u201cWe have tried to embed cultural change and responsibility at all levels of decision making,\u201d says Clothier, adding that sustainable thinking \u201cworks best when it is fully part of the business\u2019s strategic direction\u201d.   Related: How do we overcome the barriers to being a sustainable business?    5. Improve management skillsSymons says that sharing knowledge from the experts to every member of staff is one of the biggest challenges to achieving full sustainability. It is difficult, he says, to find the opportunity \u201cto give all our design teams a practical knowledge of our future world, so that they can design to it\u201d. Good management, however, could make this change happen. 6. Take risksMany sustainable businesses have taken risks by investing in systems and technologies that are not yet mainstream. While it is easier for new businesses to set up in a sector with more developed systems working and paying for themselves, it is much tougher for early adopters to raise the finance for relatively unproven technology. 7. Disrupt old business modelsFor Ramon Arratia, the sustainability director of flooring business Interface, true sustainability comes in the form of Tesla \u2013 the American automotive and energy storage company. Arthur Kay, the chief executive of bio-bean, agrees, saying that \u201cdisruption has the greatest impact when it interfaces with and improves existing infrastructure or attitudes\u201d. 8. NetworkThere are a number of regional initiatives, such as Venturefest in Bristol, that give smaller \u2013 and startup \u2013 companies the opportunities to meet, network with investors and establish like-minded and sustainability-orientated companies, says Mohammed Saddiq, managing director of GENeco.  \u201cThis extends to a number of countries in Europe,\u201d says Kay, citing Rockstart in Amsterdam. 9. Support other sustainable businessesMany businesses tell a pleasing sustainable story when they sell their own products, but they might not buy into the sustainability stories presented by other companies, says Arratia. While some stories can be greenwash, he says, sustainable businesses can support others like them by buying their products. \u201cContinuing to meet and share experiences even in tough times can inspire and encourage businesses to keep working towards their goals,\u201d said Alastair Fischbacher, chief executive, Sustainable Shipping Initiative. \u201cIt\u2019s important to keep sharing successes.\u201d", "sentences": ["\u201cThis extends to a number of countries in Europe,\u201d says Kay, citing Rockstart in Amsterdam."], "title": "Nine ways to overcome barriers to sustainable business", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2015/jul/08/nine-ways-to-overcome-barriers-to-sustainable-business", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Ethical and green living", "Ethical business", "Business", "Environment", "Green economy"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-07-08T14:57:12Z", "article": "1. Muscle Museum It would take three rereleases before Muscle Museum landed in the charts at No 25 in 2000. The slog to Top of the Pops is documented throughout debut album Showbiz, from playing the toilet circuit to the corporate shows mentioned on album opener Sunburn; \u201cI\u2019ll feel a guilty conscience grow,\u201d sang Matt Bellamy, although having disinfected every toilet in a West Country caravan site before becoming an international rock star, he needn\u2019t have felt too guilty. While ignored by the music press at first, Muse found a champion in Steve Lamacq on Radio 1, and in the unlikely guise of Madonna, who indirectly signed them to her Maverick label in the US (by indirectly, I mean she had nothing to do with it). They didn\u2019t last long with the record company, eventually ending up on EastWest in the US, but the superstar connection finally piqued the interest of UK publications and other labels keen to license Muse around the world. Taking its name from the two words that surround \u201cmuse\u201d in the dictionary, Bellamy wrote Muscle Museum around a quietly intricate and strangely enticing guitar line he came up with whilst on holiday in Greece. The octave-defying bass playing of Chris Wolstenholme and the sparse drumming of Dom Howard contrast against the emphatic build and chorus wig-out. In the same way that movie special effects or horror sequences lose their filmic impact over time, so the histrionics of the chorus now sound rather tame in light of where we now know Muse can go.   Related: Muse: 'We like pushing it as far as we can'    2. Falling Down The Devon trio had finally arrived, but unhelpful comparisons to Radiohead soon dogged them. It\u2019s fair to say Radiohead\u2019s influence was writ large throughout their debut, though it was Jeff Buckley, that secondary influence so prevalent during the 90s, that informs Falling Down. Fragile, sparing, and draped tenderly over a slow swinging 6/8, Bellamy shows uncharacteristic restraint throughout, his falsetto barely a whisper, following a tenderly picked guitar line sliding up and down the frets and yielding to the bends. Though musically it harks back to the sound of the blues spiritual, the lyrical theme might have been concerned with something closer to home, or even home itself. \u201cFifteen thousand people scream,\u201d references the people of their hometown, Teignmouth, and many of the lyrics concern the frustration and ennui of living in a provincial backwater. Wolstenholme said as much in an interview, calling Teignmouth a \u201cliving hell\u201d. The disgusted local mayor was then pictured on the cover of the South Devon Herald Express dropping a copy of Showbiz in the bin and quoted as saying: \u201cThousands of inner-city kids would have loved to have been brought up in a living hell like this.\u201d 3. Plug In Baby According to Mark Beaumont\u2019s Muse biography Out of This World, Plug In Baby didn\u2019t just arrive on any old evening, but on Millennium, and it was first outed at the Paradiso in Amsterdam. \u201cOut of the squall of feedback rose a snaking guitar riff,\u201d said Beaumont, \u201cwrithing up the neck of Matt Bellamy\u2019s guitar as if trying to wriggle clean out of the song.\u201d What \u201cmy plug-in baby crucifies my enemies\u201d actually means is open to conjecture, but that spiralling riff \u2013 with more than a nod to Bach\u2019s Toccata and Fugue in D Minor \u2013 connected with audiences in a way that nothing from Showbiz had. The first single from second album Origin of Symmetry, it signposted Muse forging their own distinct identity, the Radiohead comparisons gradually dissipating. Muse were now their own entity, spiritually and legally, which they proved when Celine Dion tried to use their moniker as the name of her Las Vegas show in 2002. The band, owning the worldwide performing rights to the name, flexed their muscles and forced her to desist.            4. New Born If people thought Plug In Baby was bombastic, then they\u2019d heard nothing yet. Some of the all-time great guitar riffs \u2013 or at least some of the most memorable (think Black Sabbath and Deep Purple) \u2013 utilise three or four notes, whereas New Born uses about 40 in quick succession. Not since Led Zeppelin\u2019s Black Dog had a guitarist shown such blatant disregard for the unwritten rules of rock, and yet despite this rejection of the orthodoxy, New Born is exhilaration itself for the six or so minutes it soars above its contemporaries. Come the second album, Bellamy had stopped bitching about the travails of living in the West Country, and had set out on course to eventually becoming the David Icke of Pop. \u201cIt\u2019s about a semi-fear of the evolution of technology, and how in reality it\u2019s destroying all humanity,\u201d he said of the song. \u201cMy fear is that we can\u2019t control it because it\u2019s moving faster than we are, so the song is setting myself in a location in the future where the body is no longer important and everyone\u2019s plugged into a network.\u201d  5. Time Is Running Out The swagger was no less pronounced come third album Absolution, the biggest difference now being that Muse, and especially Bellamy, had become politicised following the events of 9/11 and the 2003 invasion of Iraq, which was taking place during the writing and recording of the album. Certainly the lyrics aren\u2019t as overtly anti-establishment, conspiratorial or paranoid as they are on their latest album, Drones, but events had started to shape Bellamy\u2019s thinking . Though essentially a breakup song, Time Is Running Out alludes to Armageddon (the video is set in a futuristic Strangelovian war room), and though essentially a rock stomper, it was the most pop thing they\u2019d ever done; listen closely and you\u2019ll notice the verses aren\u2019t a million miles away from the Eurythmics\u2019 Who\u2019s That Girl. The public certainly liked it; Time Is Running Out scored Muse their first top 10 hit in the UK.        6. Butterflies and Hurricanes Latest album Drones does the listener a disservice by painting everything black and white. Littered as it is with the usual anti-Illuminati gibber and recorded speeches by JFK and so on, it\u2019s somehow beyond self-parody. Back in 2003 there was still hope, with beauty breaking through the misery in the shape of the neoclassical mini-masterpiece Butterflies and Hurricanes, Muse\u2019s most ambitious track to date. \u201cYou\u2019ve got be the best / You\u2019ve got to change the world,\u201d sings Bellamy over vertiginous arpeggios and a Eurobeat thud, before the whole thing comes crashing down thunderously and a 32-piece orchestra swoops in and picks it all up again. Just as one assumes the whole thing is drawing to its conclusion, Bellamy unleashes the most audacious piano movement, apparently written on the Steinways of the posh hotels they stayed in on tour. The story goes that the proper musicians drafted in for the recording \u2013 so often sniffy when called upon by rock musicians \u2013 were staggered when the virtuoso Bellamy suddenly unleashed his flamboyant pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance in the style of Rachmaninoff, with a bit of Liberace thrown in. 7. Knights of Cydonia  Even better still was to come \u2013 and maybe the best of Muse\u2019s entire oeuvre is Knights of Cydonia, which started life as a riff plucked away on a tour bus as Muse perambulated through the dust of the Arizona desert. If Ennio Morricone had been commissioned to soundtrack a western in space then it might well have sounded like this. Rather sweetly, too, there is a link to the past, with the sound of the opening guitar line surely referencing the Tornados\u2019 1962 smash Telstar, which featured one George Bellamy on rhythm guitar, father of Matt. Another six-minute epic, Knights of Cydonia\u2019s marriage of mariachi to metal mayhem is one made in heaven, or at least made in orbit, a galloping intergalactic romp with some Queen-style overdubbed vocals and some Dick Dale-style surf guitar thrown in for good measure. Awesome, in other words.            8. United States of Eurasia/Collateral Damage It\u2019s no surprise that George Orwell\u2019s 1984 has inspired songs by Muse, and United States of Eurasia is one. Said track is a two-parter, and the piece that sieges out of the triumphant arabesque ululations (Collateral Damage) is actually Nocturne in E-flat major by Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin. Muse are in fine company here, too \u2013 Serge Gainsbourg spent half his career coopting Chopin and passing it off as his own. Less well known is the influence of Zbigniew Brzezinski\u2019s The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives, which pitches the landmass of Europe and Asiaagainst American imperialism. Lyrically it\u2019s a hoot, though musically it\u2019s far more fun than the subject matter lets on. Muse were now old hands at the six-minute epic, but this sounds no less fresh for that fact.  9. Survival Although the Olympics opening ceremony for London 2012 threw up some musical surprises, in the shape of Fuck Buttons and Frank Turner, it was still a shock to learn Muse had been commissioned to tackle the official theme, especially as other associated brands included McDonald\u2019s, Coca-Cola and Rio Tinto. Epic is a word it\u2019s impossible not to keep repeating where Muse are concerned, though it\u2019s easy to feel the high campery \u2013 which borderlines the surreal at times during Survival \u2013 is also an epic pisstake. Perhaps best of all, it evokes the vision of athletes of various nations standing poised, flames aloft, ready for action; in other words, it captures the absurdity of coming together in one place from all over the world every four years in order to try to hop, skip and jump further than everybody else. Also, the guitar line in the middle sounds not unlike the theme from Terry Gilliam\u2019s Time Bandits, which may help you get the measure of where Matt Bellamy\u2019s mind was at the time.            10. Supremacy  The fifth Muse album, The Resistance, had for many been something of a misfire, and the Olympic association certainly brought out the cynics, but on album No 6, The 2nd Law, Muse proved to be back to their cataclysmic, apocalyptic best. Opener Supremacy manages to knit together musical extremes with a deft fluidity; one minute it evokes Led Zeppelin\u2019s Kashmir, the next Parisienne Walkways by Gary Moore. One minute it sounds like a French cop show, the next like a James Bond theme (a French Bond would surely be Inspector Clouseau). \u201cWake to see,\u201d sings Bellamy, \u201cyour true emancipation is a fantasy.\u201d He\u2019ll certainly not be diverted from his purpose, and it\u2019ll probably surprise few that Supremacy lacks subtlety in every conceivable way. Like most of Muse\u2019s work, it is symphonically pompous. It takes everything up to 11. It is the sonic equivalent of a Frank Gehry building, an Andrew Logan horse sculpture and the most ostentatious Cremaster Cycle of Matthew Barney\u2019s all rolled into one.

The rebels had been shooting down Ukrainian military planes in the area in the preceding days.\u201d  The terrible truth soon became clear as dazed residents of Petropavlovka and other villages surveyed the fields around them. The remains were from Malaysia Airlines flight MH17, which had apparently been shot out of the sky with a surface-to-air missile. All 298 people on the Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur flight died.  In the nearby fields, there were human remains: sometimes mangled limbs, sometimes intact bodies. There were also all the accoutrements of modern air travel strewn on the ground.   MH17 map   \u201cPeople started bringing letters, medicines, suitcases, all kinds of personal possessions. Many people just came to be here and talk, because they were scared to go home. There were pieces of plane, overhead panels, everything. It was awful,\u201d said Voloshina.  It took rescue workers several days to fill bags with the bodies: black for whole bodies and green for parts. The cleanup mission was complicated by the fact that the plane fell in territory controlled by the pro-Russia rebels, where Ukraine had lost its sovereignty. The crash site was never properly sealed off, and rumours spread of looting and interference at the scene.  A year later, there has been no conclusive proof of who was responsible, though most evidence points to separatist forces shooting down the plane by accident with a Buk missile system, possibly brought across the border from Russia. Messages appeared on social media from an account linked to the rebels saying they had shot down a Ukrainian plane, but were swiftly deleted. Russia has furiously denied accusations that pro-Moscow rebels were responsible. Russian media suggested the plane had been shot down by a Ukrainian fighter jet, and even produced witnesses who had supposedly seen the plane being tailed before being downed.     Armed pro-Russia separatists stand guard as monitors from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe and members of a Malaysian air crash investigation team inspect the crash site. Photograph: Maxim Zmeyev/Reuters    Mostly the pro-Russia forces denied ever having used a Buk, though one leader, Alexander Khodakovsky, told Reuters he believed the separatists had taken control of such a system from Russia. \u201cThat Buk I know about. I heard about it. I think they sent it back. Because I found out about it at exactly the moment that I found out that this tragedy had taken place,\u201d he said last summer. In an interview with the Guardian in Donetsk last week, he was more circumspect. \u201cThere was all the fuss about the Buks which were maybe there or maybe weren\u2019t there, but honestly I can\u2019t say anything with clarity because I didn\u2019t see anything and didn\u2019t hear anything. Recently, in order to stop any insinuations, I have tried not to talk about that theme.\u201d The head of the self-proclaimed Donetsk People\u2019s Republic was more blunt. \u201cI have said several times that we did not shoot down the Boeing,\u201d said Alexander Zakharchenko from his office in central Donetsk. \u201cWe never had this kind of missile system. The Ukrainian army had a Buk. And so with a calm conscience we will happily receive any mission that wants to look into it.\u201d But Khodakovsky pointed out that the rebels last summer were still made up of several disparate groups with no central command. \u201cAt that time it was chaotic here. One division didn\u2019t know what the others were doing. We were sitting here and were responsible for our tasks; those who were elsewhere had other tasks,\u201d he said. Exactly who was controlling the Buk remains a mystery, although there is some evidence it came from across the border and may have been manned by a Russian crew. In the days after the crash, the Ukrainian security service released what it said were phone taps that implicated a number of separatist leaders, including Igor \u201cthe Demon\u201d Bezler, who ran the town of Gorlovka at the time but has now left the region. An attempt by the Guardian to question Bezler ended with him threatening to kill the interviewer, but one of his former prisoners said Bezler could not have shot down the plane.     People walk among the plane wreckage near the village of Grabovo. A clean-up of the site only became possible in March, after a ceasefire in eastern Ukraine was signed in February. Photograph: Dmitry Lovetsky/AP    \u201cThe recording they released was about another plane. I was there when he was talking about it,\u201d said Vasyl Budik, during a recent interview in the town of Slavyansk, where he works as an adviser to Ukraine\u2019s defence ministry. He spent three months last summer as a prisoner of Bezler in Gorlovka. \u201cWhen he was told about the passenger plane later, he was going crazy; he understood that there would be major consequences for the rebels. But Bezler had nothing to do with it. He couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d In Moscow, amid public denials of involvement, diplomats scrambled to establish what had happened. A diplomatic source in Moscow said scheduled liaison meetings with counterparts in the Russian foreign ministry were held as planned all last year, with the exception of the week after the MH17 incident. It was almost as though the Russians wanted to get their story straight before meeting foreign officials, the diplomat said. On 29 July, 12 days after the incident, an intriguing column appeared in the Kommersant newspaper by the long-time Kremlin pool correspondent Andrei Kolesnikov. With its odd tone purporting to read Vladimir Putin\u2019s mind, it read like no other piece he had ever written.           Archive news report from July 2014: Witnesses describe the scene     \u201cIf at the end of the day it turns out that the rebels really were responsible for this, this will radically change his attitudes to them,\u201d wrote Kolesnikov, in what appeared to be a carefully calibrated transmission of a message he had been asked to put across. \u201cEven if it turns out to be a fateful mistake. Innocent dead children \u2026 this would be a red line for him he could not cross. To cover up for those who did this knowing that they did it. No, this is a sin he could not countenance \u2026 Our policy of relations with the resistance fighters would be rethought once and for all. Vladimir Putin would ditch them.\u201d That is not what happened, however. Instead, in the weeks after the tragedy, Russian involvement in east Ukraine appeared to intensify. In mid-August, the Guardian witnessed a convoy of armoured vehicles crossing the border under cover of night; shortly after, a group of paratroopers were captured by the Ukrainians (Russia said they had \u201cgot lost\u201d), and in late August came the battle of Ilovaisk, where regular Russian soldiers are believed to have taken part, despite Moscow\u2019s denials. The Dutch-led investigation into the crash has proceeded slowly, with a full report not expected until October. The investigators are believed to have concluded that the plane was indeed shot down by a Buk missile. Perhaps in an attempt to pre-empt this, the version of a Ukrainian fighter jet has been ditched by Russian media and a press conference was recently held in Moscow by the manufacturers of Buk systems, Almaz-Antey, in which they claimed investigations showed the plane had been hit by a Buk missile system that only Ukraine possesses. Other investigations, such as by the citizen blogging team Bellingcat, have suggested the Buk came from Russia, and was operated by a Russian military crew. There has been talk in the Netherlands and Malaysia about an international tribunal to establish criminal responsibility for the shooting down of MH17.     Passengers\u2019 belongings at the crash site. Photograph: Maxim Zmeyev/Reuters    \u201cNo route is 100% perfect, but this is the route that is by far the most preferred,\u201d the Dutch prime minister, Mark Rutte, said last week. \u201cWe also have plan Bs if this approach doesn\u2019t work, both national and international, but this is the route that would be the best. And that\u2019s why we are exploring that possibility first of all.\u201d Russia, however, has described the idea of a tribunal as premature. This week, the deputy foreign minister Gennady Gatilov tweeted: \u201cRussia opposed to a #MH17 tribunal as politically illogical, unnecessary and complicated to create.\u201d On the ground, most of the debris has been cleaned up. In the village of Grabovo, where many of the remains of MH17 fell, and where even a few months ago pieces of the plane\u2019s exterior could still be found scattered in the fields, everything has been cleared away. There is little sign of the horror of a year ago, although villagers occasionally turn up personal possessions in the field. A proper clean-up of the plane wreckage only became possible in March, after a shaky ceasefire was signed in Minsk in February. Residents helped collect fragments and belongings from the crash, and in April a Dutch mission arrived to take away everything that had been collected in a big truck, paying residents for their time. M\u00e9decins sans Fronti\u00e8res sent a psychologist to work with the children of the village. Even now, walking in the fields is not safe: just a few weeks ago in a neighbouring village, a six-year-old boy was killed by a mine. At the spot where much of the wreckage lay, a small makeshift memorial has been created with a few bedraggled children\u2019s toys and some candles laid on the ground. A placard is mounted on the nearby electricity pylon, bearing a poem in handwritten red block letters: \u201cPause and pray / Feel the minutes pass / Here fell the Boeing / And in a terrible moment / Their lives were taken.\u201d The rebel leader Zakharchenko said he did not know whether there were any events planned to mark the one-year anniversary. \u201cWhy are you asking us? Ask the Netherlands. If they want to do anything we\u2019ll guarantee their safety,\u201d he said. Voloshina, the mayor of Petropavlovka, said the father of a Dutch victim had visited the area in early June, and had taken soil from the fields in which MH17 had crashed to keep as a memory.

Most notably and recently, James Murphy continued his eclectic series of post-LCD Soundsystem ventures with the opening of a wine bar, The Four Horsemen in Williamsburg, which has been met equally with acclaim and groan-worthy All His Friends puns. Meanwhile, in Queens, Justin Carter and Eamon Harkin, already beloved in New York for their long-running Mister Saturday and Mister Sunday parties, have taken the laid-back and local aesthetic they\u2019ve established on their dance floors, and applied it to a new bar, Nowadays.        Related: Mister Saturday Night's favourite tracks    Located next to a freight railroad, its design is reminiscent of their breezy party spaces, lined with trees, littered with picnic tables and romantically illuminated with strings of hanging bulbs. It is certainly an appealing prospect through the dog days of summer. Meanwhile, Carter and Harkin\u2019s Mister Sunday parties will continue for this year at its Industry City spot in Brooklyn each weekend until September, but they hope to switch locations to their bar over the next few years. The sound of a Mister DJ set ranges from obscure acid house to classic hip hop and soul, all delivered in a straight-up club style. The pair are two of the most accommodating hosts you could hope to meet, and the only thing rolling at Nowadays is the lawn, but is artisan food ever a little too polite for the edge of the rave? \u201cWe need [Nowadays] to be something that survives outside of the club world, so when we eventually add Mister Sunday to it, it already has its own identity as a nice place to hang out,\u201d explains Carter, who stresses the pair never solely wanted to open a club space.  \u201cHow can we make this feel right for us, for where we live and what\u2019s going on in New York right now? New York isn\u2019t Berlin, and it\u2019s not the 90s anymore.

Midnight Marauding: Nowadays at night Photograph: Natalie Keyssar    Music remains the focus, however, with the duo digging deep in their crates and digitalising their extensive vinyl record collection to soundtrack the bar, even generously giving staff the chance to play DJ and choose whatever artist they wish to help draw the night in. And while other establishments spend thousands of dollars curating bespoke, mood setting Spotify playlists, Carter and Harkin are simply letting many of their favourite albums play in their entirety, just as their creators had intended. \u201cWe think that Nowadays is the sort of place where people are going to want to hang out for a long time, and when you\u2019re playing a full album, it let\u2019s you live in an artist\u2019s world for more than just a couple minutes,\u201d explains Carter, who has heard that Murphy incidentally has the same idea at his Williamsburg hang.  \u201cEven if we\u2019re playing an album with some hits on it, it\u2019s within the context of a larger album. Even if it\u2019s a hit record \u2013 listening to Off The Wall in its entirety is totally different to just listening to Get On The Floor, then moving on to some other song. Listening to the whole album extends the moment.\u201d     Dinner with DJ Seth Troxler in Glastonbury Photograph: Kate Hutchinson for the Guardian    Elsewhere, the outspoken (and often naked) DJ, Seth Troxler prides himself equally on his sense of humour and cooking. And while the former divides opinion, pretty much anyone with access to a set of tastebuds is all for his meat driven Smokey Tails venture, which alongside Lionel Richie, was arguably the sleeper hit of this year\u2019s Glastonbury festival.

On Thursday, he became the first African rider to wear the coveted King of the Mountains jersey in the Tour de France, racing as part of the first African team to compete in it, MTN-Qhubeka.  For weeks now, the term \u201cmaking history\u201d has been following this impossibly tall, softly spoken Eritrean cyclist around. Along with his team-mate, Merhawi Kudus who, at 21, is the youngest tour rider this year, he is the first black African to compete in the world\u2019s biggest bike race.  Born in a market town not far from the capital city of Asmara, Teklehaimanot explained on a sweltering day in Amsterdam, at the team\u2019s official presentation before the start of the race in Utrecht, how cycling was in his blood. \u201cI first started cycling at home, a long time ago. There are many cyclists in Eritrea, the people love it, it\u2019s really popular,\u201d he said.     The geography is a main part of why we\u2019re so good, but we also just work hard  Daniel Teklehaimanot     Bicycles were brought to the country in the 19th century by Italian colonisers, who soon established the Primo Giro dell\u2019Eritrea in 1946, named after another of the world\u2019s longest-running and most prestigious races, the Giro d\u2019Italia. \u201cWhen I was 10 or 11 I started riding my bike. When I grew up a bit, around 16, I always watched the tour on Eritrean TV, and when I became a good rider, I started dreaming that one day I could make it.\u201d And the 26-year-old has: in June, Teklehaimanot won the polka-dotted King of the Mountains jersey at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9, taken to be a marker of who to watch in the Tour de France. Chris Froome, the Kenyan-born Team Sky rider and former Tour winner, raced to victory there too.     Daniel Teklehaimanot with Europcar rider Perrig Quemeneur and Cofidis\u2019s Kenneth Van Bilsen during Wednesday\u2019s breakaway. Photograph: Eric Gaillard/Reuters    But perhaps none of this should come as a surprise. Eritrea is gripped by a fanatical love for the sport. Bicycles are everywhere in the capital, and racing has become known as the country\u2019s \u201cunofficial fifth state-sanctioned religion\u201d. Five-time Tour de France winner Bernard Hinault has predicted that the east African nation\u2019s riders \u201care the next Colombians\u201d.  Sitting 2,325 metres above sea level, at the tip of an escarpment of the Great Rift Valley, Eritrea breeds strong cyclists. \u201cThe geography is a main part of why we\u2019re so good,\u201d Teklehaimanot said, \u201cbut we also just work hard. \u201cWhen I was young, around 2005 and 2006, and I watched [the tour on] TV, me and my friends talked a lot about the bikes, the wheels \u2013 but we didn\u2019t really know how they are racing. So now I\u2019m really excited to be a part of that same race,\u201d he said.  It has been a long journey for the Eritrean. In 2010, he started catching the attention of European teams when he came first in the African Championship road race, won the individual and team time trials, and came first overall in the Tour of Rwanda. But Teklehaimanot\u2019s entry to World Tour cycling was blighted by recurring visa problems, which sabotaged his chances to compete at the highest level with his team at the time, Orica-GreenEdge.  \u201cThere are so many African riders \u2013 from Eritrea, South Africa and Rwanda \u2013 but it\u2019s not easy to become a part of the big teams. We have to work hard, so I\u2019m thankful for MTN-Qhubeka,\u201d he explained.  Kudus said he felt the same. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy when you come from Africa. There should be more invitations, and more opportunity. Especially for places like Rwanda, where riders are becoming better and better. But we need more opportunities \u2013 it\u2019s more difficult to get to Europe for us.\u201d     Teklehaimanot (centre) with Kudus at the start of the first stage of the Tour de France in Utrecht.    Recognition and respect In what has historically been a predominantly white, European and exclusive sport, the inclusion of black riders is still, lamentably, a novelty. \u201cI hope this is the beginning of a shift,\u201d said MTN\u2019s Scottish team manager, Brian Smith, adding that there was not enough respect for black riders in the peloton. \u201cYou look at long-distance running, it\u2019s all Africans now. You just need one racer to break through, and it makes others realise they can do it too. It\u2019s the same here. We don\u2019t see enough black cyclists.\u201d Though little could mar Teklehaimanot\u2019s win on Thursday, a racism row surrounding another of MTN\u2019s Eritrean riders, Natnael Berhane, has exposed the serious racial politics that hang over professional cycling.  At the Tour of Austria, which runs in tandem with the Tour de France, MTN\u2019s management are said to have appealed to the UCI, cycling\u2019s governing body, to have the Belarusian rider Branislau Samoilau expelled from the race for racial abuse.  The team\u2019s principal, Douglas Ryder, said: \u201cOne of the riders from another team said to Natnael Berhane: \u2018Get out of the way you effing n*****\u2019. Just outrageous.\u201d    I\u2019ve told them: go show the world what you can do  Brian Smith, team manager     By way of apology, Samoilau has reportedly paid a month\u2019s salary to the Qhubeka foundation, a charity that helps provide Africans with bicycles, although no official statement has been released.  Smith said MTN frequently battled prejudice, but that the peloton was slowly learning to respect the talent of the African team, and recognise their right to contest at the front of the race. \u201cLots of test teams are trying to globalise the sport, and Africa is an untapped entity. Daniel was the trailblazer, that\u2019s why there are so many [Eritreans] coming through now,\u201d he said.      Kudus, left, and Teklehaimanot at the start of stage two of the Tour de France. Photograph: Doug Pensinger/Getty Images     \u201cAlthough we\u2019ve got foreign people on the team [American Tyler Farrar and Norwegian rider Edvald Boasson Hagen, among others], this is an African team. We want African riders. We want to make sure this team is where all the African talented riders come to perform. Not to be a development team \u2013 we want to keep the cream of the crop.\u201d Last month, Teklehaimanot and Kudus returned to Eritrea to compete in the national championships. In the infamously closed-off country \u2013 better known for dire human rights records and contributing to Europe\u2019s growing migrant crisis \u2013 the two riders are stars.     I\u2019m really proud to be an Eritrean riding. It\u2019s big for me, for the team also. I\u2019m really happy  Daniel Teklehaimanot     \u201cThere was a big welcome for us. After the nationals, the government wished us good luck for the tour. We met the president, Isaias Afwerki, in his office. It was a big moment for us,\u201d Teklehaimanot said.  Afwerki has been in office since independence from Ethiopia in 1993, and no national elections have been held in this time. While Eritrean footballer players are notorious for using international matches as an opportunity to escape and seek asylum, the cyclists say they are proud of their country\u2019s support. \u201cThey are really supportive, the president too, we got lots of media attention \u2013 everyone is watching us,\u201d said Kudus. At this Tour de France, soon to enter its second week and enter the brutal mountain stages, Smith said the Eritreans were hoping for further glory. \u201cI want to give them the opportunity to try to win in one or two stages,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got no general classification hopes, no big sprint hopes, so it\u2019s save energy and grab a stage. I\u2019ve told them both: go show the world what you can do.\u201d For Teklehaimanot, there\u2019s no doubt this is his moment: \u201cMy family are waiting for the tour, they\u2019ll be watching on television, and my wife is coming to Paris [for the final stage]. I\u2019m really proud to be an Eritrean riding. It\u2019s big for me, for the team also.

According to the National United States History Content Standards for Grades 5 -12, the only time content teaching requirements about African Americans show up is when discussing slavery, the Civil War and the Civil Rights Movement, treating the black experience as a separate entity \u2013 only worth noting in climatic moments of social change.  But to give kids a fighting chance of living in a more equitable society, we have to change the way we teach them. Students shouldn\u2019t have to ask me, Where are the black people the rest of the time? In my own classroom, I added lessons about Great Migration and the Harlem Renaissance, but that wasn\u2019t enough. Black Caribbean immigrants did come through Ellis Island. Black cowboys did run huge cattle ranches in the west. Free blacks in New Amsterdam did own property \u2013 and they did vote like all other land-owning men. They were allowed to bear arms. These facts mattered to both my black and white students alike, and most kids their age probably weren\u2019t hearing them. We need to broaden what is considered important to impart to our students so that the default history of America isn\u2019t a white, male one \u2013 a view reflected in the racially-biased policing, violent hate crimes and the absurd resistance to permanently bringing down the Confederate flag, which all plays out beyond the classroom daily. Revising our vision of what constitutes \u201cblack history\u201d is especially crucial now; in 2012, 50% of American children born were minorities. It\u2019s time to stop propagating the myth of a white America as the only true and dominant one of our past and present.  Teachers are going to ask: what about state exams that students need to pass to keep schools accredited? How can we incorporate more information and still teach the content the tests ask of us? But making history more inclusive isn\u2019t in radical opposition to testing standards, especially as we shift to the new Common Core curriculum that emphasizes skill-building over content.  We teach about the 13 colonies anyway; we should include information about the first hero of the American Revolution, a black man, Crispus Attucks. We teach about Ellis Island already \u2013 we should incorporate the stories of the black immigrants who chose to come here. We teach about the Great Depression, but the photographs, songs and diary entries seldom include African Americans. And their absence reinforces the idea that white stories are the story. Every year schools, websites and publishers make choices about how to update this material anyway, and building a more complete vision of our history should be at the forefront of their priorities. Puerto Rican, Asian and female American students all sense the absence of their cultural identities too. But by creating stronger and more inclusive materials, a richer picture of history can emerge. Otherwise, we are privileging a strictly white history peppered by \u201cminority\u201d movements \u2013 and that is a very incomplete picture of America.", "sentences": ["Where did the free black men in New Amsterdam live?", "Free blacks in New Amsterdam did own property \u2013 and they did vote like all other land-owning men."], "title": "Black history is bigger than slavery.

Inside the vessel, a sharp rectangular prism, there\u2019s a trio of spaces: a kitchen, a lounge (there\u2019s a second double bed here) and a bedroom with bathroom \u2013 all fitted out in high-spec minimalism (the kitchen and floor are made from poured concrete).

Appropriately nicknamed \u201cSturdy\u201d, the boat has also been designed with nitpickers in mind: the king-size beds are from Loaf, linen is from The White Company, and high chairs, cots and games mean young guests are catered for, as well as older ones.

This week he can be found in Studio 3, an arts centre in Barking, as part of a three-week residency held by the non-profit mental health arts organisation Mental Spaghetti. The workshops are free, and open to all, mental health service users and non-users alike, and will cover everything from making fanzines to plaster sculpture and woodcut printing. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance for people to make friends, build up confidence, and find skills that maybe they didn\u2019t have before,\u201d explains Marie-Louise Plum, a multidisciplinary artist and founder of Mental Spaghetti. \u201cAlso it can be a big social thing, for people who maybe don\u2019t get out much. We\u2019ve now got people who\u2019ve attended our workshops holding their own workshops. It can really bring people out of their shells.\u201d She recalls one attendee at Hegley\u2019s last workshop \u201cthis sweet, reclusive old man who\u2019d never been to a creative workshop before, and by the end of the day he\u2019d illustrated a booklet and written a poem and read it out to the group \u2013 30 of us. And then he sang, unprompted, in front of everyone.\u201d Plum began Mental Spaghetti in 2008 as a personal blog, a place to write about her own therapy sessions. \u201cThere was this trend for writing about mental health issues online,\u201d she recalls. \u201cBut then in 2011, I realised that by writing these confessional blogs you get entrenched and bogged down, and I wanted to make it something helpful rather than wallowing.\u201d     \u2018Flights of (fondant) fancies.\u2019 Drawing a way back to happy ... notebook at Mental Spaghetti Photograph: pr    She began by putting other artists\u2019 work on the site, and gradually evolved the blog into an organisation that helps artists with mental-health issues get their work more widely seen \u2013 organising exhibitions, designing websites and promoting their work. Since then, she has taken part in the Amsterdam urban arts festival, the Scottish mental health arts and film festival and been invited to Bournemouth University media department to talk about mental health in the media. Many of the workshop exercises focus on mindfulness, which was the official theme for this year\u2019s Mental Health Awareness Week. Mindfulness, Plum concedes, \u201chas been bandied around a bit and got a bit bourgeois \u2013 people think it\u2019s going to be airy fairy, a product you can buy or a \u2018mindfulness centre\u2019 you can go to, when actually it\u2019s a lot simpler than it sounds. It\u2019s about practical steps you can take to feel better.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d adds Hegley. \u201cAs an example of this sort of thing \u2013 you two would probably be happier if you were in the sun,\u201d he says, looking at us shivering slightly in the shade. \u201cI can\u2019t say it simpler than that. And that\u2019s what a workshop leader does \u2013 say \u2018wouldn\u2019t you be better off in the sun?\u2019.\u201d The Barking residency is part of a larger project to take Mental Spaghetti on the road, beginning a few weeks ago in London\u2019s Kentish Town, and with the next stop Colchester, where they will be taking over an empty shop in the town centre to hold two weeks of free workshops and exhibitions, involving local charities and students from the nearby Colchester Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s important that Mental Spaghetti is a big network,\u201d she explains \u2013 the aim, after all, is to unite marginalised members of society and local communities through creativity, welcoming everyone from the complete novice to the established artist. Plum hopes the tour will replicate the success she had in Walthamstow, east London, where she set up an atelier space with other artists from the Slade, and held free art workshops for the local community. \u201cIt was an ongoing thing, where you could just wander in and experiment and get involved in printing or screenprinting, making collages, making sculptures,\u201d she says. \u201cWe got lots of people, from all sorts of backgrounds, all ages. People would see there was something going on, on the high street and come in and get involved. And because it was so flexible you could just say \u2018Have you ever made something out of plaster before? D\u2019you want to have a go?\u2019\u201d \u201cI think the point with a workshops is always not to make it too scary,\u201d she continues. \u201cI did a project a couple of weeks ago with a homeless charity, and I took a large picture of Hieronymus Bosch\u2019s Garden of Earthly Delights and we wrote haiku about it. When you say to someone the words \u2018creative writing workshop\u2019 they immediately think: \u2018No, I can\u2019t write, I don\u2019t want to do it.\u2019 So then I explain a bit: I say, \u2018if your writing\u2019s not great you can draw.\u2019 You have to work around people and their abilities.\u201d     Finding art to relate to ... The Garden of Earthly Delights by Hieronymus Bosch, c.1500.  Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis    Mental Spaghetti is not, Plum stresses, involved with art therapy. \u201cI don\u2019t want to ask questions,\u201d she says. \u201cI just want them to have a nice time.\u201d But she recognises the benefits for mental health service users in taking part in these workshops, as well as in seeing their work exhibited. \u201cIndividuals do write to me say things like they can express themselves easily through art,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been in therapy myself, and for me art is always a way to offload things, and not really have to talk about them. So I\u2019ll make a really hideous picture, and not really want to talk about it, but someone else can see it and in that way I\u2019m telling someone else that\u2019s what\u2019s going on.\u201d She has reservations, however, about some of the reverence that can hover over art created by those with mental health issues. \u201cThe relationship between mental health, art, mercurial personalities, creativity, has always been of interest to people,\u201d she says, \u201cbut I think it\u2019s become quite a trendy topic recently - the whole outsider art, and artists with mental health issues thing.\u201d She points to the Wellcome Collection\u2019s recent outsider art exhibition as an example. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit contentious,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve heard people say recently that mental health\u2019s really sexy, and I think some gallerists and agents, for good or bad, have picked up on it.\u201d The problem, she feels is both that the artists themselves are perhaps not profiting as much from the sales as they ought to be, and that it can help \u201cglamorise being unwell \u2026 But it\u2019s quite a difficult one to talk about.\u201d But the relationship between art and mental health does remain an interesting one, worthy of exploration, and its discussion often helpful to those with similar experiences. Plum talks of the performance artist Bobby Baker, with whom she sometimes works, and who documented her stay at Highgate Mental Health Centre in diary drawings that were on display at the Wellcome Gallery, and in lightboxes in Dalston Square, London.           Video: Bobbi Brown talks about exploring her illness through art    She also mentions Karen Sorensen, who wrote an essay for the Mental Spaghetti website about limiting her medication and the effect it had on her painting.  Plum enlisted Hegley after attending a night he staged at a pub in Clerkenwell. \u201cJohn puts people at ease,\u201d she says. \u201cThe reason I wanted him to do it was I knew it would be a singing, poetry performance, knees-up thing, and I knew it would get everyone involved.\u201d \u201cOr not get involved,\u201d adds Hegley. \u201cIf you want to come along to a workshop and just listen, that\u2019s important too. It\u2019s a bit like an escalator, so people think: \u2018Oh, I can just jump on here.\u2019\u201d He hesitates and smiles. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit of a confused metaphor because people can\u2019t walk onto an escalator because there\u2019s normally a barrier. But I get rid of the barriers so people can just walk onto the escalator.\u201d  The Mental Spaghetti Roadshow at Studio 3 Arts, Barking, London, continues until 24 July ", "sentences": ["Since then, she has taken part in the Amsterdam urban arts festival, the Scottish mental health arts and film festival and been invited to Bournemouth University media department to talk about mental health in the media."], "title": "Creating happy: the arts organisation coming to your high street", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2015/jul/10/mental-spaghetti-art-mental-health-john-hegley", "tags": ["Culture", "Art", "Mental health", "Art and design", "Music", "Painting", "Creative writing", "Society", "Education", "Health"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-07-11T08:00:08Z", "article": "  Related: Skrillex and Four Tet review \u2013 unlikely duo channel early-rave spontaneity    In a bijou cafe near King\u2019s Cross, Kieran Hebden sits under a meteorite-sized glitter ball, sipping at a ginger beer and looking uncommonly relaxed. Yesterday morning he suddenly released Morning/Evening \u2013 his new album as Four Tet and his first in two years \u2013 on Bandcamp. There was no press hype and no marketing campaign. Many musicians would now be fretting about critical reception, midweek chart positions, the haters. But with Hebden, you just sense a come-what-may acceptance. \u201cOne thing about running everything myself is that everything is flexible,\u201d he says of his decision to casually put his album online. \u201cA few days ago I was like, it\u2019s the summer solstice, a lovely day \u2013 this is perfect.\u201d Hebden hasn\u2019t done an interview for over a year, but he\u2019s hardly guarded: on the contrary, our two-hour conversation feels as if he\u2019s trying to compress 18 months of thoughts about music, life and the universe into my recorder. He\u2019s one of the UK\u2019s most dedicated club DJs, capable of holding a room in sweaty excelsis for eight hours without pause. As a musician, meanwhile, he channels his influences \u2013 cosmic jazz, techno, psychedelia, new age music \u2013 into records that feel uplifting and organic, full of warmth and light, intricately woven together from a vast \u201csound diary\u201d of samples (he has 700 bass drum sounds alone). Making music, he says, is therapeutic: \u201cI want to be able to look back when I\u2019m an old man and have these records tell a story.\u201d     Digital mystic: Kieran Hebden aka Four Tet. Photograph: Stephanie Sian Smith for the Guide    After releasing his first album, Dialogue, in 1999, Hebden played the music industry game for a decade: regular albums, frequent touring, press campaigns. He recalls \u201cdays of phoners, like: \u2018Do you have a message for your fans in Brazil?\u2019 You spent 90% of your energy trying to reach out to this casual audience who might buy your records; that\u2019s what the record company\u2019s efforts go into, pushing it beyond its ordinary scope.\u201d In the end, he just thought: \u201cWho cares about this? It\u2019s inefficient.\u201d    Unless I can speak to God through my laptop, I\u2019m never going to make a great record    So, following 2010\u2019s There Is Love In You, Hebden made the decision to simplify his affairs. He concentrated on DJing, collaborating with myriad musicians (Jamie xx, Roots Manuva, Atlanta rapper Rome Fortune and the Syrian dabke musician Omar Souleyman in 2015 alone) and making 12-inch records for a loyal fanbase who clear them out on the day of release. \u201cI was thinking: \u2018What it would be like if I eliminate all those things that get in the way of what I\u2019m really trying to do, which is make music and hang out with my child?\u2019 I decided no more record label, no more press people. I started abandoning things and feeling very zen about it.\u201d The physical version of Morning/Evening will be released on Hebden\u2019s own label, Text \u2013 and if you\u2019re looking for a word to describe it, \u201czen\u201d feels appropriate. It is separated into two sides, Morning and Evening, each running to around 20 minutes in length, and encompassing bumping kickdrums, glowing synths and the voice of Indian soundtrack singer Lata Mangeshkar. Hebden is half-Indian on his mother\u2019s side and for the first time, he says, his music finds him considering his roots. The influences that underpin Morning/Evening come from a collection of movie soundtracks and devotional music owned by his late grandfather. A young Hebden inherited the records when he died. \u201cI put them all away on a shelf,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t think I even listened to them.\u201d       In 2013, while Hebden was making the album Beautiful Rewind, his grandma passed away. \u201cIt felt like that connection to my Indian family started to fade,\u201d he says. So he dug out his grandfather\u2019s records and found himself obsessed. \u201cI think I never got round to hearing the Indian music that really appealed to me. I heard a lot of bhangra records, or those Bollywood records for the obscure funk tracks. But the blissed-out cosmic stuff \u2013 it\u2019s ooh, like, that\u2019s for me.\u201d He particularly latched on to Mangeshkar, known as \u201cthe Nightingale of India\u201d. He begun toying with her voice, sampling and manipulating it so it advances and recedes like waves lapping on a beach. \u201cSuddenly it came to me: I see an album in this.\u201d He worked on it for months, little sections at a time, until he was content. \u201cI wanted it to have this undercurrent of techno, and the loudest drums, the hardest groove to come in in the last four minutes. It ends it in the club, because that\u2019s my world now.\u201d    I\u2019ll put out a track that borders on techno and people will be like: \u2018What the hell\u2019s this?'    This is always the way Hebden has worked: fixating on aspects of music he loves, and making them his own. Debuting as Four Tet in 1998 with the jazzy 36-minute single Thirtysixtwentyfive, he made a brace of dreamy, downtempo electronica records such as 2003\u2019s Rounds and 2005\u2019s Everything Ecstatic that found their way into record collections worldwide. The press, latching on to Hebden\u2019s organic productions and sampling of acoustic instruments, dubbed his sound \u201cfolktronica\u201d, a term Hebden mentions today with a shudder. Perhaps he even started to resent his own music, because after his biggest show to date at Hammersmith Palais in 2005, he wondered if Four Tet was done. \u201cBut instead of being like: \u2018Oh, maybe we can do Brixton Academy, get a lightshow,\u2019 my feeling was: \u2018I\u2019ve said what I need to say.\u2019\u201d It was then that he decided to switch up his sound. \u201cI\u2019m quite committed to moving on,\u201d he says. \u201cI have people coming back like: \u2018I\u2019m sad it doesn\u2019t sound like Rounds.\u2019 That was 13, 14 years ago. I\u2019ll put out a track that borders on techno and people will be like: \u2018What the hell\u2019s this? What happened to folktronica?\u2019\u201d            Hebden found his new direction in London\u2019s club scene, although his route there came through his friendship with two unlikely figures. The first was Steve Reid, a jazz drummer in his 60s who\u2019d played with James Brown and Sun Ra. A mutual friend introduced them and, despite a four-decade age gap, they hit it off, going on to make four records together in three years \u2013 Reid on drums, Hebden improvising on electronics. Reid died of cancer in 2010 but the impression he left was permanent. \u201cHe\u2019d often have this pulse going underneath things, always speeding the music up from where I might have it\u2026 he got me addicted to that tempo.\u201d The second was Timo Maas, a slightly uncool progressive house producer who scored a UK Top 10 in 2000 with his remix of Azzido Da Bass\u2019s Dooms Night. Maas invited Hebden to join him as resident DJ at central London club The End in 2006. At the time, Hebden felt distanced from dance music. He\u2019d been a clubber around 2000, when UK garage was big (\u201cThe ideal mix; very pop and very experimental, both at once\u201d). But he couldn\u2019t get into grime \u2013 too aggro \u2013 and when dubstep replaced garage\u2019s bright bling with gloomy atmospherics, Hebden\u2019s interest waned. Still, Maas\u2019s invitation intrigued him. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why a lot of the best DJs are the oldest. They\u2019ve experienced every club, they know how to work an audience, to run a sound system, they\u2019re brilliant at it. You go to see Richie Hawtin or Jeff Mills, and maybe the music isn\u2019t as cutting-edge as it was, but in the moment they\u2019re on another level.\u201d At first it didn\u2019t go well. \u201cAt the beginning I kept emptying the room,\u201d he recalls. \u201cBut by the end of the residency I could hold it, eight hours, all night.\u201d And so he stayed on, sharing the residency with his friend, the DJ-producer James Holden. \u201cAnd by the end I was headlining the main room, peak time.\u201d He beams, triumphant: \u201cI\u2019d gone from not knowing what I was doing to being able to go, here I am, I\u2019m going to smash it.\u201d     Knights of the turntable: Four Tet DJs with Skrillex at Camden Underworld.  Photograph: Alicia Canter for The Guardian    These days, Hebden loves playing in clubs. Once his parents introduced him to amazing music; now he takes them out to his DJ sets, his mother and godmother joining him in the booth at Trouw in Amsterdam till 7.30am. In April, after linking up via Twitter, he played a back-to-back set with EDM superstar Skrillex in Camden Town. Of course, it went off, even though at one point Skrillex dropped the theme from The Lion King.  That night he did for fun, but Hebden\u2019s tirelessly committed to supporting a more serious club culture, too. He keeps tickets to his all-nighters purposefully low instead of at inflated prices. And when he heard that Shoreditch club Plastic People was closing at the start of this year, he went straight from playing four New Year\u2019s Eve gigs up and down the country with his friend Caribou \u2013 an idea inspired by when Status Quo played four arena gigs in one day in 1991 \u2013 to manning its decks till sunrise. \u201cThe importance of this room really dawned on me,\u201d he says of how Plastic\u2019s People inspired a generation of dancefloor-focused clubbers, as well as himself. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ll talk about til my dying day \u2013 the importance of music, the importance of friends.\u201d It might seem as if Hebden is thoroughly free and easy but he\u2019s not entirely without internal conflict. \u201cMy wife laughs at me: \u2018You\u2019re not into religion, don\u2019t believe in this or that, but you\u2019re always into all this very spiritual art.\u2019\u201d As an atheist whose music-making is irrevocably tied up with his appreciation of other people\u2019s music, it introduces a dilemma, he says. His favourite musicians, such as John Coltrane and Ali Akbar Khan, were deeply spiritual. \u201cTheir records aren\u2019t being made to, you know, make a good record. They\u2019re a communication with God. I definitely have this bee in my bonnet; unless I can speak to God through my laptop, I\u2019m never going to make a great record.\u201d He discussed this very topic in a talk with Brian Eno in New York. Eno\u2019s answer, he said, was that inspiration could be found in a sense of \u201csurrender\u201d or abandonment. \u201cHis analogy was surfing. There\u2019s an enormous amount of control or technique to get you to this place where you can ride a wave. Religious people can let themselves go, find this sense of abandonment.\u201d Eno told Hebden he finds a sense of abandonment singing in a gospel choir. \u201cBut after, I was thinking: \u2018Yeah, but he hasn\u2019t made a great gospel record, has he?\u2019 You need to find abandonment combined with your best talent.\u201d     Smile around the face: Four Tet. Photograph: Stephanie Sian Smith for the Guide    Perhaps Hebden is being too hard on himself. Listen to Ba Teaches Yoga, a tribute to his grandma from 2013\u2019s Beautiful Rewind, and you hear a personal moment elevated to something holy. Talking with Hebden as he chats about making music, or the feeling in the room as he DJed that final night of Plastic People, you notice how he describes his life as a series of little epiphanies. At one point, he tells me how he used to make chappatis with his grandmother. \u201cShe made the best ones in my family, and after she died, I realised I can never have one again. But I thought: \u2018I made them with her many times, I need to start practising.\u2019 So every few days, me and my daughter make chappatis, again and again.\u201d  And now? \u201cThey\u2019re OK. Not perfect. They don\u2019t have the elasticity. But these are the sorts of thoughts we have, as we grow older. My grandmother dying, rediscovering these lost records \u2013 and the next thing I know, I\u2019ve made an Indian record.\u201d He grins: \u201cIt\u2019s all connected.\u201d  Morning/Evening is out now on Text.

Alain Speed, an architect at a practice in London who paints in his spare time, won the top prize of \u00a31,000. Photograph: Franco Camillio     The Pintar Rapido outdoor painting festival, now in its third year in London, involved more than 300 artists of all levels, from dabblers to professionals, who raced to various spots in the city to produce a painting in a day. Artists registered at Chelsea Old Town Hall at 9am and had until 7pm to return with their artwork, which would be hung for sale in a public exhibition the following day.  Some had come from down the road while others had travelled from Spain and the Netherlands to take part. Roger Beckett, the founder of Pintar Rapido, which means \u201cpainting quickly\u201d in Spanish, said the inspiration came from Spain, where he saw such competitions with artists painting live on the streets taking place each summer. \u201cI thought: \u2018What a great experience,\u2019 because the public love to see pictures being painted.\u201d Inclusivity is a key part of the competition, said Beckett, with both professionals and amateurs encouraged to take part. \u201cAnything that encourages people to make a mark, in the creative sense, is a good thing \u2026 this is getting people to think, to increase their confidence to draw or paint.\u201d     Pintar Rapido donates 10% of all profits from picture sales to the Campaign for Drawing. Photograph: Franco Camillio     There is a social side also, which amateur artist John Hoffman, who took part for the second time, confirmed. \u201cI love it. I\u2019ve met a lot of good friends here.\u201d Hoffman\u2019s piece, a pastel painting of a violinist at Pimlico farmer\u2019s market, was hanging proudly in the hall where members of the public milled around, viewing and selecting pieces for purchase (the artists set the price they\u2019d like to receive).  \u201cI just paint during my dinner times,\u201d said Hoffman, who works in historic timber building renovation by day and travelled from Romney marsh for the competition. \u201cIt\u2019s a nice escape from talking about tools at work,\u201d he joked. Alain Speed, an architect at a practice just down the road who paints in his spare time, won the top prize of \u00a31,000 with his oil-on-canvas depiction of an alleyway between the Old Chelsea Town Hall and 181 King\u2019s Road. The spot caught his eye while he was walking past the previous week, and he thought it all the more interesting for being unexpected and hidden. \u201cPainting outside is fun, so this [competition] is ideal really,\u201d said Speed. \u201cPitch your easel somewhere and paint what you see, and for me that is art. It doesn\u2019t need to go any further than that.\u201d The Pintar Rapido competition, which donates 10% of all profits from picture sales to the Campaign for Drawing, will host its first outdoor painting challenge in Glasgow next month before moving to Amsterdam for its second ever competition in September, and then back to London in November.

The Miniaturist, to all intents and purposes, is an intriguing mystery set in an unusual historical context, and should have been plain sailing throughout, if the international reception to the book is anything to go by.  However, a part of my mind was constantly questioning small details as the story progressed. The main character, Petronella (Nella) Oortman is peculiarly worldly and a seemingly determined feminist who manages to travel unchaperoned through Amsterdam without being noticed, and while that may be nothing to pause on in a 21st-century novel, Nella\u2019s background and place in history makes this piece of her character a little out of place.       That, combined with the many many elements of the story that seem to be almost like a soup of plots bound in one cover, decreased my love for this book ever so slightly. It seemed like Burton was trying to add in one too many elements to a single novel, and while she manages admirably well, at times it can be a little overwhelming.  The characters, a little too flat and only \u2018outwardly\u2019 formed for my liking, were still mysterious and compelling, especially Marin; and while the revelation at the end of the novel seemed incongruous after such a detailed and intricate storyline, overall, The Miniaturist was a polished and elusive debut boasting layers of secrets just waiting to be unfolded which I would definitely recommend.

His initial stay was short and unhappy. The impassioned young lay preacher felt compelled to live like local people, dressing in rags and sleeping on straw in a small and squalid hut at the back of the local baker\u2019s, where he was heard sobbing at night. The church was not impressed and criticised him for \u201cundermining the dignity of the ministry\u201d. Difficult as it was, however, this visit and successive stays with the miners of the region inspired Van Gogh to swap preaching for painting. Today Mons, currently the European capital of culture, is making the most of its brief brush with fame, stealing some of the limelight from the neighbouring Netherlands, where Van Gogh was born, and France, where he settled and made his name. On Friday evening, Mons unveiled a giant maze of 7,500 sunflowers inspired by its most celebrated visitor. The installation, by French artist Fanny Bouyagui, will be tended for a week, after which the plants, comprising five varieties of sunflowers, will be distributed among local people. The event follows a successful exhibition at the city\u2019s Fine Arts Museum which, for the first time, explores the work of Van Gogh during the two years he spent in the region. \u201cWe started working on this project two years ago, trying out various plants in the lab. The big challenge was whether they would be in bloom on the day of the opening, and they are,\u201d said Bouyagui. \u201cThere are around 15,000 flowers, some of them four metres high, so people can really lose themselves in the flowers in the middle of the city. It\u2019s very Van Gogh and very poetic.\u201d While a number of painters including the 16th century artists Nicolas Neufchatel and Jan Provoost were born in Mons, their names are far from household. Local residents have sought to put Mons on the map as a key stop in Van Gogh\u2019s lifetime journey from Amsterdam to Arles in Provence, where he painted some of his finest works. (Incidentally, the French poet Paul Verlaine, who spent two years in Mons prison between 1873 and 1875 after shooting his lover Arthur Rimbaud in the arm, is also getting the celebrity treatment for the culture year). \u201cLittle is known and even less has been written about this period in Van Gogh\u2019s life, but it was a decisive point in his career,\u201d said Marie Noble, deputy director of Mons 2015. \u201cHe arrived in Mons to be a pastor and it was here he decided his dream was to become an artist. Here was this fabulous vision and transformation, and while the pictures he did here were not particularly good, they contain the artistic grammar we see in his later works. So we want to show how Mons woke the artist in him.\u201d Two of the houses Van Gogh lived in outside the city have been restored and can be visited.(Sadly, a model thatched cottage built for the culture year and based on those painted by the artist in 1890 at Auvers-sur-Oise, mysteriously went up in flames last weekend.) The Borinage region around Mons was one of the most important industrial areas of Europe when the young lay preacher arrived in December 1878. In letters to his brother Theo, Van Gogh wrote of the booming area with its tall chimneys, coal mountains and the local people \u201cfull of character \u2026 and reminiscent of Bruegel\u2019s medieval paintings\u201d. \u201cThe people are completely black, like chimney sweeps. Their houses could be better called huts, scattered along the sunken roads and against the slope of the hills,\u201d he wrote. \u201cAt first sight everything around it has something dismal and deathly about it. The workers are emaciated and pale due to fever, and they look exhausted and haggard, weather-beaten and prematurely old.\u201d Few of Van Gogh\u2019s works from the period remain. In another missive, which included two small pencil drawings of miners, Van Gogh wrote: \u201cI can see it is not any good yet \u2026 but it is starting to come.\u201d Van Gogh went on to paint a dozen different versions in his \u201csunflower series\u201d. In 1987 the Japanese insurance magnate Yasuo Goto paid $39.9m for his Still Life: Vase with Fifteen Sunflowers at auction at Christie\u2019s London, a then record-setting amount for a work of art.", "sentences": ["Local residents have sought to put Mons on the map as a key stop in Van Gogh\u2019s lifetime journey from Amsterdam to Arles in Provence, where he painted some of his finest works."], "title": "The town that drove Van Gogh to art", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/18/van-gohhmons-art-sunflowers", "tags": ["Van Gogh", "Belgium", "Painting", "Art", "Art and design"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-07-19T07:00:06Z", "article": "Perhaps I should have known more about Rembrandt\u2019s midlife crisis. Thanks to Will Gompertz, the BBC\u2019s endearing mad-professor lookalike of an arts editor, I now do. The great Dutchman was running out of money; his creative juices were no longer flowing and the nurse employed to look after his young son was suing him for not marrying her. Any visitor to Amsterdam\u2019s masterfully rebuilt Rijksmuseum would stand in awe of The Night Watch. Yet the great man\u2019s mood \u201cwasn\u2019t improved by a few snide comments made by some of the sitters\u2026 who grumbled that their features were poorly painted\u201d.

(He is performing a similar \u201chow to\u201d service on his Saturday morning \u2026 Gets Creative series on Radio 4.) One minute he is scoffing cake, and pondering race relations, at the home of the American artist Kerry James Marshall; in a particularly illuminating section, he is discussing iPhones with the Belgian artist Luc Tuymans while in Edinburgh observing the works of the Scottish portraitist Sir Henry Raeburn.

While he devotes barely a page to censorship and only a short chapter to the burning issue of education and the inability of the school system to enhance creativity, his musings on the grasping (bad) or innovative (good) side of the artist are useful in puncturing myths about \u201ccreatives\u201d divorced from the grubby outreaches of the rest of society. One only needs to look at today\u2019s bling-fuelled London auction houses to see the extent to which commercial concerns dominate. But it was, the author contends, ever thus. \u201cWhile his assistants worked all hours at his studio-cum-factory in Antwerp, the enterprising [Peter Paul] Rubens would travel to the splendid aristocratic houses and royal courts of Europe and inform their well heeled owners that if they were to keep up with their peers they would need one of his giant, fleshy, baroque paintings hanging in their Great Hall.\u201d   Related: Art: Bring me the head of Caravaggio    Fleshy \u2013 what an excellent onomatopoeia \u2013 for big walls, big paintings, big money: Gompertz has an endearing way with words, and an ability to mix history with the offcuts of his day job without ever seeming to name-drop. Some of his throwaway remarks are just a little too\u2026 throwaway. I fear he is trying a little too hard to be modish when describing the 1960s monstrosity or icon St Catherine\u2019s College \u2013 take your pick, I know my view \u2013 as one of Oxford\u2019s great buildings. And this in a passage that comes straight after discussing the merits of the singer Adele; yes, readers may well scratch their heads. This book is a series of arresting small pictures, in search of an elusive big picture. Perhaps Gompertz was not seeking to find one. More often than not, his linkages work to good effect. I would never have associated the thought process of Belgrade-born performance artist Marina Abramovic with that of the 16th-century Baroque painter Caravaggio. Citing one of his greatest works, Salome With the head of John the Baptist, Caravaggio, like Abramovic, \u201cwanted to make us part of the action, a character in the story\u201d. Apparently, the film-maker Martin Scorsese credits Caravaggio for the bar scenes in his 1973 movie, Mean Streets. He was also an inspiration for the late British fashion designer Alexander McQueen. Perhaps I should have known about that too \u2013 and of course the midlife crisis of Rembrandt, and many other artists who preceded and followed him.

Photograph: Copyright the Artist's Estate. Image courtesy of lender    In 1958, the artist William Gear arrived in Eastbourne to take up a position as curator of the Towner Gallery. Alas, not everyone was thrilled by his arrival, at least not after he began acquiring art on the town\u2019s behalf. \u201cI think this sort of painting is decadent,\u201d lamented an enraged councillor of Harold Mockford\u2019s Eastbourne (1958), a landscape some likened to a snow-covered slag heap. \u201cAny artist with anything about him at all could do that in two hours.\u201d In 1959, when Gear mounted an exhibition called English Contemporary Art, a letter to the local paper complained that \u201csuch daubs must have been painted by persons with very depraved minds\u201d. Did he imagine any right-thinking citizen of Eastbourne wanted to look at the efforts of a bunch of \u201cteddy boys\u201d? But Gear was not to be put off: the son of a Fife coal miner, he carried with him a streak of stubbornness as wide as the Grand hotel. During the next six years, his acquisitions would include works by Sandra Blow, Edward Burra, Alan Davie, Patrick Heron, Roger Hilton, Peter Lanyon and Edward Wadsworth: a vibrant collection that, as the Observer noted in 1962, contributed magnificently to the Towner\u2019s growing reputation as the \u201cmost go-ahead municipal gallery of its size in the country\u201d. Only in 1964, when Gear was appointed head of the Faculty of Fine Art at Birmingham College of Art, did he resign, by which time his work was done. The town now had the foundations of a collection of 20th-century British art of which it would one day be rather proud.     \u2018Unyielding angles\u2019: a William Gear self-portrait from 1949. Photograph: Copyright the Artist's Estate. Image courtesy Fosse Gallery    At the Towner Gallery, two exhibitions tell William Gear\u2019s unlikely story. The first, A Radical View, focuses on his six-year stint as its curator, complete with yellowing newspaper cuttings and frothing-at-the-mouth letters to the editor. The second, William Gear 1915-1997: The Painter That Britain Forgot, is a show of 100 of his own paintings and prints. Each show is fascinating in its own right, but together they make for a deeply satisfying dialogue: see Gear\u2019s work and you better understand the engine of his conviction that British galleries needed desperately to modernise, to look beyond their stuffy Victorians and into the future. Consider the various artists he promoted during his curatorial career and you have a more complete grasp of his infatuation with abstraction. Both shows also betray Gear\u2019s somewhat obdurate nature. If his application to the Gulbenkian Foundation for a grant reveals a man reluctant to do anything by committee (an award would enable him to bypass his windy alderman enemies altogether), his self-portraits, flat-capped and narrow-eyed, reduce him to a series of unyielding angles. Gear is little known now but in his time he was a controversial artist whose work frequently found its way into our national collections (The Painter That Britain Forgot includes loans from Tate and the National Gallery of Scotland). After studying at the Edinburgh College of Art in the 30s \u2013 he was, a fellow student recalled, \u201calone amongst his peers in pursuing his own work to the point of pure abstraction\u201d \u2013 he travelled through Europe on a scholarship and the world tilted excitingly. In Paris, he saw Picasso\u2019s Guernica and studied under Fernand L\u00e9ger. In Turkey, he was able to visit the Byzantine mosaics he\u2019d long loved from afar. In 1940, he was called up and posted to the Middle East, where he continued to work as an artist, making good use of any spare vehicle paint. After VE Day, he moved to Berlin, where he became a \u201cMonuments Man\u201d. The war over, he returned to Paris. There, a dealer who saw an exhibition of his work invited him to do a solo show in London (curator David Sylvester would describe him as \u201cone of our few real colourists \u2013 makers not of pattern but of light\u201d). But for Gear, Britain was hardly the centre of the universe. Invited to St Ives by Wilhelmina Barns-Graham, with whom he\u2019d studied in Edinburgh, he was repulsed by what he saw as its provincialism: \u201cI was a Parisian now\u2026 it was pretty small beer to me.\u201d In 1949, moreover, he would appear alongside other CoBrA artists \u2013 supposedly the European answer to American abstract expressionism \u2013 at the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam (he also showed with Jackson Pollock in New York, though the name then meant nothing to him). Nevertheless, in 1950 he returned home, moving with his American wife to a cottage in Buckinghamshire. Responding to an Arts Council invitation to create a work for its Sixty Paintings for \u201951 show, he produced the hefty Autumn Landscape.     Broken Yellow, 1967: \u2018a kaleidoscopic explosion\u2019.  Photograph: The artist's estate, Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art    When it was awarded a Festival of Britain purchase prize of \u00a3500, there was a terrible fuss. Why, the chancellor, Hugh Gaitskell, was asked, was a hard-pressed nation wasting its money on this rubbish? This debate, for all that Gear disdained it, made him famous. William Gear: The Painter That Britain Forgot takes a roughly chronological approach to his career. Early on, however, the visitor gets the chance to look ahead; through a specially constructed \u201cwindow\u201d, one can see the vast Autumn Landscape in all its glory. Its shades are brown, yellow and red \u2013 an \u201cequivalence\u201d of autumn, as Gear put it \u2013 but its piled angles refer back to the destruction of the war, and beyond that to Gear\u2019s childhood, to the pithead and its winding gear. On the part of the curators, this preview, glimpsed from the exhibition\u2019s first room, is a smart move: for the visitor trapped bemusedly among the highly derivative work of a painter struggling under the influence of L\u00e9ger, Matisse, Braque, Dufy and Klee, it provides a good reason to press on.     Winter Landscape, 1955. Photograph: Copyright the Artist's Estate; image courtesy Jerwood Gallery    Gear is best known (where he\u2019s known at all) for his large, colourful canvases, oils that often seem to have been painted beneath stained glass on a sunny day, their jewel-like shards outlined in oppressive black; the biggest of these is Broken Yellow, a kaleidoscopic explosion from 1967 of orange, yellow and black, whose eruptive patterning falls somewhere between Klimt and a certain kind of studio pottery. But the best of his works, it seems to me, are far quieter. Winter Landscape (1955) comprises a burnished sky, a fiery orange line where the horizon should be and a black hill rising darkly to meet it. White Square (1956) is a rectangle of blue-grey on charcoal stripes that might, according to your mood, be a window or a memorial stone. In Black Square, Green Bar (1957), the two elements of its title are arranged on a textured background of dirty pink; it as if they have unaccountably been left out in the rain and their darker colours have run. Why has Gear been forgotten? The curators speculate that his relative obscurity can be traced to his solitary nature as an artist, to his reluctance to join any school. But perhaps it\u2019s more straightforward than this, a matter less of jinxed fame \u2013 of his having failed, in effect, to find safety in numbers \u2013 than of simple confidence. Even as you salute the cosmopolitan sensibility that seems so at odds with the cardigan and tie in which he worked, it\u2019s impossible not to notice that the pictures with which he made his name often feel effortfully second hand. Lucky, then, that this show is so extensive, for it\u2019s on the many less attention-seeking of his paintings that the 21st-century eye will undoubtedly want to linger.

The exact nature of what happened next is debated, but within a matter of weeks its preserved skeleton began a European tour that reached London in 1831. Visitors could enter through the open jaws and sit inside the ribcage, like Jonah. Fascinated by this tale, Fiona Tan has produced a captivating installation that invokes the many whales that have been dragged about the world for our wonder and amusement. A gigantic lorry (a facsimile of the one that ferried dead whales around Britain in the 1950s) is beached in the Baltic, giving the sheer measure of the creature. Clamber inside and you will certainly see bones, and whales aplenty in astonishing old photographs, but Tan has reversed the historic experience. The skeleton is no longer empty: it contains an ocean of images. These come in the form of a classic Tan film \u2013 beautiful, slow-moving, so absorbing you could watch it over and again \u2013 which balances an interior monologue concerning one man\u2019s lifelong passion for the undersea world with an equivalent narrative filmed in the amber twilight of a natural history museum. He remembers the long-ago past, a life spent searching for strange creatures beneath the waves, dreaming that he can breathe in this watery element; and the camera moves pensively among these creatures, suspended in glass vessels of formaldehyde.     a travelling Jonah the Whale show reaches Rugby, March 1954. Photograph: National Fairground Archive, University of Sheffield and\u00a0 Jack Leeson Collection    Two kinds of memory are preserved. Tan\u2019s film circles the exhibits as if they were still alive, so animate do they appear in their shining fluid, not so much dead as sleeping, while the narrator\u2019s words turn them back into a shoal of myths. Here is the narwhal, the true unicorn of the waves; here is the swordfish, a samurai reincarnated in Japanese folklore; here is the sea urchin, an old blind warrior roaming the ocean\u2019s floor. Fish, eyeless and lacquered, vector forward like spiky bronze dragons; seahorses ride high in their glass vitrines; nameless serpentine forms turn gold in the museum light. The narrator describes them as sad messages in bottles, turning up in the present long after the writer has gone. Like photographs, they speak of death before they speak of life; and some are now all that remain of memory too. Many of these creatures are now extinct.     Tan\u2019s Leviathan screening at the Baltic, with archival footage of the stripping of a whale.  Photograph: Jonty Wilde    Born in Indonesia in 1966 to Chinese and Australian parents, and now based in Amsterdam, Tan is the most international of artists. She has made films in every continent and even been commissioned to create national portraits \u2013 in photographic form by the Norwegian government; in 20-second film bursts, of German society. In recent years she has deepened her subtle form of portraiture, writing scripts, commissioning music, assembling fragments of all kinds of footage into films that try to capture the slip-sliding vagaries of memory. In Disorient, Marco Polo\u2019s memories of the Silk Road form a wild narration of praise and damnation to a film that shows the contemporary Asia of these travels \u2013 challenging his words, but occasionally chiming with them too. He talks of precious indigo dye and here are poor Indians re-dyeing rags. He praises the marvellous spices, and here are cinnamon sellers in Chinese alleys. How can one trust the memories of a medieval man who claims \u201cthe Kashmiri are all idolaters, they change the weather by enchantment, and bring down thick darkness\u201d? Tan tests his words, yet the images she presents seem at times equally improbable \u2013 camels carrying cars on their humps; mountains turning copper in the sunset; high-rises as spindly as river shacks on stilts. Watch long enough and the film casts its spell so that even the shoal of silver fish leaping from the sea appears miraculous. The strangeness of our world might be Tan\u2019s true theme. On the opposite wall a second film shows a museum of artefacts stretching back to Marco Polo\u2019s day. The counterpoint is surely political; people\u2019s lives frantically occurring on one screen, while the relics of their labour gather dust on the other. Which represents life, which is the true human memento?     Fiona Tan\u2019s Inventory, 2012, featuring Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum. Photograph: Courtesy the artist and Frith Street Gallery\u00a9Fiona Tan    As the show continues, Tan holds the medium of film itself to the light, meditating on the ways it preserves (or erases) memory. This is at the heart of the mesmerising Inventory, which takes us deep into the sepulchral corridors and crannies of Sir John Soane\u2019s Museum in London, chaotic shrine to his neoclassical collection.

They appear more or less mysterious, antique or modern, more or less animated, alien or lifeless. As always, Tan\u2019s camera seems to see everything as if for the first time, intent with wonder, acutely perceptive, even when she is filming the same object over and again from different angles. As always, her film is delicate and humane. But as the classical strings hover in the air, intensifying the sense of estrangement and melancholy, she seems to be portraying time\u2019s depredations as our memories of the dead come and go, shuffling, slipping, fading like dreams. The film is itself an elegy. \u2022 Fiona Tan\u2019s Depot is at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead, until 1 November", "sentences": ["Photograph: Jonty Wilde    Born in Indonesia in 1966 to Chinese and Australian parents, and now based in Amsterdam, Tan is the most international of artists."], "title": "Fiona Tan: Depot review \u2013 mementoes from the deep", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/jul/17/fiona-tan-depot-review-baltic-mementoes-from-the-deep", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Exhibitions", "Culture"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-07-20T10:29:41Z", "article": "Vacant shops and derelict building sites are the urban scars of Athens\u2019 economic decline and endless austerity programmes. But amid even this beleaguered landscape, pockets of unusual activity can be glimpsed \u2013 carved out by the growing number of \u201cpop-up\u201d interventions in the Greek capital. With youth unemployment running at well over 50%, initiatives such as The Loft, which uses abandoned spaces for youth-led art projects, offer precious opportunities for young people to develop their creative and social skills. \u201cPocket parks\u201d are bringing new vitality to the city\u2019s vacant lots. Athenian entrepreneurs, too, have turned to pop-up culture as a way to revitalise their city: nomadic bars and cinemas travel around providing temporary entertainment sites, while supper clubs and pop-up restaurants offer ad-hoc, low-cost food venues. In Athens, this flurry of short-term activity seems a logical outcome of the economic crisis: temporariness as an important means of maintaining cultural and commercial activity in a city crippled by long-term debt. But the Greek capital is far from alone in utilising the concept. Over the past decade, pop-up culture has taken cities across the globe by storm, repurposing vacant sites or buildings in a huge variety of ways \u2013 from short-term shops, charity workshops, bars and restaurants to galleries, studio spaces and interim housing. In the UK, the pop-up phenomenon was explicitly promoted by TV retail consultant Mary Portas and then-communities minister Eric Pickles as a way to regenerate high streets in the aftermath of the 2008 recession, and to provide rates relief to landlords encumbered with vacant properties. The cities of Brighton and Amsterdam are both using pop-up shipping containers to respond to problems of homelessness.    In Christchurch, the pop-up concept was deployed to swiftly rebuild the city\u2019s retail centre after the 2011 earthquake       Post-earthquake Christchurch, with its new \u2018container\u2019 shopping mall. Photograph: Alamy    In Christchurch, New Zealand, shipping container architectures were also deployed to swiftly rebuild the city\u2019s retail centre after the 2011 earthquake. In disaster situations, these temporary structures and other pop-ups such as the city\u2019s now-famous \u201ccardboard cathedral\u201d are valorised as a flexible, fast and low-cost solution to damaged or dilapidated urban environments, used to keep city life ticking over until a longer-term solution is found. The space-finding organisation Gap Filler also emerged in Christchurch after the earthquake. According to its co-founder and director, Coralie Winn, what began as a response to the destruction wreaked on the city \u201chas grown into a city-making initiative with a longer term vision\u201d. For Gap Filler, pop-up is not just a means of recovery but a promising model of participatory organisation as the city moves forward. As academic Simon Dickinson says, the earthquake opened up fissures in \u201cthe cultural and political conservatism of the city\u201d, giving way to ideas which are \u201cbigger than disaster recovery itself\u201d. What started as a niche practice is now ubiquitous in Europe and the US, and increasingly prevalent across the rest of the world, from Nairobi and Kampala to Buenos Aires and Mumbai. Pop-ups are having a transformative impact on how cities of the future are imagined and produced \u2013 but is this increasing reliance on temporary businesses and services always a good idea for our cities? Certainly, they can be a legal and secure way to \u201cunlock\u201d urban spaces which would otherwise lie dormant, helping temporary projects that benefit communities to get off the ground. The UK-based charity 3Space temporarily took on several vacant JJB Sports stores after the company\u2019s collapse into administration, opening them up for uses including an upcycling workshop aimed at the homeless and a drop-in clinic for men in deprived areas of Glasgow. As governments become more receptive to the idea, short-term business ventures are being rolled out and supported by councils to facilitate a range of uses for vacant sites. Hull City Council is designing a pop-up farm which will occupy disused sites and tackle food poverty, while \u201czombie\u201d car parks globally are being transformed into temporary cinemas, yoga classrooms, work space for small businesses, mini-golf courses, bars and restaurants. Like Airbnb and Zipcar, space-finding organisations allow wasted urban spaces to be distributed to those who need it, when they need it, at a time when its owners don\u2019t. The temporal and spatial flexibility of pop-ups seems to help create cities of participation, sharing and resourcefulness.      Bunker puts on free electronic music events at various locations around Hong Kong. Photograph: Brett Ford/4D Images     This phenomenon can also open up space, both geographically and culturally, for radical or alternative uses. Deep underground among the second world war ruins, or high in the surrounding mountains, Hong Kong partygoers arrive to attend pop-up club nights held in some of the city\u2019s remote and abandoned locations. Bunker, a series of free electronic music events, has emerged in response to Hong Kong\u2019s limited music scene (made up of \u201ceither commercial gigs or exclusive clubs [with] nothing in between\u201d, according to its co-founders). Although originally a small party set up by friends, Bunker is using the short-termism of pop-up to avoid legal constrictions and enable a free, anti-commercial and underground music scene. For French architect Stephane Malka, the legal ambiguity of pop-ups enables a radical reinterpretation of space. In one of Marseille\u2019s wealthiest neighbourhoods, Malka\u2019s A-Kamp47 project is a \u201cvertical village\u201d on a wall between a cultural centre and a railway network, using the blurred boundaries of public and private space to disrupt traditional visualisations of home and shelter. The project seeks to use these intermittent spaces to make homeless and marginalised people more visible. According to Malka, A-Kamp47 stands as an \u201cinstant pop-up installation: the marginalised, the clandestine, squatters and the homeless are sheltered\u201d. Lack of legal definition allows the village to exist without immediate interference, and encourages public consideration of who has access to home and shelter, and who doesn\u2019t.    As pop-ups become an everyday feature of cities, we should be alert to the conflicting ideologies embedded within them       Marseille\u2019s A-Kamp47 is making homelessness more visible. Photograph: Laurent Garbit/Malka Architecture    Of course, pop-ups can also be a highly commercialised phenomenon. Global companies including Nike, Starbucks and Puma have all created temporary novelty shops, while Adidas opened one resembling a giant shoe-box in Shoreditch, epicentre of London\u2019s hipster economy. It isn\u2019t difficult to see why such global companies would jump on the same band wagon. As Professor Susan Luckman at the University of South Australia notes, the business model plays into the \u201cmedia fuelled contemporary consumer demand for the new, especially among the youth market\u201d.  It is well established that capital growth thrives on fast turnover times. Given that the immobility of real estate has traditionally been capitalism\u2019s biggest hindrance, pop-ups could well be the culmination of a capitalist dream \u2013 submitting not just products but places to its economic logics. In fact, promoting the temporariness and flexibility of space is perhaps the most significant effect that pop-up culture is having in cities, impacting even on how housing is considered. Schemes that place \u201cguardians\u201d in empty commercial properties utilise the pop-up format to promote short-term and insecure tenancies. Companies such as Camelot and Guardians of London promise cheap rent in exchange for exceptionally short tenancy agreements, which can see renters evicted with just two weeks\u2019 notice. This promotes an understanding, particularly among the urban young, that insecure conditions are a normal and accepted part of living in extortionately expensive cities. This normalisation of temporariness has begun to move into the public as well as private sectors. In Lewisham, south London, the local authority has devised a \u201cpop-up village\u201d which will move local people in need of housing around vacant sites across the borough that are awaiting redevelopment. In Lambeth, community groups have responded to cuts to local services by setting up a weekly temporary library, while across the Atlantic, A-Kamp47\u2019s Stephane Malka has been commissioned to build five units of mobile schools in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro.     Atlanta-based SCADpad created temporary micro-apartments in city parking spaces. Photograph: SCADpad    These projects could be life changing for the vulnerable people they support. Yet in celebrating pop-ups as the solution to urban problems, are we simply distracting from the lack of structural public provision in these areas \u2013 and worse still, normalising, even glorifying, its absence through passionate avowals of temporariness? If Lewisham\u2019s housing project is anything to go by, it could be that, rather than opening up urban space to under-empowered people, the pop-up approach only makes them easier to displace when more profitable uses of the space are found. Across the world, temporary hospital units are replacing permanent specialist departments as healthcare resources come under increasing strain. In Atlanta, Georgia, the SCADpad project at the Savannah College of Art and Design has built micro-homes in car-park spaces to highlight the need for adaptive re-use in an under-resourced and over-populated world. In NYC, Garrison Architects have created a prototype home designed to house displaced citizens \u201cin the event of a catastrophic natural or manmade disaster\u201d. While such designs speak to real-world concerns of future catastrophe, they also further a somewhat dystopic vision of the future in which short-term services and response systems replace the secure structures and welfare systems that cities once aspired to.  And so, as pop-ups become an everyday feature of global cities, we should be alert to the conflicting ideologies embedded within them. As we seek to build on the innovation, resourcefulness and inclusion they enable, we must remain conscious of their potential to normalise and even glorify the precariousness of urban life.

At the same time, London Pride faced criticism by those who find the rise in corporate sponsorship contrary to the event\u2019s political origins. This tension marks the start of a new phase in LGBT culture.   Related: Lord Browne: LGBT networks are fine, but CEOs must set the tone on inclusion    The intersection between mainstream media and the LGBT community has not always been an easy one. By today\u2019s standards, gay characters from American sitcom Will &amp; Grace appear crudely two-dimensional and stereotyped. Ten years later, shows such as Cucumber, Transparent and Orange is the New Black have introduced a new wave of LGBT representation on the small screen and feature LGBT characters that are rounded and diverse. The fact these shows are market-driven and attract huge audiences (the new season of Orange is the New Black broke Netflix streaming records) represents a massive interest in LGBT culture from a broad audience. With LGBT culture firmly in the mainstream, advertisers are now playing catch-up. When Queer as Folk was on our screens, the ads that ran in between were distinctly heteronormative. The few brands that did communicate with the LGBT community did so cautiously, regarding them as just another niche audience to help top up the numbers. So-called \u201cgay vague\u201d ads, such as Budweiser\u2019s Tops and Bottles and Another One\u2019s Coming Out, relied on ambiguity and coded messages, while Volkswagen\u2019s famous 1997 Sunday Afternoon commercial featured two men in a car, understood either as straight roommates or a gay couple depending on the viewer\u2019s sexuality.     Volkswagen\u2019s famous 1997 Sunday Afternoon ad campaign.    Today, the LGBT community is no longer a niche consumer segment but an influential group whose voice grows stronger all the time. LGBT culture has become a driving force of the mainstream and it\u2019s this fact that attracts advertisers. There are 1.8 billion so-called millennial consumers across the globe (those born between 1982 and the early 2000s), a group characterised by, among other things, its attitude of open-mindedness and tolerance. See how brands like Ray-Ban and Coca-Cola have placed LGBT characters centre-stage in their marketing communications. It\u2019s understandable that such brands also look to LGBT organisations like Pride to express their solidarity and form commercial partnerships. Given the recent strides made in equality, Pride must now arguably reset the agenda and this should include consideration of how to appropriately handle support from brands and corporate sponsors. As for the advertisers and the advertising industry, they must make every effort to become positive partners of the LGBT community and indeed draw lessons from past failures in respect to ethnic diversity in marketing. Guidance for brands  1 LGBT = Diversity LGBT is not a single demographic. The community is incredibly diverse and should be represented honestly. Brands should avoid simply ticking a diversity box by including a white male-male couple. 2 Push the boundaries  The LGBT community is full of colour and contrast. It continues to grow and welcomes new members who have battled misunderstanding and prejudice on a growing spectrum of identity. Brands have a real opportunity to be bold in their support. 3 Don\u2019t just say, do A rainbow-coloured tweet in support of gay marriage only goes so far. In order to build a credible association with the LGBT community, brands must back up messages of support with action. This is especially true for sought-after millennials, who, regardless of sexual orientation, favour brands that act on their words. 4 Be consistent  It takes time to win the respect of any consumer. Brands should avoid jumping on the LGBT bandwagon unless they plan on a lasting and mutually beneficial relationship. 5 Avoid saying one thing here and another thing there Sadly, LGBT rights and not uniform across the world. Global brands must avoid a contradictory stance in different markets. Apple recently found itself in controversy over the Siri app, which answers Russian queries for nearby gay venues with either silence or negativity.

Around 60 of them are in the semi-finals of the annual Fifpro Tournament, run by the world players\u2019 union, which has been played on a knockout basis over the summer between teams representing 18 European countries.

Now, if you join one of these squads for training, you\u2019ll be fit and ready to go for whoever wants you.

The fact you have played here shows that you are fit, ambitious and have a good attitude.\u201d The Spain coach, \u00d3scar Arp\u00f3n \u2013 for whom this is an equally important shop window \u2013 concurs: \u201cThis is easier than coaching players at a club. The players are all motivated, expectant and desperate to be here.\u201d Fifpro points out the cart cannot precede the horse. Players\u2019 unions are invited to participate in the tournament only when their domestic services are deemed sufficient. \u201cWe love the tournament but really this is about providing services for your unemployed players on a wider level,\u201d Tummers says. \u201cWe tell countries to set these services up at home, organise matches and training camps and show us what they\u2019ve done. Then, as an extra, you can have a place here.\u201d That was the reward given to the Czechs, whose players\u2019 union is only four years old, this summer and their debut had taken in victories over Romania, Portugal and Switzerland before the finals weekend in Rijnsburg. Their squad is perhaps the most mixed of the four involved and as well as the former Norwich striker David Strihavka, who captains the side, they include the former Chelsea and Celtic midfielder Jiri Jarosik \u2013 who is 37 and most recently played for Alav\u00e9s. \u201cJiri met the guys by coincidence when they were travelling on the plane to Lisbon for the Portugal game earlier this month,\u201d Haindlova says. \u201cThey had a chat and he said: \u2018OK, I don\u2019t have a club at the moment so I\u2019d love to come with you for a couple of weeks.\u2019     A Czech player, right, is challenged by an opponent from France\u2019s Team UNFP in a tournament where injury can be catastrophic. Photograph: Frederik Enneman for the Guardian    \u201cIt is really positive for the guys to play alongside him. Most of them \u2013 I\u2019d say 90% \u2013 have had problems with clubs not paying them on time, which has contributed to their being here. But I think about half of them already have offers, and from my experience most of them will find a club.\u201d Playing alongside the occasional big name can add conviction to the quests of players who, much as they may not show it, have often had their pride hurt. \u201cLu\u00eds Boa Morte played here for Portugal once and his influence was interesting,\u201d Tummers says. \u201cIt was a case of: \u2018If he\u2019s doing it then we don\u2019t have to be ashamed either.\u2019\u201d Jarosik plays in central defence during the Czechs\u2019 win against a France team who include the former Charlton and Portsmouth midfielder Therry Racon and, playing against his home country, the former Southampton and Brest midfielder Mario Licka. The standard is mixed, perhaps reflecting that former top-flight players are consorting with players of far lesser standing. Jiri Kabele, a Czech midfielder whose most recent football has been in his country\u2019s third tier, is one of the more impressive performers but is among those who feel this is their last chance to make a living from the sport. \u201cI\u2019ve made some mistakes with my decisions about joining clubs in the past, and here we are,\u201d says Kabele, who has also played in Hungary, Slovakia and India. \u201cI\u2019m 28 now so if I don\u2019t get a club I\u2019ll find some work, maybe as an engineer or for my sister\u2019s business, and play part-time. But I\u2019m open to anything. I\u2019m not out of hope \u2013 I\u2019ve had a good career and after being together with this squad for five weeks now I feel ready. \u201cMany of us didn\u2019t really know each other but we have all come together and it\u2019s a really positive atmosphere. You cannot cry, sit in the corner or wait for something. You need to show the best of yourself and have faith. The players are positive and joking in the dressing room; nobody is sad.\u201d The stands are not packed with trenchcoated figures scribbling into notebooks but no one is shouting into a void. While scouts from the Dutch clubs Heerenveen and RKC Waalwijk are present, along with a couple of representatives from German clubs, information will be more widely disseminated by Scout7, a Birmingham-based company which has sent two employees to feed the week\u2019s events into its online recruiting tool used by a client base of around 150 clubs. Nowadays, a piece of brilliance produced in this tiny arena can fly into inboxes worldwide within hours.     The Team UNFP dressing room is a nervous place as the French players hope a moment of brilliance will alert the world to their skills. Photograph: Frederik Enneman for the Guardian    Strihavka, who scores the Czechs\u2019 third goal against France with a smart backheel and leads the line exceptionally, is 32 and admits his last move \u2013 to Racing Beirut in Lebanon \u2013 was \u201cfor the money\u201d. He says he has five or six offers on the table, and later elaborates that he is likely to accept one from an upwardly mobile Italian club but has postponed negotiations to see the Fifpro Tournament through. \u201cI said to all of them that I want to finish this project first,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m motivated to show the young guys that we can achieve something quite unusual. It\u2019s a new project for our footballers and an important one to set an example in. I\u2019m happy with the offers I have but I want to help the others get what they deserve too.\u201d   Related: Pre-season at a Premier League club: sprints, drones and Snoozeboxes | Stuart James    The Czechs stay to watch the AFE team, inspired by the former Real Oviedo forward Nacho Rodr\u00edguez and the 34-year-old Carlos Mart\u00ednez, beat Poland 4-0 and confirm their place in the final. Later, in the hotel where all four teams are staying, they joke with the defeated Licka, who trained with them for two weeks before honouring a promise to join the French and whose father, Werner \u2013 by coincidence \u2013 coaches the team. \u201cYou really want to play with those guys now?\u201d comes a shout. \u201cPut me in the team for the final if you want,\u201d is the response. They will not need him, as they end Spain\u2019s attempt to retain the trophy two days later with a penalty shootout win that owes much to an injury-time equaliser from Jarosik. Their victory \u2013 in a tournament whose format, expanded to celebrate Fifpro\u2019s 50th anniversary, is likely to alter next year \u2013 is a remarkable one in its context and testament to a squad whose visible unity belies their short life. Perhaps the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association, which entered a young team in 2005 but has pursued its own support structures since, might look again at the benefits this kind of competition brings, although English players\u2019 financial expectations would render them off-radar to most scouts from lower-profile foreign leagues. In the end, the tournament\u2019s bottom line is to provide tangible and realistic benefits for those who need them. \u201cIf a 22-year-old footballer comes here and is still a professional player 10 years later, then the Fifpro Tournament has done its job,\u201d Tummers says. \u201cThat is the real success for us.\u201d", "sentences": ["The collective achievement is impressive but the ramifications of what occurs here in Rijnsburg, half an hour south-west of Amsterdam, will be felt entirely by the individuals competing in front of a handful of scouts and curious locals."], "title": "Playing for their futures: the tournament giving unemployed footballers a lifeline", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/jul/22/fifpro-tournament-unemployed-footballers-lifeline", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-07-23T11:08:51Z", "article": "Karma wifi was first mentioned to me as I was heading to a conference in Texas early last year. A friend lent me their own hotspot, their early adopter enthusiasm pitching it as a secret weapon against the tyranny of expensive and irritating data costs when travelling abroad.  And we all know that odd sensation of internet angst - the feeling that your laptop has become an island of futility, cast adrift from all the cloud-based streaming, email and web services upon which we have all become so dependent.  So if the question is \u201chow do I avoid ridiculously overpriced data when travelling in the US?\u201d \u2013 is the answer really Karma? It\u2019s a small device and pleasing in the way only a rounded lozenge can be, little more than 7cm square and slim. It has just one button, and some minimal lights. But it\u2019s Karma\u2019s approach that is different, and a more imaginative solution to the roaming problem.    Related: Internet of Bins: Wi-Fi to come to New York trash cans    Karma users do two things. First, they buy their own hotspot (or, as in my case, borrow one for the trip). Second, they sign up for a Karma account, loading on however much data they want. And then they turn on the device, log in, and do whatever it is that they want to do on the internet. I bought 10GB of data for $99 (\u00a363). There\u2019s an incentive in being free of contract or subscription, but also that you can log in with your Karma account to any Karma device. If you log in to someone else\u2019s, they get an extra 100MB of free data added to their account.  If someone logs into your device, you get an extra 100MB of free data; this happened nine times during SXSW, although that is one of the world\u2019s biggest concentration of technophiles. I addition the data does not have a best before date, although the option to log in with Facebook has been removed on the Karma Go. Karma\u2019s founders started work in Amsterdam nearly four years ago. Co-founder and chief executive Steven van Wel said he was frustrated by having to jump through so many hoops to get online in the US, and ended up feeling he was \u201cliving in flight mode\u201d. He is aggressive about Karma\u2019s plans to expand and take on the big internet providers.  \u201cThese are huge companies and monopolies and for those reasons there isn\u2019t enough innovation in this market. That\u2019s the thing that keeps us up every night - how we can improve the experience of connecting to the internet,\u201d he said.      Karma chief executive Steven van Wel    \u201cWe want to take customers from those big corporations. Comcast, Verizon, and BT in the UK make millions every month from people for their internet connections - and we want to eat into that.\u201d However, van Wel did not dismiss the idea that Karma might sell itself to one of those companies one day: \u201cI\u2019ll never say no to the possibility, but our priority is the idea that the business of internet connectivity sucks and there isn\u2019t a startup committed to solving this. It\u2019s about the relationship with the customer and even if there\u2019s a big cheque down the road, I\u2019d rather see us get a million people online.\u201d Karma is only available in the US for now, and there are no conversations as yet in the UK and Germany, though the EU\u2019s attempts to solve the roaming charges problem might make this less of a priority.  Despite the convenience for travellers, 95% of Karma\u2019s customers are in the US - people who already have subscriptions or contracts but use Karma on top so they don\u2019t exceed their data caps. Social layer The second version of the Karma hotspot, Karma Go, is being shipped from today. Some 20,000 people signed up for pre-order since September and the company expects to sell at least as many as the first version of the hardware, which sold 40,000.  It\u2019s very easy to use, and the combination of a social layer on top of a nicely designed piece of hardware is very compelling - even if they do need to do a little work to reduce the \u201ccreepiness\u201d of a stranger logging in to your hotspot while you\u2019re on it too. One limitation is battery life, which would only last a full working day if I used it intermittently and remembered to turn it off completely when not using it. Karma Go has been improved, they say, and can last up to 200 hours by putting itself to sleep after 30 minutes.  While it might not yet have any competitors for ease of use, it does have competition over price. Karma\u2019s data is expensive compared to 3\u2019s roaming tariff, for example, and there are other workarounds if you\u2019re organised enough to plan in advance of your trip. I\u2019m not. So the trip ended, and I came back to the UK with unused data that will sit in my account until I log in next. It\u2019s just as well the data I bought isn\u2019t assigned to that hotspot, because two months later I lent it to a friend and he lost it. But easy come, easy go.

Until 2009, he was the drummer in American hardcore punk band Against Me!, before he suddenly left the band to open Boca Fiesta, a restaurant in Gainesville, Florida, specialising in Southern and Mexican cuisine. \u201cWhen you play a show, you\u2019re trying to create an atmosphere where people feel recharged,\u201d he says. \u201cWhether you\u2019re backstage or in a kitchen, everything\u2019s happening. It\u2019s teamwork. I can see a day when bands will start touring with their own food truck. It will be: \u2018This band not only makes great music. They also cook great food.\u2019\u201d The 34-year-old\u2019s career change was met by headlines such as \u201cDrummer ditches fame for burritos\u201d, but five years on, no longer playing \u201cthe same venues in Iowa for the sixth time\u201d and with his business solid and serving \u201cdamned fine tacos\u201d, he has absolutely no regrets. Oakes isn\u2019t the only successful musician who has taken an eyebrow-raising culinary detour. Rapper Coolio \u2013 who notched up one of the best-selling singles of all time with 1995\u2019s Stevie Wonder adaptation Gangsta\u2019s Paradise \u2013 has restyled himself as the \u201cGhetto gourmet\u201d, with a cookbook and web TV show. R&amp;B star Kelis is now a qualified saucier with a sauce line and TV show. Then there\u2019s Brooks Headley, a hardcore/emo drummer turned award-winning pastry chef at New York\u2019s upmarket Del Posto, who sent an email when he was drunk, begging the restaurant to take him on. The UK producer Naughty Boy cooks in his studio, and has served okra and brown rice to Emile Sand\u00e9 and chilli-spiced shepherd\u2019s pie to Mary J Blige. Meanwhile, a procession of cooks-turned-musicians is headed the other way, including rapper Action Bronson, Fall/Ian Brown drummer Si Wolstencroft and Paul Oakenfold, a cordon bleu chef who applied the culinary work ethic to turntables, becoming a superstar DJ.            \u201cSomebody who is creative in one area will often make the leap into something else,\u201d says Coolio, who claims to be able to do things with a chicken that will make it jump out of a pot and dance. \u201cFor me, music and cooking go hand in hand. It\u2019s a creative process about combining elements \u2013 whether that\u2019s pianos and drums or flavours and ingredients.\u201d Naughty Boy \u2013 who has a halogen cooking range in his studio, agrees, but for him cooking while making music is \u201ca way of dealing with the stresses of the industry\u201d. Perhaps the most famous musical chef is reggae singer Levi Roots, who appeared on the Dragon\u2019s Den TV programme with his Reggae Reggae Sauce, a brand now worth \u00a330m. As a musician, his first single was produced by dub legend Coxsone Dodd and he knew Bob Marley during the reggae legend\u2019s sojourn in London, but although Roots still records, he never really made it. His requests for investment in a milder version of Caribbean hot sauce were rejected by banks for years \u2013 \u201cImagine you had a black man with dreadlocks in your office telling you he could outsell Heinz Tomato Ketchup,\u201d he says. However, he took his guitar and sauce to food exhibitions, becoming a singing cook. \u201cIt was the best thing I ever did,\u201d he says. \u201cThe mantra \u2013 \u2018Put some music in your food\u2019 \u2013 is about me. I wanted to make people happy while they were having food.\u201d Others have been guided towards cuisine by a dearth of decent catering on tour. \u201cI was fed up of being told: \u2018The chef does a fantastic vegan curry,\u2019\u201d sighs Nicky Garratt, founding guitarist of the UK Subs, currently playing prog rock with Hedersleben. \u201cYou\u2019d get it and it would be a tin of potatoes with curry powder chucked in. Just slop!\u201d So he learned to make his own, becoming so absorbed by Asian cuisine that he has now published a superb cookbook, Mango &amp; Mint, featuring \u201cArabian, Indian and North African-inspired vegan cuisine\u201d.            Coolio was disappointed by the \u201cswanky restaurants\u201d he sampled when he became rich and famous, and found himself thinking: \u201cI can do better than this.\u201d When the rap career slowed down, he studied an online chef\u2019s curriculum, learning about temperatures, times, knife cuts, and how to spot a ripe vegetable or blanche a potato. He\u2019s certainly enjoying his new life \u2013 his Cookin\u2019 With Coolio show finds him surrounded by racily clad ladies, who pass the ingredients and \u201cprovide motivation\u201d. Others answer a deeper calling. Kelis\u2019s mother had a catering business, so during a gap between record labels in 2006, the musician decided to enrol at Le Cordon Bleu \u2013 under her real name, Kay Rogers, specialising in sauce. \u201cThe first day was literally like the first day at school,\u201d she says. \u201cPeople knew who I was, but nobody stared or anything. We all wore uniforms and my hair was under a chef\u2019s hat, but nobody cared anyway \u2013 we were all focused on passing. It ended up being one of the best things I\u2019ve ever done.\u201d Her Saucy and Sweet sauce line was \u201cthe obvious progression\u201d from her studies, but Kelis views music and cooking as completely different. \u201cI don\u2019t have to dig into myself or my past like I do in music,\u201d she says. However, even before she titled her last album Food and cooked for producer Dave Sitek in the studio, she had started to realise how many of her songs were already about food: \u201cJerk Ribs, Milkshake, Breakfast \u2026\u201d she says. \u201cI suppose that says something about where my head was at.\u201d There isn\u2019t any particular trajectory from the stage to the kitchen, but the trip seems most popular with rappers and DJs. \u201cRappers like their food,\u201d suggests Coolio, who still misses his mother\u2019s cooking. According to Oakenfold, the explosion of DJ foodies is because \u201cprior to the show, the promoter takes you out for food, so your palette is being educated to all these different tastes around the globe. The world\u2019s biggest conference in electro music \u2013 the Amsterdam Dance Event \u2013 even runs a competition for the best DJ chef.\u201d The latest music-food crossover boom area is metal. The Vegan Black Metal Chef is a smash hit internet TV programme based on a bonkers but brilliant idea: vegan recipes sung over a black metal soundtrack by a gruff-voiced cook wearing a rubber outfit complete with knife-like finger daggers.            \u201cI\u2019m a metal musician, so I made the cookery show I wanted to see,\u201d explains the chef, Brian Manowitz of Forever Dawn, whose first show scored 2m hits. He cooks over a pentagram and promises \u201cthe essence of Satan in your food\u201d, but is succeeding in his aim to promote a \u201cdo-able\u201d form of vegan cooking. Sahil \u201cThe Demonstealer\u201d Makhija fronts one of India\u2019s biggest metal bands, Demonic Resurrection, alongside web TV show Headbanger\u2019s Kitchen, where he dishes up \u201cdemonic cookery\u201d and \u201cbacon bombs\u201d and serves metal bands with dishes based on their names. \u201cLamb of God don\u2019t actually like lamb, so I cooked them chicken,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt gets tricky when you cook for grindcore bands, like Gutslit, because every song is about death or mutilation. You don\u2019t want pus-filled eggs, but because their album is called Skewered in the Sewer I made them a fish dish called the Skewered Sewer. They absolutely loved it.\u201d None of these musicians cook for a quieter life. Punk-turned-pastry chef Brooks Headley argues that chefs party at least as hard as rock\u2019n\u2019rollers \u2013 \u201cyou\u2019re surrounded by alcohol and this atmosphere of festivity, so it\u2019s bound to rub off in getting hammered\u201d \u2013 which is an assertion borne out by plenty of chefs\u2019 memoirs. And DJ Bill Brewster\u2019s time as a chef in some of London\u2019s finest but most pressurised restaurants was never dull. \u201cI cooked for Margaret Thatcher, although they never told us the food was for her until afterwards, for obvious reasons,\u201d he chuckles. \u201cI once saw a chef hurl a meat cleaver at someone\u2019s head. The chip in the door was still there when I left.\u201d            Neither are these musicians-turned-cooks dilettantes. Headley\u2019s Fancy Desserts cookbook reflects his twin passions for food and music \u2013 essays on the perils of sugar nestle alongside signature dishes such as butterscotch mascarpone and pictures of X-Ray Spex, and it had a foreword by Steve Albini, for 30 years one of the most influential and divisive figures in alternatuve music. Like Coolio, who promises a comeback album, and Oakes, who is back doing some drumming with Sunshine State, Headley can\u2019t entirely stop the music. \u201cTouring is still my absolute favourite thing,\u201d he says. \u201cIf someone was to tell me that any one of the three crappy bands I play in could tour the world for a year, I\u2019d quit my job in a second.\u201d Oh, and just in case you thought being a chef might make him the odd one out among his musical colleagues, one of the people he plays alongside in Music Blues is Stephen Tanner of 90s noise band Harvey Milk, who now cooks at the acclaimed Brooklyn restaurant Commodore. He has been described as \u201csomewhat of a seminal figure in his adopted Williambsurg\u201d for his role in its culinary renaisssance. Maybe the only thing stopping these two foodies touring the world is the prospect of having to eat at Subway and Burger King. How to cook chicken, by Coolio  \u201cThe art of cooking chicken is to take it to the hairdresser the night before. You put it in a plastic bag, pour on balsamic vinegar, garlic and onions, throw some honey or some beer in there and some black crushed pepper. Let it sit all night and then whether you fry it, bake it or grill it, it will taste that much better.\u201d Kelis\u2019s coconut curry \u201cYou get an acorn squash, some carrots, yams or new potatoes, broccoli or maybe asparagus and some bell peppers. You start off with some coconut oil in a skillet, then add onions and garlic, then green and red peppers and black pepper. Slowly add the vegetables. I personally like to use a hot curry powder, then add coconut milk and a bit of lime juice and lime zest. A bit of brown sugar, little bit of cumin. Cover it on a low simmer and you\u2019re good to go. The key is to know the basics first: if you try to be too fancy too early, it will end up being gross.\u201d", "sentences": ["The world\u2019s biggest conference in electro music \u2013 the Amsterdam Dance Event \u2013 even runs a competition for the best DJ chef.\u201d The latest music-food crossover boom area is metal."], "title": "Vegan Black Metal Chef, Reggae Reggae Sauce, Headbanger's Kitchen: why do so many musicians cook?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/jul/23/vegan-black-metal-chef-reggae-reggae-sauce-headbangers-kitchen-why-do-so-many-musicians-cook", "tags": ["Pop and rock", "Music", "Culture", "Food & drink", "Food & drink industry", "Food TV"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-07-24T06:00:18Z", "article": "Mallorca is the top destination for Brits searching on comparison site TravelSupermarket in the runup to this year\u2019s summer holidays.

If he spots a fly crawling across a table he will cup it carefully in his hand and release it out of the window. \u201cI very quickly feel sorry for people or creatures,\u201d he says, sitting on a beige sofa in the drawing room of the central London flat he shares with his wife of more than 57 years. \u201cThat\u2019s one of my things.\u201d At 92 he thinks this surfeit of empathy comes from having witnessed appalling violence as a young man. From the formative ages of 18 to 21, Jan Bras was a Japanese prisoner of war. When the Japanese invaded the Dutch East Indies during the second world war, he was transported by \u201chell ship\u201d and cattle wagon to work on the construction of the Burma railway. Later, he was interned in a camp and sent to work in the perilous coal mines at Fukuoka. After liberation in 1945, he was one of the first to walk through a decimated Nagasaki after the detonation of the atomic bomb. He witnessed unimaginable terror, brutality and death. Throughout it all, Jan Bras survived. In many ways, his is the story of the second world war in the Pacific \u2013 a conflict overshadowed by memorialisation of events in Europe. With the 70th anniversary of Victory in Japan Day on 15 August, stories like his are becoming rarer. Bras is one of only a handful of survivors. For years Bras did not talk about what had happened to him and this is the first time he has ever shared it publicly. Like many survivors, he found it impossible to convey his experiences to others after the war. The words did not exist. \u201cHe never really talked to us, to my mother or me, maybe until the last 10 years or so,\u201d says his daughter, Gina Jennings. \u201cI think they [the survivors] do feel that nobody understands, so they don\u2019t bother to talk.\u201d But then, about 10 years ago, the memories started floating to the surface like driftwood. Scraps at first, then entire stories: the occasion he watched his best friend die; the day his older brother was threatened with execution in the camp, the time he and his fellow prisoners were forced to dig their own graves in the days leading up to liberation because their Japanese captors planned to kill them all before the allies came.     The mushroom cloud: a dense column of smoke rises more than 60,000ft into the air over Nagasaki.  Photograph: Rex    \u201cIt\u2019s quite grim actually,\u201d Gina says. Growing up, she recalls her father\u2019s absolute refusal to accept authority. She finds it difficult, still, to come to terms with what he went through. \u201cHe thinks I\u2019m not interested, but it\u2019s just that I can\u2019t take it. I can\u2019t bear what happened to them all. The random violence \u2026 It is a constant horror in the background. You live this so-called normal life, but these real atrocities happened to people you know and love.\u201d It was Gina who got in touch with me through a mutual friend. She was worried that her father\u2019s recollections would be lost when he died and that the war in the Pacific and East Asia, once immortalised in films such as The Bridge on the River Kwai, was now in danger of being forgotten amid all the commemorations centred on VE Day in May. This, then, is the story of one man\u2019s war. But it also stands for those many others left untold. Jan Bras\u2019s father was a Dutch planter living and working in the colonies. Bras was born in Indonesia, the youngest child of eight, two of whom died in childhood. One of his earliest memories is of accompanying his father on a work trip into the jungle and coming face to face with a tiger. He wasn\u2019t scared, he recalls, because tigers \u201chad no bad instinct at all. We were frightened of bears because they climbed up trees and we were frightened they would fall on us\u201d. Bras and his older brother joined the Dutch army three months before war broke out. After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Japan was able to pursue its military objectives against the allies, including the conquest of the Dutch East Indies. By early 1942, the entire Bras family had been taken prisoner. Bras and his older brother Gerrit were among thousands transported to Thailand on the notorious hell ships. Their ship was subjected to heavy bombardment and Bras remembers hearing the sound of the bombs dropping in the ocean around them as they made the perilous crossing. \u201cYes, we were scared,\u201d he says now. \u201cWe thought we would drown like rats. We were deep in the hold, covered from the top by a sheet. Two people suffocated. It was a terrible situation.\u201d From Thailand they were taken by cattle wagon to the site of the Burma railway. There, the two brothers joined forced labourers digging 5m trenches and setting down sleepers in desperate conditions. Construction of the 415km railway cost the lives of around 13,000 PoWs and 100,000 native labourers. One man died for every sleeper laid.     Forced labour: Allied PoWs working on the Burma railway.    Bras says the danger came not from the beatings the Japanese guards meted out at random intervals (\u201cThey passed,\u201d he says phlegmatically, \u201cand they didn\u2019t want to kill us because they needed us to work\u201d), but from the threat of cholera and malnutrition. He recalls being \u201calways hungry\u201d, but thinks he survived because, unlike some of his British counterparts, he was acclimatised to the tropics. His brother, who was a trainee pathologist, knew it was imperative to boil water before drinking it. Those who didn\u2019t \u201cdied like flies\u201d. There was a seasonal elevation of the Kwai owing to high rainfall. Once, after the waters receded, Bras remembers seeing the corpses of people who had died from cholera littering the branches of the trees bordering the river.    We would be lined up and we had to punch each other and if we didn\u2019t do it hard enough, the guards would beat us    Bras spent two years on the railway. He and his brother would supplement their meagre daily rice rations with strips of young bamboo and the odd squirrel thrown in for protein. Has he seen the film The Bridge on the River Kwai? \u201cYes!\u201d he says, his voice whooping with laughter. \u201cI think it\u2019s a very beautiful film, but completely beyond the truth.\u201d They did not spend their time singing and dancing and putting on shows, he says. \u201cIt [the film] was so ridiculous for a person who experienced the reality. It\u2026 it was a joke.\u201d Extraordinary as it may seem, Bras regards his time on the railway as comparatively tolerable considering what came next. He was taken to Japan, where he was interned in a prisoner of war camp in Fukuoka, on the southern island of Kyushu, and forced to work in the nearby coal mines. It was \u201cvery dangerous\u201d work, conducted underground amid the dark and soot, with the constant threat of death. Bras missed being able to see the sky. At night, he was plagued by fleas and could barely sleep. One in three prisoners died in the mines. Bras\u2019s best friend was one; he was made to drill down below a section of lake and was killed when the roof collapsed on top of him. \u201cI had to wash his clothes,\u201d Bras says. \u201cI found brain tissue on them.\u201d     After the atom bomb: Nagasaki in ruins. Photograph: Rex    He looks at me levelly, weariness twitching at the corners of his mouth. He lapses into silence. It is a painful wordlessness, one which suggests all the things he chooses not to say. The way he coped was \u201cby trying to do as little as possible. We were out there to sabotage the place\u2026 You try to forget a lot. It was so terrible in the mines. It was hard work, and the Japanese always had a stick to beat you with.\u201d After a while Bras became so ill with jaundice he was transferred to the camp sick bay, where his brother was working. He became a medical orderly as a means of escaping the mines. But camp life was relentlessly harsh and unforgiving. \u201cIf the Japanese were annoyed for some reason or other, we would be lined up one in front of the other and we had to punch each other and if we didn\u2019t do it hard enough, the guards would beat us up with a stick and tell us to beat each other harder.\u201d His eyes become veiled and tired. \u201cYou were beaten by your own kind.\u201d And yet, he says, the unexpected conflagrations of violence from their Japanese captors were much worse. At least, with an organised beating, you knew \u201cit would end\u2026 The unknown things were more frightening.\u201d The prisoners were expected to bow to the ground and say \u201cGood day\u201d in Japanese every time they passed a guard. On one occasion, when Bras forgot to do so in his haste to carry two buckets of water to the sanatorium, he was savagely beaten. \u201cThis guard beat me up until I was really black and blue,\u201d Bras says. He is matter-of-fact when he talks about this, and refuses to dwell on either the pain or the injustice. Almost immediately, he manages to seize on the slenderest filament of a positive: \u201cOne of the good things he did was that he never kicked my testicles, which he could easily have done. It sounds silly to you, but I could see there was some sort of honour in him. He beat me up terribly, but he didn\u2019t kick my testicles or my stomach.\u201d I tell him many people would be astonished that, even in the most hopeless situation, he could still find it within him to seek out the good in the man beating him up. \u201cIn those days I believed in God. I was really very religious and I think it might have helped me.\u201d But did he never think to question why, as a young man, he found himself in this nightmare? Why it was him and not someone else? \u201cIt never occurred to me to question God at that time,\u201d he replies. \u201cSince then I have completely changed my mind.\u201d These days Bras considers himself an atheist. But perhaps in the midst of such cruelty, clinging blindly on to his faith was the only way to keep going. He says that, unlike many of his fellow prisoners, he never wanted to die. The camp was liberate in September 1945. Bras vividly recollects the American planes flying overhead, dropping shoes, biscuits and cheese on to the ground below. Later, the Allied troops transported them to Nagasaki where, a few weeks earlier, one of two atomic bombs had been dropped (the other having obliterated Hiroshima), effectively ending the war. Waiting in a truck by the train station, Bras remembers a Japanese camp guard meeting his eye. This particular guard had never beaten him and had always been polite. The guard saluted Bras. Bras looked away, refusing to return the salute. \u201cUntil now, I regret it,\u201d Bras says. \u201cI often think of it.\u201d     \u2018I don\u2019t forgive what the Japanese did\u2019: Jan Bras Photograph: Richard Saker for the Observer    In Nagasaki the scene was one of utter devastation, stretching 3km in every direction. \u201cAll you could see were black hills; it was completely black. Here and there was a chimney. All the houses were just stones and rubble, and here and there was a Japanese who tried to get some food from the Americans, but the Americans did not want to share their food. \u201cI remember this fellow, a father who had just bought a bicycle for his son\u2019s birthday, and all that was found was the bicycle, nothing of the son, just the charred remnants of the bicycle. It was just twisted metal... you could not tell what was human and what was not. The whole thing was black, one lot of black rubble.\u201d Despite the carnage, Bras admits he felt \u201cno pity. I thought: \u2018Good for the Americans.\u2019 Some [former prisoners of war] went back after the war to the same area to show they felt sorry [for the Japanese], but I didn\u2019t feel sorry. I never felt sorry. I feel sorry for the boy [with the bicycle], because the boy was dead, scorched. I feel sorry for that particular case, but I don\u2019t forgive what the Japanese did. They were bastards.\u201d    All that was found were the charred remnants of the boy\u2019s bicycle, just twisted metal, nothing of the son    Of the many acts Bras is unable to forgive, the death of his father is the most painful. His father was tortured by Japanese guards: they fed a tube into his mouth and poured water through it until his stomach burst and he died of his injuries. Remarkably, the rest of the family \u2013 Bras\u2019s four sisters and his brother \u2013 all survived the war. After it ended, Bras and his mother emigrated to Amsterdam, where he pursued medical studies. For a while he and his brother worked in Kingston, Jamaica, where Bras later met his wife, a Scottish doctor. In 1958 they settled in Wrexham in Wales, where Bras worked as a GP for nearly 30 years. Is he angry, I ask, when he looks back at those lost years. He shakes his head. Why not? \u201cWell, chance is a funny thing,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy should I be angry about the bad things that occur and still accept the good things? I really do not understand life. I do not know what it\u2019s all about.\u201d He gazes at me, with the same impish smile on his face. There is a pencil drawing of him done by a fellow prisoner in September 1945 looking handsome, with hope still in his eyes in spite of almost three years in captivity. Today you can see the bones of that young face pressing through his wrinkled skin, and it\u2019s sort of miraculous, really, how strong he is, how unbowed, how his capacity to see the good in people remains. Of course there is also damage profoundly felt, deeply hidden, and his way of coping lies partly in his iron refusal to bend. He will not forgive. He will not salute. He will not fall, even when the blows come down. And here he is: Jan Bras, 92, walking without a stick and eating biscuits, winning his own war every single day.  \u2022 The headline and standfirst were amended on 26 July 2015 to more accurately reflect the content of the article.", "sentences": ["After it ended, Bras and his mother emigrated to Amsterdam, where he pursued medical studies."], "title": "From Burma to Nagasaki: the man who walked through hell", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jul/26/nagasaki-man-who-walked-through-hell-jan-bras", "tags": ["Second world war", "World news", "Japan", "Asia Pacific"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-07-27T12:56:18Z", "article": "The tottering remains of one of the rarest zoological museum specimens in the world \u2013 a quagga whose ancestors were hunted to extinction in South Africa in the 19th century \u2013 is now standing firmly on four legs again through 3D printing, which recreated a flipped version of its right hind leg to replace the missing left leg.

Photograph: Print Collector/Getty Images    The quagga is now one of the Grant\u2019s greatest treasures, but it had a woeful time in the decades before its importance was recognised. It was put on to an iron frame in 1911 with every expense spared, one of six skeletons mounted at the same time at a total cost of \u00a314. The neck was put on upside down, the legs didn\u2019t fit into their sockets, something unpleasantly brown and sticky was oozing through the breastbone, the frame was bolted straight through some of the fragile bones, and the poorly supported spine was sagging under its own weight. To add insult to injury, the poor creature was catalogued as a zebra. By 1972, when scientists took a closer look at the museum\u2019s two \u201czebras\u201d and recognised that one was a quagga and one was a donkey, the quagga had also lost a leg \u2013 possibly loaned out for study and never returned.

The museum worked with the Royal Veterinary College and the Bartlett Manufacturing and Design Exchange at University College London\u2019s school of architecture to rebuild the skeleton, including scanning the one remaining hind leg in a CT machine and creating a mirror image. The bones were then modelled in solid nylon using a 3D printer, and articulated by specialist Nigel Larkin to make the quagga complete again.

Paul Massey, who despite his nickname was little more than 5ft tall, told a BBC documentary crew in 1998 that he could be murdered \u201cat any time\u201d, but alluded to severe consequences for any assassin. In the film, which was never broadcast, Massey laughs and says: \u201cI pity the bastard who did it after.\u201d The 55-year-old was shot dead on Sunday evening outside his home in Manchester Road in Clifton, leading to fears of an increase in gang violence in the city. No arrests have been made in connection with the murder. Police are frustrated at the lack of information they have received about the crime in an area where detectives admit there has historically been a \u201cno grass culture\u201d.     Paul Massey, who was shot dead at his home, talked about possibly facing a violent death in 1998. Photograph: BBC/PA    Massey had just arrived home in his silver BMW when he was shot in his driveway, Greater Manchester police (GMP) said. He then staggered into his front garden, where he managed to phone 999 to report his own shooting. But by the time police and ambulance arrived he was dead. Witnesses reported a white man wearing a green or khaki \u201cmilitary-style top and trousers\u201d with the bottom half of his face covered fleeing the scene via the alleyway by the side of St Anne\u2019s church. The rest of Massey\u2019s family were celebrating his mother-in-law\u2019s birthday at a pub, according to one family friend. \u201cSomebody must have known he would be at home on his own,\u201d said the friend, suggesting it was a planned hit. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe it\u2019s a random attack but we don\u2019t have a motive,\u201d said chief superintendent Mary Doyle, the divisional commander of Salford, who described Massey as a \u201cprominent Salford individual\u201d. She added: \u201cWe are keeping an open mind. There\u2019s an absence of intelligence and information. Someone out there knows who did this and why.\u201d Asked whether people in Salford were unwilling to talk to police about such a crime, Doyle said: \u201cSalford historically has a no grass culture.\u201d The father of five was a well-known figure in his home city, with the Ordsall estate, near what is now Media City, being considered his territory. \u201cNo one could get involved in selling drugs or doing anything else without his say-so at one point,\u201d said an associate. He had been involved in security firms operating in Manchester and beyond but was \u201cskint\u201d in recent years, according to the associate. After serving a long jail sentence from the 90s into the start of the new millennium, he tried to reinvent himself as a politician, unsuccessfully running to be mayor of Salford on an anti-drugs ticket. In his last Tweet before his death, Massey suggested he would try again to be elected mayor.

The Noonans are a notorious criminal family in Manchester. Tony Lloyd, the police and crime commissioner for Greater Manchester, said he was in close contact with senior officers investigating the killing and called on the people of Salford to help the police. In a statement, Lloyd said: \u201cThe police, quite rightly, want to reassure the public that they can go about their business without fear. Through the ongoing Operation Gulf, police in Salford have been cracking down on violent crime in recent years and this intensive work has improved confidence in the police. \u201cBut they cannot work alone. It\u2019s only when members of the community come forward with local knowledge and information, that the police will be able to arrest those responsible and bring them to justice.   Related: Salford's 'Mr Big' Paul Massey shot dead in 'targeted attack'    \u201cI am therefore asking anyone with any information about this incident to please come forward and speak to police directly or contact Crimestoppers in complete confidence.\u201d Born and raised in Salford, Massey, who lived a modest life, had a popular and fearsome reputation. That reputation gained a new facet in the 2000s when he reportedly acted as a mediator between warring criminal factions. He declared he wanted to keep heroin off the streets of Salford and stickers appeared on lamp posts warning smack dealers they risked getting \u201csmacked\u201d if they brought their goods to the city. He was given the title \u201cMr Big\u201d by the late Salford councillor Joe Burrows at a town hall meeting to discuss civil disturbances in 1992. Massey denied having anything to do with the unrest.  In 1999 he was sentenced to 14 years in prison after stabbing a man in the groin, severing an artery and apparently leaving him for dead outside a club in Manchester. At the time he was being filmed by a TV crew making a documentary about his life. The film, believed to have been called A Salford Lad, was never finished, according to the Manchester Evening News. After the attack Massey fled to Amsterdam but was extradited. Since his release from Frankland prison in County Durham, he is believed to have been involved in the security business and to have invested in property in Glasgow.

In 2012, Massey failed to convince voters his \u201cMr Big\u201d days were behind him when he ran for mayor of Salford. On Monday Salford\u2019s mayor, Ian Stewart, described the murder as \u201chorrendous\u201d but admitted he had refused to share a platform with Massey during the campaign. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t share a platform with the BNP and certain other candidates. I stood on a platform and debated with mainstream candidates. He had shown tendencies that I personally wouldn\u2019t want to give any oxygen to. His criminality. Everyone knows about the time he spent in prison and why. It was up to the people of Salford to vote, and they did not vote for him in any great number, and that\u2019s just a fact of history,\u201d said Stewart. Earlier this year, Massey was still under investigation by police from the regional organised crime squad who were probing allegations of money laundering. He was arrested with five others in December 2011 as part of a police probe in to a Salford-based security company. Massey claimed the police were conducting a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d against him and strenuously denied any wrongdoing after having his bail conditions relaxed.", "sentences": ["After the attack Massey fled to Amsterdam but was extradited."], "title": "Murdered 'Mr Big' said he could be killed 'at any time' in 1998 interview", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/jul/27/salford-mr-big-paul-massey-murder-risk-interview-1998", "tags": ["UK news", "Manchester", "Greater Manchester", "Salford"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-07-29T15:09:24Z", "article": "My sister Caroline Chisholm, who has died from a brain tumour aged 43, was an award-winning novelist, a professional communicator for a number of high-profile charities and a dedicated environmentalist.

Our father worked for HM Customs &amp; Excise and in that capacity was assigned to positions across the UK. Caroline attended primary schools first in Ibstone, Buckinghamshire, and then over 700 miles away in the Shetland Islands. Her education continued in Peterlee, County Durham, before she completed GCSEs and A-levels in Westcliff-on-Sea. She went to Queen\u2019s University Belfast, and graduated in English and Russian studies. Caroline\u2019s career began in marketing and PR at the Northern Ireland Film Council. She dedicated both her working and her personal life to charities including the National Osteoporosis Society and the Vegetarian Society, having been a committed vegetarian from the age of 13. A supporter of the homeless charity Crisis, she gave up her own Christmas to look after others. In 2008, she was appointed head of marketing and communications globally for the Earthwatch Institute in Oxford. From there Caroline moved to Amsterdam in 2011 to take up the role of climate change communications manager for Greenpeace International. Caroline left Greenpeace in 2012 and moved to Southport to be closer to family. She began studying for an MA in creative writing at the University of Manchester. While there, she also worked as a home care worker and volunteered with the Southport Lifeboat station. Caroline had declared at the age of five her intention to swim the Channel. In 2009, she set out to do just that and although the bad weather ultimately prevented it, she spent many hours training in the freezing sea around Dover, as well as blogging about her experience. This led to the development of her first novel, Swimming Pool Hill. In September 2013, while doing research on her book in Calais, Caroline was suddenly taken ill and diagnosed with an aggressive and malignant brain tumour. She underwent surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy and somehow managed to stay positive throughout. In 2014, Caroline entered Swimming Pool Hill for the Bridport prize and, out of 1,200 entries, she was awarded first prize in the Peggy Chapman-Andrews first novel award. By this time she had completed her MA, started a PhD and was working on another novel. When in April this year a routine scan revealed that her tumour had returned, along with others, she never complained or gave up.

You\u2019re a high court judge sitting on a case worth billions of pounds and you have to step down from hearing the matter because you\u2019ve lost your calm over some misplaced luggage. Not hundreds or thousands of items of misplaced luggage, not diamonds or live tissue for human transplant, but your own luggage, that you and your wife took on a recent city break. When Mr Justice Peter Smith sat in the high court on a case involving British Airways and demanded to know what had happened to his bags on a recent romantic trip to Florence, he had unusual powers that the rest of us do not possess. Injudiciously, he threatened to use them. Smith even entertained the idea of summoning British Airways\u2019 chief executive to explain the mishap in a competition case heard at vast expense. The judge was finally invited to realise that his remarks left him completely unsuited to hearing the case. We all lose our perspective over our mistreatment by airlines but this incident was one of judicial arrogance and pomposity.

There is no hell quite like being messed around by an airline. Funnily enough, there appears to be no more opaque a system in which individuals appear to hold absolute power, except perhaps for the courts. For British Airways and their legal team, the horror of being held to account for some missing bags during a multibillion pound piece of litigation must have been both stunning and excruciating. Judges around the country hear cases involving businesses and organisations with which they have some connection. While we might wish that they could, magistrates hearing proceedings for non-payment of the TV licence fee cannot refuse to punish individuals on the grounds that Mrs Brown\u2019s Boys is dross. Judges hearing cases brought by energy suppliers, fast food companies and supermarkets cannot and should not use the hearing as a vehicle to pursue their own consumer grievances. Were judges to introduce their personal vendettas, Yodel, Abellio Greater Anglia and Ryanair would not find a fair hearing anywhere in the land. The temptation to abuse a position of professional privilege is an obvious one. Careful readers and PR agencies might raise my third paragraph rant at this moment, but I am not a judge. I am a lowly scribe, whose opinion of these companies is likely to alter upon receipt of \u2013 let\u2019s say \u2013 a free holiday. I am not hearing a dispute worth several billions which requires me to be dispassionate. Like Smith, I have a bone to pick with most companies. I expect many regular passengers will have experienced a mishap at one point or another but with the passage of time they tend not to fixate us enough to derail the execution of our work.    After his bags were safely returned to him he raised the issue a full 33 times with counsel for the airline    It isn\u2019t that Smith briefly lost his temper with British Airways but that after his bags were safely returned to him he raised the issue a full 33 times with counsel for the airline. That would count as obnoxious behaviour from anyone in any context but from a judge sitting on a case it is completely inexcusable. Nothing that has been raised 33 times, however compelling or interesting it might have been the first time, was worth repeating 32 times, just to drive the point home. Thirty three references to the same issue is unnecessarily repetitious. To give you some insight into just how tedious and obnoxious that would be, I\u2019ve just made the point a few times and by now I\u2019m certain you want to slap me.

A campaign called Save the Bassoon now aims to remind the public of the importance of this engaging member of the woodwind section and to encourage young musicians to take it up. Using the \u201cendangered species\u201d model employed by the World Wide Fund for Nature, campaigners are highlighting the scarcity of bassoonists and paving the way for the promotion of some other orchestral instruments that are under threat, such as the oboe, French horn, viola, trombone and double bass. The bassoon preservation campaign began in Amsterdam in June and is to spread across Europe through a network of professional players. At the head of the initiative is Bram van Sambeek, a virtuoso bassoonist who has often played with the London Symphony Orchestra. \u201cThe name of the campaign is deliberately quite dramatic because we want people to think about whether the bassoonist could be as endangered as the panda. There is a danger. And there is a danger to the future of the orchestra as a result,\u201d said van Sambeek, who lives in the Hague and will bring his rock version of Vivaldi\u2019s bassoon music to London next year. \u201cAt the moment, only about 1% of people on the street can even recognise this instrument,\u201d he said. \u201cI am always prepared for the fact that people won\u2019t know what it is.\u201d Save the Bassoon began as part of the Holland festival, an annual arts event in Amsterdam run by British artistic director Ruth Mackenzie. This year she commissioned seven short works to celebrate the instrument, and Van Sambeek is to push forward with the campaign next week when he appears at Berlin\u2019s Konzerthaus alongside an equally endangered double bass player. \u201cWe have big plans for bassoon events of the kind that cannot necessarily be performed in a normal concert hall. I expect to have news soon of how we will link up with musicians and orchestras in other countries. The most important thing is to have more international events under the label of Save the Bassoon.\u201d For Sir Nicholas Kenyon, managing director of the Barbican Centre in London and a former bassoon player, the trick is to promote British youth orchestras. \u201cMusic\u2019s place in young people\u2019s lives has never been greater,\u201d he said this weekend. \u201cThey are fantastic creators and consumers, but the supportive structures need to be there for those who want to take up more unusual instruments. An increase in Saturday morning orchestra groups would be a great start, I think; then there is no need to worry about school curriculums.\u201d As a child Kenyon played the cello in a youth orchestra but when a spare bassoon became available, \u201cbeing an individualist\u201d, he opted to become one of just two bassoonists in the orchestra, rather than one of six cellists. \u201cI absolutely loved playing it. It has a rich and varied sound and it certainly doesn\u2019t deserve to be neglected,\u201d he said. \u201cThe bassoon used to be characterised as the joker of the orchestra but its beauty is evident in the opening solo of Stravinsky\u2019s The Rite of Spring.\u201d Schemes such as the 25-year-old LSO Discovery project, which is run with the Barbican and reaches out to children in the London area, are doing crucial work, and, Kenyon said, when Sir Simon Rattle returns from Berlin to lead the London Symphony Orchestra in 2017, this educational mission will be a priority. Meanwhile, In Harmony, an English music programme founded by cellist Julian Lloyd Webber and based on Venezuela\u2019s acclaimed El Sistema music teaching scheme, runs events across the country. North of the border, Big Noise, Sistema Scotland, does similar work and is championed by Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti. Van Sambeek can credit his mother for his discovery of the bassoon. \u201cI had a smart mother and she realised I wanted to play the saxophone because it looks sexy,\u201d he said. \u201cI was collecting golden shiny instruments at the time.\u201d So she took her son to listen behind the door at the local music school and asked him to choose an instrument solely on its sound. \u201cIt was very clear the bassoon was the most appealing. The sax I didn\u2019t even recognise, but thought was horrible.\u201d He defines the bassoon as a modest instrument that you cannot always hear clearly in the orchestra. \u201cIt cannot be picked out. It completely disappears and it also attracts modest personalities too, although I would be the exception.\u201d Those who learn to play the bassoon vouch for its positive impact on their lives. Jennifer Webb, 27, learned as a child in Leeds in 2004 as part of the city council\u2019s Bass Line Project, aimed at giving access to disadvantaged children. \u201cThe whole remit was to promote instruments that were less popular,\u201d said Webb. \u201cI came from a single-parent family on a council estate and the bassoon and the lessons were free. Although I am not a professional musician, I still play a lot and I know others from that scheme have gone on to the Royal Northern College of Music, the Birmingham Conservatoire or the Guildhall in London.\u201d Webb teaches English in Leeds now but still plays both the bassoon and the cello. \u201cI find a lot of the children I teach don\u2019t even recognise the cello.

Twelve miles west is the university city of Davis. It\u2019s not a typical American city; it\u2019s in thrall to the bicycle. Squint and you could be in the Netherlands: people dot around on bikes. Schoolchildren. Students. Professors. Bank managers. There are bike paths on the University of California Davis campus and in the city, the civic symbol of which is a penny-farthing. Cycling in Davis is not cultish: it\u2019s ordinary, no special clothing required. In most American cities, the modal share for cycling struggles to reach 2%; in Davis it\u2019s 20%. That\u2019s well on the bike path to 25%, the average modal share for cycling in the Netherlands.  The campus, cheek-by-jowl with the city, is car-free. There are excellent rail connections to Sacramento, San Jose and San Francisco and, with a free bus service for students and university staff, it\u2019s easy to live without a car in Davis. It\u2019s even easier when your intra-urban travel can also be done swiftly and safely on a bicycle. In the 1960s and 1970s, when the rest of America was building only for cars, Davis built for bicycles. A heady mix of factors created a bike culture: a pancake-flat topography, dogged citizen activism, and a political buy-in.     In the 1960s and 1970s, when the rest of America was building only for cars, Davis built for bicycles       Cycling in Davis is ordinary, no special clothing required.  Photograph: Carlton Reid    Davis didn\u2019t measure bicycle use in the 1960s or 1970s, but, with a share of 30% in 1980, it would be safe to assume the modal share was far higher in the preceding two decades. Legendary landscape photographer Ansel Adams catalogued in a 1966 photo series how the Davis campus once hummed with cyclists. One of his black-and-white photographs shows a parking stand with hundreds of bicycles, students riding to and fro on either side. It\u2019s one of the most unAmerican photographs imaginable.  The photo series and the cycling infrastructure were commissioned by Emil Mrak, who, in 1959, was made chancellor of the University of California\u2019s Davis campus, which was to be expanded. The expansion involved increasing the student population from 2,000 to 10,000 (it\u2019s now 30,000). The city could cope with an influx of 8,000 people but would have struggled to accommodate 8,000 cars. The bicycle-loving chancellor directed architects to \u201cplan for a bicycle-riding, tree-lined campus\u201d. Prospective students were told not to bring cars but to buy bicycles.  A married couple on the academic staff had spent time in the Netherlands, and they formed a small but persistent action group to press for Mrak\u2019s vision to be implemented by the city, too. One letter to civic authorities chided, \u201cWhere the leaders have no vision, the people perish.\u201d  Car-use was restricted on campus, with drop-down barriers and a ban on student car ownership (this is still in force). Bicycle routes were striped on the roads to the 37-block downtown core. Further chivvying from the action group led to the creation in 1967 of bicycle paths separated from cars by concrete curbing, normal for the Netherlands but a first for America. Use of bicycles boomed. On an early-1970s cycle map, a tagline was added by the city\u2019s business leaders: \u201cDavis: The Bicycle Capital of America.\u201d     Bike riders on the campus of University of California, Davis circa 1960.  Photograph: UC Davis Archive    Today, 98% of the main streets in Davis have some form of bicycle provision. Cycle use is highest on the campus, with 50% modal share (lecture rooms are distant, timings tight). When 7,000 or so new students arrive each October, many struggle to cope during their freshman induction days \u2013 upperclassmen students gather at campus intersections and cheer as newbies wobble into each other on the bicycle-specific traffic circles.   Related: How Groningen invented a cycling template for cities all over the world    But for all its spacious and separated bicycle paths, its bike parking corrals with free air and use of tools, and its continued self-proclamation as the bicycle capital of America, Davis is becoming less and less of a paradise for pedalling. Cycling\u2019s modal share in the City of Davis dropped to as low as 14 percent in 2007, with the slack taken up by car and public bus use. When, in 2009, the US Bicycling Hall of Fame wanted to relocate from Somerville, New Jersey, it chose Davis but, if Davis thought securing this prestigious body would arrest cycling\u2019s slide, it was mistaken.  In the Hall of Fame\u2019s basement museum, I met with David Takemoto-Weerts, the bicycle coordinator at UC Davis since 1987. He\u2019s a cycling enthusiast, attracted to the city because of its bike culture. It pains him to see cycling\u2019s decline and he\u2019s not entirely sure why a small, warm and flat city with such a well-connected and safe bicycle network should have halved its cycling modal share since the 1970s. By rights, cycling should be booming in Davis as it is elsewhere in the US; Boulder in Colorado is likely to soon overtake Davis as the bicycle capital of America. (Boulder has 160 miles of bike paths, and \u2013 to rub salt in Davis\u2019s wound \u2013 it recently hired Dave \u201cDK\u201d Kemp, the former bicycle coordinator of the City of Davis, an expert at raising state funds for cycling projects.) Takemoto-Weerts said the city of Davis is too \u201ctimid\u201d when planning for cycling, guilty of resting on its laurels, while Boulder has created ambitious bicycle programmes and marketed its bike path network.     Plans for a new Dutch-style junction in Davis. Photograph: City of Davis    Like other Davis cycling experts I talked to, Takemoto-Weerts credits the \u201cgolden age\u201d of cycling in Davis to Dave Pelz, who became the public works director for the city in 1968. It was Pelz, with a remit from pro-cycling politicians, who built the bike paths and created educational programmes such as \u201cMr Smartspokes\u201d, a talking bicycle that toured the city\u2019s elementary schools. When Pelz (and Mr Smartspokes) retired in 1999, a great deal of fizz went out of the city\u2019s provision for cycling. \u201cThe city backed away from its commitment to cycling that it had exhibited under Pelz,\u201d agreed Takemoto-Weerts. \u201cIt may never return to the golden age we enjoyed under Dave and his crew.\u201d      Cycling is so ingrained in Davis that the city symbol is a penny farthing    This is an opinion shared by Ted Buehler, author of the only rigorous study into Davis\u2019 cycling history. Via Skype, he told me that cycling had been the norm for almost every student and university staffer in the 1970s, but that since the 1980s the city\u2019s lacklustre promotion of the bicycle had dented cycling\u2019s popularity. \u201cA lot of students stopped riding bikes, and now ride the bus or drive a car,\u201d complained Buehler, who moved to become a bicycle advocate in Portland, Oregon. Pulling on his beard, he added: \u201cEven though Davis appears to be a magical place, it doesn\u2019t create a strong culture of people who are excited about riding their bikes.\u201d But this could be about to change. A reinvigorated campaign group \u2013 Davis Bicycles! \u2013 has been working hard to elevate the profile of cycling in the city and on the campus.  \u201cDavis Bicycles! has done an enormous amount of research to push for better bicycle infrastructure,\u201d argued Buehler. \u201cWhen there were plans for yet another car-parking garage, members of Davis Bicycles went out at all times of the day and night to measure the use of the existing parking garages. They demonstrated that there were always parking spaces available for motorists \u2013 the City of Davis eventually scrapped its plans, saving taxpayers $30m.\u201d (Davis Bicycles is also PR savvy about who collects its data \u2013 one of its latest travel surveys is being conducted by girl scouts with clipboards.)     Despite its well-connected bicycle network, Davis\u2019s cycling modal share has halved since the 70s. Photograph: Carlton Reid    Meredith Glaser, a student at UC Davis between 2001 and 2005, says the city needs to show its appreciation of cyclists if it wants to retain its boast as being the bicycle capital of America.  \u201cOther cities have built \u2018wow\u2019 infrastructure, such as the Cykelslangen bridge [\u201ccycle snake\u201d] in Copenhagen, or the Hovenring in Eindhoven. These iconic pieces of cycle infrastructure make people go on detours to get to them, and make them feel loved and cared for,\u201d said Glaser, who is now the Amsterdam-based officer for Denmark\u2019s Copenhagenize cycle-infrastructure consultancy.  \u201cDavis has too little ambition,\u201d worries Glaser. \u201cIt has not built any \u2018thank-you\u2019 bridges \u2013 which say: \u2018Thank you for cycling, thank you for your efficiency.\u2019\u201d That\u2019s no longer true, says Earl Bossard, an urban-planning professor at San Jose State University, California, and a Davis resident since 1986. Davis is starting to think big, he claims. It is building a \u201cDutch-style\u201d traffic intersection, one of North America\u2019s first (an intersection in Vancouver, Canada, offering separation for cyclists from motor traffic, is usually incorrectly credited as the first such intersection in North America). The Covell intersection in Davis is opening later in the summer \u2013 it was designed by the Dutch Cycling Embassy, a commercial agency of the Dutch government, and Mobycon, a Dutch \u201cplace-making\u201d consultancy.    Related: People power: the secret to Montreal's success as a bike-friendly city    I met with Bossard at the University of Amsterdam on the Planning the Cycling City summer school, billed as the world\u2019s first university course on cycling. Bossard, who sits on the Davis transportation commission, said his adopted city is waking up to the fact it will have to up the ante if it truly wants to increase cycling\u2019s modal share. In the last 20 years, city engineers have devoted too much time, energy and money to the needs of motorists, he says. (After a cycling activist measured the one-lane road in front of City Hall and argued that a bike lane could be accommodated, City of Davis engineers instead carved out two lanes for motorists.) But the focus on motorists could change soon: the next mayor is a bicycle activist, and he even campaigned for votes from a cargo bicycle. Robb Davis \u2013 no relation to the city \u2013 takes office in 2016 and he may strengthen cycling provision in Davis. Bossard said voters knew the mayor-to-be was a cycling advocate.  \u201cDavis\u2019s original cycling culture in the 1960s was the result of citizen campaigning that led to political leadership,\u201d said Bossard. \u201cRobb Davis is a mix of both.

Only a few budding actors stop, whisper and stare in awe at Manfred Karge and his great silver mane. Karge, now 77, has been called \u201cEast Germany\u2019s Orson Welles\u201d or \u201cthe Brandenburg Beckett\u201d \u2013 though those aren\u2019t comparisons he is comfortable with. \u201cDon\u2019t get me wrong,\u201d he says, as we take our seats in the theatre\u2019s sweltering beer garden, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t want to compare myself to Beckett. As a playwright, I was always the opposite. Beckett knew exactly how he wanted his plays to be performed. Mine don\u2019t even have stage directions.\u201d Given such a lack of authorial ego, it seems even more remarkable that, when Karge eventually departs the stage for good, he\u2019ll leave behind at least one of the great modern classics of European theatre. Man to Man was originally written in the summer of 1982 as a favour to Lore Brunner, Karge\u2019s Austrian partner, a veteran ensemble-player who had always wanted a solo piece. An urban legend, relayed by a friend, served as the premise: in the middle of Weimar Republic-era depression, Ella Gericke assumes the identity of her deceased husband Max in order to hold on to his job as a crane operator, precariously manoeuvring around a world of sweat, machismo and cheap liquor.     Poster for the Traverse production of Man to Man starring Tilda Swinton.    Only years after the play had premiered in Bochum, in December 1982, did Karge receive a newspaper cutting in the post that showed that his play was in fact based on a true story: the real Ella had managed to keep up her act for a total of 12 years. \u201cAnd I thought I had merely been claiming the privilege of literature to show her deception as such a perfect act.\u201d A 1987 production of the play, at the Traverse in Edinburgh, launched the career of Tilda Swinton: her cross-dressing masterclass in a film version five years later led to Sally Potter casting her in Orlando. Man on Man lived on even after Brunner died in 2002: by Karge\u2019s own reckoning, it has been performed \u201con nearly every continent\u201d, with new productions currently showing in Stockholm, Amsterdam, Johannesburg, Budapest and Istanbul.      Margaret Ann Bain in Man to Man, which will be at the Edinburgh festival this month. Photograph: Polly Thomas      I've never been interested in the lives of kings and queens. Films about Hitler bore me; we know the top Nazis were pigs    And there\u2019s another new adaptation opening this week at the Edinburgh festival. In the 1980s, part of the appeal of Karge\u2019s monologue was that it breathed new life into a dying genre: working-class theatre. \u201cAlmost all of the 15 plays I have written are about little people,\u201d he says. \u201cI have never been interested in the lives of kings and queens. All those films about Hitler, they just bore me: we all know the Nazis at the top were pigs. To me, the most interesting thing about the Nazi period is how the working-class people coped.\u201d In Ella Gericke\u2019s case, coping with National Socialism requires the same cold-hearted pragmatism that led her to assume her husband\u2019s identity. In one scene, the dialogue describes the grey walls of a cell: we assume Gericke has been caught out and ended up in prison \u2013 until we realise that she is not the prisoner, but the guard. To dodge the draft, Karge\u2019s cross-dressing anti-hero has joined the Nazis\u2019 paramilitary arm, the SA. But while Man to Man is unmistakably a play about working life, it rises above kitchen-sink realism, mixing working-class slang with expressionist poetry and Goethe quotation, all the while pursuing a question that remains relevant even in 2015: if human beings under capitalism are solely defined by their employment status, does their gender, personality, and emotional life matter at all? Bertolt Brecht\u2019s short story The Job, based on the same true-life story as Man to Man, puts it succinctly: \u201cWoman became man within days, via the same route that man had become man over the course of millennia: the process of production.\u201d    Middle classes are interested in working-class struggles because they worry about losing their status and slipping down    Can you still make plays about working-class struggles when your paying audience is made up of a much wealthier segment of society? \u201cThe middle classes,\u201d says Karge, \u201care interested in these struggles because they always worry about losing their status and slipping down the pecking order. But, of course, it is a problem for playwrights interested in working-class life that we don\u2019t always have the audience we wish for. It was different back when the Berliner Ensemble first opened. You had whole factory brigades or school classes going to the theatre. A ticket used to cost 1.50 East German marks. Now people pay \u20ac40.\u201d Brecht has been a constant presence in Karge\u2019s career, even though the two men never met. Born in the Brandenburg region in 1938, Karge was talent-spotted by the playwright\u2019s second wife Helene \u201cHelli\u201d Weigel while still at drama school and asked to join the cast at the Berliner Ensemble, where he stayed for an initial nine-year stint, then returned for good in 1993. Originally set up by the administrators of the Soviet-occupied zone to invigorate East Berlin\u2019s cultural life, the theatre became a militant bastion of Brechtian philosophy after his death in 1956: a cultural temple dedicated to preserving the idea of epic theatre, which maintained that audiences should not be fooled into empathy by the empty trappings of realism, but jerked into critical reflection, if not action.     Manfred Karge in Berlin. Photograph: Matthias Horn    If one were to believe the ensemble\u2019s outgoing director, that original spirit is currently more under threat than ever, particularly by the kind of postmodern showmanship that many veterans fear will be imported to the city by the new head of Berlin\u2019s experimental Volksb\u00fchne theatre, ex-Tate Modern director Chris Dercon. \u201cWe are currently witnessing European theatre\u2019s Waterloo,\u201d Claus Peymann recently told German weekly Die Zeit, \u201cand sadly Germany has become the main battlefield.\u201d Karge is decidedly less terrified. The strict rules of epic theatre may have been what first attracted him to Brecht, but he found breaking them easier than many people do now. In his first year at the ensemble, he and a friend convinced Weigel to let them put on Brecht\u2019s opera Rise and Fall of the City of Mahagonny, only to find that the Songspiel version he wanted to stage had been lost in the archives. So Karge simply wrote a \u201cBrecht-sounding\u201d script around the songs and put on the show, only confessing the extent of his poetic licence to Weigel after the premiere had been a success. In the late 1960s, Karge and some others left because they felt the theatre was interpreting its founding father\u2019s work too literally. They began practising Brechtian theatre \u2013 but without Brechtian plays \u2013 at other venues around Germany, as the playwright\u2019s relatives were withholding performance rights. Brecht\u2019s theatre, Karge says, has always been less about theorising than about boiling things down to basics. \u201cWhat I learnt from Brecht is that every performance starts from zero. Brecht never tried to confuse people \u2013 he wanted to tell stories and be understood.\u201d He goes on: \u201cI still notice a difference between actors who started out in West Germany and those who were trained in the East. The western actors are often trying to express their inner state: their acting is less about telling a story than discovering yourself. In the east, our training was much more focused on technique.\u201d Even now, he says, members of the audience come up to him after shows to praise him for his elocution. Is Brecht\u2019s idea of epic theatre still relevant? \u201cIt is \u2013 because the subjects Brecht was interested in are still alive. That\u2019s not necessarily good news for Brecht: he might have been happy to find out that the problems he was interested in are no longer around. If there was no more capitalism, Saint Joan of the Stockyards wouldn\u2019t need to be performed. But it\u2019s all still here, that\u2019s the mad thing. We are going in circles. The excesses of capitalism aren\u2019t dying down \u2013 they are getting worse and worse. And until that stops, Brecht remains relevant.\u201d  Man to Man is at Underbelly Potterrow, Edinburgh, 5-31 August  \u2022 This article was amended on 4 August 2015 because Manfred Karge is 77, not 87 as an earlier version said.", "sentences": ["Man on Man lived on even after Brunner died in 2002: by Karge\u2019s own reckoning, it has been performed \u201con nearly every continent\u201d, with new productions currently showing in Stockholm, Amsterdam, Johannesburg, Budapest and Istanbul."], "title": "'The Brandenburg Beckett': last living link with German theatre's golden age", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/03/manfred-karge-theatre-berliner-ensemble-man-to-man-interview", "tags": ["Edinburgh festival 2015", "Theatre", "Bertolt Brecht", "Germany", "Stage", "Culture", "Edinburgh festival", "Festivals", "Volksb\u00fchne"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-08-04T12:40:41Z", "article": "KFC: \u201cBrothers\u201d (Starts at 00:06) \u2013 UK Designed to highlight KFC\u2019s new Mediterranean range, this advert focuses on the relationship between two brothers \u2013 Arturo and his older sibling, whom he idolises.

Four teams were involved, all with close links to association football clubs: Derby County, Preston North End, Aston Villa and Stoke City. Baseball flourished particularly in the north-east with clubs in Middlesbrough, Darlington, Stockton and Thornaby. In 1933 a National Baseball Association was founded and professional leagues were formed in Lancashire and Yorkshire. The first professional games got under way in 1936, with the Yorkshire League made up of sides from Leeds, Bradford, Sheffield, Hull, Dewsbury, Wakefield and Scarborough. Games regularly attracted 5,000 spectators \u2013 and, on occasion, as many as 10,000. More information can be found here.

Make a business case Networks of sensors need expensive infrastructure, and there\u2019s currently little precedent around whether it\u2019s the taxpayer or industry that foots the bill. A vision that adds economic, social and environmental value could be key to attracting investment from tech companies, universities and elsewhere. \u201cThe tech is probably the easiest bit to fix,\u201d says Stuart Higgins, of Cisco UK &amp; Ireland. \u201cWho pays, who drives the changes, who should be involved \u2013 they are all bigger challenges.\u201d 5. Share data and incentivise innovation Open data is critical to fostering an ecosystem for innovation, says Tomas Holderness, a chartered geographer and Smart research fellow. But the public sector, with its entrenched ideas around data protection, can be reluctant to share. Mara Balestrini, partner at Ideas for Change, says city councils should see it as \u201cinvestment rather than expenditure: I\u2019m sure it would cost them a lot more to solve public transport issues by themselves\u201d.   Related: Without a strong business case, councils risk wasting money on internet of things    6. Design from the bottom up \u201cWe have learned from past technology failures that large projects are doomed but breaking down projects into bite-size pieces often works better,\u201d says Yodit Stanton, founder and CEO of OpenSensor.io. Fujisawa, Japan, is an example of a city designed from the ground up. \u201cIt\u2019s a disaster proof, self-sufficient town with self-cleaning homes that generates its own electricity,\u201d says Cisco\u2019s Higgins. \u201cEven the streets are designed to reduce energy consumption \u2013 they follow the shape of a leaf to help natural airflow and reduce the need for AC.\u201d 7. Tread carefully \u201cWe are still in the early days of exploring the costs and benefits of these technologies for society and business and perhaps a more cautious approach is needed,\u201d says George Roussos, a professor of pervasive computing at Birkbeck College, University of London. He warns of the complicated issues around privacy that need addressing. 8. Get politicians on board Political leaders are important for communicating the need for new tech, and assuaging citizens\u2019 concerns about safety and privacy. \u201cIt would be great to see politicians explain why they are spending our taxes on a smarter city,\u201d says Stefan Schurig, director of climate and energy at the World Future Council. \u201cDare I say they might even be able to justify why spending more on tech, even during times of ever-decreasing budgets, would deliver greater benefits.\u201d   Related: How safe is our public data in the internet of things?    9. Educate citizens A smart city will be irrelevant to most of its inhabitants unless they can learn how to use new technology, says Adam Dennett, lecturer in smart cities at UCL. Very few people can pull live data from an API or set up a new sensor network to monitor air pollution \u2013 but until more can, smart cities risk being \u201clittle more than a marketing tool for big business\u201d, he says. 10. Spread the word Nesta\u2019s Saunders, author of Rethinking smart cities from the ground up, calls for all cities to share evidence so that no one has to start from scratch: \u201cThis could be something as simple as blogging about the experience \u2026 but cities could also form networks, to share the lessons from their IoT pilots.\u201d There\u2019s enormous opportunity for new projects to rethink \u201cold paradigms of urban planning\u201d and \u201cleapfrog old tech\u201d, says Muggah, of the Igarape Institute \u2013 but he\u2019s alarmed by the separation between the collaboration going on in richer cities and that in the vast majority of cities and slums in Africa and Asia.

I\u2019ve seen plenty of terrific comedy shows there over the years, and I\u2019ll see more over the next month. But will any of us see a show that rewrites comedy\u2019s rules, that raises the bar or changes the artform\u2019s direction, announcing a whole new way of doing things? It does happen \u2013 I can think of a handful of occasions over the past 15 years when fringe-goers have felt the earth move, comedically speaking \u2013 going right back to my first fringe as the Guardian\u2019s comedy bod, when a certain Daniel Kitson also made his Edinburgh debut. I enjoyed Kitson\u2019s show that year \u2013 and the following, when he won the Perrier award \u2013 but his work wasn\u2019t as distinctive then as it has since become. The big event for me back then \u2013 and still one of my all-time fringe favourites \u2013 was Noble + Silver\u2019s everything-boggling multimedia floorshow, which dynamited the distinctions between situationist prank, art happening and comedy. (Fifteen years later, one-half of that act, Kim Noble, remains as transgressive as ever.) The following year, something extraordinary arrived from the opposite end of the spectrum, when Doug Stanhope made his UK debut. I hadn\u2019t then, and I still haven\u2019t, seen Stanhope\u2019s brand of scorching, devil-may-care, misanthropic-romantic standup done better than he did it that summer, although many have tried.     Absurdo-comic \u2026 Dutch standup Hans Teeuwen. Photograph: Murdo Macleod/Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    Cementing its place as the fringe\u2019s best room for comedy, the same venue where I saw Stanhope \u2013 the downstairs bar at the Tron \u2013 five years later hosted Hans Teeuwen, the sui generis Dutch absurdo-comic recently hailed by Bridget Christie in these pages. Teeuwen performed for only 15 minutes on a bill of Amsterdam standup, but he made a more vivid impression than anyone else on that year\u2019s fringe. In his hands, you get a sense of comedy\u2019s subversive capability. His shows are brilliantly constructed to confound your expectations \u2013 of content, of rhythm, of mood. Playful, dangerous, manipulative, he set a new standard for nonsense comedy, recognising that if it lacks sense it may yet have purpose, power and poise to burn. The emergence of Flight of the Conchords in 2003-04 felt special; Will Adamsdale\u2019s Jackson\u2019s Way, confounding everyone with his 2004 Perrier win and heralding the dawn of a new era of experimental theatrical comedy; Mark Watson\u2019s 24-hour (then 36-hour) shows, expanding the possibilities of how comedy on the fringe could present itself and what it could be. Then there were the classic straight standup shows, as diverse but unforgettable as Stewart Lee\u2019s 90s Comedian (2005) and Rhod Gilbert and the Award-Winning Mince Pie \u2013 still one of the plain funniest trad standup shows I\u2019ve seen on the fringe. I\u2019ve not always spotted the game-changers, of course: sometimes I\u2019m looking the other way; sometimes I\u2019m there, but not getting it. The first time I saw Doctor Brown, in a muggy cave off Niddry Street, I felt outside of an in-joke. The following year, I got it, and could see that mime \u2013 despised, naff mime \u2013 was being given a sly, sexy and interactive makeover for a whole new audience. The other fork-in-the-road moments in recent years concerned gender, and the new generation. The 2013 fringe made fools of everyone still writing fret pieces about the dearth of women in comedy, as Bridget Christie found her (feminist) voice, Adrienne Truscott debuted with her unmissable nugget of performance-art-meets-anti-sexist-comedy, and Sara Pascoe and Aisling Bea delivered two of the best pure standup sets on the fringe. That felt like a dam breaking. I wanted to say the same about the movement heralded by Bo Burnham and Liam Williams, two very different acts whose emergence over the last few years supplied two of the fiercest, smartest standup hours I\u2019ve seen. Their shared generational angst \u2013 desperate for something to believe in; frustrated that it\u2019s all been said; complicit in and kicking against the commodification of everything \u2013 threatened a new wave of dissenting, culturally savvy millennial comedy that hasn\u2019t quite materialised.     Live and direct \u2026 Aisling Bea at Edinburgh\u2019s Gilded Balloon. Photograph: Murdo Macleod    Then there\u2019s Pappy\u2019s Last Show Ever, probably the best (and certainly the most moving) sketch show I\u2019ve seen in 15 years, and which encouraged a great leap forward for creatively ambitious group comedy. We all reaped the benefit on last year\u2019s fringe, when young sketch comics pulled that artform into a series of twisty new shapes. I see good shows on tour all year round, but it\u2019s only on the fringe \u2013 comedy\u2019s annual explosion of new stuff \u2013 that you get these glimpses of the future, these sudden encounters with unheard-of new talents and styles, these moments when promising acts discover what they were born to say and do. Who will it be this year, and what will they be up to? I\u2019m heading up there today, butterflies in stomach, hoping to find out.", "sentences": ["Teeuwen performed for only 15 minutes on a bill of Amsterdam standup, but he made a more vivid impression than anyone else on that year\u2019s fringe."], "title": "Stand-out comedians: Edinburgh festival's game-changers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/aug/06/stand-out-comedy-edinburgh-festival-2015", "tags": ["Edinburgh festival 2015", "Stage", "Culture", "Comedy", "Comedy", "Edinburgh festival", "Hans Teeuwen"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-08-06T19:00:03Z", "article": "\u201cMen, it has been well said, think in herds; it will be seen that they go mad in herds, while they only recover their senses slowly, and one by one.\u201d Moving from the joyous musical stampede of last week\u2019s songs about farming to an entirely different herding instinct, come the words of Scottish writer and journalist Charles Mackay, from his classic study of history\u2019s key moments of mass hysteria, panic and frenzy - Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds (1841).

Well, his book actually highlights society\u2019s greedy periods of economic panic buying, such as those around the South Sea Bubble of 1711\u20131720, the Mississippi Company of 1719\u20131720, and the Dutch Tulip Mania of 1637, when fortunes were temporarily won, but mostly lost, over a new of tulip bulb that appeared to be priceless one week (10 times the average annual income of a skilled craftmen), but then was nothing more than an onion-bulb of pig food the next. It was all an overhyped illusion fuelled by frenzy and greed. And things certainly haven\u2019t changed in the modern era. Mackay also drew on the crusades of of Middle Ages to the witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, and all kinds of oddities, borne of public and private obsessions from London\u2019s Cock Lane ghost in 1762 to the work of alchemists all around Europe.

Mackay wasn\u2019t always right \u2013 he also thought railways were one just a passing fad in 1860 - but history repeats itself in many forms and frenzies, serious or trivial, are nothing new, from the 1950s era of McCarthy to that of McDonald\u2019s. Mind you, in the 1960s many thought the McCartney era, along with that of John Lennon, with the mania of screaming fans, was an evil, erroneous passing fad too, and a century earlier the same was said of Charles Darwin and his theory of evolution and natural selection.     Delusion, confusion, or just sheer excitement? Fab 4 fans in the 1960s. Photograph: PA Archive    But what might history reveal to be the illusions of subsequent decades? Sometimes some such delusions were obvious while they were still happening. The 1970s era is still now being uncovered as an era of dark secrets. But what of its musical mistakes?

So we don\u2019t tend to think of them as contemporaries. Yet Vincent van Gogh and Edvard Munch were born only a decade a part, the former in 1853 in the Netherlands, the latter 10 years later in Norway. In the 1880s they were among the many painters seeking a break from the old ways and both chose the same direction, exploring the path previously opened by the impressionists.   Related: The town that drove Van Gogh to art    So they could have met in Paris. Van Gogh arrived there in February 1886, never to leave France. Munch stayed in the capital in 1885, returning several times between 1889 and 1892. But having gone home for the summer, he was out of the country when Van Gogh committed suicide. Their paths never actually crossed, but we may nevertheless ponder what they might have said. They would certainly have spoken of Manet, Monet, Pissarro and the creator of neo-impressionism, Seurat. Van Gogh might have been the first to mention Gauguin to Munch. They would undoubtedly have agreed that the teaching at art school was terribly outdated. The backdrop for such an encounter might have been a Montmartre brasserie or somewhere closer to Saint-Cloud, where Munch was living in 1889. But this was not to be. Much later, however, Munch paid tribute to Van Gogh, suggesting a parallel between them. In autumn 1933 he wrote: \u201cDuring his short life, Van Gogh did not allow his flame to go out. Fire and embers were his brushes during the few years of his life, whilst he burned out for his art. I have thought, and wished \u2013 in the long term, with more money at my disposal than he had \u2013 to follow in his footsteps.\u201d At the time Munch had good reason to recall his fellow artist, for once again they had plenty in common. After diligently collecting their works from the start of the century onwards, German museums had begun taking them down. Both were soon condemned as \u201cdegenerate\u201d. So there are plenty of good reasons to exhibit their work jointly and see what sparks fly. Oddly enough this is the first time anyone has actually done so. Drawing on their own immense collections, enriched by loans from elsewhere in Europe and the United States, the Munch Museet in Oslo and Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam have joined forces to stage Van Gogh + Munch. The show is already open in Oslo and will move to Amsterdam in the autumn. It is divided into two parts, the first placing the two artists in the context of 1880 in order to show how they cast off convention, with diligent imitations and discreet harmony, somewhat sombre in the case of the Dutchman, nearly white with his Scandinavian counterpart. Unknowingly, they already agree on several points: no more subjects inspired by myth or religion, instead pictures from real life \u2013 farmers eating potatoes, a young woman sitting on her bed, a weaver, the local welfare office. These are everyday sights, but they stir anger or compassion. Neither painter seems concerned with flattering portraits, charming set pieces, tidy landscapes. The curators have judiciously added pieces by three uncompromising realists: Millet, Isra\u00ebls and Krohg.     Starry Night over the Rhone, painted 1888 by Vincent van Gogh - an influence on Munch. Photograph: Alamy    That works by Manet, Monet and Pissarro should appear just afterwards is equally pertinent. When Van Gogh and Munch first arrived in Paris they came face to face with a new way of representing the world, a way that was modern and direct. Formally this meant more striking chromatic contrasts, and therefore simpler, more compact shapes. Each brushstroke must be more definite, more visible making the surface of the picture rougher. There was no longer any question of suggestion, it was time to be assertive. Painting was not a matter of pleasing, it was a means of self-expression targeting anyone who happened to come within its range \u2013 an art to be felt by all, at the risk of upsetting the sensibility of those who imagined that they alone were qualified to judge. This conviction brought Van Gogh a series of setbacks, culminating in his demise. For years Munch met with public hostility and, although it did not kill him, he suffered periods of anxiety and depression. Having set forth this founding principle, the exhibition moves into its second part, which is far longer. It compares the techniques and effects by which, as Munch put it, it is possible to use fire and embers as his brushes. Here the question of colour is central. First Van Gogh, then Munch a little later, cast off the need to imitate the hues found in nature. The sky can be green, faces too. The ground may be violet, much as the trees. At nightfall forms are reduced to equivocal lines. On the other hand, when fully exposed to the sun they may shatter. The underlying lines need to be clear and unbroken for the representation of the world to hold up despite the chromatic shifts and explosions of light. Van Gogh refined his technique in superb India-ink drawings using either a pen or reed. Munch preferred woodcuts and sinuous watercolours. Both artists set out the structure of their compositions on paper, reaching visual paroxysm on canvas. In the case of Van Gogh this side of his work is well known, if only because the work he did at Arles and Auvers has achieved legendary status. The exhibition rightly provides a forcible reminder, but no one will be surprised. The situation is different for Munch, however well known the Scream, with its russet sky, may be. One of the merits of the show is to reveal the extent and variety of his experiments. Some of the works bear no resemblance to what was going on at the time. In 1907 he did a painting entitled Cupid and Psyche, in which a man and a woman face one another nude. Long strokes of colour \u2013 green, purple, red \u2013 run down their bodies. Other equally assertive strokes criss-cross behind them. But \u201cbehind\u201d suggests that there is space in this canvas: in fact there is none. The sense of oppression and confrontation are all in the surface of the painting. No one else was painting like this in 1907, not even Die Br\u00fccke, a group of young German expressionists led by Kirchner and Heckel. In 1905 they had laid claim to both Van Gogh and Munch as sources of common inspiration. Indeed, a snowy landscape by Munch from this period could be by Van Gogh, much as the Dutchman\u2019s Sower might be the work of the Norwegian. Sometimes the connection seems so obvious it must be deliberate: Munch\u2019s Starry Night of 1922-24 is a tribute to his fellow\u2019s Starry Night over the Rhone of 1888. There are striking similarities in some of their portraits too: the same composition, tight close-up view, disregard for any seductive charm, the same preference for tired faces, bony features with sunken eyes. Which brings us back to our starting point, the determination to strip bare the human condition, that of the painter with savage self-portraits and, just as brutally, that of his fellows. In 1908 Munch defined painting as a means of representing a powerful emotional state simply working from nature \u2013 or rather after nature seen under the influence of that powerful emotional state. Much as for Van Gogh painting was a terrible trial for the nerves.

Her mouth dangles in open curiosity. Too young to sit still, she shifts inside the stiff husk of her dress. She is so like the boy in the next picture \u2013 they both have the unformed features and white eyelashes of the young Boris Becker \u2013 you know they must be siblings, and sure enough this is the future George III and his sister. Clothes are the only details that push them back into the past. The artist they\u2019re staring at was a spectacle in his own right: the Swiss painter Jean-Etienne Liotard (1702-89), extravagantly bearded and dressed in Turkish costume after four years in Constantinople. His quick-fire genius for pastel portraiture had sent him all over the world. Yet his reputation dipped so deeply that this sparkling show of his work is the first ever held in this country, a neglect that seems more baffling with every portrait.    Modest in scale, they are powerfully candid, noticing the teenager\u2019s mute boredom and the dowager\u2019s weary sadness    Here\u2019s the actor David Garrick, keeping a twinkling eye on the audience even as his body turns to exit stage right, and his wife, Eva Marie, who lived to the age of 98, her secret surely the humour and serenity Liotard so beautifully records. Here is Lady Fawkener, supercilious, plump and sly, opposite her slim contemporary, Lady Somerset, lips parted, dress cut provocatively low. Simon Luttrell, founder of Dublin\u2019s Hellfire Club, remains a bully boy even in his oriental disguise. The wealthy Swiss Thellussons, delighted with each other, appear in matching jackets and smiles. If you didn\u2019t know that this countess would die of anaemia and that princess would live a long and sturdy life of outdoor pursuits, you would certainly guess it from Liotard\u2019s portraits. They come at you live and direct as camera images, with their photographic veracity \u2013 the wet lip, the unruly fringe, the soft under-hang of a double chin. But they are not exactly photographic, having a different light of truth altogether. Modest in scale, they are powerfully candid, noticing the teenager\u2019s mute boredom and the dowager\u2019s weary sadness, catching the embarrassed reluctance of those who would prefer not to be portrayed at all.     Liotard Laughing (Self-portrait), c.1770. Photograph: \u00a9 Mus\u00e9e d'art et d'histoire, Ville de Gen\u00e8vePhoto: Nathalie Sabato    Pastel is a fugitive medium, a gum-bound dust that can return to dust if not carefully protected. But in Liotard\u2019s hands it becomes suave, tactile and exceptionally fluent even in the tiniest details of eyelashes, stubble, the moist highlight in a pupil. His sittings were quick \u2013 pastel is the opposite of slow-drying oil \u2013 and the likenesses feel caught on the wing, yet also profoundly observant, as if the informality of each session (odd-looking artist sketching away on parchment) yielded an extra off-guard intimacy. Human nature is all around you in this show \u2013 people gape, blush, smile and withdraw, wink, frown, look sideways, downwards, askance; the superb curating allows for the sense of being surrounded by an 18th-century crowd, from crowned heads to noted beauties and Enlightenment intellectuals, all focused upon one figure \u2013 that of the artist. Liotard took a special delight in his own strangeness. Self-portraits show him pointing and laughing, opening up a huge gap-toothed smile (the teeth look wooden, the grin about to fall apart) and heavily swathed in Turkish clothes or towering fur hats. The beard turns into a vast nest, until he shaves it off at the age of 54 on marrying his much younger wife. An English critic once jeered that this beard was the real measure of his success, and it is true that Liotard\u2019s self-portraits were crucial to his fame. But he was a master of the telling gesture and expression in any case. Look at the portrait of his little daughter, cradling her doll, one finger raised in warning \u2013 hush, my baby is sleeping! The doll, of course, appears comically awake and alert.     Marie-Anne Fran\u00e7oise Liotard with a Doll, c1744. Photograph: \u00a9 Vienna Shonbrunn Palace    The son of French Huguenot refugees in Geneva, Liotard trained first as a miniaturist and then moved to Paris, Rome, Venice, Amsterdam and even Romania in search of new pastel commissions. His best patron was Empress Maria Theresa in Vienna, 11 of whose children he portrayed. Liotard worked colour into the back of his semi-transparent paper to enhance the lustre of these portraits; and even in their rigid period clothes, the distinct personalities of each child shine through. One of them is the pertinacious Marie-Antoinette. The empress carried these portraits everywhere on her travels, and perhaps something of their variety helps explain Liotard\u2019s subsequent decline. Here he is working in chalk; and he excelled in so many media. Sir Everard Fawkener, who he first met in Constantinople, is depicted in chalk, pastel, paint and even enamel (in miniature, sitting in his Mayfair house before losing all the money he made investing in the construction of Chelsea). Liotard worked on every scale, and the pastel, on top, shows Fawkener as a trompe l\u2019oeil antique medallion. But though in pastel he can look so nearly like his peers \u2013 Maurice Quentin de la Tour, Rosalba Carriera, Nattier, Chardin \u2013 what Liotard doesn\u2019t have is a fixed look. Each portrait comes fresh and new with each different sitter. And perhaps this is most evident in the Edinburgh show (transferring to London in the autumn, where it will expand to include still lifes) \u2013 in the ever-changing self-portraits. Here you see him both hilarious and head-in-hand, shadowed and melancholy like some late Rembrandt self-portrait. He draws himself drawing, flesh sinking, an old dressing-gowned sage. He even draws some of his own earlier sketches, casually stuck to a piece of wood beneath two mythological cameos as if to undercut them.

Duck-rabbit, absent-present, 2D/3D, he twists the mind\u2019s eye with paradoxical presentations    But what makes this show so fascinating is the evolution of the Dutchman\u2019s art. He begins with a coruscating woodcut of a cat, white hairs incised in black that the eye reads as inexplicably soft, and moves on to phosphorescent seas, vertiginous hilltop cities and the Moorish mosaics he saw in the Alhambra. Look at his masterwork, the four-metre Metamorphosis II, with its bewildering parade of fish turning into birds, hives to bees, panoramas to chess pieces, and you see the tessellations Escher discovered on his travels. Reality gets in everywhere (particularly the interiors of Dutch houses) but so does Escher\u2019s dark dreaming. Where does the view through the window become the landscape itself, when do the multiplying men turn into the city? These double-takes have their own poetic, not to say philosophical, significance. And though this is a frozen world, black and white and meticulously precise, it has to stay still so that your eyes can do the moving, relishing the perceptual rush.

It was a few hours past midnight on 11 January 2015; Pillai, a campaigner with Greenpeace India, knew that two full weeks of work awaited her in London. At check-in, she had secured an aisle seat, which made her happy. Now, as the official scanned her passport, Pillai sent idle texts to a colleague in Boston and pondered a plan to visit a friend in the north of England for the weekend.   Related: Sign up to the long read email    Behind the counter, the official reached for a square of paper and began taking notes. His name was VK Ojha, Pillai remembers, and he looked fresh and alert. He had a neat moustache and wore a white shirt and navy blue trousers. Minutes went by, and Ojha scribbled on. \u201cIs there a problem?\u201d Pillai asked. \u201cYes, ma\u2019am. Please wait here.\u201d Ojha vanished. From the next counter, a curious official asked for Pillai\u2019s name and, after typing it into his computer, said: \u201cGreenpeace?\u201d Pillai nodded. When Ojha returned, he led Pillai to an office run by the immigration authority. There, he asked Pillai for her passport and told her \u2013 most politely, Pillai remembers \u2013 that she couldn\u2019t leave the country. Pillai is a voluble person, and she spent the next four hours demanding explanations from immigration officials. She got none. When an Air India employee came by, he was asked to take Pillai\u2019s luggage off the plane, which terrified her. She thought: \u201cThey\u2019ll put drugs in my bags, and they\u2019ll say: \u2018This is why we\u2019re arresting you.\u2019\u201d Pillai was sure that the state was not beyond framing her. Since 2010, she had been part of a Greenpeace group that was protesting the government\u2019s decision to commission new coal mines in the woods of Mahan in central India. She was travelling to London, in fact, to talk to an informal group of British MPs about Mahan and about Essar Energy, an Indian power and fossil fuel giant incorporated in the UK in 2009 and listed briefly on the London Stock Exchange. Essar Energy was one of two companies licensed to mine in Mahan; Greenpeace argued that the filthy process of mining coal would pulverise acres of forest and displace thousands who lived in the area. The government took a dim view of these protests. Some of Pillai\u2019s colleagues had been arrested in Mahan on flimsy charges that never stuck. Police and intelligence agencies monitored the activists closely; Pillai was sure they were aware of her London trip. \u201cI know my phone has been tapped for years,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve had experiences [such as] getting on to a train from Delhi to go to Mahan, and even the people there don\u2019t know I\u2019m coming, but the police or the local intelligence people there will call these people in Mahan and say: \u2018Priya\u2019s coming, right?\u2019 I\u2019ve had bureaucrats tell me: \u2018You should be careful. You\u2019re under surveillance.\u2019\u201d     Greenpeace activist Priya Pillai addressing a protest meeting in Delhi.  Photograph: Hindustan Times via Getty Images    A senior immigration official, Sushma Sharma, came to talk to Ojha. Pillai could hear Sharma insisting: \u201cNo, I want a fax. Ask for a fax. I won\u2019t do it without a fax.\u201d Ojha sent off for written authorisation from the government to keep Pillai off her flight, and a fax duly arrived. Pillai marched into Sharma\u2019s cabin and said: \u201cI need to know what\u2019s happening.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s nothing personal against you,\u201d Sharma said. \u201cBut we have orders. Your name is part of a database. That is why I cannot allow you to travel.\u201d Pillai and Sharma argued until 8.30am, when Pillai got her passport back, now with a big red-and-blue \u201cOffload\u201d stamp inside. Despite Pillai\u2019s obvious anger, Sharma was patient, but she offered no further information. She only suggested, as Pillai was leaving the airport, that she complain to the Bureau of Immigration. Pillai did this but received no reply. Soon afterwards, though, the government told its version of the tale through anonymous sources, who confided to journalists that India\u2019s Intelligence Bureau (IB) had issued an order a couple of days before her trip, calling her \u201canti-national\u201d and instructing authorities to stop her at the airport. Two months after that incident, the Delhi high court declared that the IB order was illegal. During the hearing, the government argued that Pillai, had she gone to London, would have created a \u201cnegative image\u201d of her country, which might have discouraged prospective investments in India. The court dismissed this. Pillai\u2019s right to travel, the judge wrote, \u201ccannot be impeded only because it is not in sync with [the] policy perspective of the executive \u2026 Criticism, by an individual, may not be palatable; even so, it cannot be muzzled.\u201d Pillai\u2019s detention was the most visibly punitive episode in a year of high friction between the government and Greenpeace. Since May last year, when the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) swept to victory in the general election, Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s administration has cancelled the licences of nearly 9,000 NGOs receiving some measure of foreign funding, on the grounds that they filed their accounts irregularly. Other NGOs \u2013 including the Ford Foundation \u2013 were placed on a watchlist, so that every bit of money they received from overseas needed first to be cleared by the home ministry.   Related: Greenpeace India fears charity crackdown under Narendra Modi    A simmering suspicion of foreign influences is written deep into the BJP\u2019s nationalist DNA, and it plays marvellously with its most loyal voters \u2013 many of whom proclaim their belief, loudly and often, that western powers are eager to throttle India\u2019s rise. In particular, Modi \u2013 who steers his government with stifling control \u2013 has never hidden his distaste for NGOs and their \u201cfive-star activists\u201d, as he once labelled them. After three days of anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat in 2002, during which around 1,000 people died, NGOs led the accusations that Modi \u2013 then Gujarat\u2019s chief minister \u2013 abetted the murderous frenzy of Hindu mobs. In June, one of these NGOs, the Sabrang Trust, was placed under investigation for misusing Ford Foundation grants. Sabrang\u2019s co-founder, the activist Teesta Setalvad, had already been harried for several years by the Gujarat government; now she was accused of diverting the money to a publishing firm she owns and runs, and of embezzling funds to buy wine, a BlackBerry, wet wipes, nail clippers and a copy of the David Baldacci thriller Total Control. The prolonged raids and interrogations were so disproportionate to these alleged misdemeanours that they carried the acrid whiff of vendetta. Even within this hothouse of hostility, no organisation has been lavished with as much unwelcome attention as Greenpeace. State auditors turned up at one of its offices twice to sweat over its books, trying to spot irregularities; British and Australian campaigners were turned away from Indian airports after landing with valid visas; three separate tax notices claim it is millions of rupees in arrears. For a few torrid weeks in April and May, all the money that Greenpeace India had in its bank accounts \u2013 those receiving funds from its international parent, but also those holding funds raised in India \u2013 was frozen, asphyxiating its operations and raising the prospect of an imminent demise. When a court granted Greenpeace a reprieve by releasing its domestic funds, another government order placed its registration as an NGO under review. \u201cWe\u2019re very sure there\u2019s a pattern,\u201d Binu Jacob, Greenpeace India\u2019s fundraising director, told me. \u201cThey\u2019re getting all their mechanisms together to do this.\u201d Within the Indian glossary of political derision, the term for a certain sort of old-fashioned leftist is jholawala \u2013 after the modest cloth bag, with a long strap slung from shoulder to waist, in which such an individual might carry pamphlets to a protest march or poetry reading. The term applies to liberal intellectuals, NGO workers, and activists \u2013 not to mock their meagre finances, but to deflate the staged asceticism of people who are presumed to be well off. In the worldview of Modi and his supporters, the jholawalas are bracketed with other objects of suspicion: the entrenched power elites of Delhi; the liberal media and the politicians of the Congress party; Marxists and academics and foreigners who comment upon Indian affairs. It is not the ideologies or the credentials of these people that come under attack; it is their loyalties, which are suspected to be invested in each other, or in foreign governments, or in international bodies with shadowy agendas. This rhetoric against them has become rooted, knowingly and successfully, in the potent notion of trust. Judgments about who can be trusted to mean well for India, and who cannot, have become a crucial part of government policy.   earlier this year.\" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" />  A Greenpeace demonstaration in Bangaloreearlier this year. Photograph: Jagadeesh Nv/EPA/Corbis    * * * In May, I spent a few days at the main Greenpeace India office, which occupies all four floors of a squat building on a quiet street in the city of Bangalore, Karnataka. It was a strange, unsettled time. Greenpeace\u2019s funds had been frozen the previous month, and its executive director, Samit Aich, revealed that he had no money to pay salaries in June. Every morning, Greenpeace employees \u2013 nearly 340 of them across India \u2013 received an email update about the legal battle to wrest back their money. Campaigns had seized up. Nobody travelled anywhere. People still held meetings, in long rooms with names such as \u201cRosa\u201d and \u201cMandela\u201d; they tramped up and down the stairs, called donors and stared into their computers. But a sense of suspended animation was inescapable. I sat in a small room on the ground floor, talking to Greenpeace staffers about their organisation even as it seemed, day by day, to be melting away around us. The first inkling Aich had of the troubles ahead came in June 2014, when a 23-page Intelligence Bureau report on foreign-funded NGOs and their \u201cconcerted efforts \u2026 to \u2018take down\u2019 Indian development projects\u201d was leaked to the media. The report had been commissioned by the previous government, led by the Congress party. A PDF of the report that can be found online is marked \u201cSecret\u201d; it warns that NGOs are stalling new mines, power plants, genetically modified food and \u201cmega industrial projects\u201d. Foreign donors, the report alleges, disguise their funds \u201ccleverly \u2026 as donations for issues ranging from human rights, violence against women, caste discrimination, religious freedom, etc.\u201d Collectively, the report says, such NGOs drag down India\u2019s GDP growth by 2-3% annually. The authors do not offer the mathematics behind this claim. Greenpeace gets a section to itself: 12 bullet points under the heading \u201cAnti-coal activism\u201d, a catalogue of activities that aims for a bare, ominous tone but winds up including observations so plain that they could have been drawn from Greenpeace\u2019s own annual reports. (\u201cIn April 2013, Greenpeace supported and screened a documentary film, Coal Curse, directed by Paranjoy Guha Thakurta, on the harmful consequences of coal mining in Singrauli region.\u201d) The IB accuses Greenpeace of coordinating protests against coal mines and power plants. Its funds finance studies on health and pollution, and pay for activists to travel to conferences. Its headquarters \u201cregularly receive foreign experts. Recently, a group of cyber security experts upgraded its communication systems and installed sophisticated and encrypted software in its servers and computers.\u201d In this manner, the report first presents a small batch of facts and then quickly links them, through pure elision of evidence, to destructive intent. These NGOs, the IB believes, do not just happen to have objectives that conflict with the government\u2019s plans for development; rather, at the behest of foreign donors, they exert every sinew to slow the velocity of India\u2019s economy.   Related: Greenpeace bank accounts frozen by Indian government    The IB report was leaked the month after Modi was sworn in, having soundly defeated the Congress party. Jairam Ramesh, the Congress environment minister from 2009 to 2011, said he didn\u2019t know his government had commissioned the report, \u201cbut I\u2019m not surprised.\u201d Some of his colleagues were deeply suspicious of NGOs, he said. In 2012 and 2013, the Congress government led by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh had forbidden nearly 5,000 NGOs from receiving foreign funds, around the time that protests were mounting over a nuclear power project in Tamil Nadu. Between his government and Modi\u2019s, Ramesh said, there was a strain of continuity, a constituency devoted to economic growth at all costs. It was almost as if the state felt a duty, then but even more now, to bear down with force upon any obstacle perceived to be seriously impeding its plans for economic progress. Ramesh himself had turned from an agnostic on environmental issues into a believer. He first told me that his experience with Greenpeace \u201cwas a disaster\u201d. Its campaigns are aggressive and given to hyperbole, he said: \u201cToo high-decibel, too vocal. Greenpeace\u2019s philosophy is that you cannot work with governments, you have to confront governments. That\u2019s a debatable philosophy.\u201d But as we spoke, he softened, saying that he had fine relations with its executives and that Greenpeace was \u201ca necessary nuisance\u201d. For nurturing these views, Ramesh came to be seen as \u201canti-growth\u201d within his own government. Other ministers squabbled with him: \u201cI was called a jholawala minister.\u201d But this was healthy, he said. \u201cWe had different viewpoints, but ultimately the NGOs had access to us. You have to learn to deal with conflict democratically. Now that access to government has stopped, and [NGOs] are seen as an active roadblock to development. The environment ministry is closed.\u201d Aich told me, similarly, that Modi\u2019s government offered no fronts for engagement at all. A short man with slowly silvering hair, Aich talks in a fast staccato, his voice getting higher as he approaches the end of each sentence. When I met him, he had been with Greenpeace for 11 years, seven of those as executive director. In that time, he said, he has never encountered such a tight-lipped, peremptory administration. Last June, after the IB report was leaked, Greenpeace India received some money from its parent in Amsterdam, but was told by its bank that the funds could not be released without the home ministry\u2019s approval. The government had given Aich no advance intimation about blocking this funding channel; when he wrote to the ministry, he was rebuffed with silence. All told, over the year, \u201cI\u2019ve written umpteen letters to the ministry. At least 15 or 20 letters, maybe more. There\u2019s been no response. Nothing at all.\u201d Any communication Greenpeace has received has been in the nature of an order or a notice. The first arrived in September 2014, just as the high court in Delhi began hearing Greenpeace\u2019s petition to access its stopped funds, with the news that a home ministry team would inspect Greenpeace\u2019s books in its office in Chennai, Tamil Nadu. Over four days, three officials trawled through ledgers and receipts; it appeared to Binu Jacob, who guided them through a decade\u2019s worth of documents, that they were conducting not so much an exercise in accounting as in Talmudic interpretation.     A boy takes a bath under a tap near a polluted water channel in Kolkata. Photograph: Rupak de Chowdhuri/Reuters    \u201cThey told us as much: \u2018See, this is the rule book, and we interpret it, and this is what we interpret,\u2019\u201d Jacob said. For instance, citing one rule that allows an NGO to use foreign funds for campaign work but not for more than 50% of administrative costs, the officials argued that air tickets were administrative costs. So was the consultancy fee for a soil analysis expert. \u201cThey were defining core campaigning so narrowly. I argued: \u2018How would somebody go do a campaign if he can\u2019t get to the location?\u2019\u201d Another day, they wondered why a staffer received 100,000 rupees (\u00a31,011) as a monthly salary. \u201cThey said: \u2018Isn\u2019t that too much for an NGO?\u2019\u201d Not really, Jacob replied. After all, marketing professionals selling toothpaste earn 500,000 rupees a month, so why should somebody doing research work not earn 100,000? \u201cThey said: \u2018Binu, these arguments are not valid. We feel, for an NGO, this is too much.\u2019 And they noted it,\u201d Jacob said. He shook his head slowly, almost in marvel. \u201cIt was nit-picking.\u201d    Every day, you find people crying in the office, saying they\u2019re just too stressed and they can\u2019t take it any more  Priya Pillai     The report of this inspection, issued after two months, bristles with trivialities. Greenpeace largely works out of its Bangalore premises, even though its registered office is in Chennai; this was interpreted as a violation of an arcane rule requiring NGOs to inform the government of changes in headquarters. Two reimbursements of an employee\u2019s accommodation expenses \u2013 for 10,036 and 12,549 rupees \u2013 were seen as fraudulent because both bills showed the same dates of stay. Aich\u2019s salary was judged to be exorbitant. Some observations were minor infringements of India\u2019s Foreign Contributions Regulation Act (FCRA), whose strictures are so myriad and so comprehensive in their vagueness that they can effect death by bureaucratic strangulation. Jacob helped draft a response, explaining and rebutting where he could. Given the minor scale of the FCRA infringements, Greenpeace expected only raps on its knuckles or, at worst, a levy of small fines. Then, for a while, Priya Pillai\u2019s run-in with the Delhi airport authorities consumed everyone\u2019s attention. When the government responded, on 9 April, it was with a four-page order that took no note of Greenpeace\u2019s clarifications, and ordered a freeze on all of its bank accounts. The timings of these actions, Jacob observed, have been tidy and relentless, one following the other like deft clockwork. The September inspection occurred soon after a court began to consider the first interruption of Greenpeace\u2019s foreign funding. The April notice blocking Greenpeace\u2019s domestic and foreign-currency bank accounts was issued after another court verdict ruled in favour of Pillai in the matter of her detention. In late May, the Delhi high court unblocked Greenpeace\u2019s domestic funds; the next day, officials from the state of Tamil Nadu, where Greenpeace is registered, announced another audit of its books. That report claimed to have identified a string of financial irregularities \u2013 one per year between 2005 and 2012 \u2013 and threatened to cancel Greenpeace\u2019s registration altogether. Yet again, Greenpeace approached the court, arguing that its accounts were woefully misread, and that there was no \u201capplication of mind\u201d in the officials\u2019 examination. Greenpeace\u2019s well-publicised troubles have made Jacob\u2019s job difficult. Its sympathisers have stuck with them, and even given more, but some potential new donors have dithered. \u201cThere was this guy I met, with an IT background, just back after his US stint. He had a lot of rich friends and sounded enthusiastic.\u201d Jacob thought he might give at least 200,000 rupees. Then the donor wondered if supporting an NGO so transparently unpopular with the government was a wise move. \u201cHe backed out.\u201d   Related: Why India is captured by carbon | David Rose    Similarly, when Jacob\u2019s team tried opening a new bank account in May, at least four banks dodged their business. \u201cNobody\u2019s saying: \u2018Don\u2019t open an account for Greenpeace.\u2019 No bank would say: \u2018I won\u2019t open an account for you.\u2019 But somebody would say off the record: \u2018I\u2019m telling you, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s going to happen,\u2019\u201d Jacob said. One bank indicated it would have to seek the home ministry\u2019s permission. \u201cThey\u2019re scared.\u201d Finally, Greenpeace persuaded a small bank, with just one branch, to accept its money. \u201cThey don\u2019t even have online banking. It\u2019s like, you know, your grandfather\u2019s bank.\u201d Amid all this struggle, Greenpeace went through an internal convulsion. In February, a former staffer alleged in a Facebook post that she had been raped by a colleague and sexually harassed several times during her stint with Greenpeace. The organisation, she said, failed to deal with her complaints of harassment, so she had never filed a formal charge of rape. Aich apologised, admitted to mistakes and promised to make amends, but the pressure mounted until he resigned in June. This fresh tribulation, in tandem with Greenpeace\u2019s ongoing distress, fried everyone\u2019s nerves, Pillai told me the week before Aich quit. We were in Greenpeace\u2019s Delhi office, where she is based. \u201cI haven\u2019t slept for three days. Sometimes I\u2019m emotional, sometimes I\u2019m rational. It\u2019s really stressful. Every day, you find two or three people crying in the office, saying they\u2019re just too stressed, and that they can\u2019t take this any more.\u201d * * * Among the most ambiguous of the rules in India\u2019s Foreign Contributions Regulations Act is one that prevents any foreign-funded NGO from comporting itself as an \u201corganisation of a political nature\u201d. Political parties fall within this classification, but so do organisations thought to be propagating an ideology or conducting \u201cpolitical activities\u201d. In theory, there is little manoeuvring room within this rule for NGOs in a country where the state is a huge, powerful presence in every station between birth and death. To propose to change a life for the better is to posit that the government has failed. The personal is political everywhere, but nowhere more than in India.     Greenpeace activists protesting in Delhi in 2012.  Photograph: Altaf Qadri/AP    I asked Pillai if she thought Greenpeace\u2019s activities were political. \u201cEvery issue on this earth is political,\u201d she said. \u201cWomen\u2019s rights is a political issue. Child rights is a political issue. Energy policy in this country is a hugely political issue. But we don\u2019t get engaged in mainstream politics, party politics.\u201d For months, I tried to approach some of the arms of the government, wanting to understand what they viewed as legitimate and illegitimate NGO activity. Soon after Modi\u2019s election, his administration became known for being thoroughly watertight, letting no information leak and keeping reporters at bay. But upon sustained exertion, the boards started to give. On the other hand, Essar and Hindalco, the companies whose mining plans in Mahan had been disrupted by Greenpeace, proved more taciturn. An Essar representative told me that his company would not participate in this story; no one from Hindalco responded. Sudhanshu Trivedi, a BJP spokesperson, met me in a five-star hotel, in a hushed bar with the sort of tinkling music that sounds as if it is made by flipping coins into glassware. Trivedi is a composed man with heavy-lidded eyes and an unexcitable manner of speech. He insisted, with as much emphasis as his languor would allow, that NGOs were free to do whatever work they chose, as long as they complied with the law. The government, he said, had only deregistered NGOs that had not filed their tax returns in years. Greenpeace was a different matter: \u201cThey were selectively targeting those projects that were of great national importance for industrial growth and development. It\u2019s a very thin line between creating environmental awareness and creating social unrest.\u201d The government was also concerned that the foreign money flowing in to Greenpeace was being misused or improperly accounted. He was unclear on the technicalities, but he was confident that Greenpeace\u2019s dubious finances were the source of its trouble. When I noted that the government had not been able to gather enough evidence to suspend Greenpeace outright, he shrugged and changed the subject. I asked Trivedi about Pillai. Why was she stopped from going to London? \u201cBecause she had already visited twice,\u201d he said, as if he was a nanny whose ward pined for the candy shop. \u201cThis was the third visit.\u201d I found out later that this was correct; Pillai had visited the UK twice when she had been working for Oxfam. \u201cBut she can visit any number of times,\u201d I said. \u201cIt\u2019s a free country.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s OK. But you are going to meet British MPs, your objective is not clear, you are unable to comply with the clarifications which were asked of you, and again you want to go. So some suspicion arises.\u201d In fact, as I learned, the government did not contact Pillai at all before her trip, whether to seek clarifications or to tell her she could not travel. A home ministry official, who asked not to be named, insisted that this had been the government\u2019s only mistake. The decision to stop Pillai\u2019s trip was taken three days before her scheduled departure: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t locate her earlier,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd it was the weekend. So we could only do it at the airport.\u201d Apart from that, the official argued, the government\u2019s logic was perfectly lucid. \u201cWe have our own system of inputs. We received some inputs that she\u2019d made some statements on overseas trips.\u201d The intent of these statements, he said, was \u201cto denigrate our country globally. So if your activities, whether inside the country or outside, are found to be incompatible with the government\u2019s view, it can take action.\u201d He tried, very sincerely, to persuade me of the strength of this argument. Greenpeace, as an international NGO, was a guest in India, he said. \u201cA guest should know his limitations.\u201d Within government circles, I frequently heard the view that Greenpeace\u2019s motives are malign. Modi came to power on a din of promises about industrial growth and economic progress; to raise concerns that differ with these particular visions of growth and progress is to run the risk of being regarded as anti-national. \u201cIn Mahan, they tried to stop a project after it was already commissioned,\u201d an environment ministry official told me. \u201cThat suggests an agenda, that they are anti-development.\u201d Last year, the supreme court cancelled a host of coal mining licences \u2013 including the one for Mahan \u2013 because of corruption in the auction process. When Modi\u2019s government set up a new auction in March, it left Mahan out, pulling its forests back under protection. I pointed this out, suggesting that Greenpeace had been justified in opposing the licence. \u201cYes,\u201d the official said, \u201cbut Mahan can always be revived. India deserves its development. And there\u2019s an agenda to stop it.\u201d Here it was again, the reflexive invocation of malevolence. To encounter it on social media, that amplifier of acrimony, was one thing; to run into it in a serious conversation with a government official, and to think that it informed policy, felt far more troubling.   Related: Greenpeace India crackdown: US seeks 'clarification' on action against groups    One evening, I met Prakash Javadekar, India\u2019s environment minister, in his office, interrupting him in the middle of a snack of diced papaya. For activists, Javadekar\u2019s tenure has been distressing. The government has peeled away several safeguards that protect forests and people who live around them, lifted a moratorium on new industries in eight areas designated as \u201ccritically polluted,\u201d and reconfigured regulatory authorities to shrink the role of independent voices. More than once, I heard the remark that Javadekar measures his ministry\u2019s value by how speedily it approves new projects and not how effectively it protects the environment. This was the case in our conversation. Javadekar told me that he had taken care of pendency \u2013 the numerous cases awaiting clearances \u2013 and moved many procedures online. Only secondly, he said, \u201cWe\u2019ve taken more care for nature than the earlier regime.\u201d He counted off items on his fingers: the introduction of an air pollution monitoring system, a revision of emission norms and a bill to plant trees in degraded forest areas. I asked him how NGOs such as Greenpeace fit into his plans for environmental management. \u201cThere are thousands of NGOs with whom we partner,\u201d he said. \u201cMany schools, many colleges. Yesterday, I was in the district of Chitrakoot, and more than 2,000 youths from four NGOs participated in a river-cleaning scheme.\u201d Greenpeace had fallen afoul only of the home ministry: \u201cAs far as we\u2019re concerned, we\u2019re talking to everybody. There\u2019s no issue.\u201d Did Greenpeace do any good work in India? \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Javadekar replied. \u201cBut your ministry must have tracked the work they do.\u201d \u201cWe track thousands of NGOs that do field work,\u201d he said. When I asked if Greenpeace was one of them, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. We must have given \u2026 we have taken their help. I take criticism also. I\u2019m always open.\u201d I persisted. \u201cDon\u2019t you think an NGO like Greenpeace brings any benefit to your field?\u201d \u201cI really don\u2019t know about Greenpeace,\u201d Javadekar said, his face impassive. \u201cBut they\u2019re such a big player in your field.\u201d \u201cNo, but there are thousands of NGOs, baba.\u201d His ministry, he said, focuses on working with those that are active on the ground. \u201cAnd not so much with Greenpeace?\u201d \u201cNo, I\u2019ve not said anything.\u201d   Related: Greenpeace India admits failures after staff claims of rape, sexual harassment    Javadekar became animated again when I inquired if he had a tough job. He did, he said, although his government believed that economic progress and environmental protection could coexist. He raised a point that India has made frequently and successfully at international forums: that poorer countries must be allowed to depend on fossil fuels to lift people out of poverty. \u201cThe principle of equity says that every citizen of mine deserves development \u2013 his or her carbon space. We have 17% of the world\u2019s population, and 17% of the world\u2019s cattle, but only 2.5% of the world\u2019s land mass. So asking the west to vacate carbon space is a real challenge.\u201d * * * Greenpeace has never been popular with governments; in fact, its activists strain to be unpopular, stopping aircraft from taking off, busting into power stations, or breaking the law in other ways. In 2013, Russia arrested 30 Greenpeace activists in the Arctic for trying to board a Gazprom oilrig. Last year, Greenpeace ran into criticism for damaging the Nazca Lines, an ancient set of etchings in the Peruvian desert, during an ill-judged protest. In Australia, Greenpeace risks losing its status as a tax-deductible society, as it has done in Canada and New Zealand. The rationale behind these disqualifications is similar to the Indian government\u2019s grouses with Greenpeace. A New Zealand judge, in 2011, found that Greenpeace\u2019s \u201cpolitical activities \u2026 cannot be regarded as \u2018merely ancillary\u2019 to Greenpeace\u2019s charitable purposes\u201d. The same year, Stephen Harper, Canada\u2019s prime minister, worried that \u201csignificant American interests\u201d were pouring money into environmental groups to stop projects including an oil pipeline. In all likelihood, Greenpeace \u2013 and other campaigning groups \u2013 will face these situations increasingly in the coming years. As in India at the moment, the pressures upon governments to ramp up economic growth and to drain every ounce of extractable resource out of the earth are immense. Simultaneously, the environment edges closer to peril. For anyone who has breathed the air of Delhi or Mumbai, or witnessed the alarming degradation of the country\u2019s water bodies, or understood how Indian governments and crony capitalists connive to bypass environmental laws, the need for NGOs seems obvious, even urgent. Activists fire themselves up to be bolder and louder. Collisions with the state are inevitable. In dealing with Greenpeace, though, the Indian government has been clumsy and heavy-handed, achieving nothing except a display of intolerance for dissent. To harp upon the dangers of Greenpeace\u2019s foreign funding, for instance, seems trivial: only 60m rupees (\u00a3606,000) out of its rough annual budget of 260m rupees (\u00a34.75m) comes from overseas. In comparison, Essar \u2013 whose leaked emails have shown a propensity to bestow favours upon politicians \u2013 had planned to invest roughly 40bn rupees (\u00a3404m) in two coal-fired power plants in Mahan.    All the heat and noise of Modi\u2019s actions against Greenpeace has drowned out debates about growth in India    But perhaps the heaviness of hand is deliberate, one person in Delhi\u2019s NGO community suggested. (\u201cYou can\u2019t quote me,\u201d he cautioned. \u201cWe get foreign funding too.\u201d) The government is signalling to industry and \u201cto a core of voters that indulges in conspiratorial nationalism: \u2018See how we\u2019ve taken on these purveyors of false ideologies?\u2019\u201d he said. These \u201cfalse ideologies\u201d could find their champions in any number of people and groups the government regards as its opponents: ardent environmentalists, rival politicians, media houses, non-profits, social media warriors, critics of Hindu nationalism. In an instance from last week, the government issued notices to three television channels, threatening to kick them off air for broadcasting interviews that had criticised the execution of a convicted terrorist; the interviews, the notices rumbled, \u201ccast aspersions on the integrity\u201d of the judiciary. The result of harassment of this type, this person said, \u201cis that people fear this government more\u201d. Meanwhile, all the heat and noise of the government\u2019s actions against Greenpeace has drowned out the truly consequential debates about growth and environmental protection in India. Sejal Worah, the programme director of the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in India, said that Greenpeace is effective at pulling issues into public attention, but that it does not acknowledge the complications of what people want. \u201cWhen I talk to people in villages about conservation, there\u2019s a real pushback from people on the ground, who\u2019re basically saying: \u2018We want development. At this point in time, we see the environment and forests and forest conservation and all that stuff as simply holding us back from developing,\u2019\u201d Worah said. \u201cThere\u2019s an impatience, and it\u2019s scary, this groundswell of people who\u2019re saying: \u2018You\u2019re sitting in your air-conditioned room, and you\u2019re telling us we can\u2019t have a road to our village because of a few hundred trees being cut.\u2019\u201d Given this, Worah said, an obdurate stance against coal, for instance, is not practical. \u201cGreenpeace is usually black or white.\u201d The WWF, on the other hand, spent more than a year internally debating its global position on coal. \u201cWe go through this whole process of consultations, understanding what each country\u2019s context is, and then we come up with a complicated three-pager which says: \u2018This is the thing, we don\u2019t like coal, but for developing countries, this is the phase-out period\u2019, and so on. What we don\u2019t have, as a result, is a Greenpeace-type, jump-out-there statement saying: \u2018No coal.\u2019\u201d The intransigence of its positions can spark some doubt about how Greenpeace India makes decisions. This doubt, said Ambuj Sagar, a professor at the Indian Institute of Technology in Delhi, has nothing to do with the paranoid perception of some vast global plan to derail India\u2019s economy. Rather, Sagar, who studies environmental policy issues, worries that Greenpeace International formulates a plain, one-size-fits-all agenda, without considering the needs of different countries. During a conference in Bali in 2007, he recalled by way of example, Greenpeace India released a report titled Hiding Behind the Poor, claiming India\u2019s per-capita emissions figures masked the voraciousness with which rich Indians consume carbon.   in Mumbai last year. \" width=\"666\" height=\"1000\" class=\"gu-image\" />  A Greenpeace protest against Essar Energyin Mumbai last year.  Photograph: Divyakant Solanki/EPA/Corbis    \u201cI had a flaming row with them, sitting in a bar,\u201d Sagar said. The title applied perfectly, he argued \u2013 but only if the report dealt with how wealthy western countries hid behind poorer developing ones. \u201cMost rich Indians emit like typical middle-class Americans, at most. They don\u2019t have three cars or centralised heating.\u201d After the shouting match, one Greenpeace staffer came up to Sagar and admitted that the idea for the report had come from Greenpeace International. \u201cSo these issues are really complex, and I often find them misrepresented,\u201d Sagar said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to put coal on a pedestal. It\u2019s a shitty and horrible energy resource. I\u2019d like us to have no coal if possible. But we don\u2019t have anything else.\u201d * * * In early July, I returned to Bangalore to find the Greenpeace building draped with two vertical banners, worn like bright yellow braces. One read: \u201cDEMOCRACY\u201d, the other \u201cFREE SPEECH\u201d. I stood looking at them, talking to a staffer. \u201cThey were hung by our action team, which includes a few women,\u201d she said. \u201cSo a crowd collected when that was happening, because they were fascinated to see these women doing this. But they\u2019ve been trained to scale buildings.\u201d \u201cReally?\u201d I asked. \u201cOf course,\u201d she said, laughing. She referred to a famous Greenpeace stunt from January 2014, in which 12 activists in tiger costumes draped a banner reading \u201cWe Kill Forests\u201d upon the 180-foot glass facade of Essar\u2019s headquarters in Mumbai. \u201cHow else would we scale an Essar building?\u201d In the ground-floor conference room, I met Vinuta Gopal and her daughter, who is not yet two. Gopal, who has been with Greenpeace since it began working in India in 2001, had switched her contract to a consultancy after the birth of her daughter, to gain a more flexible schedule. But Aich had resigned the previous week, so Gopal returned full-time as one of two interim directors. Her daughter now came to the office every day; during our conversation, she applied herself diligently to a Kit-Kat and then, replete, stretched out on her mother\u2019s lap for a nap. Having heard so many people criticise Greenpeace for its adamant stances, I asked Gopal if, on an issue such as coal, her organisation had misjudged its communications. In fact, she replied, the bluntness was part of the strategy. \u201cOur position is that India needs to transition away from coal, not that India needs to stop using coal,\u201d she said. \u201cGreenpeace isn\u2019t saying: \u2018Shut down all your coal plants.\u2019 That\u2019s unreasonable. But what people get from us is our banners and our photographs. A banner will say \u2018Forests Not Coal\u2019, so it seems the message is India should protect all its forests and keep all its coal in the ground.\u201d Was it not a burden for Greenpeace to be constantly judged by its stark messaging and its confrontational activism? Gopal thought about this. \u201cGreenpeace certainly has to reinvent itself,\u201d she said, slowly. \u201cIt\u2019s something we\u2019re working on across the globe. Merely hanging off a building or a power plant isn\u2019t going to make a difference. It has to be arguments that people believe in, investigations, expos\u00e9s. Ultimately, it\u2019s going to be the power of the people that brings about change, not a small group saying: \u2018This is the way things should be.\u2019\u201d But the messaging \u201cisn\u2019t something you dismiss. Otherwise, why would we be in the position we\u2019re in, facing a crackdown?\u201d The weeks leading up to my meeting with Gopal had been the hardest Greenpeace India had ever faced. The storm over the sexual harassment charges had blown high; Aich had quit; Greenpeace\u2019s registration was newly imperilled. Morale had plummeted. In all likelihood, the shakedown of Greenpeace, and of other civil society groups, will continue. It is in the character of this government to persecute its adversaries, and the convolutions of the law provide many ways for the state to install difficulties in their paths. Keeping up both the appetite and the funds to continue fighting was \u201cthe real challenge\u201d, Gopal said. \u201cBut now we\u2019re no longer shocked by anything that happens to us. We\u2019ve gotten used to expecting trouble.\u201d Samanth Subramanian is the India correspondent for The National and the author of This Divided Island: Stories from the Sri Lankan War \u2022 Follow the Long Read on Twitter at @gdnlongread, or sign up to the long read weekly email here", "sentences": ["Last June, after the IB report was leaked, Greenpeace India received some money from its parent in Amsterdam, but was told by its bank that the funds could not be released without the home ministry\u2019s approval."], "title": "India\u2019s war on Greenpeace | Samanth Subramanian", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/11/indias-war-on-greenpeace", "tags": ["India", "Greenpeace", "Narendra Modi", "Politics", "Environment", "South and Central Asia", "World news", "Environmental activism"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-08-11T12:46:42Z", "article": "Things tend to slow down in Europe in August, and the newsroom here in King\u2019s Cross usually follows suit.

Related: Airport VAT row: customers threatening to not show boarding passes    How do they do this? Retailers on the flight-side of airport security gates are treated as exporters by the taxman. Anything they sell for use outside the European Union is not subject to VAT, so could be sold to a consumer without the tax being added. This means that someone buying suncream for a holiday in Brazil or an Amazon Kindle they intend to read on a flight to Australia should pay less than someone buying the same items for a trip within Europe. However, some retailers are charging a single price for customers, regardless of where they are travelling. Customers are asked to produce a boarding pass when they buy something, but rather than getting a discount if it shows they are travelling outside Europe, the information is being used by the shop to save it money.  Do all retailers do this? No, but many of the big high street names do. Boots, WH Smiths and Dixons all charge a similar price for goods sold in the airport to the prices they charge in normal stores. The VAT they are not paying on sales made to those travelling to outside the EU is not passed on, even though they have information from customers\u2019 boarding cards. Are we talking about duty-free goods? No, although sometimes VAT-free and duty-free sales get talked about as one and the same thing. Duty-free purchases involve cigarettes, tobacco and spirits \u2013 goods to which the government applies separate taxes. These can also be treated as exports and sold without any taxes to travellers heading to countries outside the EU. Are retailers passing on the full savings on duty-free goods?  It has been claimed that some aren\u2019t. If the product is genuinely duty free there should be two separate prices on display. If not, and you are travelling outside the EU, you are not getting the full reduction. How much do they make out of it? It is impossible to say how much they make in total, but with VAT at 20%, on each sale they can pocket just under 17% of the price paid by every shopper travelling beyond the EU. Two years ago the average spend at Heathrow airport was just under \u00a339 per passenger.   Related: 'These shops have been very naughty': passengers react to airport VAT row    What does the boarding pass do? It is used by the retailer to prove that the sale qualified for the VAT reduction. When the retailer does its tax return it has to have evidence of how many sales were zero-rated, and by scanning your boarding pass it can record which ones were. Is the saving available to any traveller? It should be. The rules around airport shopping mean that the 0% rate on goods applies to the items, not the people buying them. Every year some 50 million passengers fly in and out of the UK to and from non-EU destinations. Travellers from outside the EU can reclaim VAT on purchases they make in the UK from retailers displaying a \u201ctax free shopping\u201d sign. In this case the money ends up in the hands of the shopper.  What if it\u2019s something I am going to use before I fly? It doesn\u2019t matter. Restaurants and caterers are not subject to the export rules (although much food is VAT-free anyway), but if you buy a packet of sweets from WH Smiths, it will qualify. Should I be getting a discount on everything I buy airside? Not on everything. Books, magazines and children\u2019s clothes, for example, are not subject to VAT wherever you buy them so there is no saving to make. However, on the electronic goods and cosmetics sold in most duty-free shops there should be a discount if your destination is outside the EU. Can you refuse to show your boarding pass? Many consumers are saying that they will refuse to show their boarding pass to retailers in protest against the news that has emerged. A spokesman for HM Revenue &amp; Customs says: \u201cThere is nothing in VAT law to require the production of a boarding pass to purchase goods in airport shops, but without such evidence the supply cannot be zero-rated as an export.\u201d This means that withholding your boarding card will make it difficult, if not impossible, for the retailer to avoid the VAT payment.  Boots and WH Smiths has said that it is happy for travellers to refuse to show their cards. Some retailers have self-service checkouts which ask travellers to scan their boarding card, so to refuse you may have to queue up.  What about for duty-free shopping? That is different - HMRC says that retailers selling duty-free goods must check your travel documents. If you are buying alcohol or tobacco at the airport you will have to show your card. If you are in the same shop but only buying a big Toblerone or make-up, there is no legal requirement to prove where you are going.   What about other EU countries?  Practice varies. Amsterdam Schiphol, one of Europe\u2019s busy airports, insists that passengers show boarding cards for anything purchased behind passport control.  Spokesman Lukas Burgering said: \u201cThe system here in Netherlands is slightly different. We have one price, the non-VAT price, for all travellers behind passport control. We the airport pay the difference together with the shop holders. We give the customers the benefit of the VAT cut and pay the difference ourselves. Downtown you would have to pay VAT [21% in the Netherlands].  \u201cIf you fly outside the EU you would get this rate anyway. But we don\u2019t want two price tags on one item. You get the bargain of the lower VAT. And the only thing we want back as an airport is proof that you are a traveller by showing us your boarding pass.\u201d ", "sentences": ["Amsterdam Schiphol, one of Europe\u2019s busy airports, insists that passengers show boarding cards for anything purchased behind passport control."], "title": "VAT revolt Q&A: can I refuse to show my boarding pass?", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2015/aug/12/airport-vat-revolt-whats-behind-revolt", "tags": ["Tax", "Money", "Airline industry", "Business", "Heathrow airport", "Air transport", "Travel", "UK news", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-08-12T18:05:22Z", "article": "When was the last time you felt trepidation prior to eating in a restaurant? Not the social anxiety of a first date or dining with your boss, but a soup\u00e7on of nervousness about the food itself. I\u2019m at Fra\u00eeche, a cosy restaurant in Amsterdam\u2019s hip Jordaan district, where chefs and co-owners Noah Tucker and Tony Joseph are laying on an eight-course psychedelic dinner, $80 (\u00a350) a head, for 25 invited guests. Alhough each course has been carefully tested for taste and potency over the previous few months, it is the first time they have all been combined in one dinner. We are guinea pigs. But we\u2019re in safe hands. Tucker, a native New Yorker who relocated to Amsterdam, is a self-professed \u201chighly functional pothead\u201d. He has been cooking since the age of six, and attended culinary school on a US navy scholarship. Joseph is a specialist patissier from London who doesn\u2019t touch drugs. As a longtime resident of Amsterdam, I am au fait with the upcoming cannabis ingredients (though I admit to being flattened by dodgy hash brownies in the past). In addition to three types of hashish and four varieties of bud, there are psychedelic truffles, the kanna and the Syrian rue: herbal novelties I am unfamiliar with. Manas Akdag from Test Lab, the city\u2019s only non-governmental cannabis tester, is in effect our \u201cweed sommelier\u201d, and has advised the chefs which varieties work best with which dishes, explaining the difference between high-altitude Indica hashes from Nepal and Tibet, and low-altitude from Morocco, which weeds have high levels of THCV (fast-acting, short-lasting euphoric high) and other cannab-arcana. Is this safe? And is it legal? Well, yes and sort of. Amsterdam has a famously laissez-fumer approach to cannabis, but obviously those interested should refer to local laws and exercise personal judgment. It seems that kanna and rue are legal in Amsterdam, as are at least some truffles. Unlike the so-called legal highs coming out of China that have caused so much distress and political brouhaha, none of the herbs are toxic (many have medicinal qualities).     Foie gras and hash jus. Photograph: Floris Leeuwenberg    They have been supplied by Azarius, Europe\u2019s largest and oldest online supplier, which started in the 90s, pioneering the sale of magic mushrooms. It offers a veritable psychedelicatessen of traditional \u201csacred herbs\u201d from around the world, from betel nut to peyote cactus. It tests everything it sells, and the Dutch government analyses all its products, so we know we\u2019re not getting fake herbs, heavy-metal contamination or sprayed-on bathtub \u201cresearch chemicals\u201d. After Tucker\u2019s brief introduction, we tuck into the starter, a hamachi \u201cshashimi\u201d with smoked avocado and Red Angel dressing, fermented plum and a bacon and kanna-extract dashi. Red Angel is an Amsterdam-bred cannabis with a unique cannabinoid profile \u2013 high in psychoactive THC (15%) and counterbalancing cannabidiol (CBD; also 15%). It is designed to lift us \u2013 but not too high so early in the meal. Next up is wild salmon in a crust of toasted hemp seed, salsify with a fennel Syrian rue \u2013 intensely bitter, but pleasant here, cut with sweet liquorice. Tucker\u2019s fondness for fish is evident with the third dish: wild bass with lemon vinaigrette and Pineapple Kush cannabis, red grapefruit and chervil, accompanied by individual pillows of weed vapour that don\u2019t get us any higher, but do add to the ambience. By now, we\u2019ve relaxed and started getting to know our fellow diners \u2013 a smattering of grizzled old psychonauts like myself, plus artists and new-media types. No alcohol has been served, but the herbal alternatives are creating a mellow vibe. The Syrian rue has brought on a tingly body high that enhances our anticipation for the centrepiece: braised pork cheeks with psychedelic Hollandia truffles, smoked barley and a BBQ-style glaze that masks the funky truffle taste. Then boudin noir with egg yolk, broccoli, foie gras and hash sauce. I\u2019m losing track: was this with the Tibetan hash or the Moroccan Sunrise?     Hamachi \u2018shashimi\u2019 with cannabis dressing. Photograph: Floris Leeuwenberg    The truffles kick in and my appetite subsides. It\u2019s not as if the walls are melting, but rare-cooked venison in chocolate/hash sauce? My knife is getting heavy, the chocolate sauce looks weird. I am intensely aware of the feel of flesh in my mouth; it is tasty and I finish, but other plates remain half eaten. Shroomy hilarity reigns, until my table gets its first bailers. First one couple (on a Tinder date!), then another, when the woman suddenly feels tired. Our table has gaps and we\u2019re getting introspective, certainly compared with the raucousness on the other table of friends (we were advised to bring friends, and this is certainly challenging with strangers). Happily, the mood swings back up with the final courses \u2013 raspberry coulis doughnuts infused with cannabis vapour, and a chocolate fondant with hash butter and an avocado and white chocolate ganache. I cycle home, still buzzing, before sleeping soundly; the next day I wake feeling refreshed, not hungover. What have we eaten? It feels strange to refer to them as \u201cdrugs\u201d. All plants are little chemical factories, awash with complex substances that interact with our own neuropeptides, hormones and enzymes. All food has subtle effects on mood, from the vitalising scent of citrus to the mild boost of coffee. Psychedelic dining is not something you want to do every week, but for special occasions? Very much so. It is an exciting new direction for experimental chefs who are interested in taking a gastronomic approach to consciousness.     Pasta with hash puree. Photograph: Floris Leeuwenberg    Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) Needs little introduction. In culinary terms, something of a \u201cnose-to-tail\u201d herb, with leaves, seeds, flowers, concentrates and vapours. Contains dozens of cannabinoids, THC being the main psychoactive ingredient. In different combinations it can promote or inhibit appetite, be calming or energising. Its aromatic terpenes add anything from fruity to pine-y overtones. Kanna (Sceletium tortuosum) Succulent herb found in southern Africa, used by pastoralists and hunter-gatherers from prehistoric times. Dried leaves and stems are chewed and the saliva swallowed, or taken as tea, tincture, snuff or smoked. It tastes a little woody. Main active ingredient: mesembrine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor with antidepressant effects. Initial boost of energy and mood elevation, decreases anxiety; higher doses can cause euphoria, interpersonal ease and a meditative feeling; classified as an empathogen. Syrian rue (Peganum harmala) A perennial plant native to the eastern Mediterranean. Seeds have been used in folk medicine and spiritual practices of many cultures. May be the \u201csoma\u201d mentioned in a number of ancient texts. Its active harmine alkaloids temporarily inhibit the action of monoamine oxidase, slowing the body\u2019s breakdown of tryptamines, thereby strengthening and prolonging the effects of other drugs consumed, especially psilocybin. Magic truffles (Psilocybe hollandia) The underground sclerotia of mushrooms, commonly known as Philosopher\u2019s Stones. Raw, they taste a bit like tangy pickled walnuts. When the sale of dry and fresh mushrooms became illegal in the Netherlands in 2008, truffles slid into the market void. A sclerotia is not a mushroom, say mycological experts, and does not contravene the UN drug conventions, add lawyers. Main active ingredient: psilocybin, a tryptamine present in many species of mushroom. Hailed for its antidepressive action, truffles are being touted as \u201cthe new medicinal marihuana\u201d. \u2022 Tucker and Joseph are launching a crowdfunding campaign to fund a cookery book this autumn and a documentary film next year; email josephandtucker@gmail.com.", "sentences": ["I\u2019m at Fra\u00eeche, a cosy restaurant in Amsterdam\u2019s hip Jordaan district, where chefs and co-owners Noah Tucker and Tony Joseph are laying on an eight-course psychedelic dinner, $80 (\u00a350) a head, for 25 invited guests.", "Tucker, a native New Yorker who relocated to Amsterdam, is a self-professed \u201chighly functional pothead\u201d.", "As a longtime resident of Amsterdam, I am au fait with the upcoming cannabis ingredients (though I admit to being flattened by dodgy hash brownies in the past).", "Amsterdam has a famously laissez-fumer approach to cannabis, but obviously those interested should refer to local laws and exercise personal judgment.", "It seems that kanna and rue are legal in Amsterdam, as are at least some truffles.", "Red Angel is an Amsterdam-bred cannabis with a unique cannabinoid profile \u2013 high in psychoactive THC (15%) and counterbalancing cannabidiol (CBD; also 15%)."], "title": "Eight courses high and rising: Amsterdam's gourmet marijuana dining experience", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2015/aug/12/amsterdam-gourmet-marijuana-dining-experience-eight-courses-high", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style", "Restaurants", "Chefs", "Netherlands", "Cannabis", "Drugs"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-08-13T11:05:10Z", "article": "Advertising reflects society. More often than not, it presents an image built on traditional views of sexuality, gender identity and gender roles. However, in recent years, brands have been presenting a more diverse world view. The ads below are some of the best examples of LGBT representations from the industry. Some went viral, others prompted bomb threats. But what unifies them is a commitment to highlight LGBT people and challenge traditional thinking. 1. Ikea: Dining Room Table (1994)         Ikea\u2019s groundbreaking 90s ad featuring a gay couple buying a dining table.    In 1994, Ikea became the first brand to feature a gay couple in a national TV ad. This itself is a landmark, but what really makes the ad stand out is how casually the relationship is depicted. There\u2019s no shock factor or camp stereotyping (which would have been easy for an interior design company) but just an honest depiction of two guys buying a table. The recent wave of gay couples in adverts, especially in the US, can be traced back to this Ikea spot. However, the LGBT community is not uniquely made up of white, middle-class men. This is why the next three campaigns are noteworthy. 2. Barneys New York: Brothers, Sisters, Sons &amp; Daughters (2014)         An excerpt from Barneys New York spring 2014 campaign, directed by Bruce Weber.    Fashion brands are increasingly diversifying the models they use. Upscale department store Barneys New York set itself apart with its spring 2014 campaign that featured 17 transgender models. Not only did it provide the models with a platform to tell their stories and challenge preconceived notions and stereotypes, the retailer also donated 10% of one day\u2019s profits to two LGBT charities. 3. Google: City Gym (2015)         The story of Jacob and City Gym.    Transgender issues have become a cultural talking point in a way that we haven\u2019t seen before. This deeply powerful film from Google tells the story of Jacob and the gym that helped him during his transition. It deals with the subject matter in a frank and honest way and never feels exploitative. 4. Smirnoff: Voguing (2015)         Smirnoff\u2019s campaign celebrates the LGBT subculture of Voguing.    Our film for Smirnoff celebrates the LGBT subculture of Voguing \u2013 an artform whose very essence deconstructs traditional notions of gender and sexuality. The vibrancy and openness of this community is a perfect match for the brand. Also important is its diverse representation of LGBT people at the cutting edge of contemporary culture. 5. Anouk: Bold is Beautiful (2015)          The Anouk ad sparked a debate on equality in India.    In a country where homosexuality remains illegal, the importance of this Indian ad cannot be overplayed (although its creative execution is questionable). This is India\u2019s version of the Ikea ad above \u2013 an important leap forward, though a very safe one. Within days of its release, the ad went viral and sparked debate on equality in India. 6. Stonewall: Some people are gay. Get over it! (2009)     Stonewall\u2019s ad campaign is a modern classic. Photograph: Stonewall    A modern classic \u2013 bold, simple and iconic. It states an obvious human fact that verges on the banal, which is why it works so well. Gay people are not a deviant, marginalised \u2018other\u2019 \u2013 they\u2019re unremarkable, ordinary humans just like everyone else. Get over it. There we are: six ads that have broken stereotypes, challenged traditional thinking and helped drive LGBT awareness in mainstream culture. It\u2019s no coincidence over half were produced in the past few years. Advertising themes typically lag behind TV and film, and LGBT representation is no different. Now that we\u2019ve caught up, it\u2019s important to keep diversity at the forefront. Here\u2019s to a new and inclusive phase in mass communication.

In the popular imagination, he\u2019s made up of equal parts Jack Daniel\u2019s, amphetamine sulphate, Nazi memorabilia and extreme-velocity noise. The myths and legends cloak him as surely as the black shirt, the black jeans, the custom-made boots, the cowboy hat with its \u201cDeath or Glory\u201d insignia and the Iron Cross around his neck. Some of the legends he has tired of \u2013 he\u2019s fed up of being asked about being Jimi Hendrix\u2019s roadie, being sacked from Hawkwind \u2013 for what, at heart, appeared to be taking the wrong kind of drug (speed, rather than the hallucinogens the rest of the band preferred) \u2013 and about the Nazi memorabilia collection (anyone who has seen the documentary about him will know how extensive it is, seemingly taking up most of his apartment in West Hollywood).       Then there are the myths: the story that circulated school playgrounds in the early 1980s \u2013 that he had an orgy with all of the Nolan sisters backstage at Top of the Pops; or the one that he can\u2019t stop taking speed because his body would collapse without it (\u201cI won\u2019t talk about drugs,\u201d he says, gruffly, when I ask about it). And there are the stories from those who have encountered him: the member of the British rock band with an equal enthusiasm for chemicals who spent an afternoon nose-deep in powders with him at the Rainbow Bar &amp; Grill in LA, playing Tetris \u2013 \u201cI love it when I\u2019ve been playing for hours \u2026 that\u2019s when the swastikas start appearing,\u201d Lemmy is reputed to have said.     Lemmy performing with Hawkwind in Amsterdam, 1972. Photograph: Redferns/Gijsbert Hanekroot    The Lemmy who sits before me this afternoon to promote Mot\u00f6rhead\u2019s 22nd official studio album, Bad Magic, seems stripped of myths, though. In 2013, he underwent an operation to implant a cardioverter-defibrillator into his chest, a device that helps prevent an irregular heartbeat turning into no heartbeat. Then, shortly afterwards, he suffered a hematoma. Earlier this year, Mot\u00f6rhead were forced to cancel shows after he suffered a gastric illness. Four days before we meet, when Mot\u00f6rhead played at Glastonbury, they followed Ace of Spades with Overkill, but Lemmy continued to sing Ace of Spades. \u201cIt was a mental block,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve sung those songs so many times. First time I\u2019ve ever sung Ace of Spades to it, though. We did it the night before and it was fucking terrible, and I swore I\u2019d never do it again. But we did. Obviously.\u201d While the all-black uniform is present and correct this afternoon, Lemmy has lost a lot of weight, and appears pale and drawn. His hands aren\u2019t wholly steady, and he says that these days he has to walk with a stick because \u201cmy legs are fucked\u201d. Nevertheless, he insists: \u201cApparently I am still indestructible.\u201d He has changed his lifestyle \u2013 he\u2019s down to a pack of fags a week, and has swapped from Jack and Coke to vodka and orange, apparently to help with his diabetes, \u2013 though his assistant wonders whether swapping from one 40% spirit topped with sugar to another 40% spirit topped with sugar is really going to help. \u201cI like orange juice better,\u201d he says. \u201cSo, Coca-Cola can fuck off.\u201d A full bottle of Absolut is put in front of him for the interview, and a full bottle of Jack Daniels is given to me \u2013 which seems a bit optimistic, given Lemmy sets an interview limit of 25 minutes, which he will extend by five minutes if he likes the questions (we get up to 33 minutes).   Related: Lemmy: 10 of the best    Lemmy\u2019s approach to music \u2013 across his 40 years leading Mot\u00f6rhead, and the 10 years before that spent with Hawkwind, Sam Gopal, and the Rockin\u2019 Vickers \u2013 has been simple: it traces its roots back to Little Richard and the first wave of rock\u2019n\u2019roll. That\u2019s the music that fired him up with the desire to transcend his life in north Wales. \u201cRock\u2019n\u2019roll sounded like music from another planet,\u201d he says. \u201cThe first time around, we had people like Elvis, Little Richard, Chuck Berry, Jerry Lee Lewis \u2013 all them people. And they were gone within two years. Chuck Berry was in jail [for transporting a minor across a state line for immoral purposes]. Jerry Lee\u2019s career had been destroyed by the British press [for marrying his 13-year-old cousin]. Elvis was in the fucking army.\u201d He then ponders the early 60s and offers his summation: \u201cAnd then we got Bobby Rydell and all them cunts. It took us a couple of years to get rid of them, then the Beatles showed up. That was all right.\u201d Lemmy is at his most enthusiastic talking about the records and bands that enthused him a long, long time ago. The Birds, Ronnie Wood\u2019s mid-60s freakbeat band, whose arrangement of the Motown standard Leaving Here was a staple of Mot\u00f6rhead sets for many years; or Peter Green\u2019s Fleetwood Mac, whom he travelled round the country to see. He\u2019s withering about groups who were great and who he believes betrayed their talent. \u201cThe Who are fucked. I don\u2019t know why they still bother without John and Keith, you know? They should have broken up in 1978.\u201d Or Free, \u201cwho unfortunately became Bad Religion. Was it Bad Religion? No, Bad Company. That was a terrible thing.\u201d One of Bad Company\u2019s singles opened with the line: \u201cHere come the jesters, one, two, three / It\u2019s all part of my fantasy,\u201d and you can imagine Lemmy listening to it and demanding: \u201cJesters? What kind of fucking fantasy is that?\u201d       Though Mot\u00f6rhead are routinely hailed as the inventors of thrash metal, not least by thrash metal bands, Lemmy has always insisted they are a rock\u2019n\u2019roll group, and there\u2019s more to them than metal \u2013 they just happened to become aligned with metal at a point in the late 70s when it was becoming commercially successful, and they were swept along with it. But, for their first few years, they were more a monstrously overdriven version of the 60s bands Lemmy loved, covering John Mayall\u2019s I\u2019m Your Witchdoctor, Johnny Burnette\u2019s Train Kept a Rollin\u2019 and the Velvet Underground\u2019s I\u2019m Waiting for My Man, as well as Louie Louie and Leaving Here. With metal band Girlschool, they had a hit with a version of Johnny Kidd\u2019s old British rock\u2019n\u2019roll hit Please Don\u2019t Touch. Also, they emerged not from the hard-rock world, but from the west London underground squat scene that bequeathed the world Hawkwind, the Deviants and the Pink Fairies (whose Larry Wallis was in the first Mot\u00f6rhead lineup).   Related: Hawkwind: 'It was basically freak-out music'    \u201cI was half and half going in,\u201d Lemmy says of the split between being part underground and part hard rock, \u201cand then I became this monster. I was really at home with that squat scene, because I didn\u2019t have to pay rent. We was living in squats in Battersea when we started with Mot\u00f6rhead. And we lived with the Hell\u2019s Angels in this flat. They were always around.\u201d Mot\u00f6rhead were formed \u2013 he wanted to establish a British equivalent of MC5 \u2013 after Lemmy\u2019s expulsion from Hawkwind in 1975. He\u2019d been arrested in Canada for possession of cocaine, which turned out to be speed, meaning he wouldn\u2019t face a custodial sentence. But the band chucked him out, anyway, after five years during which he\u2019d sung on their only hit single, Silver Machine. He was furious and bitter at the time, but their decision was what enabled him to become the Lemmy the world knows and loves. He still took his revenge, though: \u201cI came home from America and fucked all their old ladies. Except for [Hawkwind frontman Dave] Brock\u2019s. I couldn\u2019t get his. I had a good time with all them chicks \u2013 they were really eager.\u201d     Lemmy performing with Mot\u00f6rhead at Glastonbury, where a \u2018mental block\u2019 saw him sing Ace of Spades when the rest of the band were playing Overkill. Photograph: WireImage/Shirlaine Forrest    The \u201cchicks\u201d have been one of the great boons of being a rock star. \u201cYou get all these birds fastening themselves upon you. And you get a lot of drinks and a lot of presents. So, it\u2019s pretty good. You get everything for free \u2013 I\u2019ve got money now and I never have to spend it.\u201d And, for Lemmy, it has never been all about the music, but it has never been all about the rest of it, either. \u201cI didn\u2019t really want to be in the lifestyle without the music. And I didn\u2019t want to be in the music without the lifestyle,\u201d he says.   Related: Mot\u00f6rhead at Glastonbury 2015 review \u2013 predictable but greasily effective    Rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u2019s changed now, he says. It\u2019s not as much fun as it was in the days when everything seemed a bit homemade and bands would come out of nowhere for 15 minutes of infamy. The days when he would spend his evening hopping between Dingwalls and the Music Machine in Camden Town, watching bands, catching up with friends \u2013 and drinking, taking speed and playing the fruit machines \u2013 were glorious times. Nowadays, in LA, he has even cut down on his visits to the Rainbow \u2013 he goes twice a week, and he doesn\u2019t miss it when he\u2019s not there. And, through it all, Mot\u00f6rhead rumble on, a reminder of rock\u2019n\u2019roll\u2019s primal scream, of the noise that a guitar, a bass and a drum kit can make when all their owners want to do is holler \u201cAwop-bopaloobop-alopbamboom\u201d. Death, he says, is the only thing that can stop them. \u201cAs long as I can walk the few yards from the back to the front of the stage without a stick,\u201d he says, then laughs wheezily. \u201cOr even if I do have to use a stick.\u201d Bad Magic is released on 28 August on UDR Music/Mot\u00f6rhead Music", "sentences": ["Lemmy performing with Hawkwind in Amsterdam, 1972."], "title": "Lemmy: \u2018Apparently I am still indestructible\u2019", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/aug/13/lemmy-apparently-i-am-still-indestructible-motorhead-album-bad-magic", "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Lemmy", "Culture", "Motorhead", "Metal"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-08-13T17:52:47Z", "article": "On Monday, Radio 1 cleared out its normal news schedule for a series of special reports \u2013 the sort they normally reserve for a rock-star death or a general election.

Six per cent of the UK\u2019s domestic product is generated by night-time businesses, which employ around 1.3 million people, up by 500,000 from 2002.   Related: What happened to the great London nightclubs?    Which is why some people were shocked this week when the report released to Radio 1 \u2013 from the Association of Licensed Multiple Retailers (ALMR), the group that represents venues \u2013 revealed that more than half of UK nightclubs have closed in the past 10 years. ALMR\u2019s chief executive, Kate Nicholls, said that, in some towns, \u201cthey are gone for good and we\u2019re never going to get them back\u201d. To those who have been trying to go clubbing in Britain, it will not come as a surprise. It might seem that this is a story of interest to a few druggy hedonists, but the deterioration of Britain\u2019s nightclubs has been ruthless. Clubs are the most vulnerable victims of gentrification because they are difficult to defend, seen by people who don\u2019t go to them as a public nuisance. In the past few years, hundreds of nightclubs have been shut in increasingly confrontational circumstances. Two years ago, 175 Metropolitan police officers raided the 250-capacity venue 93 Feet East in dramatic scenes that looked like something out of Iraq war film The Hurt Locker. They arrested only nine people, mostly for minor drug-possession offences, but the club had its licence immediately revoked and was closed for months, only reopening after a court overturned the decision. In Glasgow, police put onus on the Arches to comply with incredibly strict searches and security measures or face being shut down. The club said that they complied with everything asked of them, but the police still persuaded the council to limit the club to a midnight licence. This effectively made it financially impossible to run the club and the huge community arts centre that ran during the day. In north London, People\u2019s Club, which served African-Caribbean communities as well as holding Eternal, an old-style rave that hosted secret sets from Jamie XX and Evian Christ, was closed earlier this year after a long-running battle with Islington council. It ended up paying the council \u00a310,000 in costs after it appealed the decision to revoke its licence. There are so many stories likes these, where clubs are treated like a hooded teenager standing outside a shop, the authorities looking for any excuse to move them along. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly the smoking ban, in combination with a far lower tolerance of noise pollution,\u201d explains Andy Peyton, the promoter of XOYO, one of the last big clubs in London, when I ask how clubs are caught out. \u201cOne single noise complaint can lead to your licence being in jeopardy. It will never be ignored, however weak that noise complaint might be. The XOYO smoking area is tiny, but there\u2019s really no way to expand it. To have people smoking out front would end the club overnight.\u201d     Ravers at Liverpool\u2019s Cream nightclub. Photograph: Naki/PYMCA/REX Shutterstock    So, back to that paradox. With British nightclubs in peril, how can the night-time economy be growing? Look at any city centre and the answer is obvious. Where once there were clubs, now there are cocktail bars, fancy pubs with late licences, small-plate restaurants and gourmet street food. Now that most places shut at 1am, no one feels the need to stay out to 6am. It would be a mistake to lay the blame for club closures solely with the powers that be. The sadder truth is that the appetite for this kind of fun has diminished. When you\u2019re paying \u00a39,000 a year to go to university, it becomes harder to justify going out every night. Many young people in cities have to settle down with a partner sooner than they might have done, in order to share a bed and split the rent. And when you\u2019re living with your partner, you\u2019re probably more likely to go to the cinema than a techno night. Youth unemployment is at a 20-year high, which means there\u2019s less money to spend on going out, and those with work are often in low-paid roles that force them to take a second job, or have to work unsociable hours. For many, clocking off at 5pm on a Friday and being out of action all weekend isn\u2019t an option. Much safer to go to the pub, sink a few craft beers and save your big blowout for a festival in the summer. \u201cThis year, we\u2019ve had the most festivals ever in the UK,\u201d says Rob Casson, a manager at ticketing agency Skiddle and the promoter of Freeze events in Liverpool. \u201cPeople who buy their tickets for those in February or March can\u2019t afford to go out clubbing. If you\u2019re a student, unions put on very good parties which are really cheap. A pub can have a DJ in the corner with decent music and it\u2019s free and people are quite happy with that. The days of going to your usual club are gone.\u201d Casson books dance-music events in unusual venues \u2013 the Liverpool Cathedral, old psychiatric institutes \u2013 which he says are doing a roaring trade. A lot of his events are in the daytime, running until 10pm, with a \u201cpart two\u201d in a club for those who are keen. Across the country, it\u2019s a similar story, with one-off warehouse parties and day festivals booming while clubs suffer. But nightclubs play a role in society that\u2019s very different from warehouse parties or festivals. They provide a fixed location where people you know and people you would like to know come back every week. Clubs can provide an incredible sense of solidarity for anyone, but if you\u2019re gay, from an ethnic minority or just a social anomaly, nightclubs can be a lifeline of unimaginable importance. Fun, in this sense, is not just blind hedonism, it\u2019s security, escapism and a feeling of belonging; it\u2019s hard to think of anything else that can provide that. And the things that emerge from it can be spectacular. \u201cIt used to be that scenes would begin in a particular spot, with the Blue Note [now closed] and drum and bass, or Plastic People [now closed] and dubstep,\u201d Joe Ray, from British dance duo Nero, tells me. \u201cBut if you look at deep house \u2013 the latest sound to cross over \u2013 that\u2019s not really come from anywhere; it has no home.\u201d Peyton says the same thing: \u201cWithout nightclubs, you lose the chance to develop scenes and you lose the chance to experiment. With our residencies, we can put on people who will not necessarily sell tickets on their own, but we think are great, and nurture them.\u201d     Fabric, in central London, which has had to introduce airport-style security at its doors. Photograph: Alamy    I put this to Casson, who is rather bullish about this new era in nightlife, and even he agrees. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably true; we\u2019ve tried riskier lineups with our nights and it has been a disaster. We lost \u00a314,000 on one night with acts that had never played Liverpool before. That\u2019s a lot of money for a small company. We have to be careful and make sure we\u2019re booking bigger names.\u201d Councils aren\u2019t just shutting down licences willy-nilly. What they are doing is limiting the capacity for fun. They\u2019ll say clubs can only trade until midnight. At Fabric, in central London, there is now stringent security, and anyone caught with drugs is bundled into a police van. Before the Arches closed down, one measure suggested by police was \u201cmoments of calm\u201d, where DJs stop playing music for five minutes each hour, with the lights switched on. The idea seems to be that if you regulate nightclubs to such an extent that the fun is squeezed out, they\u2019ll close down anyway, or be so anaemic as to no longer be a bother. The unspoken truth in all this is that the law hasn\u2019t changed much \u2013 it\u2019s just that whereas once the authorities seemed to turn a blind eye to venues with questionable licences, now even the smallest failing on a club\u2019s part can get it closed down. \u201cHonestly, we really panic if a mobile phone has been reported stolen at the end of the night. We have to find the phone ourselves, basically, or face a lot of pressure from the licensing authorities. No question, one phone theft can put your licence in jeopardy,\u201d says Peyton. The whole point of a nightclub is that it\u2019s an experience greater than the sum of its parts \u2013 a big empty room with someone playing loud music should get boring pretty quickly \u2013 but it\u2019s made by the people, the fashion, the drugs and the frisson of possibility that comes from a night without rules. It\u2019s why Glastonbury is more fun than V Festival, why camping is more fun than a night in a Travelodge and why people traipse to clubs in the middle of nowhere to see DJs. A night out is not like a massage; you can\u2019t just pay your money and feel better after 45 minutes; there has to be some kind of ineffable experience. The death of the nightclub is certainly not the end for nightlife, but it does permanently change the sort of fun you\u2019re allowed to have. It\u2019s hard to believe that the outsider communities that dance music has always engendered would ever find a home at a city festival sponsored by a pear cider.     Raving at Garlands, Liverpool. Photograph: PYMCA/REX Shutterstock    \u2018The authorities are the biggest challenge to clubs\u2019 \u201cThe authorities are the biggest challenge to clubs. The police are concerned about their lessening resources due to cuts, and it\u2019s an easy way to say that crime has been decreased by putting pressure on the night-time economy. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe recently said that 50% of bars and clubs should be closed to reduce crime. There\u2019s a notion that we should be responsible for any individual act that takes place outside the premises. Unlike a bank robbery \u2013 where the bank is just seen as a victim of crime \u2013 nightclubs are held accountable for things that happen both at their premises and outside.\u201dAlan D Miller, founder of the Old Truman Brewery in east London and chairman of the Night Time Industries Association \u201cYes, the internet plays a vital role in how people communicate now, it\u2019s less organic and physical. Before, you\u2019d make friends at clubs, whereas now people meet through social networks. But the desire to lose your mind to music is still very much there, the options are just limited. The internet hasn\u2019t killed subculture. Online platforms like Boiler Room, that push the best new music, are a new kind of club night.\u201dJennifer Byrne, producer of Dazed\u2019s Music Nation \u201cThere\u2019s been a tendency for the major, risk-averse nightclubs to adhere to the lowest common denominator. Commercial nightclub operatives have been uncreative and too concerned with catering for stag nights, hen dos and office parties. Once upon a time, people would have gone to clubs to hear exciting interesting music, to experiment with fashion and seek out new attitudes and ideas; now people get an entirely predictable experience. I know people who go all the way to Berlin or Amsterdam because they know the local disco round the corner is boring.\u201dDave Haslam, author of Life After Dark: A History of British Nightclubs and Music Venues \u201cMost areas in town cities are filled with middle-class residents, they know the sound legislation is draconian. You make a sound complaint, I will have a council officer here within 20 minutes. So many clubs in Soho were closed because of blocks of flats being built; Egg in Kings Cross, I doubt they\u2019ll survive for more than three years because of the block of flats being built opposite. What are our city centres for? Why did people come to London? It wasn\u2019t because of the traffic and taxis. It was because we have a brilliant world-famous nightlife. Town centres are for fun; they should be noisy, vibrant places. You can\u2019t have 50 residents who are in houses that were \u00a3300,000 , are now \u00a32m, wanting their houses to cost half-a-million pounds more, wanting to close clubs down.\u201dAlex Proud, founder of the Proud Group \u201cClubbing is a movement that brings people who share the same musical connection together. I loved clubbing so much I started my own club night to unite people with the same music taste and to make it easier for people to see all their different friend groups in one room. Under this current government, we are made to work so much that seeing your mates becomes hard work.

Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    This is the Angulos\u2019 first time in the UK. They are here for the London premiere of The Wolfpack, the documentary they star in, which won the Grand Jury prize at this year\u2019s Sundance festival. Directed by Crystal Moselle, it tells the strange story of the seven Angulo siblings who, for 14 years, hardly ever left their apartment in New York\u2019s Lower East Side. Their Peruvian father, Oscar, kept the door locked and guarded the key. Their American mother, Susanne, home-schooled her seven children: Bhagavan, 23; twins Govinda and Narayana, 22; Mukunda, 20; Krisna (aka Glenn), 18; Jagadesh (aka Eddie), 17; and 25-year-old sister Visnu. \u201cI went to school,\u201d Susanne says in the film, to explain her decision, \u201cand I realised a lot of socialisation was not positive.\u201d Oscar, meanwhile, was seeking to protect his children from New York\u2019s drugs and crime. On rare family excursions into the city, he insisted they didn\u2019t talk to anyone.    We learned about the importance of family from The Godfather and about American history from JFK    Was he right to do that? \u201cI guess you could say he was overprotective,\u201d says Govinda. \u201cBut after 9/11, New York changed. The city he was afraid of got a lot safer and more security-conscious. It wasn\u2019t the scary place he thought it was.\u201d And your mother wasn\u2019t allowed out, either? \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d says Narayana. \u201cI don\u2019t think he helped us \u2013 we learned everything worthwhile from our mother.\u201d The family was so reclusive that many neighbours in their block didn\u2019t know they existed. \u201cOnce we didn\u2019t leave the apartment for a whole year,\u201d says Govinda. In The Wolfpack, we see home-video footage of some of the brothers racing down the hall of their building on scooters, followed by another wearing skates. That hall was their playground. In other home footage, the camera zooms down to street level where neighbouring kids are walking round in Halloween costumes. Sixteen floors up, the Angulos were filming themselves making costumes and dressing up. The two worlds rarely met.     The siblings typed out dialogue from movies they loved and acted out scenes from their favourite films, including Reservoir Dogs, in their four-bedroom apartment.    Much of the siblings\u2019 education came through watching films: their dad had a collection of 5,000 videos and DVDs. \u201cWe learned a lot,\u201d says Govinda. \u201cEspecially about morals. We learned how people who are different get treated. We learned about the importance of family from films like The Godfather.\u201d So you were socialised by the murdering mobster Michael Corleone instead of school? \u201cNot just that,\u201d says Narayana. \u201cWe learned a lot about American history from movies like JFK, The China Syndrome and Apocalypse Now.\u201d Why did your dad have such a huge collection? \u201cTo help him learn English, to learn how Americans behave,\u201d says Govinda. The siblings typed out dialogue from movies they loved: Quentin Tarantino\u2019s Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs, Christopher Nolan\u2019s The Dark Knight. Then they dressed up and acted out scenes in their four-bedroom apartment. In the documentary, we see them re-enact The Dark Knight with a Batman costume made out of old yoga mats and cardboard. \u201cIn a way, we were imprisoned,\u201d says Govinda, \u201cbut we were always free to use our imaginations.\u201d Only four of the Angulos have made it to the UK. Does it feel strange to be in a foreign country? \u201cWe feel we know London already,\u201d says Govinda. \u201cWe know it from Austin Powers and the Spice Girls movie.\u201d But their film knowledge is more profound than that remark suggests. \u201cThat storefront is just like the one in Frenzy,\u201d says Eddie as the bus heads up St James\u2019s Street. He means the 1972 Hitchcock thriller in which Barry Foster\u2019s serial killer strangled his victims with a tie. \u201cAnyone got a tie?\u201d says Narayana.    Their dad likes the film \u2013 even though it depicts him as a controlling, paranoid wife-beater and drunk    Later, the brothers become very interested in iron railings at Eaton Square when they learn they are the ones Hugh Grant and Julia Roberts clamber over in 1999\u2019s Notting Hill. \u201cBritish movies are pretty good,\u201d says Govinda, \u201cbut we prefer French Nouvelle Vague and Italian neo-realism. Bertolucci\u2019s director of photography, Vittorio Storaro, is my favourite DP.\u201d The Angulos\u2019 parents met when hippie Susanne was on the Machu Picchu trail, in Peru, where she met Oscar, a Hare Krishna follower. They gave their children ancient Indian names. How come the pair settled in New York? \u201cThey didn\u2019t mean to stay there,\u201d says Govinda, \u201cbut because Dad didn\u2019t believe in working for a living, our options were limited.\u201d The family lived on welfare in public housing, while Oscar and Susanne dreamed of some day making it to Scandinavia where, Oscar believed, society was organised on the right lines. \u201cAlthough we were reclusive, we did travel to Europe once,\u201d says Narayana. \u201cWe went to Amsterdam. I remember it because we stayed in tents, for some reason.\u201d Were your parents unhappy in New York? \u201cMom was. She dreamed of being in the wide open spaces of Michigan, giving us what she\u2019d had as a kid.\u201d How about you? \u201cWe weren\u2019t unhappy. We had ourselves and the movies.\u201d Their imprisonment came to an end abruptly in April 2010 when Mukunda, then 15, managed to get out of the apartment and walk the streets wearing a mask inspired by Halloween\u2019s Michael Myers. He was arrested, taken to a hospital, and returned home only after being assigned a therapist. Their father could no longer contain them. Soon the Angulos were going out together, walking the streets. They wore neckties, dark clothes and shades \u2013 sweet, innocent kids with waist-length hair playing at being the colour-coded crims from Reservoir Dogs. \u201cOne of our friends is a producer,\u201d says Govinda, \u201cand she said we looked like a pack of wolves, always travelling together. So we became the Wolfpack.\u201d         Watch the trailer for The Wolfpack \u2013 video    On one walk through the Lower East Side, the Wolfpack ran into Moselle. \u201cThere was something so open about them,\u201d says the 34-year-old director. When the siblings found out she worked in the movies they were dazzled. \u201cShe was the first friend we ever invited back to our apartment,\u201d says Govinda. They were delighted when Moselle asked if she could make a documentary about their unusual upbringing: they hoped, in part, that it might get them into the film business.   Related: Party with the Wolfpack brothers: the new breed of documentary film stars    It would have been easy for Moselle to depict the kids as victims and the parents as monsters. But one of the most appealing things about the documentary is its reluctance to make the usual moves. The Wolfpack is an elliptical work that suspends judgment, not least because of the absence of voiceovers and talking heads. In fact, the film is so devoid of customary documentary detail, and the Angulos so articulate, charming and socially adept that, when I first saw it, I worried it might be an elaborate con. Maybe the Angulos weren\u2019t the weirdo shut-ins the tabloids would have us believe, but philosophy graduates or film students making a meta-documentary about media gullibility. Perhaps they weren\u2019t siblings and their parents are just actors. \u201cWe get asked that all the time!\u201d says Moselle, laughing. \u201cBut,\u201d says Govinda, \u201cit really happened just like it is in the film.\u201d That said, neither Govinda nor Narayana have seen The Wolfpack. \u201cWe both would feel uncomfortable watching ourselves,\u201d says Govinda. Other siblings, as well as their parents, had fewer compunctions. \u201cI thought it was beautiful,\u201d says Mukunda. Their dad likes it, too. \u201cI was worried what his reaction would be,\u201d says Moselle \u2013 and no wonder. The Wolfpack depicts Oscar as a controlling, paranoid man, a wife-beater and drunk. \u201cBut he was zen about it,\u201d the film-maker insists. \u201cHe said it was very beautiful.\u201d As for the siblings, they have flourished in the five years since Moselle started filming them. The boys have friends, jobs, girlfriends and new haircuts. Each of the brothers I meet is good company: perhaps their parents didn\u2019t do a bad job of raising them after all. Doubtless, the films they watched also helped. And three are fulfilling their dream of working in the movies: Mukunda has made a short film called Mirror Art; Govinda, the only sibling to have left home, is an assistant cameraman, who\u2019s worked for Vice Media; and Narayana has worked as a production assistant on films for the same company, and as an anti-fracking activist.   Related: Unlocking the Wolfpack \u2013 a strange tale of isolated brothers locked in a tiny NYC apartment    Bhagavan is a dancer and yoga-teacher. Jagadesh and Krisna want to be musicians, and have changed their names to Eddie and Glenn, respectively. Eddie, who\u2019s bleached his hair and today wears mirror shades and a denim waistcoat with a Judas Priest logo, was inspired by Eddie Money from the 1992 movie Eddie and the Cruisers, about a 1960s rock\u2019n\u2019roll band. The Wolfpack focuses on the boys: their older sister, Visnu, who has the developmental disorder Turner syndrome, and is rarely seen in the film, nor has she featured much in its promotion. Our bus rolls down Whitehall. London, as so often, proves disappointing for tourists. The Queen isn\u2019t in town, we can\u2019t find any guards in bearskin helmets for selfies, and the daintily costumed equestrian sentries at Horse Guards Parade don\u2019t look as if they could protect a cream tea, still less the integrity of the prime movers of the British constitution. No matter: the Angulos can always retreat into the more exciting London they know from the movies. \u201cThat\u2019s not your grandfather!\u201d shouts Narayana. He\u2019s playing George Harrison in a scene from the 1964 Beatles film A Hard Day\u2019s Night. Maybe, I suggest, watching all those films prepared you well for the real world. Maybe being schooled by cinema doesn\u2019t make you so very different from most other kids your age. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d says Govinda. \u201cFans come up to us all the time saying they learned how to be who they are through movies.

Industry is still important, but now the west coast\u2019s biggest city looks at ease on the pages of glossy travel magazines and is giving Stockholm a run for its money in the city-break stakes.  The container ships still chug into Gothenburg\u2019s blustery port (the biggest in Scandinavia) but are now joined by cruise liners full of tourists \u2013 73 of them docked in 2014, compared with just nine in 2000. This autumn, British Airways, Norwegian and Ryanair are all adding extra flights from London to Gothenburg. And in Hisingen, just across the G\u00f6ta river from the city centre, a new waterfront leisure area, the Jubileumsparken, is being built to celebrate the city\u2019s 400th anniversary, in 2021. The first section, with a free public sauna made from recycled materials, is already open, but construction work will keep going in this area until at least 2035.   Gothenburg locator     And within the city the changes are huge: tumbledown shops and industrial buildings have been turned into galleries; bars selling organic ales have moved into once-rundown neighbourhoods; and the picture-perfect fishing villages that dot the coast north and south of the city have begun reeling in food critics with their fresh crayfish, lobster and prawns. Add in a blossoming local design scene, six Michelin-starred restaurants, a sprawling archipelago of low-slung granite islands, plus a new wave of cool independent coffee shops across town (the city still has only one branch of Starbucks, inside the central railway station), and it\u2019s easy to see why visitor arrivals rose by almost 10% in 2014. Nowhere is Gothenburg\u2019s transformation more obvious than in the district of Haga on the south side of the G\u00f6ta, once so rundown and rowdy that large parts were demolished in the 1970s, although many of the area\u2019s old buildings have been renovated. The part left standing is now the city\u2019s showpiece district, its cobbled lanes lined with cosy cafes selling plate-sized cinnamon buns to tourists and lattepappor (latte dads, or young fathers off work on parental leave). Locals seem to welcome the influx of visitors but, being a modest bunch, are often bemused as to why anyone would choose their city for a holiday. The new bars and restaurants opening on Gothenburg\u2019s grungy \u201clong streets\u201d, just west of Linn\u00e9gatan (where Haga meets Masthugget), are increasingly swanky, specialising in everything from dim sum to tequila. Gentrification is pushing students, artists and musicians out towards neighbourhoods like Majorna, traditionally home to dockers and industrial workers, but classic watering holes such as Publik and Kelly\u2019s keep things feeling relaxed \u2013 think Acne jeans, arm-length tattoos and scuffed white Converses, rather than Stockholm\u2019s slicked-back style.     The old working-class district of Haga, once so rundown and rowdy, is now the city\u2019s showpiece district. Photograph: Souvid Datta for the Guardian    Top-end seafood restaurants such as Sj\u00f6magasinet tend to get most of the attention in travel guides, but you can eat and drink well in Gothenburg without going overboard, or even dressing up \u2013 try the food carts that set up on Magasinsgatan and Linn\u00e9gatan streets, the new waterside bar-restaurants in Rosenlund, or the cluster of individualistic street-food outlets on Skanstorget. The city\u2019s large student population means there\u2019s a boozy late-night crowd, especially at weekends, with DJs, skateboarders, designers and doctors-in-training all cramming into the most popular venues. Music/clubs scene By Bj\u00f6rn Wurmbach, German-Swedish music promoter and festival organiser     A busy evening at the popular Publik bar on Andra L\u00e5nggatan. Photograph: Souvid Datta for the Guardian    I started doing parties on my 30th birthday, which we celebrated on an island in the archipelago off Gothenburg. I organised it with some friends and to start with a lot of things went wrong. Now, that island party has evolved into an exclusive festival called Secret Island Nation, which has just celebrated its 10th anniversary. Instead of complaining about the system and capitalism, we create our own nation, which is ours for four or five days. We live according to our own values. We don\u2019t have security and we don\u2019t have a cleaning team, because the people who come to the festival are not guests; they\u2019re citizens and they look after themselves and the site. There\u2019s a mix of around 40 acts from all around the world including KSF from Iceland, Franco Bianco from Argentina, Joel Alter, who\u2019s local, and plenty of DJs spinning what I would call the Berlin club sound: house, tech-house and techno. Nobody gets paid, and we put a lot of effort and love into it.     Jos\u00e9 Gonzalez\u2019s Gothenburg playlist   Music is so big in Sweden nowadays. I\u2019d say it\u2019s the country\u2019s main export. But because of Sweden\u2019s tough licensing laws, which control when \u201cordinary\u201d clubs close, there\u2019s a growing underground party scene. Amazing club nights do happen, but they\u2019re very secretive and outside the centre in industrial areas. Facebook is the way things tend to spread. For Gothenburg, N\u00f6jesguiden is the best source of into on mainstream nightlife, while Illegal Ground covers the city\u2019s alternative venues and has extensive reviews. A year ago, we discovered a big industrial location on Hisingen island (the area north of the G\u00f6ta river) \u2013 very central, but psychologically off the map \u2013 that we rent out to different people. We have one customer called Mythos that runs a big Berlin-style warehouse party once a month. Nefertiti and Pustervik are good mainstream venues which have been around for ages with somewhat alternative bookings. To me they seem to be among the few clubs that have their focus on the music and not on maximising profits. Folk is a really cool bar with high ceilings, a nice cosmopolitan feel and a grown-up crowd. I\u2019d also recommend Magnus &amp; Magnus, which is worth a visit on Wednesdays during summer. They\u2019ve managed to attract a mixed crowd of hipsters, posh Swedes and underground people with their electronic music bookings and great food. Otherwise, you could try the Mexican-themed Puta Madre, which has these crazy red interiors and does great cocktails on its open-air terrace. If I have friends visiting from London or Berlin, we\u2019d probably start at the bars on Andra L\u00e5nggatan, just west of Haga. Where to eat and drink By Jerker Furuskog, chef at Kooperativet (G\u00f6taverksgatan 1), Gothenburg     Somm restaurant    I\u2019ve witnessed a lot of changes in the food scene in Gothenburg. There\u2019s a far more professional atmosphere in the restaurants than there was before. The ingredients are better, and the customers are more aware of what they\u2019re eating. I moved from Sm\u00e5land to Gothenburg for college \u2013 and to become a chef. It was a way for me to move away from the small town I grew up in. I\u2019ve now been working as a chef and head chef for 19 years, with stints everywhere from casual lunch places to one of the city\u2019s Michelin-starred restaurants. Today, a fairly ordinary restaurant in Gothenburg has the same quality of food that a fine-dining restaurant had 15 years ago. The thing that makes the city\u2019s food scene special is the abundance of fresh fish and seafood, caught off the west coast. Some of the best places, such as Sj\u00f6magasinet (Adolf Edelsv\u00e4rds gata 5), the Michelin-starred restaurant, where I have worked, puts its entire focus on seafood. But restaurants here also use a lot of organic meat and vegetables such as wild boar, new potatoes and freshly picked mushrooms. A big trend in Swedish cooking now is that, instead of using just the nice cuts of meat, like the tenderloin, you use the whole animal \u2013 just as they did in times gone by. Somm (mains from 190SEK, about \u00a314, Lorensbergsgatan 8) is great for this, and one of the chefs there is part of West of Sweden Culinary Team , which promotes local, organic ingredients. Swedes also have a really big interest in beer, and there are lots of microbreweries popping up around Gothenburg, including Dugges Ale och Porterbryggeri and Oceanbryggeriet.     L\u00e5ngedrags V\u00e4rdshus    Visitors should try a \u201chalf special\u201d (halv special in Swedish). It\u2019s a hotdog loaded up with mashed potatoes and a lovely shrimp-and-mayo salad. My personal favourite place to eat is \u00d6lrepubliken (mains from about \u00a311), Kronhusgatan 2B) \u2013 for the atmosphere, the wonderful beer, and the reasonably priced food, from mussels to steak tartare. L\u00e5ngedrags V\u00e4rdshus (mains from about \u00a317, Talattagatan 24) is a beautifully situated restaurant five miles to the west of the centre, right by the sea, with good food and a mix of young families and businesspeople. Upper House (six courses from about \u00a392, M\u00e4ssans gata 24) is a bit more expensive but has a great view over Gothenburg, along with some of the best-quality food you can get in this part of Sweden right now \u2013 there are six-course menus featuring everything from fresh langoustines to fermented raspberries. When it comes to coffee and cakes, try the wonderful old courtyard of Kronhusbodarna (Kronhusgatan 1D), in the one of the city\u2019s most historic areas. It\u2019s a good place for a traditional Swedish fika (essentially a chat over coffee with friends, and perhaps a slice of cake) in an old, cosy atmosphere. Another favourite of mine is Brogyllen (V\u00e4stra Hamngatan 2), a regular fika place (coffee and a cake around \u00a34) with some of the best sourdough cinnamon rolls you\u2019ll find anywhere on Earth. Where to go for art and design By Annie Granath, designer and interior architect     Friends gather at Oceanen bar. Photograph: Souvid Datta for the Guardian    The design scene in Gothenburg is small compared with Stockholm. There aren\u2019t masses of cool design studios and most designers know each other. The upside of this is that things are more relaxed and people tend to help each other out more. Gothenburg is also home to one of Sweden\u2019s most renowned craft and design schools, HDK. When something interesting involving design or craft takes place in the city, HDK has usually made a contribution in some way. R\u00f6hsska Museet is the best design museum in Sweden. Every year it holds an exhibition featuring the winner of the Torsten and Wanja S\u00f6derberg Prize, the biggest design award in the world. It also has a big collection of craft and design objects and some iconic furniture. A recent addition is A-venue, a gallery opened by the University of Gothenburg on the city\u2019s main street, Kungsportsavenyn. So far it has had one exhibition \u2013 of furniture, called DeTour HDK \u2013 that had been shown during design week in Milan. A-venue is set to be a great place to see new and interesting art and design.     Gothenburg\u2019s most prominent graffiti artist Sarai, works on a new mural by the R da Sten Konsthall beside \u00c4lvsborg suspension bridge. Photograph: Souvid Datta for the Guardian    For small galleries, Vasa is the part of town to head for. Here you\u2019ll find places such as contemporary Galleri Thomassen and G\u00f6teborgs Konsthall. R\u00f6da Sten Konsthall is also worth a visit, among other things for its great location beside the \u00c4lvsborg suspension bridge. For shopping, Artilleriet on Magasinsgatan has a great selection of furniture and some beautiful objects. It recently opened a new store called The Kitchen that\u2019s full of cooking gadgets. Over Christmas, there are usually a lot of small markets and pop-up stores full of local crafts. A perfect day for me would be to take the boat to one of the islands in the southern archipelago (Styrs\u00f6, for example). After that, I\u2019d check out a photo exhibition at the Hasselblad Center, then enjoy the sunset from Masthuggskyrkan, where there\u2019s a striking church, and have a beer at nearby Oceanen on Stigbergstorget.

Katrina alone flooded up to 80% of New Orleans. Tragically, a total of around 2,000 people lost their lives, while more than 2 million residents were evacuated. The economic impact of the crisis has been estimated at some $150bn (\u00a396bn).  In the words of the then US secretary of homeland security Michael Chertoff, it was \u201cprobably the worst catastrophe or set of catastrophes\u201d in US history. A decade on, a new New Orleans is slowly emerging after years of painstaking planning and effort. At the heart of this is an integrated and comprehensive water management system which has the potential to transform the city into America\u2019s leading water urban settlement. Holistic urban design There has been a widely held desire for renewal of New Orleans since the city\u2019s population began to decline in the 1960s. In part this was because three of the largest industries in the region \u2013 tourism, oil and gas, shipping and logistics \u2013 shed tens of thousands of jobs from 1980-2010. In this context, the US and Dutch planners brought together to start a process of rebuilding New Orleans \u2013 myself included \u2013 decided that a key issue to address after Katrina and Rita was not just how the city should be redeveloped given the threat it faces from natural hazards, but also how to integrate a fundamental reconsideration of its character as a leading water city. More was needed than simply repairing the floodwalls and storm surge barriers.     Aerial photograph of New Orleans. Photograph: Joan Hall/H3 Studio    We believe there is potential for New Orleans to develop a relationship with its river delta that contributes to spatial, economic and social renewal that could power its regeneration. This includes the implementation of the Greater New Orleans Urban Water Plan, driving indirect and direct investment of up to $11bn and supporting as many as 100,000 new jobs. Mapping this out prompted much interest in international best practice, especially the pioneering Dutch tradition of combining water management with urban development. The Netherlands, with about 20% of its land area and population located below sea level and 50% of its land lying less than a metre above sea level, has long been famous for the beauty of its thriving water cities and best-in-class flood protection systems. Next steps Reflecting this expertise, and with the support of the American Planning Association and the Embassy of the Netherlands, the Dutch Dialogue project has emerged. Since 2007 this project has brought together Dutch engineers, urban designers, landscape architects, city planners and soils and hydrology experts with their Louisiana counterparts, with the aim of providing long-term recommendations for New Orleans\u2019 future. Our unwavering belief is that the city can not only survive as a major urban centre but also prosper if it can get key fundamentals right.     A bird\u2019s-eye view of future New Orleans according to the Greater New Orleans Urban Water Plan. Illustration: Drawing by Palmbout Urban Landscapes    To put New Orleans back on a path of sustainable growth, the city requires a combination of what the Dutch call a safety-first strategy with an improvement in the quality of the urban environment. A delta city should not only be safe to live in but also attractive and enjoyable. This is how we propose to combine these two requirements:   Related: Cities should look to nature to bridge investment gap in water sector     Safety first means, in practice, that New Orleans has to better adapt to threats inherent in living in a subsiding delta, so enhanced protection against hurricanes, floods and excess storm water is essential for redevelopment. To date three new floodwalls surrounding New Orleans have been built, including a storm surge barrier in Lake Borgne.  At the heart of this approach is an innovative new water management system that is fundamentally different from the pre-Katrina system. For instance, considering the city\u2019s intense rainfall, there will now be more storm water storage capacity using interdependent components such as integrated wetlands and circulating canals. Small pilot projects have been implemented to develop this further.  This additional storage capacity lowers the risk from localised flooding during hurricanes and makes it easier to actively manage the water table and soil levels (and risks levels), as in the Netherlands. Instead of the soil subsidence that had occurred in New Orleans for decades, we will now be able to stabilise both soil and water levels. While safety first must be the priority, New Orleans can adapt more effectively to what the Dutch call the principle of living with the water. Rather than seeing flood protection systems as exclusively to keep water out or contained, the city can secure the vibrant future it deserves by better exploiting the economic, societal and cultural gain of being a world leading water city. For instance, there are exceptional opportunities to create more of the amenities, like canals, lakes and ponds, that grace other world class water cities such as Amsterdam and Venice.   Just as the Netherlands ultimately emerged stronger after the cataclysmic storm surges of 1953 which killed more than 1,800 people and flooded most of the south west of the country, so a more vibrant, thriving and safer New Orleans is undoubtedly emerging. Indeed, some 10 years on from Katrina, there is growing confidence that the city\u2019s best days may be yet to come.

Flavirina lives out her Naomi Campbell fantasy in a shimmering floor-length frock. And Sulaiga models flares covered in coca leaves and carries an AK47. The 31-year-old Dutch photographer-provocateur Jan Hoek is using his camera to make their dreams come true. \u201cI found a photo on the internet of a trans sex worker in South Africa,\u201d says Hoek. \u201cShe looked so cool. Her clothes were really improvised and raw, but so stunning and creative.\u201d So he decided to travel to Cape Town and track down trans sex workers to photograph. Via Sweat, a sex worker advocacy organisation, he met Sulaiga, Gabby, Flavirina, Coco and Cleopatra. He asked each of them to brainstorm their dream outfits, which his friend, Dutch fashion designer Duran Lantink, created. Then Hoek took portraits of the five posing on a giant hamburger \u2013 because \u201cthe girls always say trans girls can eat like boys\u201d.     \u2018My intention was to give these people during the photo shoot that royal feeling\u2019 \u2026 Jan Hoek on his series Sweet Crazies    Hoek insists this is not \u201chelicopter photography\u201d, where a foreigner drops in to shoot exotic subjects and then promptly vanishes. \u201cIt\u2019s still a work-in-progress, and so are their outfits,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going back in November to do a new shoot.\u201d Hoek has also photographed his five models in their own clothes, on which Lantink is basing his new collection. Hoek gets to know his sitters well. \u201cCleopatra wants to be an African queen. She loves water and waterfalls. She also likes crystal meth,\u201d he says. \u201cSulaiga is one of the few girls who was really close to her mother. But even when she was living with her happy family, she went out on the streets to rob people.\u201d After her mother died on Sulaiga\u2019s 21st birthday, crime soon became a full-time occupation. Now she dreams of being a big-time drug dealer and mixing with the mafia. \u201cAs for Gabby,\u201d he continues, \u201cshe started working in a brothel, but it burned down, and she had to make her own money. And Flavi is a refugee from Burundi. She is the only one of the girls that wants the operation.\u201d  Trans people have long been muses for photographers, from Christer Str\u00f6mholm in 1960s Paris to Tiane Doan na Champassak in Thailand. But Hoek is less concerned with transgenderism than he is with photographic tension \u2013 that ever-present awkwardness between sitter and photographer, and viewer and photograph. \u201cI have a love-hate relationship with awkward moments,\u201d he says. \u201cI am extremely sensitive to them and I do feel uncomfortable, but those are the moments that give the best stories.\u201d All of Hoek\u2019s projects are heavy with this uneasy humour. In Sweet Crazies, he photographed a group of homeless Ethiopian men with mental-health issues. \u201cThey all looked like kings or emperors, like they\u2019d just stepped off the catwalk,\u201d he has written. \u201cMy intention was to give them that royal feeling \u2026 to make them the stars.\u201d But one of the men got angry during a studio shoot because \u201cfancy rich people started to make stupid jokes about him\u201d, and stick-wielding security guards threw everyone out.      Kim, a 32-year-old former heroin addict that Hoek does regular supermodel photoshoots with    If Hoek\u2019s portraits are toe-curling, it\u2019s because they confront the fact that photographs of other people are intrinsically exploitative and intrusive. He has also done a bizarre hypercolour series on Pattaya, in Thailand \u2013 \u201cthe sex tourist Valhalla of the world\u201d \u2013 and a 100-metre-long photograph called Panorama Carland, both of which are about to go on show at the Unseen photography festival in Amsterdam. \u201cOld cars from all over west Africa end up in Kumasi, in Ghana,\u201d he explains. \u201cIt\u2019s a fantastic, weird world full of rusty metal. I photoshopped a panorama of old cars and the wonderful people living between them, from Nigerian sex workers that look like Lil\u2019 Kim to sexy bodybuilders using car parts to train their muscles. It\u2019s a side of Africa you normally never see \u2013 it looks like a Tarantino movie.\u201d Does he worry about taking it too far, or taking advantage of his subjects? \u201cSome people in the west think people in Africa cannot think for themselves because they are poor and vulnerable,\u201d he says, \u201cbut in my experience they are perfectly capable of choosing if and how they want to be photographed.\u201d He once took shot after shot of a little girl with no limbs that he met at a hotel. At first, he says, he was nervous about photographing such a vulnerable person, but she eventually persuaded him \u2013 \u201cand she was addicted to the camera\u201d.  Hoek\u2019s longest-running photography relationship is with Kim, a 32-year-old former heroin addict. He has already photographed her in personalised supermodel shoots, and now he\u2019s taking her on holiday. \u201cBy the age of 15, Kim was living on the streets,\u201d he explains. \u201cShe and her boyfriend have never been on holiday. I\u2019ve organised a bus with huge photos of her face on it, and I\u2019ll pick her up in the \u2018Kim-mobile\u2019. We\u2019re going to a five-star hotel in Belgium.

People were standing out in the streets in shorts and T-shirts, watching the empty road, waiting for the runners to come by. Helicopters churned in the sky, not far away. The world\u2019s television cameras zoomed in on the two leaders. Side by side they ran, eyes fixed ahead, an Ethiopian and a Kenyan. It was a familiar story.  \u201cThis is the Red Socks against the Yankies,\u201d the NBC commentator enthused. \u201cWhichever sport you like, pick the biggest battle you can. This is it.\u201d Kenya versus Ethiopia. The two kings of the most accessible, most universal sport in the world: long-distance running. After almost 42km of racing, the two men were still side by side as they entered the Commonwealth Stadium to the roar of 60,000 spectators. Their legs drove on, around the final bend, both trying, at the end of more than two hours of hard running, to outsprint the other. Their faces were straining, their teeth gnashing. But only one could win. The Ethiopian, Gezahegne Abera, the reigning Olympic champion, somehow edged one stride ahead as they approached the line and hit the tape first to claim the 2001 world marathon title in the closest finish in world championship history. The cameras zoomed in on his stunned face. By the time they zoomed back out, the third placed runner was racing in. We didn\u2019t get to see the second-placed runner again. Perhaps he had stepped off the track already. Yet another Kenyan. What was his name? Simon Biwott. Never heard of him. Years later \u2026 I\u2019m driving north out of Eldoret on the Uganda Highway, up in Kenya\u2019s Rift Valley. The town doesn\u2019t have a definite end, but gradually peters out into a scattering of chaotic wooden shops, kiosks and half-built colleges. Donkey carts and wobbly bicycles laden with sacks of charcoal and crates of chickens struggle to compete with the constant grinding of traffic. Huge lorries puff along slowly as cars and minibuses dart around them on either side, beeping just for the hell of it.  About two miles out of town, I turn left. There\u2019s an upturned tractor tire stuck into the ground, and painted along it\u2019s curve are the words Livingstone Academy. The small dirt side road passes a seemingly abandoned row of wooden buildings. A girl sits on the counter of a mango stall and watches me pass. Outside a row of tiny concrete houses, tired women sit on the steps in front of buckets and gaze as my car goes by. Up ahead, I see the gates of the school. I\u2019m here to meet the school director, Simon Biwott. The school director and once, in the closest finish in history, almost the marathon world champion.  Biwott smiles as I get out of my car and greets me with a handshake. He\u2019s now 41 and is a tall, placid man who has the kind but sober manner of a church minister. He brings me straight into his office, down a narrow corridor. Once inside, he takes his jacket off and sits down. \u201cSo,\u201d he says, \u201cYou want to know what happened? How is it that a poor boy from Kenya almost became world champion that night?\u201d Biwott\u2019s story is remarkable, but it is also typical of the tough route to success that most of Kenya\u2019s incredible runners have to traverse in order to win the world\u2019s top races. In 2014, 95 of the top 100 fastest marathons of the year were run by men from Kenya and Ethiopia. Each one of those runners has an amazing story.      Simon Biwott in his office. Photograph: Adharanand Finn    Biwott grew up herding goats in a small village about 20 miles from Eldoret in western Kenya. Like everyone else, he used to run to school. When I first arrived in Kenya, I had assumed the story of children running to school was something of a romanticised myth, but there they were each morning, skipping and racing along, up and down the banked verges of the dirt roads, and often barefoot. Many of the children race home and back at lunchtime, too, sprinting as fast as they can not to get into trouble for being late.  Once at school, Biwott liked the games lessons because it meant he got free bread and soda. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know much about athletics,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we knew about Kip Keino [who won Olympic gold in 1968 and again in 1972]. They used to circumcise women in our village and, at the ceremony, the girls sang about Kip Keino, so we knew his name. We didn\u2019t really know what it was, but we thought this athletics must be a serious business.\u201d Biwott showed promise at running and competed often for his primary school, but he was never quite good enough to make the district team. Then, in 1986, when he was 16, a tractor plough collapsed on his leg and left him badly injured. He couldn\u2019t run at all for the next three years. In 1989, he started at high school and began running again. His leg felt better and, in the summer of 1989, he managed to get into the 5000m trial race for the Commonwealth Games.  \u201cI finished second,\u201d he says, \u201cBut there was confusion with lapped runners and they thought I had another lap to run, so I didn\u2019t make the team.\u201d As he talks, a woman comes in to the room with a jug of water and a basin. I hold out my hands as she pours water over them. Biwott does the same. Then she goes out and comes back with a tray of food. A loaf of sliced bread and a packet of biscuits. Biwott pauses his story and sits in silence as she carefully places some of the bread slices in one bowl and the biscuits in another. Then she leaves.  \u201cIn 1990, [when he was 20] I started serious training,\u201d he says. \u201cI was made cross country captain at the school and I was in top form. I used to leave my colleagues standing.\u201d But then his leg became mysteriously infected. Rather than visit a doctor, he went to a local medicine man, who rubbed ash on it. \u201cI think it worked. Someone later told me if I\u2019d gone to the hospital they would have amputated it.\u201d The leg took five months to heal, but afterwards it looked much thinner than the other leg. Thinking he couldn\u2019t run anymore, Biwott gave up athletics. Life was hard for him. To pay his school fees and buy his uniform, he planted a vegetable garden and sold vegetables at the side of the road. Four years later, Biwott finished high school. He was 24.  \u201cWasn\u2019t that quite old to be finishing school?\u201d I ask him.  \u201cI think I started late,\u201d he says. He gives me a big grin. Outside the window, children are peering in. I can hear chanting from one of the classrooms. \u201cI went back to my village and decided to open a small kiosk selling vegetables, sugar and things like that. I wanted to become a business man. I had lost all interest in athletics.\u201d But, one day, someone pinned a notice on his kiosk about a race to select a team for the district championships. When he saw the letter, it motivated him to start training again. But the race was just one week later. Still, he ran the 5000m anyway, and won. In the district championships, he came second. \u201cAfter the district race, a man approached me and told me about a camp where you could train for a possible scholarship to the US. So I found a man to look after my kiosk and went to the camp, in a place called Kapsabet.\u201d When he got there, he ran a trial race and came fifth. Rather than take him into the camp, the captain told him to find somewhere to stay in the town and that they would monitor his progress. But he had no money for lodgings, so he moved in with some relatives, 20 miles away. It was the best solution he could come up with, but without money to travel in to the camp each day, he ended up training by himself, just heading out for runs each morning with no real structure to what he was doing. After a while, he thought he should return to look after his kiosk. \u201cBut when I got back to my village, the kiosk wasn\u2019t there.\u201d The man he had charged with looking after it had sold everything and run off with the money. Rather than despair, Biwott saw it as a sign that he should concentrate on athletics. \u201cI trusted in God,\u201d he says, looking at me with unwavering eyes. \u201cI trusted that it was meant to be. So I started training again.\u201d He moved to join another group in Eldoret, staying with relatives and selling paraffin to get money to buy food. He was now 25. After a good performance in the provincial cross country championships, he was approached by an army officer, who took him to train in a base in Nairobi. After three days, they set up a trial race. The race was packed with runners who had raced internationally, but Biwott managed to come fourth. \u201cAfterwards, the coach came over to me and said: \u2018Where have you been all this time?\u2019\u201d  So Biwott joined the army team training in the Ngong Hills outside Nairobi. There were no jobs in the army at that time, but they gave him a bed to sleep in and food to eat. He cleaned the swimming pool to get enough money to buy some soap. He lived in a tent and trained with a group that included a number of top international runners. His coach told him he was doing well, and told him to get himself a passport, in case he got asked to race abroad. Things were finally working out for him, when in 1996 he got injured again. \u201cFor the first time,\u201d he says, \u201cI was bitter. I decided to come home. I didn\u2019t want to become a soldier, so I got a job selling fertiliser in a farm shop.\u201d    I knew my talent was real    There were very few runners from his area, and the people who knew him told him to forget about running. His father, usually after a few drinks, would tell him that it was a waste of time. \u201c\u2019You\u2019ve trained this long and nothing has happened,\u2019 he\u2019d say to me. \u2018You should stay in the shop.\u2019\u201d His mother was the only one who never gave up on him, always offering him encouragement.  In August of 1997, when Biwott was 27, two things happened to inspire him to start running again. Firstly, Paul Tergat broke the world record in the 10,000m. Then a week later Wilson Boit Kipketer broke the steeplechase world record. \u201cThese were people I knew. I had run with them in the past and I could keep up with them. So I knew my talent was real,\u201d he says.  Although he stayed working in the shop, he started training again. At the end of the year, he met up with one of his old friends from the army camp, who told him an Italian agent called Dr Rosa was holding a trial run near his village. \u201cI was surprised. Why were they coming to my village? I joined the trial but I didn\u2019t know how far we were running. About 30 of us stood together on the start line. Some of them knew me, but others were wondering who I was.\u201d They started running and Biwott kept up with the lead group as gradually people started dropping off the pace. \u201cAt around 32km \u2013 I later found out \u2013 I asked if I could stop, but my friend John Kemboi told me to keep running.\u201d He was still running blind, not knowing where they were going or how far. When Dr Rosa appeared in his truck handing out water, Biwott didn\u2019t know what to do with it \u2013 he had never drunk water while running before. \u201cAt about 36km, I noticed people were starting to push the pace, so I pushed too. In the end there were five of us who finished together.\u201d Dr Rosa was very surprised by the new man\u2019s ability. \u201cHave you been abroad?\u201d he asked him.  \u201cNo,\u201d said Biwott. \u201cDo you have a passport?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cDo you want to join us?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d The other four people he had finished with all went to the Amsterdam marathon a few months later and one of them won. Biwott was told he was going to race in Cancun, in Mexico. But a few weeks before, he ran a cross country race and fell, and got injured. \u201cI went home again,\u201d he says. \u201cSometimes athletics is a steep hill to climb. But I was happy. Somehow I knew this was the last obstacle. I knew my time had come.\u201d In March 1998, at the age of 28, Biwott ran his first race abroad, the Rome marathon.  \u201cIt was very exciting to be abroad,\u201d he says. \u201cVery, very exciting. Just to observe how the plane moved. To see the lights on the ground as we flew through the sky. It was wonderful.\u201d He came 5th in the race and won around $6,000 \u2013 more than the average annual salary in Kenya at the time. The first thing he did with his winnings was buy a camera.  \u201cI didn\u2019t know if I was ever going to race abroad again, so I bought the camera thinking I could use it to start a business.\u201d When he got back to Kenya he went straight back to his village. He hadn\u2019t even told anyone in his family that he was going abroad. \u201cAfter all my setbacks, I didn\u2019t know if it was certain until I got there,\u201d he says. \u201cSo I didn\u2019t want to say anything.\u201d Back in his village, he spent the rest of the money paying off school fees for his brothers and sisters. The next year, he ran the Mexico City marathon, and won. This time, when he got back to Kenya, he built his parents a house. He won another few races in Mexico, and then, in 2000, he was a surprise selection for the Kenyan team for the Olympics. This was a huge achievement, but at the last minute the selectors changed their minds and he was dropped from the team. As he was in the middle of a serious training schedule, preparing for the Olympics, Dr Rosa sent him to Berlin, one of the biggest marathons in the world, but as a pacemaker. He still hadn\u2019t achieved enough to earn an invite for the main race. \u201cI did the pacing job I was paid to do, leading the race until 28km,\u201d he says. \u201cThen I pulled over, but instead of dropping out, I joined on the back of the leading group. At 31km I retook the lead \u2013 and I never looked back.\u201d He won. It was a big story \u2013 the pacemaker who stole away with victory. Biwott was now in the big time. He had won the Berlin marathon in 2:06:49 \u2013 which ended up being his fastest time ever \u2013 and in 2001 he was selected to run for Kenya in the world championships, where he came 2nd by just one second. \u201cI was that close,\u201d he says, holding up his thumb and forefinger. Still, it was a big story in Kenya \u2013 the first medal in a world marathon since 1988. \u201cI was on the front pages of all the newspapers,\u201d he says.     Simon Biwott with the children of Livingstone Academy. Photograph: Adharanand Finn    He looks up at me. The sun has moved around and a thin line of yellow streaks the wall behind him. \u201cDo you want a break?\u201d he asks me. I nod. We\u2019ve been talking for almost four hours. He takes me out into the sunlight, locking his office door behind him. Children crowd around me, wanting to shake my hand. Biwott walks solemnly across the courtyard to the far end. There are a couple of toilets behind one of the classrooms. He motions to one and then goes into the other. I open the door and enter.  Inside, it\u2019s just a small concrete cell with a hole in the middle of the ground. Once the door is closed it\u2019s too dark inside to see even the hole. The smell is overwhelming. I hold my breath and aim somewhere in the middle of the floor. Biwott is waiting for me when I get back outside. He leads me back to his office to finish his story. The year after the world championships, he injured his back. Although he still managed to win a few big marathons, including Rotterdam, his back got worse and he retired at the end of 2003 to set up his school. This is a surprisingly common thing for ex-runners to do. It is partly a way to give something back to the community, partly legacy building, and partly, as the schools are fee-paying, a business to help them through their long retirement. \u201cWhen you take it seriously,\u201d he says wistfully, \u201ctraining is hard. But I miss the experience of running in a team. The way we are all striking the ground together as we run. It was a very enjoyable thing.\u201d Before I leave, he asks me to greet the children. \u201cTell them something that will inspire them with their studies,\u201d he says. In the first classroom, the children spark up a welcoming chant as we enter. Biwott asks them how they are, and they all answer in monotone unison: \u201cWe\u2019re fine, thank you sir, and how are you?\u201d \u201cWe are very lucky today,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have a very special visitor from Great Britain.\u201d  He tells them that I\u2019m a great writer and that, if they study hard at school, they, too, one day could be writers, or doctors, or engineers, and they too could travel the world. The children watch me blankly, this scruffy, bearded white man in their midst. What can I tell them that could possibly have any meaning? Before I can think of an answer, Biwott has handed over to me. I have to speak. Amazingly, utterances come out of my mouth, platitudes about the world being full of opportunity to those who concentrate at school. It sounds good, but hollow, too. They just stare back at me. After I finish the teacher tells them to clap me, and that God is great.  \u201cGod is great and deserves a high five,\u201d they all chant in response, labouriously turning and high-fiving the person next to them. Outside in the courtyard, I breathe a sign of relief.  \u201cNow class seven,\u201d says Biwott, and before I know it we\u2019re trudging in single file into the next classroom to repeat the exercise all over again. The truth is that the opportunities open to these children from the poorest corners of Eldoret are cruelly limited, no matter how hard they work on learning their times tables. Biwott, by starting his school, is doing his best to help them, but he achieved what he did not by studying, but by tenaciously digging to unearth his talent. He was also lucky that his talent was for the thing that provides the best and most realistic chance of worldly success in this corner of east Africa: running. With role models such as Biwott around every corner, it\u2019s no wonder that the streets of Eldoret and all the surrounding villages are full every morning of thousands of Lycra-clad young men and women, flying along the dirt roads, chasing the dream of becoming a top marathon runner. And seeing how fast they all run, it\u2019s no wonder that so many of them succeed. \u2022 Adharanand Finn is the author of Running with the Kenyans and The Way of the Runner (both Faber &amp; Faber)", "sentences": ["\u201cDo you have a passport?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d \u201cDo you want to join us?\u201d \u201cYes.\u201d The other four people he had finished with all went to the Amsterdam marathon a few months later and one of them won."], "title": "'I was almost the marathon world champion'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/the-running-blog/2015/aug/21/i-was-almost-the-marathon-world-champion", "tags": ["Running", "Marathon", "World Athletics Championships", "Athletics", "Sport", "Kenya", "Africa", "World news", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-08-22T14:42:31Z", "article": "The gunman who was overpowered by three US citizens on board a high-speed train to Paris had previously travelled to Syria and was known to French and Spanish intelligence, it has been reported.

According to French media, the suspect has told police officers he is not a terrorist but intended to rob the Thalys passengers at gunpoint having found the weapons \u201cby chance in a park in Brussels\u201d. The Associated Press, however, quoted a Spanish counter-terrorism official as saying the man had recently travelled to Syria. He is understood to have lived in the southern Spanish port of Algeciras until 2014, then moved to France and on to Syria, before returning to France. The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, confirmed the suspect may be a 26-year-old Moroccan whom Spanish authorities had flagged to Paris last year. It was not immediately clear whether he was under surveillance at the time of Friday\u2019s attack. \u201cIf the identity he has declared is confirmed, he is a 26-year-old man of Moroccan nationality identified by the Spanish authorities to French intelligence services in February 2014 because of his connections to the radical Islamist movement,\u201d Cazeneuve said.           Bernard Cazeneuve makes a statement on the train attack    He cautioned, however, that the gunman\u2019s identity had not been 100% confirmed, and said he did not want to disclose any further information. The Belgian federal prosecutor\u2019s office has also opened an investigation because the suspect boarded the train in Brussels, according to spokesman Eric van der Sypt. France will lead the investigation. Under the terms of his arrest, the man can be held for four days without charge.

One other passenger, of dual French-American citizenship, was wounded when the suspect fired his handgun and is also in hospital.  The French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade suffered an injury to his finger requiring five stitches while activating the train\u2019s emergency alarm. Anglade told Paris Match he was with his partner and two children one carriage away from the gunman.

He has been transferred from the local hospital in Arras, where the train made its emergency stop, to a larger facility in Lille.

As two presidents, Barack Obama and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, poured praise on four men whose actions averted a bloodbath on the 3.17pm train from Amsterdam to Paris, with 550 passengers onboard, the details of what happened on the Thalys express 9364 emerged in shocking detail. It was at 5.45pm, as the train crossed the Belgian border into northern France, that a 28-year-old French bank worker left his seat and tried to get into the toilet on coach 12. The door opened on a shirtless dark-haired man, in white trousers and trainers, who was holding a Kalashnikov across his bare chest. Inside his rucksack were nine full magazines of ammunition, holding 280 rounds, and several knives. Somewhere he also had a handgun. Over the next few seconds there was chaos. A shot rang out, a French-American passenger fell forward in his seat, hit in the neck by a bullet from a handgun. Then came a terrifying \u201cclick, click, click\u201d as the half-naked man held his AK-47 aloft, aiming an apparently temporarily jammed gun at occupants of the carriage. As panicking passengers, helpless in their seats, realised there was an armed man in their midst, the train crew ran through carriage 11 towards the guardroom at the end of the train, barricading themselves behind a steel door, leaving people outside banging on it. Meanwhile, in carriage 12, three American childhood friends had been sitting chatting about their night ahead in Paris. They were Anthony Sadler Junior, 23, a final-year student from Sacramento State University, Alek Skarlatos, 22, a member of the Oregon national guard, who was on holiday after a tour of duty in Afghanistan, and Spencer Stone, a member of the US air force. It was the sound of the gun being breeched that caught the soldiers\u2019 attention. \u201cI just looked over at Spence and said, \u2018Let\u2019s go\u2019. He jumped up and ran, grabbed the guy by the neck. I got the handgun off him and threw it,\u201d Skarlatos told reporters afterwards.           Three of the four men who tackled a gunman on a train en route to Paris speak to the press about their actions    But Sadler said Stone had to run the length of the carriage in full sight of the gunman. \u201cWe didn\u2019t know if the gun wasn\u2019t working or anything like that. Spencer just ran anyways and if anyone had gotten shot, it would have been Spencer and we\u2019re just very lucky that nobody got killed.\u201d Chris Norman, 62, a British man living in the south of France, was sitting working on his laptop. \u201cI heard a shot. I heard some glass breaking, then I saw someone running down the aisle towards the front of the train. I stood up to see what was happening and saw a man carrying some kind of a machine gun. My first reaction was to sit down and hide. Then I heard someone, an American, say, \u2018Go get him,\u2019 then another American saying, \u2018Don\u2019t do that buddy\u2019. \u201cI thought it was the only chance to act as a team and try to take over the terrorists. I thought there might be more than one. Spencer overpowered the terrorist in a neck lock and then Alek was in the process of taking his gun. I grabbed his right arm. There was a French man, I think a train driver, who came to take the left.\u201d Norman used his tie to bind the gunman.   Related: France train shooting: gunman 'had been in Syria and was known to intelligence services'    \u201cAlek went to see if there were other terrorists in the train; at that moment we saw an injured person bleeding. Spencer was already hurt: he had almost lost his thumb and was cut several times on the neck. But he intervened because he said he was a medic. It\u2019s very difficult to understand what happened. My thought was, \u2018I\u2019m probably going to die anyway so let\u2019s go\u2019,\u201d Norman said. \u201cI don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t succeed in firing. I think his weapon jammed. We\u2019re very lucky. What can you do? Either you sit down and die, or you get up and die. We\u2019ve seen enough of these kind of attacks to know that they will kill everyone once they get started. It was purely a matter of survival.\u201d Norman added: \u201cI just want to go home and spend some time with my family.\u201d The attacker, Ayoub el-Khazani, a 25-year-old Moroccan known to European intelligence agencies, pleaded with the Americans to give him back his gun, said Sadler. \u201cBut we just carried on beating him up and immobilised him and that was it.\u201d Video footage from passengers inside the train shows the man face-down on the ground, groaning but apparently unconscious, while a shirtless Stone, smeared in blood, administers first aid to the injured passenger next to him. As other passengers searched on the floor for the handgun, the train driver can be heard over the PA system asking train crew to contact him.           Video shot on a mobile phone shows the moments after three US citizens, two of whom were military personnel overpowered a gunman on a high-speed train travelling between Amsterdam and Paris     Stone was moved on Saturday to a specialist hospital in Lille with cuts to his hands and neck. \u201cWe\u2019ve called him and he\u2019s doing great, he\u2019s in disbelief that it happened,\u201d said Sadler. The other passengers\u2019 injuries were not life-threatening, French authorities said. Also hurt was the French actor Jean-Hugues Anglade, known for film roles in Betty Blue and Nikita, who cut his finger to the bone smashing the emergency stop handle to try to halt the train. He gave a graphic account of his ordeal to Paris Match, criticising train staff for refusing to open their steel door even after the gunman had been overcome. Anglade was in coach 11. \u201cWe heard passengers shouting in English \u2018He\u2019s shooting! He\u2019s shooting! He has a Kalashnikov\u2019. I was with my two children and my partner,\u201d he said. \u201cAround us there were another 15 or so passengers. Suddenly, members of the train crew ran down the corridor, backs hunched. Their faces were blanched white. They ran towards their guardroom. They opened it with a special key, then locked themselves inside. The gunman was a few dozen metres from us in coach 12. [He was] coming towards us and seemed determined. I thought it was the end, that we were going to die, that he was going to kill us all. We could see ourselves die because we were stuck in the train and it was impossible to escape this nightmare. We were trapped. \u201cI broke the glass to pull the alarm cord to stop the Thalys. The glass cut my middle finger to the bone and the engines slowed. But we were still trapped inside. \u201cWith our backs to the wall, huddled together one against the other against the metal door of the guardroom we shouted for the staff to let us in. But \u2026 nobody replied. Radio silence. This abandonment, this distress, this solitude was terrible and unbearable. For us it was inhuman. Minutes seemed like hours. I protected my children with my body, telling them everything would be fine. My hand was bleeding a lot, but surprisingly we kept our cool.\u201d He added: \u201cThen a young man, Anthony Sadler, ran into our coach shouting that the gunman had been overcome by off-duty American soldiers and that everything was fine. He was looking for blankets and a first-aid kit for the two seriously injured. He knocked on the door of the guardroom, but once again there was no answer.\u201d Christophe Sargollo, a rail union spokesman, told BFMTV that the Thalys staff had acted \u201cfor the best security of the train\u201d. \u201cI insist on congratulating them on their sang-froid,\u201d he said. Most of the congratulations pouring in were for the heroes of carriage 12. The French prime minister, Manuel Valls, described the Americans as \u201cespecially courageous\u201d and said they had \u201cshown their bravery in extremely difficult circumstances\u201d. \u201cWe express all our gratitude, recognition and admiration for the sang-froid that they showed, without which we could have perhaps faced a terrible drama,\u201d Valls added. All three, along with Norman, were awarded bravery medals by the mayor of Arras, the town where the train finally stopped, and where the gunman was taken off by anti-terrorist officers. He is now being held at the specialist terrorist brigade headquarters at Levallois-Perret near Paris. As a bemused Sadler senior and his wife Mariah faced television crews in California, he said he was just grateful no one had been killed. \u201cWe live in a falling world that is full of good and evil,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know that there is a safe place anywhere to shelter your children.\u201d He had heard that his son was to meet President Hollande. \u201cI\u2019m still wrapping my head around that right now.\u201d", "sentences": ["As two presidents, Barack Obama and Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, poured praise on four men whose actions averted a bloodbath on the 3.17pm train from Amsterdam to Paris, with 550 passengers onboard, the details of what happened on the Thalys express 9364 emerged in shocking detail.", "Video shot on a mobile phone shows the moments after three US citizens, two of whom were military personnel overpowered a gunman on a high-speed train travelling between Amsterdam and Paris     Stone was moved on Saturday to a specialist hospital in Lille with cuts to his hands and neck."], "title": "US student tells of his attack on French train gunman", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/aug/22/us-student-tells-of-attack-on-french-train-gunman", "tags": ["France train attack", "France", "Europe", "Belgium", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-08-22T19:08:28Z", "article": "Lewis Hamilton has denied he was responsible for posting a video of himself firing an automatic weapon on Instagram, that attracted considerable criticism.

The name of the gunman was confirmed by French police as Ayoub el-Khazani, a 25-year-old Moroccan, known to Belgian, French and Spanish authorities, who travelled to fight in Syria last year, prompting the belief that the attack was linked to Islamic State. French authorities were questioning Khazani at their counter-terrorism headquarters outside Paris as remarkable details continued to emerge of how the heavily armed gunman was overpowered by passengers on the train in France.     A photograph reported by television channel France 2 to be of Ayoub el-Khazani. Photograph: Facebook    A Briton, and two US servicemen, one of whom suffered knife wounds in the struggle to subdue the Kalashnikov-carrying attacker, were among those who wrestled him to the ground after he had boarded in Brussels. Within hours of the thwarted attack, security measures on the high-speed Thalys trains between France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany were upgraded with increased patrols and baggage checks at international rail stations. French police confirmed the gunman\u2019s identity and said he was known to intelligence services as a radical Islamist who went to Syria in 2014. The office of Charles Michel, Belgium\u2019s prime minister, also confirmed that Khazani was known to Belgian authorities and they had been informed by Spain that he was a security risk. It also emerged that the he may have lived in France before travelling to Syria.           Bernard Cazeneuve, the French minister of the interior, says the individual arrested could be a Moroccan man who Spanish intelligence services warned French police about in 2014    What is known is that before his attack he travelled to Belgium\u2019s busiest station \u2013 the terminus of the Eurostar rail link to Britain, Brussels\u2019 Gare du Midi \u2013 to board the train. Security experts have repeatedly warned of \u201cblowback\u201d \u2013 the term used to describe the rebound of violence from one area to another \u2013 and say the terrorist threat posed by European jihadis who have fought in Syria or Iraq returning home is significant. A spokesman for Europol, the EU\u2019s police agency, said on Saturday that Europeans returning from Iraq and Syria presented the \u201cmost serious terrorist threat Europe has faced since 9/11\u201d. The agency\u2019s latest assessment indicates that as many as 5,000 Europeans have joined the fighting in Syria, posing a potentially significant risk to their native countries. This includes around 600 Britons, 1,200 French nationals and at least 350 Belgians, the latter giving the country the largest contingent of foreign fighters relative to the size of its Muslim population. Until the confirmation that Khazani was the gunman, the only case of Isis \u201cblowback\u201d in Europe had been Mehdi Nemmouche, a 29-year-old French national of Algerian origin who has been charged with attacking the Brussels Jewish Museum in May 2014. Nemmouche had spent more than a year in Syria, and police found links to Isis.   Related: France train shooting: gunman 'had been in Syria and was known to intelligence services'    Bernard Cazeneuve, France\u2019s interior minister, said that Spanish authorities had initially alerted French intelligence services in February 2014 to Khazani because of his connections to the radical Islamist movement. In response, French authorities placed him on the country\u2019s state security \u201cS-list\u201d, which identifies suspects noted for \u201clinks with terrorism\u201d, although not all are placed under surveillance. Raffaello Pantucci, a counter-terrorism expert, said there was a \u201chigh probability\u201d that Khazani had forged links to Isis. Claude Moniquet, the chief executive of the European Strategic Intelligence and Security Centre, agreed that he was \u201cvery probably linked to Islamic State\u201d. Others pointed out the similarities with the recent attack in the Tunisian beach resort of Sousse in which a gunman, also armed with an AK-47, killed 38 people, mainly British tourists. The French newspaper La Voix du Nord claimed that Khazani may have had connections with a group involved in a suspected Islamist shooting in Belgium in January. On 8 January, 24 hours after the attacks at Charlie Hebdo in Paris, Belgian police killed two suspected Islamist extremists and arrested a third. The suspects were allegedly on the point of carrying out an attack.

Ayoub El-Khazzani, 25, a Moroccan national, opened fire with a Kalashnikov on the high-speed Thalys train on Friday, but was wrestled to the floor by three American passengers, aided by a British man. After the French interior minister said European intelligence services had flagged up the suspect\u2019s links to \u201cradical Islamist movements\u201d, French investigators were focusing on an extremist attack. Under questioning at France\u2019s anti-terrorist police headquarters just outside Paris, El-Khazzani, whose face was reportedly still bruised after his beating by the American passengers who overcame him, denied terrorism or any intention of waging a jihadi attack. He said he had merely stumbled upon a weapons stash and decided to use it to rob passengers.   Related: France train attack heroes: 'In time of crisis, do something'    \u201cHe doesn\u2019t understand why this incident has taken on such great proportions,\u201d his lawyer, Sophie Duval, told Le Parisien, adding that El-Khazzani said he had just wanted to rob passengers and denied \u201cany terrorism dimension to what he did\u201d. The lawyer added that suggestions of terrorism \u201calmost made him laugh\u201d. El-Khazzani, who was armed with a Kalashnikov assault rifle, nine magazines, a pistol and a box cutter, told police he had found the arms, as well as a mobile phone, in an abandoned suitcase in a park near the Brussels station where he normally sleeps. His lawyer said: \u201cHe has been homeless since his identity documents were stolen in Brussels. He has worked as a painter in Spain, where he was also convicted twice for drug trafficking in 2013.\u201d Le Parisien reported that he spoke Arabic and knew a few words of French, and was being assisted by a translator in police questioning. His lawyer later told BFMTV of her impressions of El-Khazzani in the first hours of his police interview: \u201c[I saw] somebody who was very sick, somebody very weakened physically, as if he suffered from malnutrition, very, very thin and very haggard.\u201d  She said he told him he had found the Kalashnikov in a park near the Gare du Midi rail station in Brussels where he was in the habit of sleeping. \u201cA few days later he decided to get on a train that some other homeless people told him would be full of wealthy people travelling from Amsterdam to Paris and he hoped to feed himself by armed robbery,\u201d she said.            Bernard Cazeneuve, the French minister of the interior, holds a press conference on Saturday following the thwarted attack on a train travelling to Paris by a gunman    El-Khazzani, who will turn 26 on 3 September, has been a legal resident in Spain for the past seven years. His family comes from Tetu\u00e1n in Morocco and El-Khazzani lived in Madrid from 2007-10 before settling in the El Saladillo neighbourhood of Algeciras in southern Spain. The family lived from collecting and selling waste. El-Khazzani was known to the police as a petty criminal. He was arrested on three occasions for drug offences, for which he was convicted, although police did not give details of his sentence. He and his father both attended Taqwa, a radical Salafist mosque in Algeciras. As a result he was put on the Spanish police database of suspected terrorists.  During his time in Spain, he came to the attention of the authorities for making hardline speeches defending jihad, a Spanish counter-terrorism source told AFP. When he left Spain in 2014, the security forces alerted their French counterparts, describing him as a \u201cdangerous radical\u201d. El-Kazzani\u2019s lawyer said he had declared under police questioning that in the past six months he had travelled in Spain, Andorra, Belgium, Austria and Germany and had passed through France, without saying where. He denied having been to Turkey or Syria. The exact breakdown of his travels over the past year remains unclear. An official linked to Spain\u2019s anti-terrorism unit told the Associated Press that El-Kazzani had lived in Spain until last year, then moved to France, from where he travelled to Syria and returned to France.  A French official said the alarm bell sounded for the French on 10 May in Berlin, when German security services identified him boarding a flight from Berlin to Istanbul. The French transmitted this information to Spain, which advised on 21 May that he no longer lived there but in Belgium. A French source told AFP that the suspect \u201clived in Belgium, got on the train in Belgium with weapons likely acquired in Belgium. And he had identity papers issued in Spain.\u201d Bernard Cazeneuve, the French interior minister, said Spanish intelligence services had tipped off France about his ties to radical Islamist movements, but it is unclear whether he lived in France at any time after leaving Spain.           Video shot on a mobile phone shows the moments after three US citizens, two of whom were military personnel, overpowered a gunman on a high-speed train travelling between Amsterdam and Paris    In Belgium, where an investigation is also underway, Koen Geens, the justice minister, confirmed that El-Khazzani was known to the country\u2019s intelligence services. Heavily armed, El-Khazzani left a toilet cubicle on the high-speed train just after it crossed from Belgium into northern France. He had a Kalashnikov strapped across his shoulder when a French citizen trying to use the toilet encountered him and tried to subdue him, Cazeneuve said.  A French passenger who happened to be there tried to disarm Khazzani \u2013 who was described as \u201csmall, slim, not very strong\u201d \u2013 but he got away and fired at least one shot, wounding a Franco-American traveller in his fifties. Bullets started flying and two American servicemen, with help from a friend and a Briton, tackled and disarmed him. Khazzani was arrested when the train carrying 554 passengers came to an emergency stop at Arras station in northern France.

But in a democratic age, the real stuff of heroism is in the contrast between the ordinariness of the individuals and the extraordinariness of their actions. The three young Americans whose split-second response to a life-threatening terrorist attack probably saved dozens, even scores, of lives of passengers on the 3.17 express from Amsterdam to Paris on Friday afternoon were hardly less ordinary than most of the rest of us. Two of them, Alek Skarlatos, 22, and Spencer Stone, 23, were serving members of the US armed forces. But the third, Anthony Sadler Junior, 23, was only a student, in his final-year at Sacramento State University. None of them appears to have been trained in any way to tackle a heavily armed terrorist in a confined space. They were just three young men looking forward to a night out in Paris, when they heard shots and took action. In an act of extraordinary courage, they ran the full length of the carriage to confront the man, 25-year-old Ayoub el-Khazzani, a Moroccan national. No wonder the US ambassador to France, Jane Hartley, was beaming almost uncontrollably as journalists from the world\u2019s media queued to say thank you to her fellow American citizens. It was not only the Americans: at least as remarkable was a Frenchman, now refusing to give interviews, who first encountered the gunman and was shot when he tackled him. And so too was the decision of Chris Norman, 62, a Briton in the same carriage as the Americans, sitting working on his laptop. When he heard the gunshots his first instinct was the entirely rational one: he looked for somewhere to hide. But then he took inspiration from the young Americans and joined the battle, reportedly providing \u2013 in a detail too good not to be true \u2013 his tie in order to bind the captive\u2019s hands. Every attack of this nature sends another tremor through the structures of civil society. Trust between travellers will become a little more fragile; security at train stations may be stepped up. Intelligence agencies should be left, once again, considering the lessons to be learned from allowing a recognised potential risk \u2013 El-Khazzani had been identified as a radical Islamist, and there are unconfirmed reports that he had travelled recently to Syria \u2013 to acquire weapons and launch a challenge. But perhaps even more important is the renewed evidence of the power of one or two people to prevent harm and to do good. Society needs its heroes, and although the names that history remembers tend to be the ones who are prepared to confront death, or who refuse to accept it as beyond resistance \u2013 like the 33 passengers on Flight 93 on 9/11 who took a vote to tackle the hi-jackers rather than allow their plane to be used as a flying bomb \u2013 heroism takes many forms. By striking coincidence, shortly before the four passengers on the Paris express overpowered the putative terrorist, Malala the young Pakistani woman shot by the Taliban to stop her going to school, passed a string of GCSEs at A and A* to add to her Nobel peace prize. Heroic actions are what shape the scope of public ambition.

Francois Hollande is to travel to Berlin on Monday evening to draft common Franco-German initiatives on immigration and security with Angela Merkel. They will also focus on the worsening situation in eastern Ukraine. Berlin, in particular, is increasingly determined to push a new system of mandatory quotas for refugees across the EU despite the plan being rejected amid acrimonious scenes by EU leaders at a summit in June. The European commission is also to propose a new \u201cpermanent\u201d system of emergency refugee-sharing across the union. Following Friday\u2019s abortive train attack in France, and given the immigration pressure, several EU countries have said that national border controls may have to be re-established across Europe\u2019s Schengen passport-free travel zone. Berlin is also warning of reintroducing national border controls unless other countries step up to the plate and share the refugee burden more equitably.  Proposals from Brussels in May to introduce mandatory refugee quotas across the EU on a small initial scale were rejected by Spain and most of eastern Europe. At their June summit, leaders argued till 3.30am and agreed nothing. Since then, the number of migrants entering Greece, Italy and the Balkans has soared, with Germany predicting the arrival of 800,000 asylum seekers and refugees this year and figures for the EU projected to triple compared with 2014.           The tiny Greek island sinking under Europe\u2019s migrant crisis    Thousands of exhausted migrants crossed on foot from Macedonia into Serbia on Monday on their way to the EU. The rush came after Macedonia lifted a blockade of its border with Greece, which was put in place when thousands of migrants rushed past Macedonian police, who tried to stop their entry by force. About 7,000 migrants, including many women with babies and small children, crossed into Serbia over the weekend. Some were pushed in wheelchairs or walked on crutches. After entering Serbia, the migrants will head further north towards Hungary, which is an EU member. From there they want to head to richer EU countries. The commission, as the guardian of the Schengen system, insisted on Monday that the free travel area was sacrosanct and would not be changed, but added that national authorities could mount identity checks and other monitoring measures on rail traffic and in problem areas as long as the action did not amount to border controls. With European asylum and immigration policies increasingly confused and national governments failing to come up with a coherent response to the worst migratory pressures witnessed in many countries, Berlin and Brussels are sounding the alarm. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the commission, has said the failure to be more generous and sharing on the refugee issue meant that \u201cthis is not the Europe I want to live in\u201d.   Related: Europe\u2019s migrant \u2018emergency\u2019 is entirely of its own making | Rube1n Andersson    Germany\u2019s social democrat leaders warned that public opinion would turn against the EU if it was left with more than one third of those seeking asylum in Europe, while many other countries, mostly in eastern Europe, admitted minimal numbers of refugees. On Monday it emerged that the German authorities had decided to waive certain EU asylum rules for Syrians, without informing Brussels. Berlin\u2019s immigration authority ruled that all Syrians entering Germany would have their asylum claims processed, forgoing the right to have them deported back to the first EU country the claimants entered. German chancellor Angela Merkel condemned violent protests against refugees that erupted over the weekend in eastern Germany, blaming them on far-right extremists who were bent on spreading a \u201cdisgusting\u201d message of hatred.  More than 30 police were injured in clashes in the town of Heidenau, near Dresden, early on Saturday morning after a mob of several hundred people began pelting officers with bottles and fireworks. Some of them shouted \u201cHeil Hitler\u201d.  Germany has witnessed dozens of arson attacks on asylum shelters in recent months. But the violence in Heidenau, which continued on Saturday and Sunday nights, was unprecedented.  Associated Press contributed to this report.

From New York to Sydney, the complaints are indistinguishable. Sitting among 450 of the world\u2019s leading labour law scholars at the University of Amsterdam in June, I met a young Belgian scholar who confided that he only used Uber because it provided a superior service. \u201cI never use Belgian cab drivers,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are fucking pigs.\u201d  As I journeyed on the fast train from Paris to Amsterdam that week, French newspapers were running hard on protest action and a subsequent strike by French taxi drivers against Uber. Violent attacks on Uber drivers and clients had prompted a public outcry.    Related: Uber bookings more than treble in a year to nearly $11bn, says report    Weeks earlier, a California court had ruled against Uber in deciding that its drivers were employees, and thereby entitled to important legal protections. Uber promptly announced an appeal, maintaining that its drivers were independent contractors in business for themselves. A new breed of entrepreneur, no less. For decades now, hapless judges in different parts of the globe have been wrestling with the task of correctly classifying workers, dutifully trying to apply old employment laws to often complex and elaborate new work arrangements.  The results are a mess, often producing farcical decisions. A low-paid factory worker can go home on Friday only to turn up to the same workplace the following Monday as a contractor \u2013 with a pay cut and fewer benefits. Is this the entrepreneurial risk-taking spirit at play? Only in the sense that the unlucky worker assumes the risk of getting sick and not being paid when she is too sick to work. Uber is merely the latest battle ground for the same debate. Businesses have been shedding their identity as employers for at least 30 years. For example, back in 1991, the Federal Court of Australia decided that carpenters and labourers supplied by the labour hire company Troubleshooters Available to their client, Odco, were not employees of either company but were in fact independent contractors. The triangular structure (business \u2013 labour hire company \u2013 independent contractors) meant that these workers assumed a new identity: as self-employed entrepreneurs in business for themselves. The decision cleared the way for labour hire companies to provide labour to businesses at attractive rates. Pre-existing wage rates, annual leave, sick leave and other employee entitlements were quickly eliminated from the workplace.   Related: Uber denies misleading passengers with 'phantom cars' on app    In the decades since, there has been a steady growth in these precarious work structures. Hotels have fired their cleaners and housekeepers, replacing them with \u201ccontractors\u201d supplied by intermediaries. Low-paid migrant women have suddenly found themselves in business \u2013 for themselves, but with fewer rights. This is how the way we work is being radically transformed: through a combination of restructuring, globalisation and the formidable power of the internet. Businesses are deploying an array of structures by which they can profit from the work performed by others without the cost, risk or aggravation of actually dealing with them.  Academic David Weil has coined the term the \u201cfissured workplace\u201d to describe the phenomenon of business delegating their employing function to other entities, creating intermediaries between the workers and the business profiting from that work. The intent behind the fissured workplace is to avoid employment laws and thereby cut the cost of labour \u2013 usually by about one third. Standard wage rates and other employee entitlements that have been achieved by employees and their unions over decades can be eliminated with remarkable ease, rendering employment laws increasingly irrelevant. In essence, people formerly known as \u201cemployees\u201d have lost that identity to schemes drafted by lawyers and top-tier accountants involving labour hire agencies, dependent and independent contracting, franchising, supply chains and digitalised labour.  The same lawyers and accountants using the same logic are also behind the elaborate tax structures adopted by multinational corporations. Instead of subverting employment laws, those schemes subvert tax laws. Avoiding tax and cutting the cost of labour continue to be key drivers of profitability for demanding shareholders. Global labour supply chains are de rigeur for many of the world\u2019s most prominent brands, including Apple and Nike. Instead of one intermediary between a company and the workers who make its product, there can be many. This in turn triggers a loss of quality control, by which I mean control over the quality of conditions under which people work. Periodically, big brands find themselves having to engage in damage control: sometimes the workers die, sometimes they work in grossly exploitative environments. Sometimes, they\u2019re children. As for Uber? Its revolution is actually a reversion to the same triangular labour supply configuration, but with a twist. By dint of the internet, labour hire companies are no longer required. Now what stands between a corporation and the workers who generate its profit is an app. The implications are profound. If bargaining with a labour hire company is almost impossible, how do you bargain with an app? You\u2019re interested in a career structure? Go tell your iPhone. You preferred being a paid employee with some security of tenure? You\u2019re in the wrong job. Get hip to the gig economy, sister. Badly paid Uber drivers have replaced badly paid cab drivers, but this will not endure. Driverless cars will eventually mow down Uber. But behind Uber is an army of other tech companies seeking to apply the same methodology to other services and products \u2013 cleaners, business consultants, administrators, personal assistants, nurses, lawyers and couriers are all being Uberised. Many more employees will lose their jobs and current remuneration. Relying on the odd legal challenge or media shaming campaign may be all there is, but it\u2019s about as effective as trying to put out a bushfire with a water pistol. The Economist has correctly identified that current laws are hopelessly inadequate: \u201cThe fundamental problem is that in America, as in many other rich countries, employment law has failed to keep up with the changing realities of modern work.\u201d Existing employment laws, like current tax laws, in many developed countries are no longer fit for purpose. Employment law needs to be replaced by work law.  Let the debate about its content and how it should operate begin.

After president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande on Monday awarded Norman with France\u2019s highest distinction, the L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur, for helping to avert a massacre on the high-speed Amsterdam-to-Paris train, the 62-year-old grandfather of three said the events were still sinking in. \u201cThe journey was going fine, passengers were beginning to sleep a bit, there wasn\u2019t much noise in the carriage and I was working on my computer trying to get the Wi-Fi to connect,\u201d said Norman, who has lived in France for 25 years.  \u201cThe first thing I heard was what I assumed was a gunshot,\u201d he said.

Let\u2019s go!\u201d  Two of the Americans were off-duty soldiers on holiday in Europe. One, Spencer Stone, held the gunman, 25-year-old Moroccan, Ayoub El-Khazzani, in a choke-hold, while the other, Alek Skarlatos, first took away the Kalashnikov, then a pistol that the gunman had pulled on him.  \u201cI just pounced on the gunman\u2019s arm so that he couldn\u2019t actually use it, and I held his arm to the ground,\u201d Norman said. \u201cWe all held him until he stopped struggling.\u201d  The Americans beat the gunman until he lost consciousness. \u201cAlek had held the pistol to his head and said \u2018Stop, stop,\u2019 and that had no effect \u2013 he carried on struggling,\u201d Norman said. When the gunman began to lose consciousness, Skarlatos told Norman to hold down the man while he went to look for any other gunmen and Stone tended to a man who had been shot.  An off-duty French train driver travelling in the carriage held down the gunman\u2019s other arm.  Norman wanted to make sure the gunman remained immobile. \u201cFirst, I held his hands behind his back. Then somebody came along with cable ties which we tried to put on him ... My hands were covered with sweat so I pulled the cable ties with my teeth. They didn\u2019t work, so a passenger gave me his tie.\u201d Norman used the tie to restrain the gunman\u2019s hands, then he and the off-duty train driver tied his feet together with another passenger\u2019s scarf.  \u201cI was dead scared that there might be [another gunman] on the train,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I was just trying to make certain that this guy was not going to get up again and didn\u2019t have any opportunity to be a threat.\u201d  He said of the gunman: \u201cHe was slight, he didn\u2019t appear to me to be very strong ... But I was also concerned that he was on drugs of some sort and who knows what kind of strength that can give? So I was being very cautious.\u201d When the train made an emergency stop at Arras station in northern France, police boarded the train to arrest the gunman.

If you make a decision, if you see something like that and there is an opportunity, then act. \u201cI think the traditional advice that we\u2019ve all grown up with over the last 30 or 40 years is don\u2019t intervene, don\u2019t do those kinds of things.  \u201cBecause I think the ways terrorists once operated was very different. They weren\u2019t killing people to start off with. Whereas here they come in and they\u2019re going to kill you, so you have to think about it differently.\u201d  Asked what he had learned about himself, Norman said: \u201cI always wondered how I would react.

I watched Katrina unfold on television, and after seeing those shocking images, I felt passionately that I needed to come home and use my training to help rebuild the city. I didn\u2019t get to New Orleans until about a month later. My brother picked me up and we drove around the city \u2013 we saw awful devastation. His house on Jena Street in Uptown, near the Baptist hospital, was flooded. The entire first floor was ruined; mould had begun to eat the walls. The wooden floors were buckled and the smell was putrid. There was debris all over the streets, and there had been many fires in that neighbourhood. I began volunteering doing urban planning work, and ended up working in the governor\u2019s recovery office, putting plans together for the rebuilding of the city and surrounding communities that were impacted. I\u2019ve been in New Orleans ever since. In November 2014, I was appointed the city\u2019s first chief resilience officer, a role developed by the Rockefeller Foundation\u2019s 100 Resilient Cities initiative. Today we are launching our \u201cresilience strategy\u201d, in the week that the city marks the 10th anniversary of Katrina.            New Orleans is arguably the most vulnerable city in the US, and one of the most vulnerable cities in the world, to climate change and sea-level rise. The attention on those threats is new. I think we\u2019ve done a very good job of rebuilding the city since Katrina, but now we need to exist in the future \u2013 that\u2019s been the perspective shift for us. Understanding what 50 years from now looks like; rebuilding the city to withstand what it is that we\u2019re going be faced with in 50 years\u2019 time. For New Orleans that means looking at climate change, sea-level rise models and coastal erosion; figuring out the improvements that have to be made so we have a much more robust flooding infrastructure system. This city is just shy of 300 years old and it has always been a testing place to live, but our future challenges look very different to our past ones. We have to adapt to survive. We are a city that really needs to start to understand that we cannot engineer ourselves out of our environment. Instead of thinking that engineering solutions can solve all the problems, we need to reengineer the city to live with its environmental conditions. At its heart my job is about connecting a lot of disparate pieces. Past focus on the surge barrier and flood protection system, education and job creation has produced really well thought-out initiatives, but in many ways they\u2019ve been isolated from one another. My role has been to connect those together and show how interdependent they are.     A storm surge barrier in Rotterdam: \u2018We have probably more in common with Rotterdam and Amsterdam than a city like Dallas.\u2019 Photograph: Frans Lemmens/Corbis    Developing the resilience strategy has been an eight-month process, involving more than 350 individuals. We examined each of 21 challenges, from transportation and social mobility to violence and housing affordability. Three core themes emerged: \u201cadapt to thrive\u201d (we are a city that embraces our changing environment); \u201cconnect to opportunity\u201d (we are an equitable city), and \u201ctransform city systems\u201d (we are a modern and prepared city). When you talk about resilience, you\u2019re really talking about people. New Orleanians have bounced back from adversity time and again over the history of this city, whether it be from hurricanes or the BP oil spill. So a big component of our work must be around awareness and outreach. But just having information saying \u201cthis is going to happen\u201d is not helpful. Having the tools available for people to act is very important. For the resilient cities programme, we\u2019ve been working with partners on building solutions that allow people to adapt \u2013 creating opportunities for the public sector, the private sector and individual citizens to take steps to prevent or mitigate against conditions we see coming. For example, incentivising property owners to invest in risk reduction schemes such as elevating their homes. We want to create a culture of environmental awareness \u2013 which also means committing to mitigating the city\u2019s climate impact, for example by looking into setting greenhouse gas emission standards for New Orleans. The biggest economic impact in this region is from the port system. Oil spills and coastal erosion expose the vulnerability of the petroleum infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico. With coastal erosion, the protection for those pipelines is going away as much as protection for the city itself. So there\u2019s an economic point to protecting the coast as well as an environmental one.    Our future challenges look very different to our past ones.

There\u2019s the scientific and technical side: how do you build systems to live in these deltaic environments? But then the other side is the education and outreach component: the Dutch start with their children, teaching them how to live within this sort of environment and what it means. We need the natural systems and the engineered systems to be in balance, which is something the Dutch are pretty good at.   Related: Is New Orleans in danger of turning into a modern-day Atlantis?    Mainstream technological solutions that are not bespoke to New Orleans are not going to help us. We have probably more in common with Rotterdam and Amsterdam than a city like Dallas.

The resilient cities programme has given us a stage to talk about these issues in a way that probably would not have existed before.

I could go out and experience magic on the dancefloor with men. But I always dreaded what I sought most: a moment of intimacy. At that point my coach would turn back into a pumpkin and my gown would disappear in an instant. When I was studying abroad in Leiden, Holland, during law school, I met a handsome Italian whom I\u2019ll call Adriano. At a get-together with other students, he stared across the room at me the whole evening. I tried to ignore what was happening, to no avail. I could not sustain conversation with whomever I was talking to. After a few minutes I got up to leave; but he intercepted me. The next thing I knew, I was in a conversation with him, trying to catch the breath he was taking away. Adriano was tall and broad-shouldered, with curly dark brown hair and clear golden brown eyes. He spoke fluent English with a slight Italian accent. He had recently decided on law as an undergraduate major. He had the opportunity to come check out the Netherlands and thought he\u2019d take the adventure north to broaden his mind. Basically, he was perfect.  And, it turns out, he had been waiting to talk to me for weeks. He lived in the same student housing and had seen me coming and going through the courtyard. \u201cI was going to leave you a note,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t sure which mailbox was yours.\u201d Terrified that this exchange might lead somewhere, I said goodbye and vanished.  The following afternoon, I was walking across the courtyard with my laundry, when there he was, having materialized sitting behind a window downstairs. \u201cCome here,\u201d he said, curling his finger back and forth.  We chatted a bit \u2013 he said he was just hanging out and \u201cmunching\u201d on peanuts, which prompted me to wonder how many Americans would know the word for munching in any language other than English \u2013 and then it came: \u201cWhat are you doing tonight?\u201d  \u201cI\u2019m going to Amsterdam,\u201d I said \u201cHmm. Can I come?\u201d That night we rode my bike to the train station. He insisted on pedaling, and I sat on the metal storage rack over the back wheel. It was September in Northern Europe, and so the day had grown dark and even a little chilly by the time we departed. Leiden was quiet and the canals twinkled with reflections of lights from the streets and houses nearby. I lay my cheek on his shoulder blade, closed my eyes, felt the muscles of his back move as he stood up to pedal over a bridge, and tried to savor a moment from fiction, it seemed.  In Amsterdam we went to a bar that I\u2019d discovered, which had a wide cushioned bench hidden in the back. It wasn\u2019t long before we were lying next to one another and making out.  Overhead, an exposed light bulb shone and threatened to douse the mood, so I stood on the bench, leaned over the doorway, and unscrewed it. \u201cHard movements,\u201d Adriano said. \u201cSometimes the way you move is \u2026 a little hard.\u201d They notice the details, these guys, they\u2019re always watching every little thing, I thought. I remembered the other Italian I kissed in Amsterdam two months before, a scraggly young man who, as he snuggled next to me inside my tent in the pot-smoked campground where we met, raised his eyebrows when I yawned wide and taught me to cover my teeth with my lips like a girl.  During the train ride back to Leiden, I kept turning away from Adriano to stare through the window at the nighttime outside. He was trying to hold my hand, and sometimes I let him, then I would withdraw.  The bike ride back to our student housing was not the same as before for me. I often say that I never know how a man is going to react to a discussion about my past \u2013 and my genitalia \u2013 and it\u2019s always true at the beginning, I never do. Yet at some point I will have an intuition. I sense it, and just know.  Adriano was all over me the moment we stepped in the door. My heart came apart a little as I placed my palms on his chest and drew away. \u201cI have something to tell you,\u201d I said. \u201cCan we just sit down for a minute?\u201d We sat on the edge of my bed, a miserable excuse of springs and plastic that only a college dorm room can get away with. He took my hands in his and looked at me with such earnestness that I struggled to speak. \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong? Are you on your period? It doesn\u2019t bother me, really.\u201d I laughed. \u201cReally.\u201d I lifted my hand to his cheek and smiled. \u201cNo,\u201d I said, \u201cit\u2019s very different from that.\u201d After I told him, he bolted up and looked down at me in rage. \u201cYou\u2019re a man?\u201d he shouted. \u201cNo, I\u2019m trying to explain \u2013\u201d He tightened his fists. I thought he was going to hit me.  But he didn\u2019t. He just turned around and left.  I cried myself to sleep that night. My dreams had come true: I got to be Cinderella for an evening with a dashing young Italian man who was the cutest one in a room of so many others. The experience was beyond anything I had dared to imagine.  But greediness had spelled the end. I had stayed past midnight to dance a little longer with Adriano, which I should never have done. I had lost track of the ground while soaring through the sky. It was glorious, until everything fell apart. My gown had turned to rags, and I was covered in soot.

I plumped for an anniversary edition 1985 Raleigh Classic. All original, from 531ST tubing forks to Brooks saddle tail. These days I go just about everywhere on that bike, rain or shine.  In 2011 I joined the Transport for Greater Manchester (TFGM) committee and gravitated to buses and bicycles. I made sure Manchester City Council and TFGM participated fully in the All Party Parliamentary Cycling Group \u201cGet Britain Cycling\u201d Inquiry. This helped provide a platform for Cycle City Ambition, in which Manchester\u2019s ten districts won the largest grant. Later in 2013 I became TFGM Committee\u2019s first Cycling and Active Travel champion. Last Tuesday I was pedalling along one long-standing Dutch-style cycle lane along Alan Turing Way, ready to launch myself across three lanes of fast traffic to turn right to the velodrome, when an alert pinged. A few minutes later I read an article by the Guardian\u2019s North of England editor about cycling in my city that made my heart sink.  \u201cWhy Manchester is a terrible cycling city\u201d screamed the headline. Every fault recited was of course recognisable to any determined daily cyclist negotiating the same impenetrable city centre and the same A56 commute through St George\u2019s roundabout.  Lots of good points. Yet I had an overwhelming feeling that the conclusions were wrong, and deeply unfair.  It seemed unfair firstly because it singled Manchester out. Helen Pidd could have been describing just about any UK town or city. \u201cThe UK is a terrible cycling country\u201d might have been fairer. Though thousands of us are now working on changing that. TFGM has had a cycling remit since 2011 and people on bikes and on foot now make 22% of journeys to work and study to central Manchester, predominantly walking. There\u2019s huge scope for growth yet there is virtually no mainstream budget for us. Our cycle ambition proposal, Veocity2025, aims to boost us from 2% to 10% of all journeys by bike by 2025. Pretty ambitious, though the local campaign group Love Your Bike suggests 20%, and by 2020! But to progress, for either target, beyond the strong and fearless 1% and the have-a-go 7% identified in similar Portland, Oregon we will need the jazzy grooves of Amsterdam, the broad shoulders of Copenhagen, and perhaps some quick wins via the creative paint and planters of Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens. It seemed unfair secondly because references to past projects were partial with no recognition of any positives. OK, the premium parking solution that is City Tower Cycle Hub does not float everyone\u2019s boat, with an annual subscription costing \u00a3100. I always park on public hoops or informally in the street myself to keep my feet on the ground. But that Hub is now one of a dozen with more on the way, all but two virtually free. And yes, the 20 year old lanes along the Bridgewater Viaduct, across St George\u2019s Roundabout, and onwards to Chester Road and Chorlton Road are not perfect, though Love Cycling Go Dutch experts were largely positive. But there are miles and miles of new and improved cycling routes. Not least along Wilmslow Road and Oxford Road, with the Love Cycling Go Dutch expert solutions proposed in a funding vacuum just three years ago now set to be largely delivered by Christmas, particularly in Rusholme as we go the extra mile.  Similar Dutch-style separated facilities are also in design for routes for Chorlton and Stretford, under Cycle City Ambition 2, potentially converging at a significantly upgraded St George\u2019s. The concept is for such \u201cspokes\u201d on all major radial routes, and much more besides.  The article seemed unfair thirdly in referring so favourably to London. They are making good progress, but that really is not like for like. Boris boasts of a rolling \u00a31 billion ten-year budget and has a big head-start. Eight years ago Ken Livingstone and Konnie Huq were promoting the Hovis London Freewheel, which became the model for those traffic-free Sky Rides Helen mentioned.  It\u2019s not all about money of course. And \u00a342m from Cycle City Ambition grants is very welcome. But, personally speaking, spending \u00a310m a year across almost three million people (around \u00a33.50 per head) when Kingston is spending \u00a330m for a Mini Holland serving 170,000 people (\u00a3176.50 per head) does rather underline the current North-South divide and the need to more in Manchester.

With volunteers returning week after week to carefully preserve the posters and relight the candles, the monument to the republic has become an unofficial shrine not just to those who were killed, but to the spirit of the post-attack rally itself. Paris hadn\u2019t seen a gathering of this size since the lib\u00e9ration from the Nazis in 1944. The four million people and 50 heads of state who took to the streets across France after the attacks were seen as taking part in a show of national unity and resilience, defending not just liberty, equality, fraternity, but tolerance. Since then, the so-called \u201cspirit of 11 January\u201d \u2013 the date of the street rallies \u2013 has been seized upon by politicians as shorthand for all that is best and still great about France. While the aftermath of the attacks has been bitterly contested, no one questioned the street rallies themselves, which were seen as sacrosanct: the one positive sign in one of France\u2019s grimmest hours.     Some of the estimated two million people who demonstrated in Paris in the wake of the attacks. Photograph: Christopher Furlong/Getty Images    But then a leading French intellectual, the leftwing historian and sociologist Emmanuel Todd, lobbed what he called his own \u201cmagnificently crafted Exocet missile\u201d at the nation, with a book arguing that the street rallies were a giant lie. The rallies, he argued, were not what they claimed to be \u2013 an admirable coming-together of people from different ethnic, religious and social backgrounds standing up for tolerance \u2013 but an odious display of middle-class domination, prejudice and Islamophobia. To Todd, they represented \u201ca sudden glimpse of totalitarianism\u201d. These \u201csham\u201d demonstrations, he claimed, were made up of a one-sided elite who wanted to spit on Islam, the religion of a weak minority in France. The working class and the children of immigrants had been notably absent, he said. The most enthusiastic demonstrations, he decided, had occurred in the country\u2019s most historically Catholic and reactionary regions, an affirmation of the middle class\u2019s moral superiority and domination, and their Islamophobic quest for a scapegoat. Todd\u2019s massively contested and controversial book, Who is Charlie? \u2013 which is published in English next week \u2013 instantly became a bestseller and caused one of the biggest intellectual slanging matches of recent years, even by bruising French standards. It was slated as \u201ca polemical ego trip\u201d; Todd was accused on the front page of the daily Lib\u00e9ration of \u201cblasphemy against 11 January\u201d. The paper\u2019s editor, Laurent Joffrin, told the Guardian that Todd\u2019s book was not just \u201cabsurd, insulting and false\u201d but \u201cgratuitous controversy and harmful\u201d. Todd made every major TV show and magazine cover and was dubbed \u201cthe disturbing intellectual\u201d. The Socialist prime minister, Manuel Valls, took the unprecedented step of writing a furious critique of the book in Le Monde accusing Todd of \u201cself-flagellation\u201d. Todd in turn likened Valls\u2019s blind optimism about France to that of Marshal P\u00e9tain, the leader of France\u2019s collaborationist Vichy regime in the 1940s. Who is Charlie? is now being published across the world with a preface warning that in all western societies \u201ca Charlie lies slumbering\u201d \u2013 a horrific event that cleaves society apart and sees the highly educated and well-off stick their heads in the sand.     Todd says the rally was a display of middle class dominance and Islamophobia. Photograph: Stephane Mahe    Sitting in his flat looking out over the Paris rooftops, wearing frayed jeans and espadrilles, Todd admits he\u2019s now France\u2019s public enemy number one. But he is unrepentant. He says he feels liberated for speaking out. \u201cIt\u2019s extraordinary,\u201d he says. \u201cYou put out a book that says France had an attack of hysteria on 11 January, and that book immediately sparks an attack of hysteria. It\u2019s a marvellous proof of my thesis. When you produce a reaction like that, it\u2019s because you\u2019ve touched a nerve.\u201d He pauses. \u201cIt is a bit unpleasant to be insulted every 10 minutes, but I think it\u2019s an astonishing proof of all that\u2019s true in the book.\u201d The furious row surrounding Todd\u2019s book comes amid a wider soul-searching in France. After a fresh round of terror attacks in France \u2013 including a beheading and attempt to blow up a chemical plant near Lyon, and last week\u2019s shooting on a high-speed train from Amsterdam to Paris \u2013 the question of what remains of that spirit of 11 January haunts the country. Has France moved on? Or is it still in thrall to the unsettling fears that Charlie Hebdo\u2019s attackers, the Kouachi brothers, ignited, despite the repeated breastbeating of politicians from the far-left to the far-right of the strength of the republican, secular ideal?     French prime minister Manuel Valls wrote a critique of Todd\u2019s book for Le Monde. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    As France came to terms with its national trauma, it was easier for politicians to focus on 11 January as one day of unity than the three fraught days between 7 and 9 January when two brothers who were once wards of the republic in children\u2019s homes massacred some of the country\u2019s best-known cartoonists as well as a Muslim policeman before finally being shot dead by police after a hostage-taking at a printer\u2019s outside Paris. Their target, Charlie Hebdo, had long been under police protection after death threats over its caricatures of the prophet Muhammad. The febrile atmosphere worsened when the brothers\u2019 accomplice, Amedy Coulibaly, also French born and bred, touched the rawest of nerves by killing four people in a siege of a Paris kosher grocery store days after shooting dead a policewoman while reportedly on his way to attack a Jewish school. The slogan \u201cJe Suis Charlie\u201d (I am Charlie) became a worldwide rallying cry but proved complex, and to some extent, excluding. It didn\u2019t fit with those who utterly condemned the shooting, but didn\u2019t agree with the magazine\u2019s caricatures of Muhammad. Scores of disrupted minute\u2019s silences in schools, particularly in the restive banlieues, or suburbs, appeared to highlight the uneasy relationship between teenagers, often from immigrant minorities, and their teachers. Amid this, the French government cracked down on speech \u201cdeemed to glorify terrorism\u201d. A series of cases rushed through the courts resulted in heavy prison sentences, some handed down to people who were drunk. One man with slight learning difficulties was sentenced to six months in prison for drunkenly shouting at police officers in the street: \u201cThey killed Charlie, I laughed.\u201d Rights groups protested. The debate intensified after it emerged that an eight-year-old boy was questioned by police for saying at school \u201cI am with the terrorists,\u201d later admitting he didn\u2019t know who the terrorists were or even what terrorism meant.    It was fascinating to see people demonstrating for the right to freedom of expression and then trying to shut others up  Emmanuel Todd     Valls warned of \u201cterritorial, social and ethnic apartheid\u201d in France and launched a plan for greater mixing in social housing and measures against discrimination. This hint that homegrown terror may have a homegrown cause sparked a chorus of disapproval from politicians. Then came the government\u2019s new increased surveillance laws, which caused a storm over civil liberties. All the while, people were looking for answers. Non-fiction book sales rose markedly as readers searched for explanations of the terrorist attacks. Voltaire\u2019s Treatise on Tolerance, first published in 1763 \u2013 the source of the ideas that were paraphrased as \u201cI disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it\u201d \u2013 was reissued, and sold more than 90,000 copies in four months. Scores of books were published about the \u201cSpirit of 11 January\u201d, debating everything from the right to blasphemy, introduced by the French revolution in 1789, to the place of Islam in France. It was against that background that Todd launched his Exocet. He hadn\u2019t gone on the 11 January rallies himself, although he knew the economist Bernard Maris, who was killed in the Charlie Hebdo attack. But he said that when he opened the newspaper the next day and saw the maps of where rallies had taken place, he saw a pattern that infuriated him. \u201cHere was clear fraud. The street demonstrations were the self-glorification of the French middle class. That made me explode.\u201d He saw it as France refusing to look at the economic stagnation and deep inequality that might have led to the horror of the attacks.     Another view of the solidarity march on 11 January. Photograph: Reuters    He wasn\u2019t previously a \u201cFrench-basher\u201d but now calls himself \u201ca Frenchman exasperated by his own society\u201d. He wrote the book in 30 days, getting up at 3am, but is at pains to say it was based on 40 years\u2019 previous research. Todd\u2019s central argument is that there are fundamentally two Frances. There is a \u201ccentral\u201d France, including Paris and Marseille and the Mediterranean, where there is equality on the family level and a deep-rooted attachment to secular values of the French revolution and the republic. Then there is a France of the periphery, for example, the west or cities such as Lyon, which has stayed true to the old Catholic bedrock, where people may no longer be practising Catholics, but they\u2019re still infused with all the social conservatism of that Catholicism, its hierarchies and inequality. He calls this \u201czombie Catholicism\u201d. Infuriating his critics, Todd maintains that the post-attack rallies represented zombie Catholicism on the march. Despite the row, he stands by the idea. \u201cFrance is always double,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s why you never know if it will collapse or get back on its feet.\u201d Todd, who comes from a cosmopolitan family of writers and is distantly related to the anthropologist Claude L\u00e9vi-Strauss, came to fame for predicting the fall of the Soviet Union in 1976 and more recently for suggesting the US is an empire in decline. He has long argued that family structures explain why people adhere to certain ideologies, and has pleaded for France to leave the euro. He claims in Who is Charlie? that France is no longer a place of liberty, equality, fraternity, but instead is a kind of pseudo republic favouring only the middle class while the working class and children of immigrants have been excluded. He feels France has much that is \u201cmarvellous\u201d, including its welfare and social security safety net. \u201cBut it has stayed marvellous only for the top half of society.\u201d However, Todd\u2019s argument that you can tell a lot about the \u201cunconscious\u201d drive of the people on the street rallies just from the political and religious traditions of where they come from has been widely challenged. He says he\u2019s not suggesting everyone on the march was a rampant middle-class Islamophobe, but that the overall effect of the mass rally was just that. \u201cAfter the rallies, we saw Islamophobic behaviour everywhere; it loosened people\u2019s tongues.\u201d Todd says he was most hurt by attacks on his methods and stands by what he says is \u201cserious statistical analysis\u201d. One of his key concerns is \u201cthe wave of Islamophobia\u201d in France, which he says is echoed across the west.     The perpetrators of the attacks in Paris, Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi, Sa\u00efd Kouachi and Amedy Coulibaly were born and bred in France. Photograph: AFP    Dismissing Charlie Hebdo as a \u201cbad magazine\u201d, he said France\u2019s new obsession with the right to blaspheme is a pointless over-reaction. To him, blasphemy is now hailed not just as a right but a kind of duty. He feels that freedom of expression is clearly not under threat in France, so it\u2019s wrong to focus mainly on that in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo attacks. He said he felt very uncomfortable watching the French Muslim comedy star Jamel Debbouze on TV talking about his mixed marriage and joys of living together, being pushed to say he agreed with caricatures of the prophet, as if that was the only true measure of how French he was. \u201cYes, of course, there\u2019s a right to blaspheme,\u201d Todd says. \u201cBut one must also have the right to say that blasphemy is not a priority and that it\u2019s idiotic. With my book, I was demanding the right to counter-blaspheme: to say that the caricatures of Muhammad were obscene, rubbish, totally historically out of sync and the expression of rampant Islamophobia. And, for saying that, I was accused of complicity with the terrorists.\u201d He felt vindicated by the reaction. \u201cIt was fascinating to see people demonstrating for the right to freedom of expression and then trying to shut others up.\u201d    With my book, I was demanding the right to counter-blaspheme: to say that the caricatures of Muhammad were obscene  Emmanuel Todd     The maternal side of Todd\u2019s family is Jewish. \u201cThis is probably the first time in my life that I\u2019ve written a book as a Jew,\u201d he said. When a young gunman Mohamed Merah opened fire outside a Jewish school in Toulouse in 2012, killing four, Todd put the antisemitic element to the back of his mind; likewise when a French gunman killed four at the Jewish museum in Brussels last year. But with the attack on the kosher grocery store, which he feels has been overshadowed by the Charlie Hebdo killings, he said antisemitism was clearly at crisis point. His theory is that the rise in Islamophobia is in turn stoking antisemitism in run-down suburbs, and that antisemitism is growing in the middle class. He feels that \u201cFrance is a sick society\u201d.

He says, as a historian, it\u2019s not his place to find answers for the future, but feels that they rest on accommodating Islam into French life. He warns that, as politicians focus on their ageing electorate, \u201cthere\u2019s a phenomenon of reducing to silence a large part of the young population, something you\u2019ve become conscious of in the UK long before we have\u201d.

I won\u2019t say that David Cameron\u2019s politics, which are destroying the UK, are a good way to adapt. But in the UK, there\u2019s an idea that at least things need to adapt. In France, we have a ridiculous political system in which everyone talks about reform but does nothing. And that inaction produces a phenomenon of exclusion, destroying the lower half of French society.\u201d He sighs. \u201cThere\u2019s a part of French society that\u2019s rotten, and nothing is being done.\u201d Who is Charlie? is published by Polity Press on 4 September", "sentences": ["After a fresh round of terror attacks in France \u2013 including a beheading and attempt to blow up a chemical plant near Lyon, and last week\u2019s shooting on a high-speed train from Amsterdam to Paris \u2013 the question of what remains of that spirit of 11 January haunts the country."], "title": "Emmanuel Todd: the French thinker who won't toe the Charlie Hebdo line", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2015/aug/28/emmanuel-todd-the-french-thinker-who-wont-toe-the-charlie-hebdo-line", "tags": ["Charlie Hebdo"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-08-29T18:39:19Z", "article": "A missing mother and her four children are feared to be travelling from Britain to Syria after they disappeared from their London home last week, Scotland Yard has said. Police are trying to trace Zahera Tariq, 33, and her sons Muhammad, 12, Amaar, 11, Aadid, four, and daughter Safiyyah, nine. They were last seen at their house in Walthamstow, east London, on Tuesday, and were believed to have flown from London City airport to Amsterdam the same day. Police believe all five may be on their way to Syria. Tariq\u2019s husband and the father of her children is thought to be still in the UK, two neighbours said yesterday. One said she spotted him at the house early on Wednesday morning as she was heading to work. \u201cHe was fine, I think maybe he was tired because it was early,\u201d said 21-year-old Janick Ndala. Her family\u2019s terrace house shares a wall with the Tariq family home, and she has known them for over a decade. \u201cIt\u2019s surreal,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just seemed like a normal, happy family.\u201d A relative contacted police on Wednesday to report that the family of five were missing and fears that they could be on their way to the conflict zone, police added. Detectives later found the family had been captured on CCTV at London City airport prior to their flight to the Netherlands. The children are carrying rucksacks and clustered round their mother, who is pushing a trolley loaded with four suitcases.     Zahera Tariq and children at London City airport. Photograph: London Metropolitan Police/EPA    The route to Raqqa, the capital of Islamic State, is through Turkey, but there has been increased scrutiny of passengers heading to Istanbul, prompting some westerners seeking to join the extremist group to take a less direct route to the border. Tariq may therefore have been using the Netherlands as a staging post to deflect potential concerns. Around 700 Britons are estimated to have set out for Isis-controlled parts of Syria and at least 100 are thought to be women and girls, some travelling with friends and others with children. They include three sisters from Bradford, who set off with their nine children in June, and three students from Bethnal Green. In addition, it was reported in July that several members of the same family from Luton, including three children, were believed to have travelled to Syria after a holiday in Bangladesh. Commander Richard Walton, from the Metropolitan police counter-terrorism command, said relatives and officials were worried about the latest group. \u201cWe\u2019re concerned about Zahera and her four children, and we\u2019re doing all we can to work with our partners and colleagues both here and abroad to locate them and make sure they are safe and well,\u201d he said. \u201cWhilst we do have some concerns that Zahera may be thinking of travelling to Syria, there is no information to suggest that she\u2019s already travelled there. Her family are extremely worried about her and her three sons and daughter, and we urge anybody with information to contact us as soon as possible.\u201d   Related: 'There is no silver bullet': Isis, al-Qaida and the myths of terrorism    Police are appealing for any information on the whereabouts of Tariq and her children. She is described as 5ft 3in and of medium build with long, black hair. Neighbours said Zahera was quiet and conservative, always wearing a niqab that covered her face when she went out, though the family were friendly. Her husband would be away for long hours, at one point working in a laundry, while their children used to run in and out of homes on the quiet suburban cul-de-sac where they lived and join games of football in the street, although they did not attend the local school. \u201cThey would say \u2018hi\u2019 in the morning but didn\u2019t interact much,\u201d said neighbour Luc Nonga, a 25-year-old fine art student whose home shares a wall with the Tariq family. He had not seen the father for around three weeks, he added. Most people on the street were baffled to find that their quiet neighbour may have been nursing such extreme plans for herself and her children. \u201cI am quite shocked; they just seemed like normal people, never any trouble.

There are rows of shirts with his name and number on the back, framed pictures, pennants and footballing memorabilia of every description, all from his early days in Argentina and displayed in what looks like a huge trophy cabinet. \u201cThis picture was in my parents\u2019 home,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. \u201cIt\u2019s a window, and the window was on the street because it\u2019s a shop, which my father had for the school, selling books and things. There are a lot of shirts, my first for Argentina as an Under-20 \u2026 It\u2019s impossible to see them all. \u201cAt that time the people in my town came to the door and said: \u2018Hey, can I see the museum?\u2019 After a month my father said: \u2018No, no, it\u2019s closed. It\u2019s not possible.\u2019 The people would knock on the door but there were too many in the house.\u201d The Fern\u00e1ndez family have moved from the small town of Tres Algarrobos, which is about 280 miles west of Buenos Aires, but it is tempting to wonder what the queue would be like if the \u201cmuseum\u201d was still open. After all, Fern\u00e1ndez has gone on to win silverware with Napoli, make four appearances at the World Cup in Brazil, and since joining Swansea City 12 months ago has been sending back a steady supply of shirts bearing names such as Di Mar\u00eda, Ag\u00fcero and Rojo (he has also kept the one he wore on his debut, against Rotherham, in the League Cup).   Related: Lionel Messi hat-trick leads Argentina to 4-3 win over Brazil    There is a World Cup final shirt and runners-up medal to add to the collection \u2013 Fern\u00e1ndez was on the bench for the 1-0 defeat to Germany \u2013 and a cherished photograph with Lionel Messi in the dressing room in New Jersey after Argentina beat Brazil in a classic in 2012. \u201cCrazy,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says, smiling at the memory of the match and his second-half header. \u201cMessi scored a hat-trick and we won 4-3. So I put on Twitter our two scorers.\u201d It is one of several football stories that Fern\u00e1ndez could dine out on for years to come in Argentina but the 26-year-old seems just as likely to regale others with tales about travelling. The son of a geography teacher, he views his football career as a wonderful opportunity to embrace other cultures and visit the countries and cities that his mother brings alive in class in Argentina. A little while back he was in Edinburgh, on board the Royal Yacht Britannia, making sure no time goes to waste. \u201cTravelling the world, I think, is amazing,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. \u201cWhen we have two days off I try to go to somewhere like Amsterdam, London, Edinburgh or Dublin, because maybe I\u2019ll never come back.\u201d Swansea hope he will stay as long as possible. A ball-playing centre-half with a scar or two to prove that he is up for the physical scrap as well, Fern\u00e1ndez has slotted seamlessly into the Swansea defence following his arrival from Napoli and looks a class act. Forget the mistake that led to Sunderland equalising in the 1-1 draw at the Stadium of Light last weekend \u2013 an incident so rare it is a collector\u2019s item of a different kind \u2013 Fern\u00e1ndez has made a big impression in a short time at the Liberty Stadium and it says much about his determination to adapt that his English is good enough to conduct an hour-long interview without a translator. \u201cLast year my English, one point. Now, maybe five,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cI wanted to learn. I have lessons twice a week with my teacher in my house. Obviously, it\u2019s important now for my time playing for Swansea, but it\u2019s very important for life also. English is the first language in the world and I want to speak it very well. But it\u2019s very important for my job on the pitch, because in my position I\u2019m always speaking: \u2018Ashley [Williams], back in, cover, mark\u2019. That communication is important because as a defender you view the whole situation.\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez has always had a clear picture in his mind. He grew up idolising Roberto Ayala \u2013 \u201cI watched a lot of videos of him; I think he was the complete defender\u201d \u2013 and dreamed of playing for Argentina. His big break came when his father called Estudiantes de La Plata to ask if his 14-year-old son could have a trial. Estudiantes saw enough in a week to know that the kid nicknamed \u201cEl Flaco\u201d (Skinny) was worth signing. Fern\u00e1ndez uses the word \u201cspecial\u201d to describe the eight years he spent at Estudiantes and it is easy to see why. He was a promising youngster training with the first-team when Diego Simeone led the team to the Apertura (the Argentinian league title) in 2006 and that period also coincided with Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n\u2019s fairytale return to the club where he had started his career. Ver\u00f3n, who is now the president at Estudiantes, had a big influence on Fern\u00e1ndez and the two remain close. Emotionally attached to Estudiantes through his father\u2019s hugely successful time there as a player, Ver\u00f3n came back to the club after disappointing spells with Manchester United and Chelsea and inspired a turnaround on the pitch at the same time as investing his own money in the facilities and the academy. \u201cHe changed the club,\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez says. \u201cVer\u00f3n, for the club, is a hero, and Estudiantes for him and his father is historic. I competed in the Copa Sudamericana final in 2008, I lost, but the next year I won the Copa Libertadores, which is the best tournament in South America, and the next year I won another tournament [the league title]. For me, it was the best experience in Argentina because Ver\u00f3n played a long time in Europe and he passed on a lot of things to the young players. I remember he said to me: \u2018Fede, you\u2019ll play in the national team in the future\u2019.\u201d Ver\u00f3n called it right. Fern\u00e1ndez made his international debut in April 2011 and a few months later joined Napoli, where he was following in the footsteps of Ayala and a certain other Argentinian. \u201cThe supporters have not forgotten Maradona \u2013 incredible,\u201d says Fern\u00e1ndez, who briefly met him during his time in Italy. Fern\u00e1ndez\u2019s best season at Napoli was his last, in 2013-14, when Rafael Ben\u00edtez led the club to third place in Serie A and won the Coppa Italia. During that campaign Napoli played Swansea in the Europa League and Fern\u00e1ndez was hugely impressed with the Welsh club. \u201cI was surprised by the style, because they passed all the time, controlled the game with the ball, and I liked it,\u201d he says. \u201cIn the Premier League, teams can play long ball or physical, but I like Swansea\u2019s style because it\u2019s the same as in Argentina: play the ball at the back and in the middle \u2013 it\u2019s good football.\u201d Six months later Fern\u00e1ndez was wearing a Swansea shirt after a \u00a37m transfer that underlined how much the club wants to push on. \u201cTheir history in the Premier League is short but the ambition for the club in the future is big,\u201d he says. \u201cThe players that come are different: me from Napoli, or Jonjo [Shelvey] and Lukasz [Fabianski] from big teams \u2013 that\u2019s very important for the club. \u201cAt the moment we\u2019re in a good position in the Premier League, together we want to do better than last season [eighth place]. It\u2019s difficult, I know, with the big teams in the Premier League, but last season maybe two or three games we lost one or two points and the finish could have been different. We focus on doing that and maybe in the Cups more focus to get to the final.\u201d   Related: Swansea City 2-1 Manchester United | Premier League match report    Before joining Swansea, Fern\u00e1ndez started in Argentina\u2019s first four games at the World Cup and he remains in touch with the squad via a group that was set up on WhatsApp at the time. Sergio Romero, Argentina\u2019s goalkeeper in Brazil, will line up against him today, when Swansea host Manchester United, and Fern\u00e1ndez knows Rojo well from their time at Estudiantes. Swansea did the double over United last season in Garry Monk\u2019s first full campaign in charge and Fern\u00e1ndez is hugely complimentary about the manager. \u201cGarry is doing a very good job at Swansea. He prepares in the week for the game, the [information] is complete. We have iPads [with tactical insights] \u2013 the players have a lot of help. The mentality \u2013 he works 24 hours at the club \u2013 the same as Simeone. From my experience with different clubs and different coaches, I think in the future he\u2019ll be a top coach at a big club.\u201d Fern\u00e1ndez may also be destined for greater things, although he sounds more than happy at Swansea. He likes the fact that \u201cthe people respect you\u201d when he pops out to the supermarket or goes to dinner \u2013 life was not so reserved in Naples \u2013 and enjoys living close to the sea. In fact, there is only one complaint from a man who was brought up on red meat and barbecues. \u201cHere I can\u2019t get a good steak,\u201d he concludes, laughing.", "sentences": ["\u201cWhen we have two days off I try to go to somewhere like Amsterdam, London, Edinburgh or Dublin, because maybe I\u2019ll never come back.\u201d Swansea hope he will stay as long as possible."], "title": "Federico Fern\u00e1ndez on Lionel Messi and his big ambitions for Swansea", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/29/federico-fernandez-swansea-city-premier-league-lionel-messi-argentina-world-cup", "tags": ["Swansea City", "Premier League", "Napoli", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-08-30T12:00:06Z", "article": "It\u2019s a strange sight: 44 arms and legs, encased in shimmering brick-red fabric, standing on the Millennium bridge. It looks like a sea creature escaped from the Thames, or perhaps an attempt on a particularly esoteric Guinness world record. It is, of course, neither of those things: it is a coat, and it is art. The Red Coat, by pop artist Nicola L, has travelled from its home in New York and been donned by 11 volunteers, part of a performance organised by Tate previewing its big autumn show. I\u2019ve been invited to join it as it marauds across town. Born in French Morocco, Nicola trained as a painter in Paris in the early 1960s before deciding to junk her brushes and destroy her canvases. She began to experiment with works she called P\u00e9n\u00e9trables, sculptures made from fabric, which the viewer was invited to \u201cwear\u201d by poking arms or a torso into their folds. In 1967, she collaborated with the prog-rock group Soft Machine. Two years later, invited to create a piece for a gig at the Isle of Wight festival by Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso, the Red Coat was born. \u201cThe idea was to make a piece of art where everyone shares the same skin,\u201d says Nicola, now in her late 70s, and disarmingly chic in black pedal-pushers and moon-sized shades. \u201cWe are born in our own bodies, but if you make a piece of clothing that is worn by 11 people, they have to change everything \u2013 the way they move, the way they walk.\u201d    In the Alps, 11 skiers took it for a spin down the slopes; in Barcelona, a Francoist policeman put its wearers in jail    Nicola moved to an apartment in the Chelsea hotel, where she still lives. Meanwhile, the coat (\u201cto me he is always a he\u201d, she confides, \u201cI am not sure why this is\u201d) has had a globetrotting life. In Ibiza, it went swimming in the sea; in the Alps, 11 professional skiers took it for a spin down the slopes (\u201cthis was fabulous,\u201d cackles Nicola). In Barcelona in 1969, it landed both artist and wearers in jail when a policeman decided it didn\u2019t fit Franco\u2019s regime.  It has even spawned offspring: a Black Coat came in 1995, dedicated to the memory of women Nicola called \u201cfemme fatales\u201d, including Joan of Arc and Frida Kahlo, followed by a Blue Cape, symbolising peace and cooperation, in 2001. But the red version, now frayed and patched, is emphatically the original, she says, even if insurance costs mean that she is no longer permitted to travel with it in a suitcase.     Pop art for a rainy day ... Nicola L\u2019s Red Coat in Amsterdam, 1970 Photograph: Tate    While we wait for a boat to take us upriver to Tate Modern, there is a tense debate over how many tickets the coat requires \u2013 one? group discount? \u2013 until a hand produces an Oystercard from somewhere deep inside its folds. How does it feel to be part of this historic performance, I ask. \u201cHot,\u201d she replies. As we jounce up the Thames, curator Flavia Frigeri explains that, despite its playful, puckish character, the Red Coat has a serious purpose. Influenced by second-wave feminism and the civil rights movement, it reminds us our similarities as a species far outweigh our differences \u2013 issues every bit as pertinent today, with transgender and gay rights more visible than ever. There is a similar political impetus behind the Tate\u2019s The World Goes Pop exhibition itself, which aims to reclaim pop art from its reputation for being obsessed by the brittle surfaces of consumer society. In place of Warhol Brillo boxes, there will be upholstery sculptures of digestive organs by the Italian-Brazilian artist Anna Maria Maiolino and paintings by the wonderful Ushio Shinohara, who has infused traditional Japanese woodblock techniques with the colour and verve of 1950s American magazines.      Artist Nicola L, right, escorts her Red Coat to Tate Modern. Photograph: Graeme Robertson    Many of the artists come from far outside the Anglo-American canon; almost half are women. The intention is to expand, perhaps explode, our sense of what pop art is. The Red Coat, this time hanging obediently in a gallery, will take a starring role. \u201cThere was so much pop art happening across the world during the 1950s and 60s,\u201d says Frigeri. \u201cSo much we don\u2019t necessarily recognise, particularly by female artists who were early feminists. It\u2019s really important to tell that story, particularly as so much pop art is about men looking at women.\u201d Nicola is simply pleased that the coat has made it to London: its first time in the city, even if health-and-safety concerns nixed her original plan, which was that all 11 volunteers would wear roller skates.  Tate Modern has floated into view; on the riverbank there is spirited talk of clambering on a red London bus, perhaps taking the coat to Buckingham Palace, but I\u2019m done. The sky has turned an ominous battleship-grey and rain looks a distinct possibility.

In August, May visited Calais to inspect new security measures aimed at preventing migrants from reaching England via the Channel tunnel. Up to 5,000 displaced people are estimated to be in the French port, with at least nine known to have died trying to make the journey into Britain since June. Unprecedented numbers of migrants are reaching EU borders, surpassing 100,000 in July alone and reaching more than 340,000 this year so far. Italy and Greece are struggling to cope, while Macedonia has declared a state of emergency. The Italian prime minister, Matteo Renzi, said on Sunday he believed the crisis would push the EU to adopt uniform rules for refugees in place of the current patchwork of laws and approaches. \u201cIt will take months, but we will have a single European policy on asylum, not as many policies as there are countries,\u201d he told the Corriere della Sera.  The French, British and German statement specifically called for reception centres to be set up urgently in Italy and Greece to register new arrivals, and for a common EU list of \u201csafe countries of origin\u201d to be established, which would theoretically allow asylum applications to be fast-tracked for specific nationalities.     Syrians travel on a train taking them from Macedonia to the Serbian border on 30 August 2015.  Photograph: Aris Messinis/AFP/Getty Images    Germany, which expects to receive 800,000 asylum seekers this year, has been pushing for such a list, arguing that it would free up resources to help those fleeing war and persecution. May said in an editorial in the Sunday Times that the migrant crisis had been exacerbated by a broken European migration system, which she said demonstrated the need for a renegotiation of the terms of Britain\u2019s EU membership. She said countries across Europe were realising that the Schengen agreement \u2013 which created Europe\u2019s borderless area \u2013 had exacerbated the crisis, which would be a \u201cwake-up call\u201d to European leaders that they needed to consider \u201cthe consequences of uncontrolled migration\u201d.   Related: The Balkans are now the centre of Europe\u2019s people smuggling web    \u201cThe events of this summer have shown that the most tragic consequences of a broken European migration system have been borne by those at risk of exploitation,\u201d May wrote. \u201cAnd the greatest beneficiaries have been the callous gangs who sell false dreams and trade on the free borders within the EU.\u201d May said suggesting that migration could not be controlled within the EU \u2013 which gives freedom of movement to member state nationals \u2013 was defeatist and wrong and flew in the face of the evidence. \u201cReducing net EU migration need not mean undermining the principle of free movement. When it was first enshrined, free movement meant the freedom to move to a job, not the freedom to cross borders to look for work or claim benefits.\u201d The shadow home secretary, Yvette Cooper, said May was treating immigration and asylum as the same issue. \u201cWe have long called on her to do more to help Syrian refugees, but the government won\u2019t because they are included in the net migration target,\u201d she said. \u201cIncreasing the rhetoric doesn\u2019t help anyone, what we need is sensible and practical policies instead.\u201d She accused May of being dishonest by pretending she still had a migration target of tens of thousands. \u201cThe reality is that net migration is over three times the target she set and has risen since she took office \u2013 so all she is doing is undermining trust in the whole system,\u201d Cooper said.           Immigration minister James Brokenshire says EU migrants, students and reliance on skills from abroad are knocking the UK off its targets.    Figures from the Office for National Statistics show migration to Britain has hit a record high, reaching 330,000 in the year to March. The rise comes despite a pledge made by David Cameron in 2011 to bring down immigration to the tens of thousands. May argued that the biggest single factor preventing the government from meeting its immigration target was net migration from the EU. \u201cWhile net migration from outside the EU is 10% lower than it was in 2010, net migration from within the EU has more than doubled,\u201d May said. \u201cThat is why this government\u2019s renegotiation of Britain\u2019s relationship with the EU is so important.\u201d May argued that only European migrants with a job lined up should be allowed into the UK. \u201cNet migration at that volume is simply unsustainable,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt puts pressure on infrastructure, such as housing and transport, and public services, such as schools and hospitals.\u201d   Related: Only migrants with jobs should be let in to UK, says Theresa May    Four in 10 of the migrants who came to the UK last year came with no job waiting for them, said May, and this \u201csearch for a better life\u201d has had huge economic costs for the countries they\u2019ve left behind. \u201cA third of Portugal\u2019s qualified nurses have migrated; 20% of the Czech Republic\u2019s medical graduates leave as soon as they qualify; nearly 500 doctors are leaving Bulgaria every year.\u201d Cameron will continue his attempt to renegotiate the terms of the UK\u2019s membership of the EU on Friday, visiting Lisbon for talks with the Portuguese prime minister, Pedro Passos Coelho, before traveling to Madrid where he will meet the Spanish prime minister, Mariano Rajoy.

In Danny Williams\u2019 world, the two are in leagues of their own. \u201cThey are both different in their own tastes,\u201d says Reading\u2019s Germany-raised, US-repping midfielder. Williams moved from Baden-W\u00fcrttemburg to England two years ago, and there\u2019s not much he doesn\u2019t love about his new home. Not even the local cuisine has put him off the place. (The club nutritionist should look away now.) \u201cI\u2019ve learnt a lot about the English culture. About fish \u2019n\u2019 chips and all that stuff. Next to my place, I have a good restaurant that serves fish \u2019n\u2019 chips, so when my parents are coming over to visit me, I am always having fish \u2019n\u2019 chips. It\u2019s very good.\u201d The football is a different story. It\u2019s been an up-and-down couple of seasons in the Championship for Williams and his Royals. In 2013-14, they just missed out on promotion. Then last season, they battled to avoid the drop. \u201cIt was a disappointing season,\u201d the heavily tattooed, punkishly haired 26-year-old says in his gentle timbre. \u201cThe manager, he made it clear already he don\u2019t want to have a season like that. He wants to push for promotion. We just have to get our confidence back.   Related: Tim Howard makes USA return for Brazil and Peru friendlies    \u201cIt\u2019s a new season, new start. So we all start from zero again, and it\u2019s about us, only about us. We have to find a rhythm, we have to find a way of winning because especially at home, we didn\u2019t win too many games. I think that\u2019s the biggest change that we have to try fix.\u201d They are a work in progress. Five rounds in, and Reading have only just notched up their first win, the weekend\u2019s 3-1 victory at Brentford. They are yet to score at home, but they are undefeated in four matches. Their 2-1 opening week loss at Birmingham City was a big turnaround on the 6-1 hammering they were given there last year. Williams has been looking dangerous, and has scored once. It\u2019s something he only managed to do once last season, in part due to a knee injury. The injury has disrupted a good deal of his time in England. It sidelined him for the crucial final weeks of the 2013-14 campaign, kept him from going to the World Cup in Brazil and meant a late start to last season.  \u201cI fought my way back to the team [in early 2014] and all of a sudden I got this big knee injury, six weeks or five weeks before the World Cup. And I was [playing well] again and all of a sudden the doctor says I have to make other plans for the summer. That was a tough moment.\u201d That troublesome knee also saw him rested for this summer\u2019s failed Gold Cup campaign before getting called up for this month\u2019s friendlies against Peru and Brazil. With hindsight, it\u2019s a decision US coach J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann may well regret, especially given Williams\u2019 performances in end-of-season friendlies against Germany and Holland. In that match in Amsterdam, he scored his first international goal, and you only had to see his celebration to know how much it meant to him. He raced up the field thumping his heart, before jumping into Klinsmann\u2019s arms on the sideline. \u201cIt\u2019s the best moment when you score for your country, you know. You can make so many people happy. Because I think we represent one of the best countries in the world. You saw it in my celebration, it was a moment I\u2019ll never forget.\u201d He says it was an especially significant moment for his dad, a New Yorker who grew up in North Carolina. \u201cHe was proud, because he\u2019s American, and his whole family is from the States, and they all watched it.\u201d Williams\u2019 parents met in a way that is almost becoming cliched in the US men\u2019s national team: it happened while his soldier dad was on a tour of duty in West Germany at the end of the Cold War. At least a half dozen of his national team-mates have a similar story to tell. Months before the Berlin Wall was torn down, Danny was born in Karlsruhe, just outside the Black Forest. He graduated from the youth team to the Bundesliga side at Freiburg, was quickly signed up nearby Hoffenheim, and then Reading came calling. Until that move to the UK in 2013, Williams had never lived outside his home state. In the Championship, Reading aren\u2019t expected to challenge Hull City, Middlesbrough, Ipswich Town and the like for the title. But Williams, like his manager, is expecting a big improvement on last season, for both himself and the team. \u201cEveryone can step their game up [and] I want to be more of a threat in front of goal \u2026 I always say when you work hard, someone up there he will reward you for that, see it, and as long as you work hard you will always come back stronger.\u201d", "sentences": ["In that match in Amsterdam, he scored his first international goal, and you only had to see his celebration to know how much it meant to him."], "title": "Interview: Danny Williams happy to be in three worlds as USMNT career resumes", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/aug/31/interview-danny-williams-happy-to-be-in-three-worlds-as-usmnt-career-resumes", "tags": ["USA", "Reading", "US sports", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-08-31T23:01:15Z", "article": "There has been a slight change in Glen Koorey\u2019s daily 20-minute bicycle ride to work over the last four years. In the weeks following Christchurch\u2019s devastating earthquake in 2011, in which 185 people were killed and large portions of the CBD were levelled, there was no way to drive through the city. Buildings lay crumbled. Roads were cracked and split. Basic infrastructure was torn apart.  For months stretching into years, it remained nearly impossible to navigate the city without having to divert into myriad detours before eventually arriving at your destination. Cycling, says Koorey, became a simpler means of transport. \u201cAt work if there was an aftershock and you were told to go home, it was a lot easier to go on a bike than drive.\u201d Slowly, Koorey has watched Christchurch recover \u2013 the roads repaired, the buildings rebuilt and the infrastructure reengineered. But he has also seen a change in attitude for a city that had long neglected its two-wheeled commuters. Koorey is a transport engineer by trade and teaches at the local University of Canterbury. But before all that he was, and always has been, a cyclist. In the aftermath of the earthquake, he became a voice for cycling advocates. He presented to the local council on how the city could build back better \u2013 this time with cycling in mind.     In 1924, the council estimated there were 40,000 cyclists in the city \u2013 half the population at the time       Christchurch back when it was known as \u2018cyclopolis\u2019. Photograph: Christchurch City Libraries    The city had an opportunity for change and asked its citizens what it wanted of the new Christchurch. One of the resounding calls from the public was that it wanted a greener and more people-focused city \u2013 and one of the more obvious ways to achieve this was to invest in cycling infrastructure. \u201cThe key thing is that council asked the question and that often doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d Koorey says. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have to have an earthquake for this to happen.\u201d The model to transform was based on those northern European countries that are famed for their cycling infrastructure \u2013 particularly the Netherlands and Denmark. Koorey was interested in how they did what they did. After all, 40 years ago Amsterdam, the bastion of cycle-friendly cities, was heading down the same path as Christchurch. It had not invested in infrastructure, and the proliferation of low-cost cars and cheap petrol saw its streets bulging with vehicles. But then Amsterdam had its own earthquake of sorts, says Koorey: a terrible record of children being killed by motorists. It took that self-reflection to turn the city around. Now, 32% of Amsterdam traffic is made up of bicycles.     Pop-up bike workshops such as RAD have been built by community-minded citizens. Photograph: Cycling in Christchurch    New Zealand has a way to go. Cycling here accounts for 1.4% of trips, and 3% of all all commutes. In Christchurch this rises to 7% \u2013 making it the country\u2019s unofficial cycling capital. But that number used to be much higher. In fact, Christchurch was once known as \u201cCyclopolis\u201d and as the \u201cCopenhagen of the south\u201d.  You can still find old black-and-white films of commuters clogging the city\u2019s streets. But in these films there are not traffic lights, roundabouts and intersections; instead, there are hundreds of cyclists all merging, all organically going about their day. In 1924, the council estimated there were 40,000 cyclists in the city \u2013 half the population at the time. Koorey believes that, one day, Christchurch can become more than \u201cjust\u201d the Copenhagen of the south. He thinks it can become one of the best cycling cities in the world. \u201cI\u2019ve had the chance to see a lot of good places for cycling,\u201d he says, \u201cbut really they are not too far ahead of what Christchurch is now doing\u201d (that is, investment and thinking smarter about how to promote cycling). Almost NZ$160m (\u00a367m) has been promised from government to build 13 new cycleways planned for the city.    The key thing is that council asked the question \u2026 You shouldn\u2019t have to have an earthquake for this to happen  Glen Koorey        A map of Christchurch\u2019s proposed new cycleways    Creating good cycling infrastructure starts with doing the basics right, such as having well-designed intersections and creating \u201cquiet streets\u201d, where few cars are allowed and only at 30kmh. Along with installing separated cycle lanes, there are means by which to change perceptions of how city transport should function. According to Koorey, when you include the associated health benefits, there is an eight-to-one benefit-to-cost ratio that comes with cycling investment. \u201cWhat\u2019s good for cycling is good for people generally,\u201d he says. This philosophy has shone through in other projects throughout Christchurch. Groups such as Frocks on Bikes encourage women to take up cycling. Bike events have seen the city closed to cars to show residents what Christchurch could look like in the future. Pop-up central city bike workshops such as RAD have been built by young community-minded citizens wanting to get involved in the rebuild \u2013 a hallmark of the Christchurch recovery. A cycle share project, Spark Bikes, also started in August on a two-year pilot programme that saw 40 bikes installed in five different locations around the central city.   Related: Christchurch: after the earthquake, a city rebuilt in whose image?    \u201cThere is a renaissance of cycling all around the place,\u201d Koorey says. \u201cWe need all that in addition to the infrastructure to make it fun.\u201d One of the biggest barriers to cycling being fully embraced here is the perception of safety. Koorey says the local media has made much of cycling deaths over the past several years \u2013 12 since 2009. He says by virtue of having more cyclists that any other city in the country they have more accidents, but per capita the numbers are actually quite good. Even in the Netherlands, because of the sheer volume of cyclists, they still have 180 deaths a year. Then there are the oft-cited road rage incidents between cyclists and motorists. One 51-year-old cyclist was even fined by the police for impeding traffic on a narrow and winding hill road on the outskirts of the central city. Koorey says out of that confusion good discussions can be had, and will need to be had if the city is to fully embrace a cycling future.  It will take about five years before the city\u2019s major cycleways are off the ground. By then, Koorey anticipates that Christchurch\u2019s cycling commuters will have doubled. Then give it a few more years, he says, and his vision of a world-class cycling city that rivals the Northern Europeans may actually take shape: \u201cI don\u2019t see why not.\u201d Follow Guardian Cities on Twitter and Facebook and join the discussion", "sentences": ["After all, 40 years ago Amsterdam, the bastion of cycle-friendly cities, was heading down the same path as Christchurch.", "But then Amsterdam had its own earthquake of sorts, says Koorey: a terrible record of children being killed by motorists.", "Now, 32% of Amsterdam traffic is made up of bicycles."], "title": "How Christchurch used the earthquake to return the city to its cycling roots", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/sep/01/christchurch-earthquake-cyclopolis-redesign-city-cyclists-pedestrians", "tags": ["Cities", "Christchurch", "New Zealand", "World news", "Asia Pacific", "Pedestrianisation", "Environment"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-09-01T11:43:09Z", "article": "Last week, while attempting to enter the UK for a string of festival performances, including in Reading and Leeds, Tyler, the Creator was turned away at the border and told he had been banned by the home secretary, Theresa May, from entering Britain for the next three to five years. It wasn\u2019t the first time the rapper has had problems entering a country. In 2014, he was banned from visiting New Zealand for posing \u201ca threat to the public order and the public interest\u201d, and earlier this year he was the subject of a campaign by Australian feminist group Collective Shout, who cited lyrics from his mixtape Bastard and his song Tron Cat, from his debut album Goblin, in their efforts to bar him from the country. Collective Shout\u2019s campaign appeared to slow down the approval of his visa to enter Australia, and led to Tyler curtailing a planned tour there in September. \u201cWe would much rather come to Australia when it isn\u2019t surrounded in controversy,\u201d he tweeted. On 26 August, after being turned away at the UK border, Tyler tweeted: \u201cBased on lyrics from 2009, I am not allowed in the UK for 3-5 years (although I was there 8 weeks ago). That is why the shows were cancelled.\u201d Although the Home Office would not comment on the specific case, it issued a statement saying: \u201cComing to the UK is a privilege, and we expect those who come here to respect our shared values.\u201d   Related: Once you start banning rappers like Tyler, the Creator, where do you stop?    However, government papers given to Tyler specifically cite lyrics from VCR, Blow, Sarah, Tron Cat and French, and explain that he was rejected under the terms of Home Office policy on \u201cbehaviours unacceptable in the UK\u201d \u2013 a set of guidelines drawn up in 2005 to try to prevent suspected terrorists entering Britain. \u201cThe home secretary has considered whether, in light of this list, you should be excluded from the UK on the grounds that your presence here would not be conducive to the public good,\u201d the letter to the performer stated. \u201cThe home secretary has reached this decision because you have brought yourself within the scope of the list of unacceptable behaviour by making statements that may foster hatred, which might lead to intercommunity violence in the UK.\u201d The letter goes on to state: \u201cYour albums Bastard, in 2009, and Goblin, in 2011, are based on the premise of your adopting a mentally unstable alter ego who describes violent physical abuse, rape and murder in graphic terms which appears to glamourise this behaviour.\u201d Now, Tyler, the Creator has agreed to speak about being banned from UK entry. What happened at the border? Monday was one of the shittiest days I\u2019ve ever had. I was in a detention room; I felt like a criminal. And then [a Border Force officer] showed me lyrics from songs \u2026 literally, a paper with five lines of lyrics, and four were from Bastard songs and one was from Tron Cat. I never perform those songs. Thirty minutes later, the guy comes in, he gives me a paper, and he says: \u201cOK, they\u2019re not letting you in the country.\u201d The paper said I couldn\u2019t come at all, saying that I support homophobia and acts of terrorism, and [it said] some other stuff. I\u2019m just like, one, none of that is true, and two, I was here seven weeks ago. I rented out a movie theatre for a show. I did something really awesome, and it was no problem. All year, I\u2019ve been renting out movie theatres around the world to show my favourite movies. I just did Amsterdam, and we showed Moonrise Kingdom. In London, we rented out a movie theatre and watched Napoleon Dynamite, then we played a show and had a little pop-up shop. It was really cool. Then me reading [why I couldn\u2019t come to the UK], it was like, yo? What the hell?    Related: Tyler, the Creator, meets his match in Theresa, the Home Secretary, head of the UK branch of Banaholics Anonymous    Now [the UK government] are just followers. Everyone is a follower, just following what other countries are doing. Now I\u2019m getting treated like a terrorist. I\u2019m bummed out because it\u2019s like, dude, I\u2019m not homophobic. I\u2019ve said this since the beginning. The \u201chating women\u201d thing \u2013 it\u2019s so nuts. It\u2019s based on things I made when I was super-young, when no one was listening [to my music]. Like, I wrote Blow when I was reading about different people in American history. One of the people happened to be [the serial killer] Ted Bundy, and I wrote a song from his point of view.  The thing that irks me about it is that the paper saying I am denied entry to the UK clearly states that these songs were written from [the perspective of] an alter ego \u2013 which means they obviously did some research on these songs that they\u2019re detaining me for. So the argument is right there! This song is written from an alter ego \u2013 I\u2019m not like this! You could watch any interview and see my personality, see the guy I am. I wouldn\u2019t hurt a fly.  When the Australia thing happened, I was like, \u201cWow, OK.\u201d Then the UK thing happened, and it\u2019s like: \u2018OK, this is not funny any more \u2013 this is actually wrong, from a moral standpoint. Now [threats against] freedom of art and speech are at hand. And because of this, it\u2019s opening a door for anyone to be banned. There\u2019s a long history of rap music being censored in the US and elsewhere. What about the people who will make music in the next five years? Are they gonna get banned? Why don\u2019t they ban authors? Writers who write these mystery books about people getting raped and sabotaged and murdered and brainwashed \u2013 why don\u2019t they ban them? There are rallies of neo-Nazis in parts of England. And then you\u2019re telling me I can\u2019t come there because of some bullshit song, but you got motherfuckers with swastikas rallying down the street actually promoting hate?  Do you think the UK ban is directly related to the boycott in Australia? They\u2019re following! They\u2019re just followers at this point \u2013 to me, at least. Personally. I don\u2019t know. It all came out of nowhere; I was [in London] in May, dude. Two months later they\u2019re like: \u201cHey, uh, yeah, we reviewed music from a long time ago out of nowhere, [and] you can\u2019t come in.\u201d What?         A question of lyrics? Listen to Smuckers \u2013 audio    Where does the paperwork state that you can\u2019t return for five years? It says: \u201cAlthough there is no statutory right of appeal against the secretary\u2019s decision, the decision is reviewed every three to five years.\u201d On Smuckers, I rap: \u201cThey say I\u2019m nutty, I\u2019m picnic basket, one short of a sandwich of peanut butter \u2026 I got banned from New Zealand, Whitey had called me a terrorist \u2026 and goddammit I couldn\u2019t believe it.\u201d That relates to right now so much. \u201cBan the kid from the country, I never fall, never timber / but you fucked up as a parent, your child\u2019s idol\u2019s a nigga.\u201d  [I wrote that] lyric because I was starting to think that they did not like the fact that their children were idolising a black man. There were Caucasian parents who were not feeling that, so yes, they\u2019re gonna sign a petition to make sure I don\u2019t come and infiltrate their child\u2019s brain.

The Van Gogh Museum houses the largest collection of work by one of the world\u2019s most famous artists, Vincent van Gogh. The collection encompasses 200 paintings, 500 drawings and almost his entire correspondence. The museum also collects paintings and works on paper by Van Gogh\u2019s contemporaries, so we can place him in the wider artistic context of his time and show his sources of inspiration, as well as those whom he inspired. It\u2019s our mission to make the work and life of Van Gogh, and the work of his contemporaries, accessible to as many people around the world as possible, to enrich and inspire them.  What are the biggest challenges you face as a museum director? One of our key challenges is the further diversification of our income stream. Our financial model is somewhat unusual in that we generate 50% of our income through ticket sales, with about 25% grant-in-aid from the national government and the remaining 25% coming from fundraising and commercial activities. Given that roughly 85% of our visitors come from abroad, our dependence on a healthy tourist economy and growing tourism is considerable \u2013 and vulnerable. Government funding is also under pressure, so it\u2019s critical for us to diversify our income streams further and seek new business opportunities. Our dependence on international travel and tourism means that we\u2019re also concerned about our immediate environment: the city of Amsterdam, which seems to be attracting ever-increasing numbers of tourists, but is limited logistically. It\u2019s increasingly important to think about how to facilitate and manage the enormous stream of visitors, while keeping the experience pleasant and the city liveable. This year marks the 125th year of Van Gogh\u2019s death \u2013 how does a museum such as yours approach such a date? It lends itself naturally to special attention. Of course, it\u2019s not really a celebration, but rather a moment to reflect on the reception of Van Gogh and his significance today. This year also marks a milestone for the museum in terms of its development. In the runup to this special year, late in 2014, we fundamentally redeveloped the display of the permanent collection and launched a completely new website. This year we\u2019re also expanding our facilities by adding a new entrance hall, providing more than 8,000 sq ft of additional space.   Related: How we designed the Van Gogh Museum website    What are the benefits and challenges of running a single artist museum? It has a number of particular challenges. In our case, one of the great advantages is that Van Gogh is one of the most famous artists in the world. That means that the museum enjoys a natural and considerable flow of audiences and interest on a continuous basis. The concentration on one artist \u2013 albeit in our case, in combination with his contemporaries \u2013 also provides the museum with a clear focus in terms of its mission and programme. It\u2019s a case of: you get what it says on the tin.  The flip side, however, is that our audience mostly expects to see Van Gogh, which means that we have to think carefully about how far we want to stray from the artist and his immediate environment in our exhibitions . Clearly the biggest challenge is how to continue to find new topics and angles for our research and exhibition programmes, and by extension how to keep the artist \u201cfresh\u201d and relevant. Fortunately, interest in Van Gogh seems to grow unabatedly and it\u2019s more a question of how to satisfy such enormous demand. What can you tell me about the museum\u2019s new commercial directions? One of them is the new generation of extremely high-quality 3D-reproductions of paintings by Van Gogh, which we launched a few years ago. These are being made with technology developed by Fujifilm and provide the first true-to-life reproduction of both the image and the surface texture of the paintings. They form the logical next step in the history of the reproduction of paintings. Another enterprise we\u2019re currently researching is the development of a consultancy based on the expertise the museum has developed over the years, in order to advise existing and new museums on a variety of issues, such as collections management, environmental sustainability, facilities management and so on.  Finally, in 2016 we\u2019re planning to launch a Van Gogh \u201cexperience\u201d \u2013 a multi-sensory, three-dimensional travelling educational display to be shown in different parts of the world. It will not only be a way for us to respond to the considerable global demand for the artist without lending the collection, but a new source of income too.  What can you tell me about the campaign you\u2019re spearheading to get more leading cultural figures on the boards of major businesses? The Dutch government\u2019s cuts to the cultural budget two years ago were accompanied by shockingly insulting and denigrating rhetoric. The sector was portrayed a being unprofessional, dilettante and catering to only a left-wing elite, thus completely ignoring the great steps that institutions have taken in recent years to become highly professionalised and target-orientated organisations. This perception of the sector is also indirectly reflected by the fact that while almost every commercial CEO feels entitled and naturally qualified to serve on the supervisory board or board of trustees of any cultural organisation, hardly any leader of a cultural organisation \u2013 at least in the Netherlands \u2013 is ever asked to serve as non-executive director of any commercial company.  The aim for cultural leaders to become commercial non-executive directors would be twofold: contributing their expertise to management issues in the commercial sector from a different vantage point, while also creating a greater understanding and respect for the professionalism and expertise that exists in the cultural sector. What career tips would you give to an aspiring museum director?  Keep both eyes wide open: be aware of what it means to run a creative organisation and be certain that you are sufficiently interested in the more organisational aspects.  Become part of the community: sometimes you see directors who only concentrate on their own organisations and move solely in their own artistic circle. Especially when you start somewhere, realise that no one has been waiting for you, but that it\u2019s upon you actively to introduce yourself and show interest in your new (social) environment.  Don\u2019t be afraid of changing existing structures: museums are, by their nature, conservative and not always open to change. If you see the need, for example, to change the organisational structure, do it and do it swiftly.

Meanwhile, any hope of becoming a home owner in the capital is becoming a receding fantasy. The London Assembly housing committee is trying to work out how to help. On Tuesday, a panel of experts shared its wisdom about the pros and cons of regulating rents and much, much more. Here are some of the illuminating points made.  There\u2019s more sharing and less dying \u201cThe core issue for London is that we are now housing four generations rather than three,\u201d said Christine Whitehead, housing economics professor of the London School of Economics. This meant that \u201cpeople trying to get into the market are being excluded by people like me, who live too long\u201d. A related factor is that the historic outflow of population from London (largely to the Home Counties) has slowed because of the financial crisis. Result? \u201cWe have a lot more families in London than we would have predicted,\u201d Whitehead said. \u201cThey won\u2019t move until the kids are of a particular age, even if they can.\u201d All of this has contributed to the enlargement of the private rented sector in the capital in recent years and to the growing demand for it. Newcomers to the London housing market have always had to put up with accommodation that is less than ideal, Whitehead stressed, but what used to last for four or five years can now go on for 20 or 30. It\u2019s partly a consequence of London\u2019s pulling power and growth. \u201cLondon needs people and if it\u2019s successful it will get people,\u201d Whitehead said. \u201cThe ones who want to be here are going to be prepared to put up with worse housing. That means by definition that sharers will outbid non-sharers. The sharing issue is enormous.\u201d Different kinds of renters want different things Property analyst Kate Faulkner told the committee it was a mistake to see London as a single, uniform renting market. Even individual boroughs can contain several different renting markets, she explained, catering to different needs. She stressed the range of people who rent privately and their differing reasons for doing so: there\u2019s the student market; those who would be in social housing were there enough of it; those who\u2019d like to buy but can\u2019t afford it; and those who rent simply \u201cbecause it suits them down to the ground.\u201d  Faulkner acknowledged that in an ideal world many renters would like to be able to buy, but that in reality even some who can afford to choose not to. \u201cQuite a lot of people living in London don\u2019t want the hassle of doing up an old house these days,\u201d she said. And while rents are clearly rising, they aren\u2019t outstripping lower-paid Londoners\u2019 stagnating wages at anything like the same rate as house prices are: \u201cA lot more people are renting simply because it\u2019s cheaper.\u201d Faulkner also cited research showing that house sharing among the young can be popular. \u201cCompanies like Spare Room have shown that people like living together. They leave university and don\u2019t want a one-bed flat to themselves. They want to continue with that lifestyle.\u201d Goodbye Rising Damp, hello Friends. Also on the panel was Anne Baxendale from Shelter, who said the charity\u2019s most recent survey of tenants found that 13% of private renters were in the sector from choice. She drew attention to the growing number of families renting privately in London and their greater need for long-term certainty about where they are going live, notably because it isn\u2019t good for children to have to keep changing schools. To that end, Shelter has been campaigning for the introduction of five-year minimum tenures. However, both Alan Collett, a consultant with property investors M&amp;G Real Estate, and Simon Chattfield, research and operations director with be:here, said they\u2019d found little demand for five-year tenures so far. Many young professionals don\u2019t want to stay put for more than a single year. So the private renting picture is a complicated one within the context of a London housing culture that is changing in a variety of ways. Most London private landlords are pretty good Kate Faulkner said that standards in the capital\u2019s private rented sector had improved greatly in the last ten years. Christine Whitehead said it was important to separate out \u201cgood landlords and good tenants, which are the majority\u201d from the minority. There was also some interesting debate about rent rises. Anne Baxendale reminded everyone that rents can take enormous bites out of Londoners\u2019 take home pay: an average of 60%, she said, when Shelter would consider 30% to be a properly affordable proportion. Yet despite recent data showing that the average monthly rent for a London house or flat has risen to \u00a31,500 a month, the committee heard that many landlords don\u2019t increase their rents at all.  What\u2019s going on? Well, landlords often have an interest in keeping good tenants in their properties. They don\u2019t give them any grief and if they move it can mean time, trouble and possibly a spell while the property stands empty until someone new moves in. It can be cheaper and less hassle to leave rents as they are or only hike them by a little. Rises tend to happen when new tenants move in, and landlords put their prices back up to local market levels or whatever they judge competitive. Also, different trackers of rent levels tend to measure different things in different ways. So, yes, rents overall are rising but at different rates for different people at different times. The general upward trend is about growing demand failing to be met by supply, even though more rooms are being let and more people are occupying individual properties. Also, higher standards don\u2019t come free. Higher rents aren\u2019t necessarily about greed. They can also help fund higher quality.   There is a small number of very big crooks \u201cThere is horrendous criminality, particularly in London, landlords that are absolutely exploiting people,\u201d Faulkner said. \u201cThe number of landlords like that is small, but they have a lot of properties and they affect an awful lot of people, because they are shoving in as many as they can. That is an enforcement issue.\u201d She praised Newham\u2019s pioneering licensing scheme, which requires every private landlord in the borough to register. The Guardian\u2019s Hilary Osborne pointed out that elsewhere \u201ccomplete dross\u201d was being marketed \u201cin plain sight\u201d for \u00a3800 a month or more, and wondered why letting agents weren\u2019t questioning it. This was the kind of stuff vulnerable people on insecure incomes were ending up living in. Baxendale pointed out that families often end up in overcrowded and otherwise unsuitable homes. She\u2019d like to see if Boris Johnson\u2019s London Rental Standard could be beefed up to help deal with this.  Forget \u201crent control\u201d as a miracle cure For a lot of people concerned about high rent levels - including, it seems, a lot of Guardian readers - it is beyond obvious that legally enforceable regulations or controls would fix the problem. If only London did things the way they do them in Berlin or New York! If only it were that simple. You don\u2019t have to be the sort who screams \u201cVenezuela\u201d at the merest mention of statutory intervention to recognise that such moves can have adverse effects for some as well as benefits for others.  In Berlin (and elsewhere in Germany), where the entire housing scenario has long been quite different from London including in private renting, new, stronger rent controls are welcomed by current tenants living in increasingly desirable areas but are also raising concerns that they are deterring investors in new homes for rent in such areas at a time when more are needed.  Whitehead said that rents in several German cities, while much lower to begin with, have actually increased more quickly than in London as a result of stabilisation measures, perverse as that may seem. She explained that in a high inflation environment rules limiting the extent to which rents can be increased appeared to have encouraged landlords to impose such increases as are permitted instead of engaging in negotiations with their tenants, which might have resulted in smaller increases or none at all.  In New York, Whitehead said, \u201cThe people who are benefiting are all over the age of 50 and professionals.\u201d She added: \u201cThe general evidence says that if you have extreme types of control, basically those who are there benefit and those who want to get in [to such properties], don\u2019t get in.\u201d Anne Baxendale said that research for Shelter found that if rents were reduced by a third, many landlords would simply sell up - hardly ideal for tenants. Alan Collett told the committee that in Amsterdam, another city often held up as a rent control example London should follow, new properties for private rent are to be free of rent regulation measures in order to get more of them built. There is a useful lesson here: complaining about high rents is easy; making them lower without hurting the very people you want to help is trickier.  Conclusion? London needs a bigger, better and cheaper private rented sector, but politicians seeking to get all three at the same time will have to engage in a complex and subtle balancing act that the mayor and the boroughs lack the powers to even try to execute all on their own.

In 2011, the publication of the photobook Magnum Contact Sheets seemed like an epitaph on the whole elaborate, hands-on process of pre-digital photography. Four years on, a new exhibition, which opens at FOAM Amsterdam on 11 September, is framed as \u201ca tribute to analogue technique\u201d \u2013 further evidence that what was once taken for granted is now seen as almost absurdly old-fashioned. It strikes me that many younger visitors to the show may not even be familiar with the term \u201ccontact sheet\u201d, so swiftly has digital culture excised all traces of the process that once governed photography.     Thomas Hoepker\u2019s 9/11 contact sheet. Photograph: Magnum Photos     For all that, the show lets us reconsider not just what has been lost, but the discipline and rigour of analogue photography. We often speak of a photographer honing his or her eye solely through the act of shooting, but perusing contact sheets also honed the eye in terms of selecting images.  How revelatory they could be in illuminating a photographer\u2019s creative choices was hit home to me at the great Robert Frank retrospective, Storylines, at Tate Modern in 2005. The contact sheets for The Americans showed how few frames Frank shot of each subject \u2013 just two or three slight variations sufficed. Like many great photographers, he edited in his head as he shot. The use of a contact sheet was a process of utter refinement. (How this worked for William Eggleston has intrigued me ever since he told me: \u201cI only ever take one picture of one thing. Literally. Never two.\u201d)  At Foam, 60 contact sheets \u2013 and the famous images picked from them \u2013 will be on show. The first is from the 1940s, three years before Magnum was established, when Robert Capa (another co-founder) was a photojournalist embedded with British troops in the second world war. As Capa\u2019s dramatic images of the landings on Omaha Beach on D-day show, the contact sheet is evidence of how a photographer works under extreme duress.     Leonard Freed\u2019s contact sheet of Martin Luther King in Baltimore, 1963. Photograph: Magnum Photos    Likewise, the young Josef Koudelka\u2019s shots of the Russian invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968, taken at considerable risk on the streets of Prague. Koudelka\u2019s contact sheets, like Capa\u2019s, are both a record of a seismic historical moment and a diary of a frantic creative process. All the visceral energy and edginess of those first days of collective shock and turmoil are captured in photographs that are not always deftly composed or properly exposed. Koudelka was shooting on out-of-date black-and-white cinema film \u2013 the only stock available to him \u2013 and had to run back to his dark room to reload after shooting every roll.   Four years later, Gilles Peress was on the ground in Derry when British paratroopers fired into the crowd at a civil-rights march, killing 13 civilians. Peress\u2019s contact sheets were integral to the Saville Inquiry into the Bloody Sunday shootings, helping to establish context. In her essay for the Magnum Contact Sheets book, Kristen Lubben notes how a contact sheet can offer detailed evidence, and be used to corroborate or contradict received versions of events. The single photograph may be our defining image of a historical moment, but the contact sheet shows the uncertainty and even unreliability of that moment.   At the other extreme, they can record the painstaking creation of an elaborate studio portrait. Philippe Halsman\u2019s fittingly surreal image of Salvador Dal\u00ed is a case in point. The artist stands poised at his easel as three startled cats and a stream of water fly though the air. Here, the contact sheet proves how labour-intensive and hit-and-miss such an ambitious set-up could be \u2013 and, yes, the cats were repeatedly flung though the air by Halsman\u2019s assistants until he got the shot he wanted.      Josef Koudelka\u2019s contact sheet from the Prague invasion, August 1968. Photograph: Magnum Photos     One of the most iconic images at Foam is Ren\u00e9 Burri\u2019s 1963 portrait of a cigar-smoking Che Guevara. It shows the victorious revolutionary as statesman, a Cuban cigar adding another layer of romantic gravitas to Guevara\u2019s already carefully-managed image. The contact sheet shows a more restless \u2013 and more human \u2013 individual, by turns tired and expansive. Once again, it is the contact sheet, not the individual portrait, that captures the complexity of the subject.   Whether showing us a second-by-second unfolding of a historical event (Stuart Franklin\u2019s contact sheet from the Tiananmen Square protests that contained the famous \u201ctank man\u201d shot), or a glimpse of the mechanics of Hollywood star-making machinery (Bert Glinn\u2019s shots of a young and sultry Elizabeth Taylor on the set of Suddenly Last Summer), the contact sheet is a repository of evidence that can reveal both a photographer\u2019s greatness \u2013 and their fallibility.  \u2022 Magnum Contact Sheets is at FOAM Amsterdam, from 11 September to 9 December.

Even among a population whose last, and indeed only, fleeting period of believing they were able to compete on a global scale at anything other than the large-scale collection of cod ended with one of humanity\u2019s greatest and most humiliating banking crises, this is a cause for unbridled celebration.

Goalscorer Gylfi Sigurdsson admitted that the post-goal melee had not been his only celebration of the evening, telling Morgunbladid that \u201cit was a pleasant feeling to see Arjen Robben go off injured\u201d. Kolbeinn Sigthorsson, meanwhile, said of the red-carded Bruno Martins Indi that \u201cI knew he is the type of player who does really stupid things\u201d (to be fair Robben, the Dutch captain, agreed on this one, admitting of his team-mate\u2019s tackle that \u201cI can\u2019t say anything other than that this is very stupid\u201d). And so, then, to Reykjavik. \u201cIt will be really something to come back home now,\u201d said the goalkeeper, Hannes Thor Halldorsson. \u201cNow we just need to finish this off on Sunday. It will be one of the greatest parties ever held in our country if we do it.\u201d Quick, hide the fruit bowl. As for the Dutch, well, at least they can afford to drown their sorrows. In Holland at the moment they could use a hankie. In Iceland they could rip a tissue (kids, ask your grandad again).

FIVER LETTERS \u201cAs a Spurs fan I very much enjoyed yesterday\u2019s Fiver (making it a nice change) as it raged over the many flaws of Arsenal being as Arsenal can be and what a comedy of errors they are. The only down side is to now sit through nine months of Tottenham being as only Tottenham can be and contrive to finish below them \u2013 again! \u2013 despite numerous opportunities to finally better them and end up blaming it on a dodgy lasagne or more likely this year a dodgy defensive midfielder. Using the term defensive midfielder in a fairly loose sense\u201d \u2013 Graham Haslam. \u201cThere is no possible reason for such a wanton misunderstanding of the word tertiary, as used by Derby chief suit, other than to bait pedants. Yes yes, I know, I bit, along with 1,056 others no doubt.

BITS AND BOBS It wasn\u2019t iffy paperwork or a fax on the fritz that prevented David de Gea\u2019s move to Real Madrid going through, but Manchester United\u2019s naivety. That\u2019s according to Real chief suit Florentino P\u00e9rez, anyway. \u201cI think what they lack is experience,\u201d P\u00e9rez finger-wagged. \u201cI don\u2019t want to blame anyone but it took eight hours,\u201d he continued, very much appearing to blame someone. Dithering at Old Trafford seems to be a theme where transfers are concerned, as Pedro has cited their umming and ahhing as the reason behind choosing Chelsea over Manchester United, rather than them being mean to V\u00edctor Vald\u00e9s. \u201cIt\u2019s true that I don\u2019t like that treatment for my colleagues, especially for Victor,\u201d he shrugged. \u201cI just saw that Manchester didn\u2019t take that move forward, that they were taking too long. Chelsea were more decisive. Despite taking advice from Wayne Rooney, Harry Kane isn\u2019t concerned about his goalless start to the season. \u201cSome strikers go down a bad path and lose their confidence but not me,\u201d he roared.

Lord Herman Ouseley, the chairman of Kick It Out, has warned David Cameron and all his politician chums to be careful about their use of language, after a 21% increase in the reports of racial abuse at football grounds was reported. \u201cDavid Cameron, and all politicians and public figures, have a duty to give leadership on how they speak about these issues, otherwise hatred will explode,\u201d Ouseley said. In rather more heartening news, English supporters\u2019 groups are set to follow the example of their German brethren by taking \u2018Refugees Welcome\u2019 banners into grounds. They\u2019ll need a permit for that at Anfield, of course.

Vincent Woolsgrove told the authorities he had found the cannon outside British waters on an unidentified wreck, which allowed him to pocket about \u00a350,000 by selling them to an American buyer. After two years of painstaking detective work, investigators proved the cannon were actually taken from the warship HMS London, which sank in 1665 off Southend in Essex. By then the cannon had been exported and were sitting on the front lawn of a collector\u2019s home in Florida.  Woolsgrove, 49, of Ramsgate, Kent, admitted fraud in relation to the cannon and asked for 61 offences of failure to notify the receiver of wreck (RoW) of other finds to be taken into consideration.  These offences relate to an \u201cAladdin\u2019s cave\u201d of objects from wrecks, found at his home and at his girlfriend\u2019s house, worth more than \u00a3100,000.      One of the three cannon lifted from the wreck.  Photograph: Maritime and Coastguard Agency/PA    Sentencing Woolsgrove at Southampton crown court on Friday, Judge Peter Ralls QC said: \u201cThe cannon are extremely rare and they are indeed unique. Other cannon were melted down or reformed, they just do not exist. \u201cIt\u2019s great credit to the MCA [Maritime and Coastguard Agency] that they have been able to piece together historical records that show without doubt the origin and identity of these ancient weapons. The work that has gone into this by the MCA is frankly enormous.\u201d As well as the prison sentence, Woolsgrove was ordered to pay \u00a335,000 in costs and he is being made subject of Proceeds of Crime Act proceedings to recover the money gained from the sale of the cannon. Built in 1654, HMS London took part in the first Dutch war (1652-4). Later it formed part of an English squadron sent to collect Charles II from the Netherlands to restore him to the throne. The ship blew up and sank as it sailed through the Thames estuary preparing to fight the Dutch in the Channel in March 1665, an event recorded in Samuel Pepys\u2019s diary.  The wreckage of the London was rediscovered in 2005 during work in advance of the London Gateway Port development and was designated under the Protection of Wrecks Act.  The ship continues to yield treasures. A 17th-century gun carriage was successfully lifted from the seabed last month. It was in startlingly good condition, still with a length of rope threaded through a pulley block.   Related: 17th-century HMS London gun carriage lifted from Southend seabed    In 2007, Woolsgrove reported finding five cannon during the summer. He declared truthfully that two were from the wreck of the London, meaning they belonged to the crown and could be saved for the nation. But he claimed three bronze cannon \u2013 branded with the crest of the City of Amsterdam \u2013 were found in international waters from an unidentified wreck, outside British jurisdiction. With no way of proving him wrong, Woolsgrove was allowed to keep the three cannon and sold them to the US collector. But investigators from the MCA, Kent and Essex police, and Historic England continued to test Woolsgrove\u2019s account after receiving reports that divers were looting the London.  Woolsgrove\u2019s house in Ramsgate and his girlfriend\u2019s home were searched. Investigators found wreck items including copper, lead, tin and glass ingots, and ships\u2019 bells. They also discovered photographs on Woolsgrove\u2019s computer that seemed to show they had been recovered off Southend.  After intensive detective work they established that the three cannon were built in Amsterdam to protect the city, and had later been issued to Dutch vessels to attack the English fleet during the first Dutch war. The vessels were captured by the English and the cannon taken as prizes. These were subsequently placed on board the London.  Ian Lawrie QC, prosecuting, said: \u201cThe heart of this case are three bronze Dutch fortress cannon. They are cannon of great beauty, power and rarity.\u201d He said that immaculate records kept by the Dutch navy archivists with additional records from the Royal Navy meant the MCA was able to trace the history of the cannon and their final resting place on the London. Lawrie said the American collector was \u201cdisinclined to return them to England\u201d. He added: \u201cAs far as the MCA is concerned, they are gone, which considering their rarity value, that is a considerable shame.\u201d The barrister said that Woolsgrove had a significant amount of wreck material at his home that led to him asking for other offences to be taken into consideration.  He said: \u201cThere was a positive Aladdin\u2019s cave in wreck material in his garden, outhouse, his own house and his girlfriend\u2019s house nearby.\u201d Kevin Toomey, defending, said: \u201cHe is a normal person who has fallen into a great deal of difficulty because of his dishonesty and he has to live with that and the shame he has brought on his family.\u201d He said his client would have been in line for compensation for possibly the full value of the cannon if he had informed the RoW accurately as he was obliged to do. Alison Kentuck, MCA receiver of wreck, said: \u201cOur message is clear: all wreck material found within or brought within UK territorial waters must be reported within 28 days to the receiver of wreck.  \u201cIt is not a case of \u2018finders keepers\u2019. Had these artefacts been correctly reported, the finder would have been entitled to a substantial salvage award and important information could have been added to the historical record.\u201d Mark Harrison, Historic England\u2019s national policing and crime adviser, said: \u201cThis case sets an important precedent in the fight against uncontrolled salvage by a small criminal minority who have no appreciation for England\u2019s maritime heritage.  \u201cWoolsgrove used sophisticated techniques and equipment to remove these valuable artefacts from the seabed.\u201d ", "sentences": ["But he claimed three bronze cannon \u2013 branded with the crest of the City of Amsterdam \u2013 were found in international waters from an unidentified wreck, outside British jurisdiction.", "After intensive detective work they established that the three cannon were built in Amsterdam to protect the city, and had later been issued to Dutch vessels to attack the English fleet during the first Dutch war."], "title": "Diver jailed for fraudulently selling three cannon found in UK waters", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/sep/04/diver-jailed-fraudulently-selling-three-cannon-found-uk-waters-vincent-woolsgrove", "tags": ["Crime", "UK news", "Heritage", "Southend-on-Sea"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-09-05T06:00:01Z", "article": "Growing numbers of British school leavers are shunning higher education at home in favour of universities in the EU, forced out by sky-high tuition fees and attracted by degree courses taught entirely in English. Groningen, the biggest university in the Netherlands and ranked between Bristol and Warwick in the world academic league tables, has received twice as many applications from British students for the 2015-16 year compared to last year. Around 285 British undergraduates will start courses this week in the northern Dutch city, compared to only 135 last year. Maastricht University, the trailblazer for courses taught entirely in English, has more than 370 students from Britain, while colleges such as Aarhus in Denmark and the Freie Universit\u00e4t in Berlin are starting to see a flow of students from the other side of the North Sea.    I will leave with less than \u00a34,000 in debt. And I\u2019m having a whale of a time  Jonah Thompson     The global dominance of English means many universities in the EU are now opening undergraduate courses, particularly in business, economics and IT, taught entirely in English. What\u2019s more, students within the EU have to be offered the same financial terms as domestic students \u2013 which at many universities means there are no tuition fees. The last regional government in Germany to impose tuition fees abandoned them in 2014, meaning all of the country\u2019s 2.4 million students pay nothing. In Denmark, tuition fees are also zero for anyone from the EU. In the Netherlands, the annual fee is \u00a31,400 a year, but British students have the same rights as Dutch students in applying for government loans to cover the fees. British students in many EU universities also talk of much lower living costs, particularly rents, and are benefitting from the sharp rise in the value of sterling against the euro over the past year. While a student at Bristol will pay a minimum of \u00a3424 a month for a single room in a university residence, in Groningen it is \u00a3339. A postgraduate student in Berlin said his rent for a large one-bed self-contained flat in the city centre was \u00a3290 a month, compared to \u00a31,400 for the same sort of flat in London. Jonah Thompson, from Midhurst, West Sussex, is just starting his second year at Groningen studying law, says: \u201cMy friends at the English universities will be coming out with \u00a350,000 in debt. I will leave with less than \u00a34,000 in debt. And I\u2019m having a whale of a time.\u201d Sophie Bray from Nottingham is studying hospitality management at the Dutch university of Stenden in Leeuwarden, a four-year course not only taught in English but which also offers three months at its sister academic site in Bali, Indonesia. \u201cI am with five other British students and others from all around the world. It\u2019s probably more academic than the average British university \u2013 there\u2019s no playing about, and nightlife is not exactly raucous as it is in Nottingham.\u201d     Sophie Bray is studying in Holland. Photograph: Sophie Bray    Dutch universities started term this week, unlike most of their English counterparts, where terms don\u2019t start for another three weeks. Bray took two years out to travel. \u201cIt is interesting living and working with people who are all from different upbringings and backgrounds which makes you step out of your comfort zone, and it also makes you easily adaptable and culturally intelligent,\u201d she adds. \u201cLeeuwarden is also a very relaxed and chilled place to be.\u201d Thompson says that one stark contrast to British universities is that the first year workload is quite heavy, with the Dutch happy to admit lots of students and see how they get on, rather than screen them out beforehand. \u201cOut of the 100 students who joined my course, we lost about 30 in the first year. This is quite common.\u201d Around a quarter of Groningen\u2019s 190,000 population are undergraduates, which makes for a more lively student scene. \u201cBut it\u2019s not like Britain \u2013 it has only one of the sort of nightclubs you see at home,\u201d Thompson says. \u201cIt\u2019s retained so much more of its Dutch culture. But there is a massive association culture, with clubs and societies for everything.\u201d The British are the third largest non-Dutch contingent after the Germans and the Chinese, he says, and he has found the Dutch hugely welcoming. \u201cEveryone speaks English \u2026 to show how much the Dutch welcome you, I even managed to get elected to the faculty council.\u201d While the Netherlands and the Nordic countries were among the first to start courses taught entirely in English, in part because of the relative obscurity of their own languages, in France it is another matter. Apart from a few business school postgraduate courses, it\u2019s impossible to find any in France that are not in the mother tongue (and likewise in England). In Germany, Italy and Spain, English-taught first degree courses are still rare, but there are a growing number of master\u2019s and postgraduate courses entirely in English. Oscar Norris-Broughton, 27, graduated from the University of Sussex with a degree in history, and is now doing a master\u2019s in global history at the Freie Universit\u00e4t in Berlin. It is a two-year course taught in English, with zero tuition fees \u2013 and students even get a free travel pass for the city. \u201cI found the price of higher education in Britain to be completely untenable, and the cost of living in Brighton is so much higher than Berlin. I am now at a fair level of proficiency in German, but I didn\u2019t have any when I first came here, although that didn\u2019t matter as so many people speak English really well, and the course was in English. I couldn\u2019t recommend it highly enough.\u201d However, students from England and Wales cannot obtain loans from the Student Loans Company and use them to study abroad, although Scottish students can take their loans with them. There is also the risk that the UK votes to pull out of the EU, which is likely to make the financial equation much less attractive, unless Britain remains in the EEA. What\u2019s on offer where, and what it costs Netherlands Courses taught in English There are 13 research universities, but some do not teach bachelor degrees in the English language. Currently, only the University of Groningen and Maastricht University offer courses in English in more than five subjects, although most have plans to increase undergraduate education in English. Note that Dutch universities offer a liberal arts-style of education where you tend to study a range of subjects before going on to specialise at a later stage, rather than the British single-subject bachelor\u2019s degree approach. Tuition fees \u00a31,432 for most courses in 2015-16 for EU students, who are also eligible for a state loan. The interest rate on the \u201ccollegegeldkrediet\u201d is 0.81% and for a three-year undergraduate degree you are likely to owe around \u00a34,400. Living costs Largely on a par with the UK. Amsterdam is the most expensive. Rents are around \u00a3238-\u00a3367 a month. Travel costs Trains from London to Maastricht via Eurostar take around 4.5 hours and cost around \u00a360 one way booked in advance. Denmark Courses taught in English 500 degree programmes and 1,300 courses taught in English, although there is a bias towards master\u2019s rather than undergraduate degrees. Lots of business/economics, IT and engineering courses in English. Tuition fees Zero for students from the EU and the European Economic Area (EU nations plus Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein). Living costs Can be spectacularly high in Copenhagen, less so outside. Rents for college-run accommodation in Aarhus start at \u00a3230 a month. Travel costs Aarhus is especially cheap with budget airlines from Britain. For Copenhagen, it is cheaper to fly to Malmo in Sweden and cross the bridge. Ireland Courses taught in English If you need the answer to this one, perhaps you should reconsider going to university. Tuition fees The major universities \u2013 such as Trinity, University College Dublin, University College Cork, NUI Galway \u2013 charge around \u00a34,266 for most degrees, rising to \u00a36,430 for medicine. Living costs Dublin is not cheap. On-campus accommodation at UCD is \u00a34,170-\u00a35,667 per academic year. In Cork, campus rooms are more like \u00a33,300 a year, and flatshares in the city start at around \u00a3200 a month, while Galway is cheaper still. Number of British students An expected surge of tuition-fee dodging Brits has failed to materialise. UCD says it has few UK students, which may be because of the lingering perception that Dublin is an expensive city. Travel costs London-Dublin is the world\u2019s busiest international air route, with return fares on budget airlines from \u00a340, while the London-Dublin train and ferry starts from \u00a332 one way. Germany Courses taught in English Berlin\u2019s Freie Universit\u00e4t has one undergraduate course taught in English (North American Studies), but like other German universities it has numerous master\u2019s programmes in English. Tuition fees These were finally abolished in 2014 for all Germany\u2019s 2.4m students \u2013 same applies to EU students. Living costs Slightly lower than the UK overall, and much cheaper than London (this is the home of Lidl and Aldi). Rents are much lower \u2013 even in an expensive city such as Munich, student rents are typically \u00a3183-\u00a3260 a month. Travel costs Northern Germany easily served by trains from London via Eurostar, and numerous budget airlines. Belgium Courses taught in English Still relatively limited, with most undergraduate courses in French. But it is possible to find some degrees entirely in English, such as the business and economics at KU Leuven in Brussels. Tuition fees EU students at Flemish institutions pay a variable fee, usually around \u00a3440 a year, while those in the French community area pay around \u00a3274-\u00a3613. Living costs Brussels will be expensive, but the rest of Belgium is in line with, or lower than, UK costs. Travel costs Superb train connections on Eurostar to Brussels from \u00a359 return. Other countries Sweden has a number of degrees taught in English, but living costs are high. Annual fees for most non-EU students are \u00a36,000-\u00a310,800. In France, undergraduate fees are just \u00a3150 a year at most public universities. In Italy the fees are around \u00a31,000 a year and in Spain you pay per \u201ccredit\u201d, but it works out at about \u00a3440-\u00a3734 a year. Among the main English speaking nations, Canada is about best value. Its tuition fees average \u00a33,000 a year, ranging from around \u00a34,000 in Toronto to just \u00a31,300 in Labrador or Newfoundland. Tuition fees for international students in Australia and New Zealand are a lot higher, ranging from \u00a37,000-\u00a316,000. Some top American universities charge gobsmacking tuition fees, with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology priciest at around \u00a330,000 a year. South Africa shouldn\u2019t be ruled out; its top-ranking university, Cape Town, charges international students around \u00a32,000 a year, with student flatshares in relatively safe parts of town from around \u00a3200 per month. \u2022 All currency conversions correct as of 2 September 2015.

His mother\u2019s (inconvenient) phone call interrupts the hum of Willem\u2019s daily life and summons him back to the family home in Amsterdam. But it is no homecoming.  Willem elects to stay in the Lloyd hotel in the city, a place where emigrants once lodged before they embarked to the new world. His father leaks disappointment and his mother hugs him and eventually tells him to \u201cgo home\u201d. But where is his home?   There is something of Will Eno\u2019s Thom Pain in this study of the disappointments and futility of life, although Song from Far Away is stylistically very different. And there are echoes of Stephens\u2019s heartbreaking Sea Wall in the way it cradles grief and confronts how we disappear without trace.  Willem is barely present, happier in the liminal spaces of airport lounges and hotels. He wears headphones to shield himself from the world, but he\u2019s not listening to music, only to the elevated sound of his own breathing.    Related: This week\u2019s new theatre     Over seven days, Willem starts to rediscover his lost self through the act of writing a daily letter to his dead brother. A child\u2019s unselfconscious joie de vivre affects him, an encounter with an ex-lover makes him weep and, most of all, a song \u2013 written by Mark Eitzel and heard in a cafe \u2013 awakens something in him. A particular phrase in its melody catches his \u201cheart in its hand.\u201d Smits\u2019s Dutch-inflected English makes every word sound jagged, as if its edges have been exposed, and his bravely understated performance renders Willem naked and vulnerable. He goes back to the beginning.  The final image of an embarkation is ambiguous, yet Song from Far Away offers a window into the heart. Its staging reflects us back to ourselves, like pale ghosts peering into the abyss, straining to hear a distant song.  \u2022 At the Young Vic, London, until 19 September.

I fully suspect I killed him. I\u2019ve no idea what happened to him.\u201d Being homeless and desperate, as De Mooi was at the time, perhaps explains why he did what he says he did, although he has never been charged with anything. The incident, described in De Mooi\u2019s just released autobiography CJ, allegedly took place in Amsterdam 25 years ago, but according to the Daily Mirror, which is serialising the book, Dutch police will now investigate. The most perplexing aspect of his story, however, is the fact that he chose to share it. Yet those who kill \u2013 or think they\u2019ve killed \u2013 often find a way to tell the story. Consider the case of the Polish writer Krystian Bala. In 2007, Bala was convicted and jailed for the sadistic murder, seven years previously, of Dariusz Janiszewski, a man he suspected of beginning a relationship with his ex-wife. Bala was caught because, after committing the crime, he wrote a novel called Amok, in which the narrator does something very similar \u2013 and afterwards goes online to sell the murder weapon. Bala (who continues to insist he is innocent) had sold Janiszewski\u2019s phone in the same, very traceable way. It proved to be the vital connection between them. Besides echoing the real killing, Amok also mimicked Dostoyevsky\u2019s Crime and Punishment, in which Raskolnikov \u2013 drunk on philosophy like Bala \u2013 cannot stop himself confessing to a murder. Probably unknowingly, Bala was also copying the behaviour of the Dutch novelist Richard Klinkhamer, who in 1992 submitted a book to his publisher in which he speculated about the ways in which he might have killed his wife, Hanny, who had gone missing the year before. In 2000, her remains were uncovered during building works in the couple\u2019s former garden, upon which Klinkhamer confessed everything. In Nebraska in 2013, Hannah Sabata recorded her own distinctly 21st-century confession. Having stolen a car, and then robbed a bank, Sabata drove home and posted a video to YouTube, in which she described in detail what she had done. The video went viral, the car was found at her home, and she was jailed for 10-20 years. Sabata had a history of mental illness, but it is clear that in some cases a kind of pressure \u2013 perhaps guilt, perhaps uncontainable pride, perhaps something else \u2013 seems to build up in people, leading them to what seem like absurdly unwise confessions. In retrospect, even Jimmy Savile now looks like he flirted repeatedly with the truth of his appalling crimes. Louis Theroux has described how Savile used to \u201ctantalise you by giving the impression he did have secrets\u201d. In his autobiography, Savile even talked openly about keeping a runway girl at his house overnight \u201cas my reward\u201d, and of another time when he demanded and received a tent full of six young girls in return for a public appearance.

Deflategate runs out of air  Deflategate \u2013 the biggest scandal involving underpressurised balls ever to engulf American football \u2013 parped its way ever more painfully towards a denouement last week. To recap: in January, the New England Patriots were caught using underinflated balls in a playoff game against the Indianapolis Colts. Four months later, the NFL released a 243-page report and Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was banned for four games. Brady\u2019s appeal to the NFL was rejected, before his ban was overturned by a federal court last week. The NFL has since appealed but mercifully it\u2019s now possible the affair, which has dominated US networks all summer, may be overshadowed by some actual sport: the NFL season begins this week. Hamilton continues F1 run  Air pressure was somewhat bizarrely also the topic du jour at the Italian Grand Prix, where Lewis Hamilton endured a nervy wait before having his latest dominant F1 triumph confirmed by stewards investigating a tyre pressure infringement by Mercedes, which was later adjudged to have occurred within the rules. \u201cI feel this weekend is the best I\u2019ve ever driven.

This has her worried \u2013 heading into the final week of the Canning byelection campaign, the Greens candidate will be called upon to deliver her party\u2019s message to an electorate that\u2019s rapidly getting tired of all the would-be politicians clogging up its shopping centres. \u201cThat\u2019s what the Greens advisers keep telling me,\u201d she says. \u201cSoundbites. Keep it short.\u201d Sitting in a cafe in Fremantle, Rauland brings her hands down for emphasis on the last word, cutting a discrete chunk out of the air. \u201cBe concise\u201d. Rauland doesn\u2019t do concise. She\u2019s a university lecturer, working part-time at the Curtin University Sustainability Policy Institute (CUSP), where she completed her PhD in low-carbon urban development in 2013. That\u2019s a career suited to talking in lengthy detail, and only when you\u2019re sure you know everything it is reasonably possible to know on a subject.  The politician\u2019s knack of speaking confidently from a recently memorised page of briefing notes is foreign to Rauland, as is sticking to a party line. Fortunately, her key concerns \u2013 renewable energy and sustainable communities \u2013 and those of the Greens. No memorising necessary.   Related: Canning byelection: Andrew Hastie refuses to give his views on creationism    \u201cI get so excited by the future and I am so amazed at the research that\u2019s coming out of CUSP,\u201d she says. \u201cI get really excited \u2013 and then you just look up to the government and at every point they are squashing it all.\u201d It was the removal of the carbon tax last year that first made Rauland consider switching her focus from research to politics. Then the prime minister, Tony Abbott, said the federal government would not fund passenger rail projects. And finally, in June, the Abbott government wound back the renewable energy target. \u201cI have always put my blinkers on to politics and just tried to keep working away at it, but if we\u2019re working away and we just keep getting roadblocks, I think this is a fantastic opportunity to actually work to change policy \u2013 so that the other me\u2019s can keep doing what they are doing,\u201d she says.  \u201cThen we can actually progress society along much quicker, rather than having to be stopped at every corner because of silly policies that are not evidence-based, not forward thinking.\u201d In the socially conservative, working-class seat of Canning, the Greens took just 7.4% of the primary vote at the last election. Early polling for the 19 September byelection, triggered by the sudden death of sitting MP Don Randall, puts them on a marginally improved vote of 7.9%. That\u2019s roughly the expected combined vote of all the other minor party candidates.    Related: What do voters in the Canning byelection want Australia to do for refugees?    Rauland has never lived in the Canning electorate. She grew up in Melbourne and spent four years in Europe, completing her masters at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam before moving to Perth to take up a position at Curtin University in 2009. She now lives in Fremantle \u2013 culturally very different from the Canning population centres of Armadale and Mandurah \u2013 and runs a sustainability consultancy business with fellow Curtin academic Dr Samantha Hall, as well as lecturing part-time.  At 33, she is the contemporary of Liberal candidate Andrew Hastie, 32, and Labor candidate Matt Keogh, 33. With her dark-rimmed glasses, leather jacket and green tea, Rauland is perhaps a more appropriate target for Julie Bishop to label a hipster than Keogh (who, when he spoke to Guardian Australia earlier this week, drank black tea).  But, Rauland tells Guardian Australia, Canning is the perfect test case for sustainable development. A rapidly growing area where new suburbs pop up in empty paddocks every six months, on the fringe of one of the lowest-density cities in the world, Canning is the frothy tip on the wave of urban sprawl.  \u201cI get a little bit upset and get a bit ranty when people talk about affordable housing being cheap housing on the outskirts of suburbs,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s not thinking long-term affordability. That\u2019s putting people who are vulnerable, who have not much money, somewhere that they have got huge transport costs, [where] they\u2019re car dependent.  \u201cAnd if it\u2019s a cheap house, it probably means it\u2019s not really well-designed, it\u2019s not efficient, so they have got high energy bills as well \u2026 like in America, it could end up being the slums if you end up just having massive big houses that consume a lot of energy and are cut off from transport.\u201d Rauland says housing affordability is the issue Canning voters raise most with her, followed by concerns about local crime levels \u2013 something that has been a major focus of her opponents\u2019 campaigns, but not hers. Some are concerned about renewable energy, but usually over the impact on their bills \u2013 half of all houses in Canning have either rooftop solar or solar hot water, to keep costs down. \u201cWe have got the biggest power station in Western Australia on our rooftops \u2013 I think it\u2019s 500 megawatts now,\u201d she said. \u201cIt just doesn\u2019t make sense to me \u2013 why aren\u2019t we increasing that?\u201d", "sentences": ["She grew up in Melbourne and spent four years in Europe, completing her masters at Vrije Universiteit in Amsterdam before moving to Perth to take up a position at Curtin University in 2009."], "title": "Canning byelection: Greens candidate trying to make sense of soundbites", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/sep/11/canning-byelection-greens-candidate-trying-to-make-sense-of-soundbites", "tags": ["Canning byelection 2015", "Western Australian politics", "Western Australia", "Australian politics", "Australia news", "Australian Greens"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-09-13T06:50:16Z", "article": "Simon Stephens\u2019s Song From Far Away is one of the saddest plays I have ever seen: a short chamber piece for one. Willem (Eelco Smits) has travelled from New York to Amsterdam because his 20-year-old brother, Pauli, has died of a heart attack. He has chosen to stay in a hotel rather than at home because his relations with his family are strained. The play is in the form of letters written by Willem to Pauli \u2013 part mourner\u2019s journey, part autobiography. Willem is gay but it is not clear whether this explains the estrangement from his family. As in life, the story might be more complicated. Stephens shows but does not makes the mistake of telling. Director Ivo van Hove has a feeling for everyday choreography and Smits\u2019s performance is a tour de force. All his gestures are evocative. When he turns his head upwards to convey he is under the hotel\u2019s shower, there is a changed softness, his voice comes back to life. When he describes his niece writing names in the sky with sparklers after Pauli\u2019s funeral, his hand retraces hers. When he says goodbye to his ex-boyfriend, he gives a final anything-but-resigned shrug. He performs much of the show naked \u2013 a risk that pays off in a piece about vulnerability. Fortunately, anguish is offset by mournfully funny moments. I enjoyed the description of his sister\u2019s self-congratulation stacking the dishwasher in her parents\u2019 kitchen. But the piece\u2019s greatest achievement is the tension that grows out of Willem\u2019s questioning character.

The latest sneak preview of the book I\u2019ll Never Write My Memoirs, out later this month, sees Jones taking aim at modern pop stars for copying her image, which has been carefully curated over a career spanning five decades.  She\u2019s right, too. When Kim Kardashian \u201cbroke the internet\u201d with her Jones-approved Paper cover last year (a collaboration with Jean-Paul Goude, who masterminded Jones\u2019s visual impact), she was paying homage to the star\u2019s 80s aesthetic.

For Minogue\u2019s video, the Australian used a similar shape created, appropriately enough, by the British designer Mrs Jones. Minogue combined the cape with a bodysuit and Kraftwerk-style dancers \u2013 also somewhat reminiscent of the ones Jones worked with on her famous live extravaganza A One Man Show.

Rihanna borrowed the look but, as Jones says, wore a bodysuit. The implication? She\u2019s not quite as committed to her art.      Grace Jones in body paint playing Festival No 6 in Wales this month.

An honourable mention here goes to La Roux, who is partial to Jones-style tailoring and has spoken of Jones\u2019s influence on the sound \u2013 and look \u2013 of her 2014 album Trouble in Paradise.

While it was later revealed that this image was actually painstakingly created by Goude using a collage of photographs, it\u2019s unclear if Minaj\u2019s precarious pose is genuine.     ... but Grace Jones did it first on the cover of Jungle Fever.

Nobody will use it. Photography is a serious thing, if you want to take a photograph you take your camera,\u201d he says. \u201cHow wrong I was.\u201d The world changed and Fontcuberta was wise enough to change with it. The proliferation of the cameraphone means we all constantly make and consume photographs, a state that has led him to describe humans as Homo photographicus. Named the guest curator for the 14th biannual Le Mois de la Photo \u00e0 Montreal, Fontcuberta chose the \u201cpost-photographic condition\u201d as this edition\u2019s theme.  Through the 29 selected artists from 11 countries, the month-long festival offers perspectives on the new kinds of images needed to mediate our 21st century reality now the former rules of our 150-year-old relationship with the photograph no longer apply. These issues will be further unpacked during the three-day colloquium, \u00c0 Partir aujourd\u2019hui \u2026 Reconsidering Photography, which includes a keynote speech by Quentin Bajac, the chief curator of photography at New York\u2019s Museum of Modern Art.  Rather than focussing on the technology or aesthetics of this phenomenon, Fontcuberta prefers an anthropological approach. \u201cThe post-photographic is not a style, not a tendency or artistic movement. It\u2019s a kind of attitude towards photography. How are people using photographs, cellphones, how do they react to this cascade of pictures on the internet?\u201d Or, put another way, Robert Pellegrinuzzi\u2019s cloud-like sculpture of 250 000 photos asks: \u201cDo we, in fact, produce images, or do images produce us?\u201d     Joachim Schmid\u2019s Big Fish, from the series Other People\u2019s Photographs. Photograph: Joachim Schmid    How we decide in this \u201cimage ocean\u201d which photos are important, and who imbues images with meaning \u2013 and how \u2013 remains troubled. Berlin-based Joachim Schmid believes an artist\u2019s mission is to restore order to this chaos. In Other People\u2019s Photographs he collects uninteresting images of everyday life found in flea markets and on photo-sharing sites, organizing them to highlight themes and patterns of amateur photographers. Series like Big Fish, Mugshots and Cleavage mock the categories of conventional photography and propose an alternative history of valuation. This kind of grouping, says Fontcuberta, proposes that \u201cphotographs are inserted in a kind of conversational idea and because of that they\u2019re not important individually, but as they compose a chain, a sequence, like words\u201d. The use of vernacular images runs throughout the festival and reflects the fact that, of the billions of photos we snap each day, the majority depict banal and everyday things, pictures made to be forgotten. Amsterdam-based Erik Kessels recontextualises cast-off images by resituating them within a book, which gives them a significance beyond their creator\u2019s intention. In The World as Will and Representation, Canadian Roy Arden compiles 28,144 found pictures into a dizzying 90-minute video that demonstrates the poetics of chance over the desire for knowledge by classification. American Dina Kelberman\u2019s Torrent stems from her I\u2019m Google project, which unspools a seemingly infinite sequence of photos with similar visual or semantic properties. Like a visual game of telephone, one object slowly morphs through endless variations \u2013 an orange ping-pong ball becomes a molten sphere becomes an egg yolk becomes putty ... The pleasure here stems from the flow of colour and shape, and the moment of seemingly incongruent transformation.     Erik Kessels\u2019s All Yours, from in almost every picture #9, 2011. Photograph: Erik Kessels    Many of the artists at the festival operate through appropriation, though Fontcuberta thinks this term is out of date now the internet has upended the idea of property. Instead, he suggests we use \u201cadoption\u201d, which, in Latin, means to choose or select. Patricians in ancient Rome, he explains, would adopt a child by selecting a poor boy to increase his rank: an example, in his view, of culture triumphing over the nature of origin. \u201cI think that now most artists adopt images because they don\u2019t pretend to be the biological parents, they just pick those images to make them alive in another context. The importance is how we assign meaning. The craft and authorship of the image are no longer relevant issues, which brings us to the crisis of photography.\u201d If image-making is no longer a requirement, if the value of an image\u2019s composition is trumped by the \u201cadopted\u201d, then who is a photographer? Fontcuberta says it doesn\u2019t matter who makes the photos \u2013 humans, CCTV cameras, monkeys. What matters is intention. \u201cMaybe that\u2019s the difference between the artist and the amateur, that the artist is aware of a certain meaning or discourse,\u201d he says. \u201cIn order to have intention we need will. In order to have will we need consciousness, in order to have consciousness we need the human condition. So actually this post-photographic condition is bringing us to the discussion of what is the human condition today?\u201d More than ever, pictures \u2013 of ourselves or the things we want to be associated with \u2013 perform our identity. Spanish artist Laia Abril photographs the selfies that anorexic women post on pro-anorexia websites. By reframing their images, she hones in on what she believes the girls intended to show \u2013 for example, the gap between their thighs rather than their entire bedroom. The result is a warning that social networks and photography are the disease\u2019s new risk factors. They also reveal how we\u2019re always viewing and being viewed through a screen. \u201cIt\u2019s a way to deal with the idea of the window,\u201d says Fontcuberta. \u201cWe look through a window and believe that we are experiencing the world directly but then the glass is broken and we realise that there was something mediating it.\u201d     Leandro Berra, Ariane A, from the series Autoportraits Robots. Photograph: Galerie Univer/Colette Colla    Argentinian Leandro Berra approaches the question of self-identity from another angle. Having fled his home country to France to escape political repression, he wanted to pay homage to his disappeared friends by recreating their likenesses. But he couldn\u2019t remember their faces. This experience later led him to ask acquaintances to make a self-portrait using police facial recreation software. Without aid of a mirror or photo, each individual had to work from only the interior image they had of themselves. From thousands of noses, ears and eyes, they had to select one. The result was a caricature, which Berra pairs with a conventional portrait. The discrepancies between the two reveal the edges of memory, self-knowledge and the failure of self-depiction. Canadian Owen Kydd\u2019s mesmerizing Durational Photographs question where the medium begins and ends.

Removed from the contexts of the past, when the power of images depended upon their display in churches or museums, in magazines, TV and other \u201ccharismatic media\u201d, this flood of banal images has resulted in a lost reverence or solemnity for the photograph, says Fontcuberta. \u201cPhotography has secularized this passion and now we are in a kind of \u2018iconocracy\u2019 in the sense that it\u2019s a power regime in which images are playing a role but we have the way to react more critically because we are also image makers, not only consumers.\u201d Despite his previous failure, Fontcuberta will still speculate on how the post-photographic condition could evolve. \u201cDigital photographs have no body, are everywhere and nowhere at the same time, and because of that they are very close to mental images.

But English language YA contemporary stories disproportionately take place in the US and, to a lesser extent, the UK, and those few that are set in other countries are often told through the lens of a newcomer rather than an actual native, which can detract from the cultural authenticity of the book.  When you ask for YA contemporary novels set outside of Anglo-America, what you\u2019re likely to get is a flurry of stories about upper-middle-class Americans or Brits who move halfway across the world and suffer from extreme culture shock. Although there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with that, those narratives can get tiring \u2013 and, in some cases, problematic \u2013 pretty quickly.          Below, I\u2019ve compiled seven geographically diverse contemporary YA novels that I believe will appeal to any teen reader, and will provide a fascinating glimpse into the lives of teenagers throughout the world. A Time to Dance by Padma Venkatraman          When Veda, a bharatanatyam dancer, is injured in a car crash that results in the amputation of one of her legs, she is determined not to give up the dance that she loves, even if it means struggling through beginner classes. Weaving together Veda\u2019s relationships with her family, her body, and her new dance teacher, A Time To Dance is an exploration of culture and spirituality set in Chennai, India. If You Could Be Mine by Sara Farizan          Sahar and Nasrin, two Iranian girls, have been in love since childhood. But when Nasrin\u2019s parents announce that they\u2019ve found Nasrin a suitor, Sahar, desperate to be the one to marry Nasrin, turns to the possibility of a sex change (which, unlike homosexuality, is legal in Iran). A fascinating glimpse into LGBT life in Iran, If You Could Be Mine follows Sahar as she struggles to decide whether being with Nasrin is worth sacrificing who she really is. Coconut by Kopano Matlwa Set in South Africa, Coconut is a dual point-of-view novel following two black girls: Ofilwe, who has grown up wealthy and feels she has lost her culture, and Fiks, who is hoping to drown her tragic past in the bright lights of Johannesburg. The novel, above all, explores the concept of being a \u201ccoconut\u201d (the equivalent of an \u201coreo\u201d in the west) \u2013 a person of colour who is seen, often through the lens of stereotypes, as rejecting their culture.          Swimming in the Monsoon Sea by Shyam Selvadurai Ever since the death of his parents, Amrith has lived with his foster mother and father in a wealthy part of Sri Lanka. Told against the backdrop of Othello, the school play for which Amrith is auditioning, Swimming in the Monsoon Sea follows Amrith as he falls for a Canadian boy who comes to town \u2013 setting off a wave of confusion about himself and his identity. Though it\u2019s technically set in 1980, this novel has so many contemporary YA themes that I\u2019m including it anyway!          Wildlife by Fiona Wood In keeping with its title, Fiona Wood\u2019s second novel explores something that YA novels rarely focus on: wildlife. Set at an Australian high school\u2019s outdoor education program, in which students live in harmony with nature for a term, the novel is told through the points of view of two girls navigating grief, friendships (both positive and toxic), and \u2013 yes \u2013 camping. Wildlife also boasts a cast of flawed and above all realistic teen characters and honest portrayals of sex. The Secret Sky by Atia Abawi          Fatima and Samiullah have been friends since childhood. Separated by culture, Fatima, a Hazara girl and a farmer\u2019s daughter, is forbidden from seeing Sami, a wealthy Pashtun, once Sami returns after a three-year stint being educated in his religion. Told in three points of view, The Secret Sky is a searingly honest story of forbidden love set in a remote, Taliban-controlled village in contemporary Afghanistan. Street Dreams by Tama Wise          Growing up in a poverty-stricken neighborhood in Auckland, New Zealand, Tyson works late nights to keep his family afloat. But when he realises that he\u2019s gay, he feels a deep isolation. Looking around the local hip hop community in which he is involved, as well as in Auckland itself, he struggles to find anyone else like him. Yet, as a M\u0101ori boy, he\u2019s also alienated by New Zealand\u2019s predominantly white gay community. Navigating friendships, maybe-unrequited love, and Tyson\u2019s dreams of making art for a living, Street Dreams is a much-needed addition to the world of LGBTQ+ literature.

He was a source of joy in an era of severe decline, one which saw the club relegated twice in two years and left amid the muck and nettles of England\u2019s third tier. They were the worst of times but from 1995-1998 the fans at least had \u2018the Georgian Maradona\u2019, a midfielder whose impact was such that when he departed to Ajax, some of those who had watched him light up Maine Road simply could not let go. They had to see him, to speak to him, to sing about him, at least one more time. \u201cThe Prestwich and Whitefield City supporters club branch had organised a trip over to Amsterdam to take in an Ajax game and invited Kinkladze to meet them in a bar on the Damstraat, which to everyone\u2019s surprise he did,\u201d remembers the football writer and City fan Simon Curtis. \u201cHe turned up as casual as you like and spent the night playing pool and signing everything from clogs to beer bellies. \u201cI was living in Alkmaar at the time and remember sitting with Georgi on one of the pool tables chatting away about how much he missed City. He\u2019d had various problems settling in at Ajax and things weren\u2019t working out for him very well. Meanwhile, the whole place was swamped by deafening songs of praise. It was a great night and showed the humility of the guy.\u201d     Kinkladze looks to escape the attentions of Barry Venison and Mark Walters. Photograph: Action Images    Life at Ajax indeed proved difficult for Kinkladze. He joined for \u00a34.9m in the summer of 1998 and appeared a perfect fit for a club whose reputation was built around highly technical, creative footballers. But Kinkladze was unable to settle and flourish in his new surroundings. As David Winner outlines in Brilliant Orange: The Neurotic Genius of Dutch Football: \u201cKinkladze didn\u2019t understand the Ajax system. He was baffled and alienated by the Dutch and their ugly, incomprehensible guttural language. Within a year he was utterly depressed, his only comfort watching videos with his countryman Shota Arveladze.\u201d It was all a far cry from the sense of belonging Kinkladze felt at City having arrived in July 1995 during the first modern wave of deliciously talented foreign players into English football. Six months earlier Tony Yeboah had joined Leeds, while three months later Middlesbrough welcomed Juninho. Meanwhile at Tottenham, it had not been long since Ilie Dumitrescu and J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann had arrived and helped form Ossie Ardiles\u2019s wild and ultimately doomed \u2018famous five\u2019. Then, of course, there was Dennis Bergkamp, who joined Arsenal in June 1995, and Eric Cantona, who by then was the king of Old Trafford. They were exciting, they were new, they had unusual sounding names and in the case of Kinkladze, appeared to have come out of nowhere. He actually arrived from Dinamo Tbilisi for \u00a32m \u2013 via loan spells at FC Saarbr\u00fccken in Germany and Boca Juniors in Argentina \u2013 after being spotted by City\u2019s then-chairman Francis Lee. Given Kinkladze only left Tbilisi in the first place due to the civil war that ravaged Georgia after independence from the Soviet Union, it was perhaps no surprise he suffered homesickness after moving to Manchester. But the arrival of his mother, Khatuna, just before Christmas 1995 helped him settle in the city and thrive for his new team.   Related: Golden goal: Matt Le Tissier for Southampton v Newcastle (1993)    He was unspectacular in appearance \u2013 small and squat, baggy in shirt and scruffy in hair \u2013 but the signs that Kinkladze was a player blessed with incredible balance, skill, pace and purpose, had been evident before his mum landed, most consistently during a run of four wins and a draw in November. But it was what Kinkladze did against Southampton at Maine Road four months later that secured his status as a creative talent of the highest order and the new darling of the Kippax. It is 16 March 1996, and in the 37th minute of a crucial encounter between two teams fighting for survival, City\u2019s No7 collects a pass from Steve Lomas just inside the opposition\u2019s half. He is close to the right-hand touchline and up against Simon Charlton. The Southampton full-back\u2019s body shape makes it clear that he wants to push Kinkladze wide, but the man in possession has other ideas and with a drop of the shoulder and a rapid shift in weight, he drives infield. The home crowd roar in anticipation; they can feel something special is on. It doesn\u2019t appear that way, however, when Kinkladze reaches the edge of the area and as well as having to deal with Charlton grappling with his right shoulder in a desperate attempt to rescue the situation, is faced by two more players, not to mention the towering presence of Dave Beasant in the goal. Cue the sexy bit.            Kinkladze skips past Ken Monkou with the ease of a man avoiding a piece of litter on the street and then once inside the Southampton area, does the same to the sprawling David Hughes, who rather strangely had run across Kinkladze in his initial attempt to halt the Georgian. With Beasant only to beat, he then dinks the ball over the goalkeeper and into the back of the net with his left foot. Nine seconds from start to finish, four players beaten and one beautiful goal scored. \u201cIt was impossibly impudent, impossibly cool headed,\u201d says Curtis, who was at Maine Road that Saturday afternoon. \u201cI remember the euphoria at seeing such a breathtaking goal and watching the little man run to the Platt Lane end beckoning, as if to say, \u2018come and join the celebrations\u2019. It was a magical moment.\u201d Two things in particular stand out about the goal. The first is the command of possession Kinkladze displayed. It\u2019s a clich\u00e9 to say the ball appeared stuck to his feet, but not once does it drift or deviate as he dribbles forward, holds off Charlton, glides inside Monkou and then around Hughes\u2019s legs. The control is magnetic and utterly remarkable. The second is the finish. One-on-one with Beasant, it would have been easy for Kinkladze to simply smash the ball past the keeper, but instead he dummies to shoot twice and waits for the man in front of him to collapse on to his knees so he can lift the ball over him. His message to Beasant was clear: \u201cI\u2019m going to make a dickhead out of you here, son.\u201d It\u2019s often forgotten that Kinkladze beat the former England goalkeeper twice that day, with his first goal coming five minutes before the second via a tap-in from close range after Beasant had failed to hold on to Nigel Clough\u2019s shot. Paul Tisdale pulled one back for Southampton on 64 minutes but it proved to be a consolation and City ultimately secured victory in a match their manager, Alan Ball, had described prior to kick-off as the most important since his arrival from Southampton the previous summer. The win moved City up to 15th but they still ended up going down in bizarre circumstances following a 2-2 draw with Liverpool on the final day of the season. In truth the campaign had been a disaster from the start, with the team failing to win any of their opening 11 fixtures and failing to convince thereafter. The only real highlight was Kinkladze, who in terms of raw talent was several levels above his team-mates. Quite frankly, seeing him play alongside the likes of Lomas, Garry Flitcroft and Ian Brightwell was akin to seeing Jimi Hendrix jam with Toploader. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long after Georgi arrived for us to recognise we had a naturally gifted footballer in our ranks. He was an out and out match winner,\u201d remembers Keith Curle, City\u2019s captain at the time. \u201cOff the pitch he was very shy, very unassuming, and someone who didn\u2019t enjoy the limelight. But on it he came alive. We used to call him \u2018Happy Feet\u2019 because he always seemed happiest when he had a ball at his feet.   Related: Golden Goal: Ian Wright for Arsenal v Leeds United (1995) | Rob Smyth    \u201cThe goal against Southampton didn\u2019t surprise me because I\u2019d seen Georgi do that type of thing in training all the time. In fact, he did it so regularly that after a while our defenders stopped committing to a challenge when he had the ball because they knew he could and would make a fool out of them. He had an ability to quickly change direction, exceptional vision and a wand of a left foot. And you saw all of that in that goal.\u201d Curle\u2019s affection for Kinkladze is obvious but he says there was also resentment within City\u2019s ranks regarding how the player was excused by Ball of any defensive duties, something which \u201cdisrupted the ethos of a team built around 10 outfield players working hard for 90 minutes\u201d. \u201cI remember losing away to Arsenal that season and one of the goals we conceded came because Georgi hadn\u2019t tracked a runner,\u201d adds Curle, currently the manager at Carlisle. \u201cThe lads were not happy and some said as much to the manager after the game. In reply, he told them that if they were as talented as Georgi they wouldn\u2019t have to track back either. \u201cAlan adored Georgi and gave him the responsibility of being our matchwinner. He told him to not worry about defending and instead concentrate on finding space when the opposition had the ball and being prepared to attack once we won it back. He\u2019d had a similar approach with Matt Le Tissier at Southampton and Matt flourished. Alan\u2019s feeling was that Georgi could do the same at City.\u201d            And that he did, providing heavenly moments during a season of hell for City\u2019s supporters \u2013as well as seeing their side relegated they also had to endure the sight of Manchester United winning a second Premier League and FA Cup double in two years. And their love for \u2018Kinky\u2019 was cemented after he decided to stay at the club, only leaving once they had endured yet another drop down the divisions. \u201cKinkladze produced the same level of brilliance at the lower level, scoring marvellous goals at Oxford and Southend and a giant end to end slalom verses Leicester in the Cup that is still etched on the memory,\u201d adds Curtis. \u201cIf only he had been around in today\u2019s City side. People would have recognised the true genius of Giorgi Kinkladze.\u201d It is something of travesty that the midfielder\u2019s career tailed off after he left Maine Road. After struggling at Ajax he joined Derby County, first on loan and then on a long-term deal. But back in England Kinkladze could not recreate the magic of old, and following a spell at Rubin Kazan he retired in 2006. Kinkladze could have become a great of European football. Ball, for one, was in doubt of his talents, describing him as \u201cthe best player to ever come out of Eastern Europe\u201d. But the Georgian will always have those three years at City, and in particular that goal against Southampton, when he gave a club on its knees a reason to stand tall and feel good about itself. As Joe Royle, the City manager who sold Kinkladze to Ajax, put it in his autobiography: \u201cI wasn\u2019t blind to what lay behind our supporters\u2019 worship at the throne of King Kinky. In the long dark days at Maine Road he was a shining beacon who lit up the gloom with his flashes of genius.\u201d", "sentences": ["\u201cThe Prestwich and Whitefield City supporters club branch had organised a trip over to Amsterdam to take in an Ajax game and invited Kinkladze to meet them in a bar on the Damstraat, which to everyone\u2019s surprise he did,\u201d remembers the football writer and City fan Simon Curtis."], "title": "Golden Goal: Georgi Kinkladze for Manchester City v Southampton (1996) | Sachin Nakrani", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/sep/17/golden-goal-georgi-kinkladze-southampton", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-09-17T11:54:48Z", "article": "Tourists don\u2019t have the best reputation when it comes to cycling around Amsterdam.

In Madrid, authorities promised to find a black person to play the role of Balthazar in this year\u2019s post-Christmas three kings cavalcade, putting an end to a nearly four-decade tradition for the city\u2019s biggest street parade. \u201cThis change is much more than just anecdotal,\u201d Socialist city councillor Mar Espinar said on Wednesday. Her party has spent years championing changes to the event. \u201cGiven the increasingly large community of colour in our city, it seems absurd that this role continues to be represented by a person with their face blackened.\u201d  In recent years, various groups across Spain have joined in the push for change, including the more than 60,000 people who signed a petition last year urging Madrid city council to drop the practice. \u201cIt is senseless and unnecessary in this day and age for king Balthazar to be a white man painted black,\u201d argued the petition. Over in the Dutch capital of The Hague meanwhile, the education board said elementary schools would no longer use Santa helpers with painted black faces, another holiday tradition that had caused considerable offence.  The move, which came after the United Nations called last month for the \u201cBlack Pete\u201d practice to be modified to avoid reflecting negative stereotypes, is the broadest measure against the practice, and will affect more than 160 schools, Reuters reported.  A majority of Dutch people reject any suggestion that Black Pete, typically played by white people in blackface, is racist. But many others disagree. Starting this year, schools in The Hague will begin phasing out the use of blackface, curly hair wigs and red painted lips, with the changes to be completed within three years. They will be replaced with visually neutral Santa servants.  In the past Madrid city council, led by conservative People\u2019s party mayor Ana Botella, had argued that the Spanish capital\u2019s tradition was not rooted in racism but sheer necessity. Since the country\u2019s return to democracy after the death of Franco, the city has used local politicians to play the role of the kings. \u201cIf there was a black councillor then we would have a black king,\u201d Botella explained to reporters.  With the recent election of mayor Manuela Carmena and her leftist coalition Ahora Madrid, those pushing for change found a more receptive council.  \u201cThis Christmas, the cavalcade of the three kings will be a bit more natural in Madrid,\u201d the city said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cIn a nod to the integration and acceptance of the diversity that increasingly characterises Madrid, King Balthazar will be represented this year by a black person rather than someone characterised as such.\u201d Madrid joins a growing list of Spanish municipalities who have taken action to address the controversial practice. But campaigners continue to push for changes across the country, in cities likes Almer\u00eda and Pamplona, or in Marbella, where retired Dutch footballer Ruud Van Nistelrooy made international headlines in 2013 after posting a photo of himself onTwitter painted black to play the role of Balthazar as he visited a local hospital. Black Pete, typically played by white people in blackface, has become the focus of heated debate in the Netherlands. A majority of the Dutch reject any suggestion that the tradition is racist, but opponents say it is offensive. Starting this year, schools in The Hague will begin phasing out the use of blackface, curly hair wigs and red painted lips, with the changes to be completed within three years. They will be replaced with visually neutral Santa servants.  Many European winter gift-giving celebrations include a dark-faced sidekick accompanying Saint Nicolas. The appearance of Black Pete is usually attributed to a popular book published in the mid-1800s.  About 6% percent of the Dutch population is of African or Afro-Caribbean descent, a legacy in part of the country\u2019s colonial history.

It lies close to the \u201cBalti triangle\u201d in Birmingham, a city whose reputation has taken a battering in recent years, thanks to the so-called Trojan Horse scandal (which saw allegations that some Birmingham state schools were being taken over by hardline Muslims who were undermining headteachers), and the outlandish claim on Fox News that it was a no-go area for non-Muslims. But something in the densely packed rows of terrace houses, shopping streets of fast-food outlets and sequin-strewn Asian fashion shops has attracted everyone from David Cameron to David Blunkett, from Jack Straw to Iain Duncan Smith. The answer lies in a little wooden building on St Paul\u2019s Road. Surrounded by a green oasis of flower beds, vegetable patches and greenhouses is the Balsall Heath forum, the heart of a community with ambitious plans. Inside the cabin, which looks like a cross between an Alpine chalet and a garden shed, is a collection of local people, from teenagers to pensioners, whose community spirit is said to be the inspiration of Cameron\u2019s ill-fated Big Society.  But while the government may have quietly dropped their buzzword, in this corner of Birmingham, it has stepped up a gear. Alongside the litter picks, youth awards, interfaith celebrations and food banks that are the forum\u2019s day-to-day work, they are fighting to ensure the needs of people living in the deprived streets are met with tailor-made services. The latest skirmish in this battle is a referendum of the 15,000 residents to push through a neighbourhood development plan.    When I said I was from Balsall Heath, everyone shrank back as though I had a disease  Raja Amin        \u2018A green oasis of flower beds, vegetable patches and greenhouses\u2019 \u2026 Balsall Heath forum.  Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian    Brought in under the 2011 Localism Act, the plan will set the development agenda for the 2km sq area for the next 20 years, allowing people who live there to decide how the land around them is used. While other similar schemes have been voted in across the country, Balsall Heath is said to be the first in an urban area to go to a referendum \u2013 a testament to the kind of collective activism more often associated with villages. Over a cup of tea, Raja Amin, one of the forum\u2019s original founders, explains how it was not always like this. In the late 80s, high unemployment, gangs and a spiralling crime rate made living in Balsall Heath frightening, he tells me. The area was known as \u201cLittle Amsterdam\u201d because of its reputation as a red-light district, with almost 500 women working in a four mile radius \u2013 many in \u201cwindow displays\u201d. \u201cGangs were saying they ran the street,\u201d says Amin. \u201cDrug dealers were sitting around on corners from 10am to 4am \u2026 No one wanted to admit to being from Balsall Heath. I remember being on a plane and I sat down between a man from Alum Rock and one from Handsworth,\u201d he says. \u201cWe got chatting and were laughing at the fact we were all from Birmingham, but I kid you not, when I said I was from Balsall Heath, they all shrank back as though I had a disease.\u201d The police seemed incapable of making a dent in the neighborhood\u2019s problems, and the families living there grew increasingly scared and frustrated. Abdullah Rehman, the chief executive of the forum, who grew up in Balsall Heath where his dad ran a local supermarket, says things went from bad to worse when crack cocaine swept through the area. \u201cMy customers got more vicious,\u201d he says. \u201cOne of the [working] girls, Samo Paull, was murdered.

Photograph: Nick Hedges/National Media Museum, Bradford    \u201cThis was the place to come \u2013 for drugs, guns or women. One thing I can never get out of my mind is seeing a pregnant woman being hit on the street because she hadn\u2019t earned enough for her pimp. It became fight or flight. We were getting nowhere with the police: they said they were spending \u00a3350,000 a year on the vice squad and what more could they do? The council said, \u2018If you don\u2019t like it, leave\u2019, but of course we couldn\u2019t because our houses were worthless.\u201d Finally, Raja Amin had enough. A British Rail union representative, he, along with five or six other local men, started standing outside their homes with placards demanding change. They noted down the number plates of the kerb crawlers and held posters reading, \u201cYour wife will find out\u201d, hoping to shame them out of the area. The word spread and soon whole streets were turning out to help, he says.  \u201cWe called it the Balsall Heath pickets: from the union, we knew about strikes, but really it was a street watch.\u201d Support from the local churches, mosques, synagogues and gurdwaras soon followed and, Rehman says, within six months, the crime rate had dropped.  But it was what happened next that really changed things, says Rehman. To capitalise on the new-found community cohesion, the forum was set up in 1994 by sociologist Dick Atkinson. Now with six paid employees as well as more than 500 volunteers, it runs micro residents group, all attended by local police and council officers. \u201cPeople want to contribute more when they are included and treated as part of the solution not the problem,\u201d says Rehman. The picketers, meanwhile, have been transformed into street wardens, who work to improve the local environment, and there are partnerships with more than 50 local groups, with initiatives covering everything from social welfare projects visiting elderly residents to training and employment. By 2008, a survey showed 70% of those in Balsall Heath felt they could influence what happened in their area, and 86% of Balsall Heath\u2019s ethnically mixed population (said to be 57% Asian, 24% white and 10% black) said they felt people with different backgrounds got on well together. A huge 89% felt satisfied with their local area. Local people speak with pride about the fact that more people are moving into the area than are moving out, and with evident astonishment that it is now seen as a \u201cdesirable\u201d area.    We called it the Balsall Heath pickets\u200b, but really it was a street watch. Within six months, the crime rate had dropped  Abdullah Rehman        David Blunkett talks with neighbourhood warden Adbul Hamid during a visit to Balsall Heath. Photograph: David Jones    The turnaround has brought politicians to Balsall Heath, keen to learn the lessons of their community cohesion \u2013 or at least bask in its reflected glory. In 2001, Blunkett arrived, while David Cameron has been a repeat visitor, staying in Rehman\u2019s house and mentioning him in his speeches.  But the development plan, say the forum members, will improve the area even further. Architect Joe Holyoak, who has spent three years putting it together, says: \u201cUnder the old system, when planning officers make plans, they consulted local people,\u201d he says. \u201cBut the planners and local politicians had the ultimate responsibility. Now that is entirely with the community. \u201cFor instance, one of things that came up again and again were the parks. There are seven and they are very well used, because this is an intensively residential area with a high proportion of children. But they have been under invested in.\u201d But there are also more ambitious items: a railway station for Balsall Heath, a transformation of the the local river \u2013 currently blocked off by concrete walls and fences \u2013 and a new town square.    Related: How community-led renovation is helping a rundown Pittsburgh neighbourhood fight crime    For Luke Holland, it is the plan\u2019s youth hub that is the most exciting prospect. The 18-year-old, who this April stood in the local elections in a bid to become the country\u2019s youngest councillor, tells me there are few places for young people to socialise in the area. He was hoping the local council would pass a motion to allow 16-year-olds to vote in the referendum on the development plan. But while the motion was passed, it was too late to implement it for the referendum, and instead, Holland will be arranging a shadow referendum for those under 18 on 8 September, ahead of the main referendum on 8 October. \u201cBirmingham is the UK\u2019s youngest city,\u201d he tells me seriously. \u201cAbout 42% of our inhabitants are aged between 16 and 26, but young people\u2019s voices are neglected.Having this mock vote would indicate to the city \u2013 and the country \u2013 that young people care about where they live.\u201d  Anywhere else, it may seem strange to hear a teenager speak so passionately about planning law, but after a morning spent in the forum, I am no longer surprised. \u201cThis is my city and it rips me apart when I hear it maligned,\u201d says Holland. \u201cWhen people think of Birmingham, they think of things such as the Trojan Horse scandal, but the Forum shows the best of the city and the best of its diversity.

All have commissioned theme tunes from German baton-twiddler Michael Kadelbach, with his latest offering set to be premiered before tonight\u2019s games. \u201cFans feature prominently,\u201d report Uefa of the new composition, which was unavailable for the Fiver\u2019s critical appraisal this afternoon but we are told features a \u201ccatchy, melodic theme\u201d that \u201cprovides limitless energy and excitement\u201d and \u201cproduces a \u2018togetherness\u2019 feeling\u201d, all of which sounds both brilliant if true and extraordinarily unlikely. Anyway, those fans, Uefa continue, \u201cprovide the underlying rhythm through the sound of their hands clapping, aiming to provide true consistency between broadcast coverage and the live stadium experience\u201d. Though, if that was really what they were after, they should probably have included a smattering of boos at half-time. Uefa blowing the trumpet for their own tune (which may or may not feature trumpets, we wouldn\u2019t know, though we wouldn\u2019t be at all surprised) was perhaps a little over-the-top but wasn\u2019t the only unlikely pre-kick-off claim. According to the Google translation of Qarabag\u2019s news story reporting their team\u2019s arrival in London on Wednesday ahead of tonight\u2019s match against Spurs, the Azeri aces\u2019 sojourn got off to an unpleasant start. \u201cAfter a five-hour flight,\u201d they report, \u201cour team was laid to rest after dinner.\u201d Crikey. A tragedy, and one that places Tottenham\u2019s own lasagne-gate furore of 2006 in some kind of context. Anyway, Qarabag\u2019s bravehearts having somehow got over that, today Spurs hope they will be put to bed before half-time.  There\u2019s no historical precedent to encourage such confidence, no Azeri club side ever having played a competitive game against an English team (though if you count friendlies 2011\u2019s Barnet 1-0 Qabala doesn\u2019t exactly provoke a lot of optimism for the away side). The ability of English footballers to clinically mastermind the failure of Azerbaijan\u2019s top clubs was proven during Tony Adams\u2019 18-month spell in the country, during which he led the aforementioned Qabala to a humiliating eighth place in the Premyer Liqasi (as well as that friendly defeat at Barnet). Qarabag, known as The Horsemen to their friends because of the two horses on their club crest (either that or they have two horses on their club crest because they\u2019re known as the Horsemen, the Fiver can\u2019t be entirely sure) and Qabala are the only Q-commencing teams in European competition this season. If this suggests a surfeit of imaginative Azeri nomenclators evidence to the contrary comes in the shape of the manager, Gurban Gurbanov (literally: Gurban son of Gurban) and midfielder Gara Garayev (literally: Gara who belongs to Gara), even if they no longer boast Muarem Muarem, the Macedonian mainstay of their midfield who moved to Eskisehirspor in Turkey over the summer.

Its announcement came hours after a final ruling from the European court of justice opened the floodgates for compensation claims against airlines that could run into hundreds of millions of pounds.  Individuals will be able to claim as much as \u20ac600 (\u00a3437) a head after the court said airlines must pay out if flights are delayed or cancelled for \u201ctechnical reasons\u201d. Thousands of claims made by passengers of Ryanair, Flybe, Thomas Cook, Jet2 and WizzAir were put on hold pending the outcome of the ruling, which involved Dutch airline KLM. Once the judgment was handed down, the UK\u2019s Civil Aviation Authority revealed it had already been reviewing Ryanair\u2019s compliance with European consumer law, and had concluded that it was \u201cnot satisfied\u201d with the way the airline was handling compensation claims for disruption caused by routine technical faults. The CAA said that because Ryanair was not complying with the law, it was taking enforcement action to ensure UK passengers were protected - and it warned that if the airline did not change its policy, court action could follow.  Thursday\u2019s ruling concerned a flight from Quito in Ecuador to Amsterdam taken in 2009 by passenger Corina van der Lans, which was delayed by 29 hours. Her claim for compensation was rejected after KLM argued it could not be held responsible for technical problems that emerged just before take off.  Most airlines, particularly budget carriers, have routinely rejected claims from passengers seeking compensation until the outcome of the KLM case.  The court ruled: \u201cThe airline must ensure the maintenance and proper functioning of all aircrafts used for commercial activities. No component of an aircraft is indestructible; these situations are inherent in the normal operations of an airline. Therefore, when a flight is cancelled due to unforeseen technical errors, the airline remains obliged to pay compensation to its passengers.\u201d  Compensation lawyers said they will now go back to court with thousands of cases rejected by budget airlines.  Kevin Clarke, flight delay lawyer with solicitors Bott &amp; Co, said it had 15,000 cases pending against airlines, with Ryanair making up the largest group. \u201cWe brought clarity to the law when we won the case of Huzar v Jet2. Technical issues are not extraordinary; they are claimable.    Related: Flight delay claims could soar after court ruling    \u201cThe fact that the same issue has had to go to the European court of justice despite the [UK] supreme court ruling shows the lengths the airline industry will go to to avoid paying out on valid claims. Fortunately the courts have once again ruled in favour of consumers \u2013 we\u2019re delighted with this outcome.\u201d Under the EU compensation rules, passengers whose flight is cancelled or arrives more than three hours late can claim \u20ac250-\u20ac600 depending on the distance of the flight. The compensation applies to flights departing from any EU airport or arriving in the EU with an EU carrier or one from Iceland, Norway or Switzerland. Ryanair said: \u201cRyanair notes today\u2019s decision in the KLM case and will continue to comply with the EU261 legislation. Since less than half of 1% of Ryanair flights are delayed by over three hours, this ruling will have less effect on Ryanair than any other airline.\u201d Commenting on the CAA\u2019s move, he said the airline was unsure why enforcement action was being threatened when Ryanair was complying fully with EU 261 regulations.  Passengers seeking compensation may still face a battle for compensation. Airlines frequently cite \u201cadverse weather conditions\u201d, which allows them to legally sidestep claims. However, determined travellers have later proved there were no weather problems.  Airlines are now likely to shift to a separate defence to reject compensation claims, claiming that the technical fault was actually a \u201chidden manufacturing defect\u201d. This also allows them to legally sidestep claims, although lawyers say that when cases reach court the airline is usually unable to supply adequate proof.   \u201cApproximately 79% of the claims are immediately rejected, yet when we take a claim to court we win 98% of the time, even in the case of technical errors,\u201d said Raymond Veldkamp of the claims firm Flight-Delayed.  But he added: \u201cThis judgment still leaves room for interpretation and as we\u2019ve seen with previous smaller judgments, airlines are incredibly creative.\u201d", "sentences": ["Thursday\u2019s ruling concerned a flight from Quito in Ecuador to Amsterdam taken in 2009 by passenger Corina van der Lans, which was delayed by 29 hours."], "title": "UK airline regulator to force Ryanair to pay flight delay compensation", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/sep/17/european-court-ruling-boosts-flight-delay-compensation-claims", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Air transport", "Business", "World news", "Law", "Consumer rights", "Money", "Court of justice of the European Union", "Europe", "Ryanair", "Thomas Cook", "Travel & leisure"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-09-18T13:00:11Z", "article": "In June this year I found myself sitting in the office of a small apartment in a suburban street of a dormitory town close to Munich. The owner was a large man and he could barely squeeze behind his desk. It was a very orderly space \u2013 family photographs arrayed carefully, a bookcase of tabulated journals and files. A glass case stretched along the whole wall containing models of deer and dogs and figurines, 18th-century soldiers, a shelf of vessels, vases and bowls, a chess set. They were made a mile away and this man was a collector and dealer. He sells this Allach Porzellan, he says, to Russians and Americans. There is a serious market for porcelain made by slave labour in the Dachau concentration camp. He was particularly proud of the chess set that had belonged to Heinrich Himmler. Its gilding was finer than any he had encountered before. It is not for sale. But I could buy the porcelain model of the fresh-faced Hitler Youth banging his drum, eyes on the future, noisy. Or the alsatian dog, or the plate celebrating the winter solstice inscribed with words of exhortation, crocuses pushing upwards through snowy earth, or the medallions for SS sports competitions. He likes this porcelain, he tells me, because it is very well made. Porcelain is a very good German material. It has history. Above all, he repeats to me, it is pure. I had not expected a journey to discover what porcelain meant to me \u2013 my midlife attempt to work out why I had been working with it for 30 years \u2013 to bring me to this place. I had mapped out my pilgrimage to the white hills of China, where the raw materials were first found, and the hills of Saxony, where the secrets of porcelain were uncovered by a philosopher and an alchemist in the early 18th century. And to the hills of the south-west of England, where a Quaker apothecary worked out the arcanum by himself and changed the landscape of Cornwall. I thought that I understood the purity of porcelain and its attraction for so many people \u2013 to the point of obsession \u2013 for a thousand years. Porcelain comes from China. It was so rare, so arcane in medieval Europe, that to drink from porcelain was supposed to prevent poison. The story of its travels, of its trade, is one of desire. There are very few materials in the world that embody such a strong transformational pull from earth to something that is so light, translucent, so fine that it rings as clear as a bell. It is alchemy. But there is nothing simple about simplicity. Desire and power, in conjunction with purity, comes at a great cost. *** On my voyage into porcelain, I come across a reference to one of my favourite designers from the Bauhaus and his work for the Allach porcelain factory. As I don\u2019t know it \u2013 there is a plenitude of German factories \u2013 I\u2019m intrigued and buy a book on this Allach Porzellan. It arrives a week later, a small black hardback with a photo of a porcelain statue of Athena on the front. It is in English, published by Tony L Oliver, from a suburban street in Egham, Surrey, in 1970. \u201cThe unique circumstances that prevailed in Germany \u2026 made it possible for the very best artists, designers, potters, and all persons associated with the manufacture of fine porcelain, to be taken from the many world-famous factories that existed in Germany at that time, such as Dresden, Berlin, Rosenthal etc, and employed at the previously unknown factory at Allach. It was this unique concentration of talent made available for its production that enabled Allach porcelain to be of such a high quality, and consequently highly desirable \u2026\u201d The back flap lists books and colour postcards of uniforms of the SS. I open it up and illustration No 1 is a photograph of Hitler and Reichsf\u00fchrer-SS H Himmler \u201cexamining, with apparent approval, a selection of Allach porcelain figures\u201d in 1943. The figures look like 18th-century Meissen. Hitler is smiling, avid. Concentration of talent is a hard phrase. They were made in the camp at Dachau. The story began in 1935 at Lindenstrasse 8 in Allach, a suburb to the north west of Munich, with three committed members of the SS: the painter Franz Nagy, a sculptor, Theodor K\u00e4rner, and an artist, Karl Diebitsch. They built a small factory attached to a suburban villa. The plan was to create porcelain worthy of the Nazi party.     A large bivouac bowl and its original box Photograph: Alamy    The plan quickly came to the notice of Himmler, who arranged for a substantial capital infusion of 45,000 Reichsmarks from his personal office. The PMA, the Porzellan Manufaktur Allach, was founded. Himmler believed in art for every German home, but \u201cfirst of all in the homes of my SS men\u201d. Having his own porcelain factory would give him control, allow him to show off his cultural reach, raise money for the causes he held dear. One of these, the \u201cGerman Winter Relief\u201d, the official NSDAP charity founded by Hitler after he was appointed chancellor, had enormous kudos in the party. The slogan for 1938 was \u201c20 million porcelain soldiers on the march\u201d, as Allach sold porcelain soldiers and little porcelain badges with soldiers on them to raise money for impoverished loyal citizens of the Reich. It was the week of the Anschluss, when German soldiers marched across the border into Austria to be met by delirious crowds. *** Having your own porcelain factory allowed you to give gifts. In Himmler\u2019s SS there were interminable rites of gift giving. Alfred Rosenberg, the theoretician of the party, was hard at work creating new rituals, new arcana to embed the people in their culture. Christmas became Julfest, an ersatz Nordic winter celebration, with sacred fire and candles and music. So Allach made Julleuchter \u2013 yule lanterns \u2013 to sit on the festive tables and glow as the family celebrated the new year, the new start for their country. Birthdays and weddings and the birth of a child to SS members all warranted presents of Allach porcelain. And there were porcelain bowls for presentation at the party rallies at Nuremberg, sporting medals, plaques to celebrate the Anschluss, a presentation vase to Hitler for his 50th birthday in 1939, huge white vases for the niches of the Chancellery. Who could have foreseen such demand for porcelain?    Birthdays, and weddings and the birth of a child to SS members all warranted presents of Allach porcelain    The factory in Allach became too small, and at the end of 1940 it moved to Dachau concentration camp. There were many advantages of having the factory here. There was the immediate gain of using the prisoners. The Allach porcelain company \u2013 as with the porcelain manufactory in Meissen \u2013 was losing skilled workers to the eastern front, and here they could draw on the talents of inmates. The few prisoners brought in from the camp in 1941 grew to over a hundred by 1943. And so Himmler had his own factory that he could bring his fellow SS officers to, walk along the benches, peer over the prisoners\u2019 shoulders and inquire and inspect. When they visited Dachau, the factory was the first place on the tour. There was a visitors\u2019 book. And there were photographs. There they all are, picking up figurines, comparing things. They turn them over, and underneath is the mark that says Allach, and the symbol is the double-lightning insignia of the SS. Cleverly, it is also the Meissen mark of the two swords transposed. It was a company that was run with precision. The accounts were accurate. The numbers of the figures are filed meticulously. Himmler took 45% of the output of the factory. And in 1942, when there was a typhoid epidemic among the prisoners in Dachau, Himmler asked for payment for those who died. Himmler wanted his Allach to make objects that were k\u00fcnstlerisch wertvolle \u2013 artistically worthwhile \u2013 not degenerating into kitsch. Deutsch sein heist klar sein, said Hitler. \u201cTo be German is to be clear.\u201d To be clear is to be skilled and to tell stories well, not to obfuscate. Degenerate art is unskilled, merely sketched, inept. It is unclear. Hitler knew what he wanted. He wanted to see skill. So Allach created a porcelain stallion, leaping upwards, tail flowing, powerful and independent, a leader. And Hitler, having seen what Allach was capable of, ordered the special production of a hundred figures of Frederick the Great on horseback. He kept one in his office in the Chancellery. He gave the others to those who had impressed him with their dedication to the purity of the Reich. *** Look at the modelling on the porcelain bears, the stags and does and fawns, the fox cubs, dachshunds and alsatians. The puppies are so expressive. The Reclining Stag by Professor T K\u00e4rner is wary, every muscle quivering to take flight. This is a German bestiary with animals to cosset or animals to hunt. There were stags of this splendour in the deer park on the southern border of the Dachau camp, just beyond the barbed wire fences and watchtowers, carefully corralled to be shot from the lodge, after dinner with the commandant. And then there are the statues of the young and perfect; maidens after the bath, mothers with children, champions, striding female nudes, a member of the League of German Girls, with pigtails framing her face, left foot forward. There is a run of flying officers in full uniform with swords, and a figurine of a pilot, straight from the cockpit, nonchalant, and an SS rider and an SS standard bearer. \u201cThe standard bearer wears a nicely detailed SA-SS gorget,\u201d says a book for collectors. The standard bearer was not on display in the stores and was the personal gift of Himmler.     A belling stag designed by Professor K\u00e4rner. Photograph: Alamy    And then there is the SS stormtrooper. Count von Ribbentrop, the German ambassador to London, bought these to give to those in society he felt understood the complexity of the Reich. An Allach porcelain stormtrooper ended up on the mantelpiece of the earl of Londonderry\u2019s house at Mount Stewart in Northern Ireland. It is still there. The most desired of all these figures was Die Fechter \u2013 The Fencer \u2013 a muscled youth, shirtless, leaning on his \u00e9p\u00e9e. It was given only to the elite in the party. And I find a formal portrait of Reinhard Heydrich, who Hitler called \u201cthe man with the iron heart\u201d, responsible for the Einsatzgruppen, the death squads that killed a million Jews. He was a fencer. Die Fechter sits on a table next to him, a white trophy. *** Das Schwarze Korps, the SS newspaper, recorded the opening of the new Allach store in Berlin at Leipziger Strasse 13 on 1 April 1939. It quoted Hitler. He had proclaimed, as he saw these porcelains: \u201cNo people live longer than the document of their culture.\u201d The new store was very smart, with a pair of huge windows flanking the entrance and wall sconces to light it up at night. Das Schwarze Korps for the following week took you inside, where there were vitrines to the right with spotlit figures. The photograph shows Himmler as he walks past these glass cases, hands behind his back, reviewing his dragooners. And in 1941 and 1942, as the army pushed east, stores for Allach were opened in the new cities of the Reich: Warsaw, Pozn\u00e1n and Lw\u00f3w, rechristened Lemberg. The Julfest plate for 1943, sent to leading members of the SS, shows pink crocuses emerging from a snowy earth. On the back is a facsimile of Oswald Pohl\u2019s signature surrounded by a circlet of runes. On 14 January 1943, Himmler wrote to Pohl that he had visited the Allach store in Pozn\u00e1n: \u201cIn Allach we had a very pretty eagle in clay, matt. And now I see this eagle in the store in Poznan glazed! It looks disgraceful. I request that this is changed immediately.\u201d It can\u2019t be too difficult, surely, to send him the first porcelain sample produced and ask his opinion. And the staff are too young. They shouldn\u2019t work in such visible positions during the war. \u201cI really don\u2019t wish to get annoyed about one of the few things that give me pleasure.\u201d Details mattered to Himmler. On 6 February, Pohl sent him, as requested, an inventory of the materials taken from Jews in Auschwitz: 155,000 women\u2019s coats, 132,000 men\u2019s shirts, 11,000 boys\u2019 jackets, 6,600lb of women\u2019s hair. *** Most of the figures were white. This was at Himmler\u2019s request. They were either white glazed or unglazed bisque ware. Production numbers of white porcelain far outweighed coloured porcelain. \u201cWhite porcelain is the embodiment of the German soul,\u201d says the first catalogue for Allach.     The Allach porcelain shop in Warsaw in 1941. Photograph: Archiwum Cyfrowe/Warsaw    The whiteness of the skin of this porcelain was the whiteness of marble surfaces, the perfection of the Greek statues in the museums in Berlin and Munich. The Pergamon Museum, holding the greatest sculpture of the classical world, was the whitest building in the Reich. Allach\u2019s porcelain figures obeyed the strictures of Germany\u2019s great art critic Johann Winckelmann: \u201cSince white is the colour that reflects the most rays of light, and thus is most easily perceived, a beautiful body will be all the more beautiful the whiter it is.\u201d Here was the cult of the body, the fetishised smoothness and correct proportions, the cleanliness, the asexuality. This was porcelain to pick up and hold, to collect. You could buy the nudes. Or you could get an SS printing set and show the accuracy of the details of the insignia to your fellow officers as you relaxed after fulfilling your duties. I remember Susan Sontag writing about the films of Leni Riefenstahl and \u201cthe contrast between the clean and the impure, the incorruptible and the defiled, the physical and the mental, the joyful and the critical\u201d. White searches out degeneracy. *** I go to Dachau to find out what happened. It is early autumn and there is low mist. Pumpkins and squashes are stacked up outside the houses by the side of the road. Each pile has an honesty box. It is so grey and humid that everything seems caught. I notice the perimeter fence, the watchtowers, the ground where the punishments took place, the walls for the executions and I think this a journey I shouldn\u2019t be making. The archivist meets me. There is a long table, a library of research books and files. A woman is sitting quietly, whitely, looking at photographs. She makes very small pencil marks in her notebook. The archivist has been here for 15 years. He knows the intricacies of the SS sub camps, how prisoners were detailed to work in particular factories, the terrible realities of the granite quarries, the manifests, the trains, the death marches. And he is kind. He brings out the documents I need to see. In the manner of archives, the first sheet of paper is a letter of thanks to Himmler. It comes from Brigadef\u00fchrer Friedrich Uebelhoer and profusely thanks the Reichsf\u00fchrer for his gift of a porcelain standard bearer and the card, and the recognition of his support for the work he\u2019s doing in building a new Germany in the east. Uebelhoer is the governor of \u0141\u00f3d\u017a, and is building the ghetto.   Related: God of small things    The second letter is from Frau Himmler to Frau ER, which says she is very sorry to cause trouble, but has \u201clittle Ekhart\u201d received his Allach candlestick as a gift from his godfather, the Reichsf\u00fchrer, yet? \u201cAlso whether Sigrid and Irmtraut have received their candles as well.\u201d Frau Himmler sends condolences for the bombing. The third letter, dated 15 January 1945, is from Dr Hopfner to an unknown recipient, stating that the Julleuchter \u2013 the SS lantern for the solstice celebrations \u2013 should no longer be produced, but the production of the plates with SS phrases on the bottom should be increased. The texts can be uplifting in \u201cthe coming difficult months\u201d to those who use them. There is to be no more coal for the crematorium in Dachau, but supplies will continue to be delivered to fire the Allach kilns. But there is one testimony that is central, says the archivist, and he tells me about Hans Landauer, who worked in the factory and spent his life after the war speaking about what happened. His home was Vienna, but he came here often. I ask him if, by any chance, Herr Landauer can still be visited? And he gestures to his office, where there is a photograph of a large, open-faced, smiling man above his desk. Landauer died last week, he says. He was a great man. *** Hans Landauer was an Austrian socialist who had joined the International Brigade at 16 and was arrested fighting against Franco in the Spanish civil war. He was deported to the French camp at Gurs and arrived in Dachau on 6 June 1941. The archivist gives me the context for his story. It is May 1941 and a note is circulated at Buchenwald, Auschwitz, Flossenb\u00fcrg, Mauthausen, Neuengamme, Gross-Rosen and Sachsenhausen: \u201cDue to various civil workers having to go to war, the running of the porcelain factory in Allach cannot be kept up \u2026 the order has been made that the possibility to use useful prisoners for this command has to be considered. This concerns modellers, kiln-firers, formers and ceramicists. There has to be an immediate check up on forces in the concentration camps to find who has already been working in the area of ceramics and who is capable of working here.\u201d Ten days later, there is a list of names. They have located one Jew, four ASR \u2013 anti-social prisoners \u2013 one Bib-F \u2013 a Jehovah\u2019s Witness \u2013 and 12 political prisoners. Six days after this, Buchenwald says they can\u2019t find any workers for the kilns, or modelling, but they have 14 people for forming porcelain, one person to work a mill, one person to paint and one person to throw porcelain. These include one Jew and one labelled only as \u201cill\u201d. On 5 July 1941, 13 prisoners arrive in Allach to make porcelain. This group contained no kiln specialists, so an Austrian and a Spanish fighter, Franz Pinker and Karl Soldan, both communists, were selected to work on the firings in the factory. These men in turn select Landauer, their comrade newly arrived from a French camp. Initially, he is to work on the railway, pulling coal from the station at Dachau to the porcelain factory, \u201cin the way that boats were pulled on the Volga\u201d. This, writes Landauer, in his memoirs, is ein Gl\u00fccksfall \u2013 a piece of luck.     Himmler inspecting Allach porcelain at Dachau on 20 January 1941. Photograph: Image Bank WW2 \u2013 NIOD/Amsterdam    Sitting in the archive, Landauer\u2019s memoirs make this contingent moment, this Gl\u00fccksfall, seem incredibly close. This is the moment when, while he was unloading coal in the courtyard at the factory, he was asked if he could draw. He said yes, and drew a small sketch. This sketch takes him from the cruelty of dragging the coal wagons outside over the threshold and into Allach. It was the first step for him in the \u201cdirection of surviving hell\u201d. He starts work on the candleholders, and then he works on the figurines and becomes \u201cirreplaceable\u201d when he works on the horse riders that Hitler and Himmler so value. \u201cI only had to look out of the basement window from my desk, when the emaciated figures of the gravel quarry stumbled while pushing carts full of dead prisoners, or those not capable of walking any more, back into the camp \u2026\u201d He records how strange it was that this group of workers in the Allach porcelain factory, from so many different nations, were the people who had to produce the cult symbol of the party, the Julleuchter, and that making this product could give him and his fellow prisoners a higher chance of surviving the camp. Landauer is an extraordinary witness. He recalls seeing the closed carriages arriving from France, full of the dead and dying. He recalls his fellow workers, Franz Okroy, Herbert Hartmann, Franz Schmierer. There were two more Polish prisoners, whose names he can\u2019t remember, who worked on the small figurines. One was a professor from Krakow, who killed himself in 1942 or 1943 by running into the electric fence. There was Erwin Zapf, and the porcelain painter Gustav Krippner. There was Karl Schwendemann, who after an argument with an SS modeller, was taken out of the factory and back to Dachau main camp. Reading these names is salutary. I read them again. *** I need air and go outside for 10 minutes. When I return, the archivist explains that a local collector of Nazi memorabilia has died and his daughter has given a box to the archives. He brings in a grey plastic washing basket filled with Nazi objects in plastic bags and wrapped in newspaper. There is Allach porcelain, he says, but on top there is a belt, some buttons, a chart of the 38 divisions of the SS and magazines. He puts them on the table. Then he unwraps the first object. It is Bambi. Following that, there is a sleeping dachshund, another standing up looking mournful, and then a deer lying down, legs tucked underneath its body. I\u2019d expected a storm trooper, something white. But I\u2019m faced with Bambi, liquid-eyed, spindly legs, head tilted, carefully glazed. I pick it up and look underneath, as you always should do, and there is the cartouche with Allach and TH K\u00e4rner and the SS runes. I thank the archivist and wrap up the porcelain again and put it back in the laundry basket. I walk down across the ground, down the long avenue between the barracks, all the way to the perimeter fence. On the way back to the airport, I make a detour to the first Allach factory, on the outskirts of Munich. It is a safe jigsaw of small streets, kids on bicycles, a dog walker, trimmed hedges. The road says dead end, and unexpectedly there is an industrial site, prewar factories, something big alongside the road. The taxi stops at No 8. The street has been renamed. It is now Reinhard von Frank Strasse. No 8 is a high gabled house, six steps up to a front door, a workshop running to the right behind a high tangled hedge. It is derelict. The windows are broken and the gate is padlocked. It looks exactly like the workshop I was apprenticed in. This is where it began, a suburban street in nowhere special. Keep Out, warns the notice. \u2022 Edmund de Waal\u2019s The White Road: A Pilgrimage of Sorts is published by Chatto &amp; Windus.

Savers attracted by high interest rates had billions in their Icesave bank accounts temporarily frozen in 2008. Two years later, ash spewed by the Eyjafjallaj\u00f6kull volcano grounded planes across Europe for a week. So an Icelandic tech tycoon promising to fly bargain-hunting Brits to the US for \u00a399 one-way on his upstart airline might ring a few alarm bells. Sk\u00fali Mogensen\u2019s Wow Air is hoping to lure more people to Reykjavik from the UK \u2013 or more accurately, to pass through Keflavik airport for an hour or two. Its fleet of six short-haul planes is connecting London Gatwick, as well as Paris, Amsterdam and other European cities, with the eastern seaboard of the US. And in the era of low-cost aviation, it is hoping that a sub-\u00a3100 fare will will make an unconventional transatlantic crossing more attractive.  How will Mogensen, 47, a former philosophy dropout with a Bransonesque style, make the sums work? He is wearily familiar with the aviation industry joke of how to make a million (you start an airline with double that amount). In its fourth year, Wow is turning profitable, he says, although no accounts are published: financing came from \u201cmy left pocket\u201d.  Mogensen made his money in technology, selling mobile messaging software around the world and eventually selling one company, Oz Communications, to Nokia in 2008 to generate enough capital to start an airline. \u201cEveryone thought I was crazy,\u201d he said. \u201cThey told me you know nothing about running an airline. True, but I know a lot about the internet. And I love the fact that a small airline in Iceland with our small office can compete.\u201d   Related: UK airline regulator to force Ryanair to pay flight delay compensation    The business plan is for low-cost airline operations, grabbing online customers through cheap fares, but extended to the lucrative transatlantic route \u2013 a plan enabled by Iceland\u2019s potential as a staging post for flights to north America. Instead of direct flights on wide-body aircraft designed for long-range travel for several hundred passengers with full catering and entertainment, Wow does two short hops in the same kind of Airbus planes used by EasyJet \u2013 which typically seat between 180 and 220 passengers. Price is everything, Mogensen says. \u201cYou ask people what\u2019s important to them and they say things like seat pitch \u2013 but when they go online to book they don\u2019t get any information like that: 80% of passengers just go for price. \u201cThat\u2019s the principal driving factor for the consumer, so it\u2019s all about how you position yourself on the internet. Make sure you appear first on all the online travel agencies, then you\u2019re in business.\u201d Wow appears to be achieving this on Google Flights and Skyscanner for several routes: apparently substantially undercutting the nearest rivals on certain days, and frequently cheapest for those prepared to take connecting flights and be flexible on travel dates.  Google found a \u00a3274 return on Wow for London-Washington leaving 15 October, compared to that day\u2019s next cheapest \u00a3498 on KLM (connecting) or \u00a3541 on Virgin (direct); as little as \u00a3249 return departing November 11 to Boston (then \u00a3411 on Virgin). But for fixed autumn dates, while the likes of British Airways and Virgin were still returning a price between \u00a3390 and \u00a3500, cheap Wow fares were often nowhere to be seen.    Map of two Wow routes   Furthermore, Wow has only recently reissued its headline-grabbing \u00a399 outbound fares from Europe to the US; it costs more coming back. And the fare is not available at all after the spring, costing \u00a3479 one-way from June. Extras drive the cost up further, including a booking fee and notably tight baggage allowances: a maximum carry-on weight of 5kg rules out the kind of case most transatlantic passengers would want. A 12kg carry-on costs \u00a328, a 20kg bag in the hold \u00a339 each way. Throw in food and drink over four flights and the savings look less keen. Mogensen admits: \u201cNo one will buy a Wow Air ticket if it\u2019s the second cheapest. The internet tells us, every day, every second \u2013 it\u2019s a brutal boss.\u201d   Related: Norwegian's low-cost transatlantic service takes off from Gatwick    How sustainable is it to sell the cheapest tickets? This marketing tactic was claimed last year by Bj\u00f8rn Kjos, the chief executive of the budget carrier Norwegian, who said low fares were enough to market his airline when it launched a transatlantic service from Gatwick with \u00a3199 fares.  Mogensen says: \u201cObviously, you have to have a cost-conscious business.\u201d Planes are filled and used intensively, he adds, and his \u201cstartup\u201d does not have the costs affecting legacy carriers \u2013 a line that is generally airline CEO code for lower wages \u2013 but claims Wow employs none of the controversial tactics of some rivals. Unlike Ryanair, crew do not have to buy their own uniform. Norwegian courted controversy by hiring Thai crew on longhaul routes; Mogensen says Wow employs Icelandic staff on local terms and conditions, and crew and airline pay taxes there. Mogensen talks boldly of expanding Wow\u2019s transatlantic market share to 10% by 2020, an eight-fold increase in the airline\u2019s 750,000 annual passengers, more than half of which are on connecting flights. The name Wow was deliberately global rather than hinting at its north Atlantic island base which arguably gives Wow its most salient competitive advantage. But other dreams have foundered on that rocky outcrop: Wow has partly grown from the ruins of Iceland Express, whose own efforts to crack the same market ended in failure.  Analysts are cautious about its prospects. John Strickland, an aviation consultant, says: \u201cMost airlines have found it easier to fill seats profitably this year, aided by low fuel prices. The transatlantic routes market is known for its lucrative profit potential but it can equally be a graveyard: it\u2019s possible to make money in the summer only to bleed to death in the winter. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s an interesting model. But it\u2019s early days, and the recent experience of low-cost longhaul businesses isn\u2019t promising: AirAsia X [the biggest such airline in Asia] is wrestling with big losses; Norwegian also turned in a very big loss for 2014. It\u2019s not a surprise to fill a daily New York service out of Gatwick as it\u2019s a vast market. Picking thinner routes, to destinations like Baltimore and Washington, is much more challenging.\u201d  Mogensen returned to Iceland from Canada in 2009, having made his fortune in the Nokia sale just as his homeland suffered its financial crash: \u201cInstead of celebrating, I saw my friends and family were being very hard hit.\u201d Pouring his money into Wow may have cost him somewhat more, but he says he is optimistic: \u201cI like to call it an investment.\u201d Transatlantic trailblazers  Freddie Laker The founder of Laker Airways tried to take on the big boys with cheap and cheerful flights to the US, but after years of battling for legislative approval, his airline went bankrupt in 1982 as British Airways and US carriers conspired to undercut his fares.

At the same time, it has been intriguing to see the different reactions to what happened in Manchester United\u2019s game at PSV Eindhoven and Keane is certainly not alone when he says that just because there is a victim it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean there is a guilty party. Dwight Yorke\u2019s conclusion was the same and, most pertinently of all, Howard Webb\u2019s verdict after watching several slow-motion replays, from all the different angles, was that the referee, Nicola Rizzoli, was correct not to punish H\u00e9ctor Moreno.   Related: Chelsea\u2019s Jos\u00e9 Mourinho: Diego Costa was man of the match against Arsenal    Louis van Gaal, in stark contrast, described it as awful, arguing it should have been a red card and a penalty, and signalling his displeasure again at Friday\u2019s press conference, when he was informed that not everyone thought Moreno was to blame. Owen Hargreaves, who was covering the game on television, agreed with Van Gaal that it was reckless and out of control, therefore warranting a red card, and Peter Schmeichel\u2019s reaction to Moreno winning Uefa\u2019s man\u2011of\u2011the\u2011match award was that he \u201cshouldn\u2019t even have been on the pitch\u201d. Then the other ex-referees weighed in, Graham Poll and Mark Halsey both insisting the player should have been dismissed for dangerous play and that Webb, their former colleague, was completely wrong. Confusing, isn\u2019t it? On the one hand, there is the argument that Moreno\u2019s challenge was an automatic sending\u2011off judging by Uefa\u2019s guidance for any tackle that has \u201cexcessive force or endangers the safety of an opponent\u201d. On the other, there is the counter\u2011argument that it was hard but fair and that, unfortunately in sport, injuries can happen without culpability having to be attached. It is a split jury. Nobody is going to disprove the other case and the only real conclusion to draw is that this surely kills, stone dead, the argument that video technology will solve these cases. That might not be a popular view when there is clearly a strong weight of feeling that referees need help to decide, for instance, whether a penalty should have been awarded or if a foul was serious enough to send off the guilty player. The International Football Association Board is due to revisit the idea when it meets early next year and Greg Dyke, chairman of the FA, is among those supporting the idea of trials, primarily by having another official, monitoring video replays for key decisions relating to goals, penalties and red cards, wired up to the referee. \u201cI believe we will look back in 20 years\u2019 time and say: \u2018Wasn\u2019t it quaint that we didn\u2019t use the available technology to help referees?\u2019\u201d Dyke says. It is a nice soundbite but the events in Eindhoven show it isn\u2019t actually that straightforward. The aim, apparently, is to delay games by no more than five to six seconds but that simply isn\u2019t feasible when there is an incident as divisive as Moreno\u2019s challenge on Shaw. Some decisions might be obvious; others need almost forensic analysis and, as the Shaw case proves, there will always be incidents that split opinion in two and provoke disagreement no matter how many times they are reviewed on video and studied, meticulously, frame by frame. Someone will still ultimately make the decision and it strikes me we would merely be shifting the debate about the referee\u2019s judgment to that of the television official, and going round in the same circles again. And, plainly, it is not straightforward when even the people with the laws of the game imprinted on their brains give us such wildly contrasting opinions. Webb says Moreno made a fair and controlled challenge. Poll says he would have sent the Mexican off and Halsey goes even further: \u201cIt is a horrendous challenge and quite how one of Europe\u2019s top referees does not punish the PSV man is absolutely baffling.\u201d All three have seen it on video; if they cannot agree, it just shows the potential for more controversy and arguments. If we are not careful, it isn\u2019t difficult to imagine a situation whereby a referee looks at an incident after the match and decides the video official was wrong. Van Gaal evidently thinks it is worth doing anyway and the Dutch FA, which has been leading the calls for video replays, say it has had positive feedbacks from its trials. \u201cI believe we should use as much technology as possible,\u201d Van Gaal says. \u201cTechnology is always neutral and doesn\u2019t make the mistakes human beings make.\u201d He is right on that last point and there is certainly a strong case to push for technology on offside decisions, when they are in theory easier to judge than a flying tackle. It would have taken only a few moments, for instance, for a message to reach the referee that Aaron Ramsey\u2019s disallowed goal for Arsenal against Liverpool a few weeks back was perfectly legitimate.   Related: Liverpool will never replace Luis Su\u00e1rez, but Christian Benteke gives them hope    The new offside rule, with its specification about interfering with play, complicates matters slightly, on the basis it now boils down to a matter of opinion rather than actually relying solely on the technology. Again, it seems fanciful to imagine this could all be done in five or six seconds. It would, however, have been a relatively swift decision to determine that Christian Benteke\u2019s winning goal for Liverpool against Bournemouth should have been ruled out on the basis Philippe Coutinho was in an offside position when he lunged for the ball first. Van Gaal has been banging that drum, too, and made it clear a while back that in his opinion there should be a television official in place and no need for linesmen. \u201cIn today\u2019s football, offside is extremely hard to determine. The game is quicker now and to be able to view the moment a ball is played and to check at the same time where the forwards are is basically an impossibility. No one can see those moments at the same time.\u201d Well, they don\u2019t do too badly: the Premier League says that Prozone statistics, coupled with the analysis of Professional Game Match Officials Limited, show that 99% of offside decisions were called correctly last season, and that the figure has wavered only by 0.1% over the last five years. The problem is everyone remembers the bad calls, not the good ones, and it is clearly getting harder when there are other statistics that show how the speed of the game has increased dramatically in the past decade. Ars\u00e8ne Wenger is another one who wants technology for offside calls and, over time, nobody should be too surprised if television officials take over from linesmen. Apparently, they will sit in a van outside the ground, so at least they won\u2019t hear the opprobrium that is directed towards the man with the whistle. Ipswich\u2019s McCarthy would find putting one over Van Gaal with Ipswich just capital Manchester United play Ipswich Town in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday and, though it is not quite up there with, say, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho versus Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, there is an intriguing subplot bearing in mind the history between Mick McCarthy and Louis van Gaal. The last time they faced each other was September 2001, as managers of Republic of Ireland and Holland, ahead of a do-or-die World Cup qualifier in which Roy Keane put in a performance that was every bit as epic as his tour de force for United against Juventus in the Champions League semi-final two years earlier. Van Gaal had prepared for the game in Dublin by suggesting that Ireland\u2019s manager was likely to be sacked in the event of a Dutch victory and, as a barometer of how that went down, there are a couple of extracts from Mick McCarthy\u2019s World Cup 2002 Diary that adequately sum it up. \u201cLouis van Gaal is starting to annoy me,\u201d McCarthy writes on the day before the game. \u201cHe has been quoted on my employment prospects if Ireland lose and he seems none too concerned at the prospect of Ireland sacking their manager and me losing my job. That disappoints me. There is no need for Louis van Gaal to get involved in Irish football politics. Hopefully we can wipe the smile off his face.\u201d Then we get to the day of the match and McCarthy\u2019s final team talk. \u201cIt\u2019s about passionate hearts and calm heads,\u201d he explains. \u201cI ask the players to give me the opportunity to walk up to Louis van Gaal afterwards and say: \u2018Unlucky.\u2019 Just give me the chance to look him in the eye, shake his hand and say: \u2018Bad luck.\u2019\u201d   Related: Steven Gerrard: \u2018I wish I was 25 again and captain, leading Liverpool out'    Keane clattered Marc Overmars with a tackle straight from kick-off that made our bones vibrate in the pressbox, so goodness knows what it felt like to be the recipient. Jason McAteer scored and Lansdowne Road has rarely sounded better. Van Gaal ended up with four strikers on the pitch but none of them could score, even though Gary Kelly was sent off with half an hour to play. Ireland went through to the World Cup, via a play-off against Iran. Holland bowed out \u2013 and Van Gaal went home to a national inquest, including the observation in Brabants Dagblad that his philosophy and excuses were \u201cbullshit\u201d. Just before the World Cup, McCarthy and Van Gaal found themselves at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam at the same time. Van Gaal, who had resigned as bondscoach was on his way to Barcelona where he had been reinstalled at the Camp Nou. McCarthy smiled and shook his head. \u201cIf the tables were turned there\u2019s no way I\u2019d have got Barcelona, is there?\u201d he asked the journalists in his company. It was a fair question. And one imagines he would love to say \u201cunlucky\u201d again. Long haul to BT for Galaxy\u2019s Gerrard Steven Gerrard made an immediate impact in his new punditry role with BT Sport by floating the idea that the fault lines had started to appear in Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s relationship with John Terry. Yet the more relevant question, perhaps, is whether Gerrard should be booked in for all these 11,000-mile round trips to London when he is just settling into Major League Soccer and at an age when extra care needs to be taken to prepare for games. LA Galaxy say they are comfortable with it, apparently, but it is difficult to imagine Liverpool would be too happy if one of their players had a regular gig flying to Los Angeles and back before weekend games.", "sentences": ["Just before the World Cup, McCarthy and Van Gaal found themselves at Schiphol airport in Amsterdam at the same time."], "title": "Referees\u2019 debate over tackle on Luke Shaw shows limits of technology | Daniel Taylor", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2015/sep/19/referees-luke-shaw-technology", "tags": ["Laws of football", "Manchester United", "Referees", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-09-23T12:16:56Z", "article": "A gunshot and a scream reverberate through the yellow house, echo across the fjord, and fill a new exhibition at the Van Gogh museum in Amsterdam with pity and terror. In 1890 Vincent van Gogh fatally shot himself in the French countryside. Three years later the Norwegian painter Edvard Munch was walking near Oslo\u2019s fjord at sunset. As the sun went down, he remembered years later, he was seized by a dreadful vision:  \u201cThe air became like blood \u2013 with piercing strands of fire ... I felt a great scream \u2013 and I actually heard a great scream.\u201d Munch\u2019s 1893 crayon drawing The Scream, on loan from Oslo\u2019s Munch Museum, now hangs near Van Gogh\u2019s Wheatfield under Thunderclouds, which he painted in the last months of his life. The sky for Van Gogh has become a gorgeously thick and wet, yet oppressively dense and massive smear of blue and white. Meanwhile the sky for Munch, in The Scream, is a sinister aurora borealis, a radioactive blaze. We are left to guess what Van Gogh\u2019s blue soup of a sky says about his emotional state. Munch leaves no such ambiguity. He portrays himself as a robed, monk-like figure, his eyes dots of pain in a hairless skull, his mouth an oval of anguish. Other walkers stand insensitive before the fjord. Only the isolated artist can hear the scream that is tearing nature itself apart. Seeing Munch and Van Gogh side by side is a journey to the birth of expressionism. They never met, and Van Gogh never knew Munch existed \u2013 although Munch, who lived until 1944, certainly got to know eventually about Van Gogh. Yet both artists intuited something similar. They felt the world crying out to express itself in colours. They heard a music, or a scream, in nature that connected artist and sky, artist and fields. The way they set down this holistic, extreme sensitivity created a new kind of art.     Vincent van Gogh\u2019s The Yellow House (1888); and Red Virginia Creeper (1898-1900), by Edvard Munch Photograph: Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam/ Munch-Museet, Oslo    Munch: Van Gogh compares some of the greatest masterpieces of two of the greatest modern artists. Munch, besides one of his four versions of The Scream, is represented by his even more terrifying vision of a house that seems to drip blood, Red Virginia Creeper (1898-1900), his darkly erotic Madonna (1895-97), and many more such shocking revelations of the fin de siecle. Van Gogh replies with works like Starry Night over the Rhone (1888) and The Yellow House (1888). It is like a drama by Strindberg in which the two most intense artists who ever lived rage in mutual madness.    Munch was the friend Van Gogh never found. Would he have been a better companion than Gauguin?    Munch was the friend Van Gogh never found. The one man who might have understood him. When he rented the Yellow House in Arles and decorated it with bright paintings of sunflowers, Van Gogh was dreaming of utopia. He hoped this house would become an art colony where painters worked like brothers. Instead he got Paul Gauguin as a house guest and the dream ended in self harm and hospitalisation. Would Munch have been a better painting companion? In his 1889 painting Summer Night: Inger on the Beach, nature is a numinous, living presence that infuses the painting with inner light, just as Van Gogh\u2019s stars spark in the blue.  Both these northerners were set alight by French impressionism and both admired Gauguin\u2019s abstract, symbolic boldness. Munch\u2019s nightmarish lithographs of lonely souls and depraved sexuality owe more to Gauguin than Van Gogh does, even though it was Van Gogh who lived with Gauguin. But the similarities between Munch and Van Gogh are ultimately less telling than their differences.

Photograph: Reuters      If a psychiatrist were asked which of these painters was most troubled, the diagnosis would be easy: Munch    This exhibition casts a radically new light on the tragedy of Van Gogh. If a psychiatrist were asked which of these painters was affected by mental health issues, which was most troubled, the diagnosis would be easy. Obviously, Munch is the morbid, seriously disturbed artist here. It is Munch who wears sickness on his sleeve. It\u2019s not just his self-portrait as a screaming ghoul. What about his print Jealousy, in which a bearded youth gazes big-eyed into nothingness while a woman shows her body to a voyeuristic man? Or Red Virginia Creeper, in which blood covers a house and seeps into a muddy path, while the same tortured face gazes into an abyss of horror?  By comparison Van Gogh is free from all morbidity, despair, or self-pity. He liked to close his letters \u201cwith a handshake\u201d and recommended smoking a pipe, like he did, to stay sane and happy. His paintings, next to those of Munch, are golden dreams of harmony and hope. He sees a magic in nature, a divine energy. The sound he hears is not a scream but a shout of exultation. Munch is a macabre poet of darkness, vampires, murder. His art is erotic and perverse. Van Gogh, in the cornfield, is a believer. He is all love. Until the crows come screaming.

Simon and co-writer William F Zorzi do this brilliantly, which should be no surprise. Their previous collaboration, The Wire, about life in Baltimore\u2019s inner city, was the best show ever on American television. They are just as unflinching here, their canvas an endless, real-life fight over public housing in Yonkers, a small city just north of New York. Its overwhelmingly white, working-class population had already been battered by de-industrialisation when the fight began in 1980, and Simon and Zorzi are sympathetic to their fears. They never soft-soap the crime and dysfunction prevalent in Yonkers\u2019 predominantly black and Hispanic public housing projects, while at the same time, they deftly uncover white Yonkers\u2019 true sin: the inability to see the people of colour in the projects as human beings, just as desperate as they are to build a better life for themselves and their children. Yonkers was just one of many such fights over public housing that went on throughout the United States for decades \u2013 and are still going on. But there is another dimension to the story, one that is probably beyond the scope of any six-hour TV series to tell.    Running through the history of the US, white people have had a conviction that any black space is not legitimate       A still from Show Me A Hero, the latest TV series from The Wire\u2019s David Simon, about social housing in Yonkers, New York. Photograph: HBO    That is, our past. Not only the refusal of white people to live with people of colour, but their conviction, running back through the history of the US, that any black space is not legitimate \u2013 that whatever black people own can and should be expropriated by whites, if they so desire it. During the second world war, this idea of white primacy sparked one of the worst race riots in American history, after white people insisted not only that Detroit\u2019s federal housing built for war workers be segregated, but that all of it be turned over to white residents. The riot was no anomaly. During the first world war, in 1917, another white-on-black race riot all but annihilated the black community of East St Louis, Illinois. A few years later, armed white mobs (backed by local law officers) razed to the ground the all-black Florida towns of Ocoee and Rosewood, and the prosperous black Greenwood section of Tulsa, Oklahoma. Scores of black people were killed in these onslaughts. Greenwood was burned to the ground as airplanes dropped incendiaries on the neighbourhood. Some 10,000 African Americans were left homeless. These flourishing black communities were erased not only from physical existence, but also from living memory. Bodies were hidden, accounts censored and the survivors scattered or intimidated into silence. To this day, we don\u2019t know exactly what happened, or how many people died. One of the most vibrant communities in black America vanished just across the street from where I lived almost all of my adult life. Until a few years ago, I had no idea it had ever been there. Soon after I graduated from college in 1980 \u2013 at almost the exact time the federal government joined a lawsuit by the National Association of Coloured People (NAACP) against the city of Yonkers \u2013 three friends and I moved into an apartment on West 99th Street on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side.     An episode of This American Life all about Kevin Baker\u2019s \u2018dangerous\u2019 building superintendent   It was in a row of tenements on the south side of the street, apartment buildings that, as a city inspector once put it, were \u201clittle more than six stories of dust, held up by 100 years of paint.\u201d The superintendent was a former member of a Brazilian death squad, given refuge by the US government, while the landlord would be sent to prison a few years later, not only for murdering his brother-in-law, but also for having some of his minions pick-axe their way down to the gas line below the street in order to finagle the meter. The local stretch of Broadway then was a hodge-podge of greasy spoons, barbershops and pizza places. Musty little stores stuffed with newspapers and pornographic magazines, that sold loose cigarettes and lighters, and red and yellow dream sheets that told you the best numbers to bet in the lottery. Hookers roamed the sidestreets, servicing the car trade from Jersey, and liquor stores had partitions thick enough to stop anti-tank guns. We loved it. The rent was dirt cheap and there was an elevator. Best of all, though, were the people. My neighbourhood is almost a joke about multiculturalism: black, white, Dominican, Puerto Rican, Indian, Chinese, Haitian, gay and lesbian couples, extended families, graduate students, widows and widowers, mixed-race couples and gender non-conformists live here. For years, our postman was a Sikh gentleman living on the first floor. We let in the guests of his Orthodox Jewish neighbour on Saturdays, knowing they couldn\u2019t violate the Sabbath by pressing the buzzer. Working at my desk by an open courtyard window, I sometimes feel as though I am sitting astride the great hive of the world, hearing scraps of languid, evening conversations in three languages I do not understand. All around us, up and down Amsterdam Avenue, are the sorts of high-rise, public housing projects that so terrified the residents of Yonkers. They\u2019re not pretty buildings. But because New York has \u2013 usually \u2013 tried to integrate its public housing somewhat by income, and tie it into the rest of the community, they are generally safe and well-tended places. The lawns are unlittered and kids play happily.     97th and Columbus in 1956. Photograph courtesy of Richard Storm and the archives of St Michael\u2019s Church, New York City    Directly across from us is another sort of housing complex. West 99th street stops abruptly there, one of the few interruptions of Manhattan\u2019s endless grid. Where the streets used to go from 97th to 100th street are giant lots crowded with luxury towers, many of them co-ops and condominiums with balconies and great views. A Whole Foods store moved in a few years ago, along with a gourmet cupcake shop and a pricey cosmetics outlet. Developers are trying to rebrand it all as \u201cColumbus Square\u201d, even though there\u2019s no square there. There\u2019s no hint of what it replaced. No suggestion of \u201cthe Old Community\u201d that once was one of the few places outside of Harlem that black New Yorkers could call their own.    Developers are trying to rebrand the area as Columbus Square, even though there\u2019s no square there    So much of the history of African Americans in New York is that of being pushed off land by an encroaching white population. Before the Civil War, there was an integrated community called Seneca Village on the Upper West Side, that included three churches, a school and a graveyard. The majority of its residents were black, but American Indians and Irish immigrants, who had fled the potato famine, also lived there. Almost all were squatters, and so when the land was needed to build Central Park, they were evicted without recourse or restitution, their homes and churches and school demolished. After the white-on-black violence that erupted during the city\u2019s Civil War draft riots, the only place there were enough African Americans to feel safe was a few blocks of Greenwich Village, around Minetta Lane. Soon, they were moved on from there as well, pushed steadily uptown over the next 50 years by one wave of white immigration after another. First to the Tenderloin, and Hell\u2019s Kitchen in midtown, then to the area around what is Columbus Circle and Lincoln Center today.     Poverty in Harlem.  Photograph: Central Press/Getty Images    After a cop was killed in a fight with a black man in 1900, a police riot in which New York police officers encouraged white mobs to join them in beating local black people at random succeeded in getting the black population to move on again, this time to Harlem. Real estate speculators had hoped to turn Harlem into a wealthy, white enclave, but they misgauged the market. With black people forcibly prevented from living almost anywhere else in Manhattan, landlords could charge them two or three times the going rents \u2013 gouging that forced African Americans to double or triple up in their apartments, ultimately sowing the seeds of the community\u2019s decline. There was a modest alternative. In 1905, black real estate entrepreneur Philip A Payton Jr \u2013 who would make a small fortune managing the exodus to Harlem \u2013 carved out another niche for African Americans on 98th and 99th streets, between Amsterdam and Central Park West \u2013 just across the street from my home. The tenements would have been good, middle-class housing at the time, and they attracted a dazzling array of black and Hispanic professionals, artists, scholars, entertainers and political leaders: Bert Williams, the popular song-and-dance man who put on the first all-black Broadway musical; Robert Earl Jones, a former Mississippi sharecropper who became a longtime star of the stage and was most famous as the father of James Earl Jones; James Weldon Johnson, the great voice of the Harlem Renaissance and longtime leader at the NAACP; Marcus Garvey, renowned leader of the first mass, black nationalist movement in America; and the incomparable Billie Holliday, whose mother also ran a restaurant on W 99th street, and many others \u2013 such a fantastic collection of talent, of intellect, that had they all been white people, we would have been taught about it in school and young people from around the country would have made pilgrimages to it, as they did to Greenwich Village.     Billie Holiday was one of the many famous residents of the \u2018Old Community\u2019, where her mother also ran a restaurant. Photograph: Charles Hewitt/Getty    Instead, by 1951, the Old Community was a tightly knit if poor neighbourhood, served by its own black church and settlement house. Its average family lived well below the poverty line, but rents were cheap, and because their neighbourhood was integrated, they enjoyed the benefit of good public schools and government services. Their children could frolic in the leafy greensward of Central Park, just next door. But things were about to change. In one of the most unfortunate examples of what happens to good intentions that are not thought out, President Harry Truman had signed into law the 1949 Housing Law, with its notorious Title I, soon to become better known as \u201curban renewal\u201d. Title I gave civic authorities the right to condemn \u201cslum neighbourhoods\u201d, and turn them over to a \u201creasonable bidder\u201d to redevelop. In theory, this was a laudable effort to put federal funds behind local and private-sector efforts to eradicate city slums. In practice, under the supervision of overwhelmingly white and often racist local officials, \u201curban renewal,\u201d as novelist James Baldwin would famously put it, \u201cmeans Negro removal.\u201d Nowhere was this policy more avidly and brutally pursued than in New York, where \u201cmaster builder\u201d Robert Moses then ruled as a virtual dictator. Moses, an inveterate racist, saw a double opportunity in urban renewal. He could remove whole black neighbourhoods from wherever he liked, and funnel millions of dollars of supposedly \u201chonest graft\u201d to the politicians, contractors and developers whose support he needed. In all, he would demolish some 2,000 city neighbourhoods to these ends, throwing at least 300,000 people \u2013 and probably many more \u2013 out of their homes. As Robert Caro points out in his magisterial study of Moses, The Power Broker, while only some 12% of New Yorkers were listed as \u201cnon-white\u201d in the 1950 census, at least 37% of those evicted by Moses\u2019 projects were minorities. The most egregious example of this policy cited by Caro was the destruction of the Old Community. Moses wielded his power to condemn six square blocks of this remarkable neighbourhood, containing 338 apartment buildings and 3,628 families. The total appraised value of this property was $15m, but the \u201creasonable bid\u201d Moses accepted for its \u201crenewal\u201d was just $1m, from a company run by one Samuel Caspert, who promised to build a wonderful new housing complex, dubbed Manhattantown. Caspert was many things, but he was not a builder. Professionally, he was an auctioneer and appraiser, whose family business describes him today on its website as \u201ca visionary\u201d. His main vision seemed to be of money filling his pockets. He and his partners would build nothing at Manhattantown beyond a parking lot, and they did not even demolish all that much.

One such scam included Caspert having the company sell all the buildings\u2019 stoves and refrigerators to a son-in-law\u2019s corporation, rent them back for over three times the cost of the sale, then buy them back at the end of the year. In return for providing the rents to finance such lucrative scams, the residents of the Old Community received nothing but the slow destruction of their homes and their community. In keeping with the provisions of Title I, evicted tenants were promised comparable living arrangements and \u201cpreferential status\u201d if they applied for new apartments. In reality, as in most of Moses\u2019 projects, this was just a lie. Little or no effort was made to find the evicted residents a place to go, and none of them could afford the nice new buildings of Manhattantown \u2013 provided they ever got built. In other words, the \u201cslum-dwellers\u201d who urban renewal was supposed to be all about, would get nothing and lose everything. Caspert and company simply slapped notices in lobbies announcing that the buildings would be demolished at once, and that all tenants had to leave. To encourage them to do so, their new landlord stopped cleaning the buildings or making any repairs, leaving their front doors open to bums and winos. Eventually, heat and hot water went, too. All around them, the few buildings that were being slowly torn down were converted into huge piles of jagged, dusty wreckage, until one observer noted: \u201cManhattantown looked like a cross-section of burned out Berlin right after the second world war.\u201d     New York parks commissioner Robert Moses in Brooklyn, 1956. Photograph: AP    A band of defiant liberal reformers decided to fight back. Going from apartment to apartment to interview the remaining tenants, they found people wary and frightened by what would become of them, but discovered \u201cthat most of the apartments were well kept, clean\u201d. They still would not become slum-dwellers, even as the slum was built around them. Scrupulously documenting all the wanton destruction and corruption they had found, the liberal reformers went public with their findings \u2013 and got nowhere. In Show Me a Hero, the ranting white protesters on the news every night cannot understand how it is that federal judges can impose what they considered to be naive and dangerous anti-segregation statutes on their community. They punish one Yonkers mayor after another, for not wasting money on what are plainly hopeless appeals. But the black residents of Manhattantown and their liberal allies would not even get a day in court. Such was the power of Moses and the white establishment behind him, that almost none of New York\u2019s many newspapers reported anything on the blatant corruption going on in Manhattantown. No elected officials were in a position to rein him in, even if they wanted to. It was only when the liberals were able to force a hearing before a US Senate committee in 1954, three years after Moses\u2019 \u201creasonable bidders\u201d had obtained the right to build Manhattantown, that Caspert and company admitted that 280 of the 338 buildings they were supposed to have demolished already were still standing, and that their inhabitants were still being charged rent. It would also come out that the company was not even paying city taxes on the properties. But even then, there would be no punishment for any of this malfeasance. Only after a belated series of newspaper exposes, and three more years of negligible progress \u2013 after Caspert was used as a fake developer at other \u201cslum clearance\u201d sites by Moses \u2013 would the leading stockholders allow themselves to be bought out by a real developer and walk away from the rubble with a tidy fortune. After that, things moved quickly enough. The remaining buildings were knocked down, their residents scattered. By 1960, Manhattantown had become Park West Village. A fairly charming, pricey set of red-brick buildings to start, its residents would include many of the same sorts of extraordinary black and Hispanic achievers who had lived in the Old Community \u2013 Duke Ellington, Odetta, Coleman Hawkins, Wilt Chamberlain, Cicely Tyson, Tito Puente, Hugh Masakela, Miriam Makeba. Though, in perhaps the ultimate irony, the number of black tenants was initially limited to 20% of all residents, lest their presence reach the \u201ctipping point\u201d that would scare off white renters.    Today, of course, we live in the perfect democracy of money           The Tragedy of Urban Renewal \u2013 a short film by Jim Epstein    Today, of course, there is no question of anyone being turned away from living in Park West Village, or anywhere else around what was the Old Community, due to the colour of their skin. We live in the perfect democracy of money. All they have to have is the Brinks truck full of lucre that is required to buy into most of Manhattan these days. The old dive bars and the greasy spoons are gone, but so are the wonderful little butcher shops, bakeries and corner cinemas that were there for decades, sustaining our community through all the crime and social decay of the drug years \u2013 crime and social decay that were, in part, drawn to the area in the first place by the long, government-imposed disintegration of the Old Community. Businesses on Broadway are being driven out of existence in droves by the exorbitant rent demands of landlords \u2013 many of which are the governing boards of the wealthy new co-ops. Even franchises of major national chains, such as Starbucks or Subway, are routinely shuttered, and shops sit empty for months at a time.   Related: Resurrecting Newburgh, the once-grand American city that had its heart torn out    It feels as if we have gone full circle, and come out somewhere slightly worse. Almost all that survives are pharmaceutical chains, bank branches and nail salons, overwhelming our neighbourhood like invasive species of weeds. It is difficult to believe that this is what even the owners of the shiny new condominiums in \u201cColumbus Square\u201d had in mind when they invested in urban living, but here we are. Meanwhile, the elderly, dignified alumni of the Old Community hold annual reunions and reminisce about past days. They seem remarkably devoid of bitterness, considering what was done to them. And my little block still hangs on, an island of neighbourly diversity in a sea of gentrification. Perhaps Yonkers, its population now almost half black, Hispanic and Asian, is coming to understand, too, what there is to be gained from living with people different from you.

Tales from my InterRailing mates made hostels sound like an endurance test. Food eaten by mice in the night; drunk interlopers comatose in your bunk; and even a story about a bloke fried on LSD attempting to pile all the furniture against the dormitory door. At 4am. Once, in Amsterdam (naturally, I was in a hotel), I ended up drinking with a group of Australian backpackers who appeared to be tolerating one another solely because, as solo travellers, they badly needed the companionship. The loudest of them was very proud of the large felt-tip penis that somehow (use your imagination), had been drawn on his belly in the red-light district. Were these the kind of people you had to put up with in hostels? Because, frankly, I am not a big felt-tip-penis kind of guy.     The work of graffiti artist Small Kid adorns the walls    What I do like, though, is value for money, which in the hotel world is increasingly hard to find. A standard room in most UK cities is now \u00a3100-plus at the weekend, even in many supposedly \u201cbudget\u201d hotels. Fundamentally, all you need is a comfortable bed, a toilet, shower, TV and mirror. Why are rooms that expensive? Despite my historic prejudice, therefore, I was intrigued by Igloo Hybrid, a hip new \u201cho[s]tel\u201d in Nottingham, which includes several private double rooms (some en suite), family rooms, pod-like \u201csleep boxes\u201d for two (decorated by local graffiti artist Small Kid), and dorms with up to six beds. Private rooms start at \u00a329, and, naturally, are basic. You have to bring your own toiletries and, unless you rent Igloo\u2019s thin ones, your own towels. You are politely asked to strip your bed.

I liked my loosely beach-themed room, though. The hardwearing carpet is an institutional charcoal grey, but there is enough homespun colour (a cartoon palm tree illustration; digital-print sunset wallpaper from eBay) that it feels warmly cosy. The idiosyncratic mismatching of Ikea-ish and vintage furniture pieces is also pleasing. The en suite bathroom (heated towel rail but no drinking glasses) is fine, despite the shower\u2019s domestic power. Generally \u2013 plenty of hooks, if no hangers; idiot-proof TV; full-length mirror; clever, built-in writing desk \u2013 I like the room\u2019s neat, clutter-free functionality. Guests can cook in the ground-floor kitchen or hang out in the communal lounge and cute courtyard (there\u2019s no bar or restaurant). On this midweek visit, it was far from raucous. A couple of people nursed beers, but there was little chatter. Most were sitting, headphones on, tapping at laptops. The Libertines had played Nottingham the night before. Perhaps everyone was coming around from that. Or were they just dumbstruck to see someone of my advanced years (in this context, anyone over 25) in a youth hostel?     Dorms have up to six beds    Either way, I beetled off to Junkyard, an ace craft beer bar just minutes away. The Malt Cross, a bar and arts centre in a restored Victorian music hall, is also recommended and, again, close to centrally located Igloo. Next morning, two minutes after check-out, I was in coffee shop 200 Degrees, enjoying an excellent flat white and a bagel. Who wouldn\u2019t prefer to swerve Britain\u2019s overpriced chain hotels and spend the money saved at such local independents?

Later I would listen again and again to a recording of West Side Story \u2013 one of the most riveting scores in Broadway history. Bernstein was, to me, an authentic hero of the arts, a man of passion and wide-ranging creativity, a kind of Picasso in the realm of music. So it caught my attention when Gore Vidal (a friend) called from Ravello one summer day in 1988 to ask if my wife and I would join him for a sail up the Amalfi Coast with \u201cLenny\u201d and Howard Austen, Gore\u2019s partner of many decades. We were, at the time, living in Amalfi itself, just down the hillside from Ravello. Lenny was trying to convince Gore (without success) to rewrite the book of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the only musical by Bernstein that had fallen flat. It had appeared on Broadway in 1976 and lasted for only seven performances. The composer, quite rightly, assumed that the problem lay with the book and libretto, not the music. We met the next morning in the harbour, boarding an old motor launch that Gore often hired. A laconic captain ignored us completely as we headed north along the rocky coast toward Positano. I couldn\u2019t help but notice that Howard and Lenny seemed oddly alike: short, pot-bellied, chain-smoking, talkative. Both wore gold necklaces, like Mafia dons. Gore was distracted that day, probably hungover. But he came to life as we passed a villa where Sofia Loren used to live with Carlo Ponti. Lenny was dismissive: \u201cYou\u2019re such a star-fucker, Gore.\u201d We stopped for lunch at a cliffside restaurant that hung over the water. I was last off the boat, with Lenny, who had told me he would leave in a few days to conduct a concert in Amsterdam. I asked a stupid question: \u201cDo you get to practise with the orchestra before you step onto the stage?\u201d He grinned and said, \u201cIt\u2019s called rehearsal!\u201d When he saw how embarrassed I was, he kissed me on the forehead, saying in a hoarse voice: \u201cNobody takes what I say personally, so don\u2019t you!\u201d     I asked a stupid question: \u201cDo you get to practise with the orchestra before you step on to the stage?\u201d Leonard (pictured) grinned and said: \u201cIt\u2019s called rehearsal.\u201d Photograph: Ullstein Bild/Getty Images    We climbed a slippery stairwell made of limestone to a broad terrace, where lunch was served under a grape arbour. The owner of the restaurant obviously knew Gore and Howard well, and he kissed them on both cheeks, calling Gore \u201cMaestro\u201d, as everyone did on the coast. Lemon trees were everywhere, and flowering bougainvillea, dahlias, roses. For three hours we sat over lunch, with successive courses, many bottles of local wine, listening as Lenny described the wonders of Brahms, whom he called \u201cthe least appreciated of the major composers\u201d. He was about to embark, he explained, on a major revival of Brahms. \u201cI\u2019m one of the few conductors in the world who can do this. In fact, there are only two star conductors in the world. There\u2019s me, and there\u2019s Herbert.\u201d Herbert, I assumed, was Herbert von Karajan. Gore had been silent until now, rather sullen, but he suddenly pounded a fist on the table, sending a plate crashing to the tiled floor. \u201cAnd there are only two star novelists in the world,\u201d he said loudly. \u201cThere\u2019s me, of course. And there is Bellow.\u201d Without a pause, Lenny smacked his side of the table, sending another plate to the floor. \u201cI\u2019m the fucking guest here!\u201d he shouted. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t get a word in edgeways!\u201d In the late afternoon, we sailed back to the Amalfi harbour in time for drinks along the broad street that fronts the beach. Gore ordered Campari-and-soda for everyone. Now in a great mood again, Lenny crossed the street where a string of cheese hung in the open window of a grocery shop. He handed over a stack of bills to pay for them. In an antic mood, he strung them like a necklace around my wife\u2019s neck. He and she waltz in the street as Lenny sang into her ear a famous tune from West Side Story. \u201cParini! I\u2019ve just met a girl named Parini!\u201d Howard looked at me and Gore, and said, \u201cI wish I had his ASCAP.\u201d He referred, of course, to Bernstein\u2019s massive royalty checks. Gore was not amused. \u201cDon\u2019t I make enough for the two of us, Howard?\u201d he wondered. I remember seeing Lenny get into the back of the taxi with Gore, then watching as Lenny\u2019s shock of white hair faded as they turned a corner. I felt as if I\u2019d encountered a life-force on a rare and possibly frightening scale. Leonard Bernstein, a quarter century after his death, stays in my head, a vivid example of life itself spilling unchecked from every pore in a single human being.

The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, said the operation to \u201cfight the terrorist threat\u201d was coordinated with partners in the region. \u201cFrance struck in Syria this morning an Islamic State training camp which threatened the security of our country,\u201d he told reporters at the United Nations, adding that six French jets had struck the Isis camp and warned of more strikes in coming weeks.  The targets were identified during surveillance missions conducted by French jets since 8 September. The French government has insisted that although it is part of the US-led coalition, France will decide who and what to attack independently. The airstrikes mark a turnaround in the French approach to the Syrian civil war. The president\u2019s office said: \u201cWe will strike any time our national security is at stake.\u201d Hollande announced earlier this month that France would carry out surveillance with a view to eventual airstrikes against Isis, citing self-defence as his rationale. The decision came as the refugee crisis and the photo of drowned three-year-old Alan Kurdi sparked shock across the world. But France\u2019s decision was influenced more by last month\u2019s foiled attack by a suspected jihadi gunman who opened fire on a packed Amsterdam-Paris train. As France faces what the government says is a high-level terrorist threat on home soil, and is still coming to term with January\u2019s terrorist attacks by gunmen, who left 17 dead after targeting the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and a Paris kosher supermarket, the president has sought to send an important message to his electorate that France would be ready to strike back if there was any terrorist attempt on France. The surveillance operation in Syria over the past weeks has been described by the government as targeting those who could be planning terrorist attacks on France. The move to airstrikes shows how France\u2019s strategy on Syria has evolved. Until now, France had been launching airstrikes on Isis extremists only in Iraq as part of the US-led coalition, and had resisted airstrikes in Syria because it did not want to be seen to be strengthening President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s hold on the country. France, the former colonial power after the Ottoman Empire broke up, has been one of the most outspoken western powers on Syria from the start of the crisis. Two years ago France was pushing for military action against Assad, resolving to punish Damascus over its use of chemical weapons on the Syrian people, but that move faltered without an international coalition of support. This month the French president ruled out sending ground troops to Syria and said nothing should be done that could strengthen Assad or help him remain in power. \u201cIn the end, Assad must go,\u201d Hollande said. In his statement on Sunday, Hollande said: \u201cCivilian populations must be protected from all forms of violence, that of IS [Islamic State] and other terrorist groups but also the murderous bombardments of Bashar Assad.\u201d Polls show that a majority of the French public favours military action in Syria. But at the French foreign ministry the emphasis is on politics and diplomacy as the only possible solution to the crisis. The announcement of operations in Syria came the day before Hollande joins world leaders for the start of the UN general assembly in New York, where the four-year Syrian war is expected to be at the centre of debate. Iran and Russia have given strong backing to Assad, who is regarded by the US and European countries including France as the instigator of the civil war, which has left an estimated 125,000 to 330,000 people dead and large parts of his country in the hands of Isis. Russia, meanwhile, has alarmed the west by strengthening its military presence in Syria in recent weeks. On Saturday the US secretary of state, John Kerry, met his Iranian counterpart, Mohammad Javad Zarif, to discuss Syria. Washington refuses to accept a peace process that would leave Assad in power and so has backed and armed small \u201cmoderate\u201d rebel groups.

The modern hospice movement began in 1967 when Dame Cicely Saunders, dismayed at the treatment dying people received in hospitals, opened St Christopher\u2019s hospice in Sydenham, south-east London. Since then, more than 250 hospices have been established in the UK, which is now regarded internationally as a pioneer in the provision of palliative care. St Christopher\u2019s was the prototype for a new kind of building \u2013 a mixture of way station, retreat and therapeutic community, even if only for a few weeks or days. Clarke, a Riba prizewinning graduate, was spotted in 1990 by the Newcastle upon Tyne architectural practice Jane Darbyshire &amp; David Kendall (JDDK), early innovators in hospice design. Darbyshire \u2013 whose aesthetic was influenced by a 1960s scholarship to study Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s buildings and a subsequent study year in Japan \u2013 later recalled that, \u201calthough we didn\u2019t have a job for him at the time, we just knew we had to have him\u201d. Clarke stayed with JDDK for the rest of his life, establishing a reputation for his finely wrought approach to designing healthcare buildings in which people might find care and human reassurance, with their personal identity nurtured and left intact. \u201cThe design of the environment,\u201d Clarke wrote in the first of many letters to me when I was researching my book, Modern Hospice Design: The Architecture of Palliative Care (2009), \u201chas many factors which can augment (or deplete) self-worth, particularly centred on issues such as choice and control, privacy and dignity, and continued connectivity to the outside world at large.\u201d     Ian Clarke was snapped up by the architectural firm JDDK, early innovators in hospice design. Photograph: JDDK    When Clarke subsequently showed me round JDDK\u2019s St Oswald\u2019s hospice in Newcastle, I was surprised to discover what a jolly place it was \u2013 an amiable labyrinth of colourful spaces and revealing configurations of light and shadow, interiors and sky, which emulated Aldo van Eyck\u2019s radical reinterpretation of a children\u2019s home in his 1960 Amsterdam orphanage. In his influential essay Building with Feeling (2006), Clarke wrote: \u201cThe design of the environment can make the journey through the building feel like one through a characterful village: incorporating distinct and legible \u2018places\u2019, with, importantly, the essential thresholds or buffers between them which assist in our knowing where we are and what sort of behaviour is appropriate in our progressive journey \u2026 Why can we not get away from the ubiquitous \u2018no-place\u2019 hospital corridors that we are so used to, which often feel like monotonous human vectors, or motorways, simply terminating at the patient bed almost as if it were an arbitrary destination?\u201d Like Saunders, Clarke despaired of conventional hospital design, particularly wards for the elderly where, as he so graphically put it, \u201cdistress is contagious\u201d. Noting that more than 50% of all NHS complaints related to the care of the dying, Clarke adhered to Alvar Aalto\u2019s belief that architecture should \u201cdefend man at his weakest\u201d. Hospitals were, according to Clarke, exercises in sensory deprivation. The retention of a strong sense of self-identity was central to Clarke\u2019s philosophy of space, at the centre of which was the patient\u2019s bed. This, he said, was too often regarded as \u201ca workbench for care delivery\u201d, not the intimate place it had to be. Such sentiments echoed Norbert Elias, whose excoriating account of institutionalised death, The Loneliness of the Dying, concluded that in modern medicine, \u201ccare for the person is secondary to care for their organs\u201d. Clarke thought long and hard about creating spaces for patients that neither replicated the Florence Nightingale pavilion ward nor the Corbusier cell. Although current healthcare practice favours single-room accommodation, Clarke believed that there remained a need for multi-bedded rooms where a small community of patients could occupy separate niches, rather than being isolated separately behind closed doors. The dignity of the dying, he insisted, was not simply solved by greater privacy. He was also critical of the fussy domestic interiors of care homes, believing that modern hospice design could offer \u201can equally reassuring and hopefully uplifting atmosphere as the home\u201d, but serenely free of clutter. Not a place of death, but a house of life. Clarke grew up in Stockport, where he attended Stockport grammar school, and where his own father practised as an architect. He met his wife, Judith Bulmer, in 1994 and they married the following year. They shared a love of gardening, art, craft and of all things Japanese. In 2012, the couple finally visited Japan, where Ian bemused passers-by with his meticulous photographing of doors, windows, joinery details, floor surfaces, and all the minutiae of well-made things. From 2000 onwards, and as a newly appointed director, Clarke led JDDK\u2019s work at St Gemma\u2019s hospice, Leeds; St Oswald\u2019s hospice, Newcastle; St Patrick\u2019s University hospital, Cork (in collaboration with Scott Tallon Walker); Wear Referrals Veterinary hospital, Sedgefield; St Columba\u2019s hospice, Edinburgh; Highland hospice, Inverness; Marie Curie hospices in Glasgow and Solihull; and Thorpe Hall Hospice in Peterborough for Sue Ryder.

A team funded by the Medical Research Council say their investigations into smokers who survive their habit into old age could hold the key to better treatment for diseases such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).  They say their findings, which have also identified the genetic differences which affect whether a person is more likely to get addicted to cigarettes, could also lead to better interventions to help people quit.   Related: Why is nicotine addictive? You asked Google \u2013 here\u2019s the answer | Marc Lewis    The team, led by Professors Ian Hall at the University of Nottingham and Martin Tobin at the University of Leicester, found certain DNA profiles had a lower risk of COPD \u2013 a collection of lung disorders including bronchitis and emphysema \u2013 than others, despite external factors such as smoking. These genes appeared to affect the way lungs grow and respond to injury. On the other hand, there were also certain DNA profiles that had a higher risk of COPD, explaining why some people develop the disease despite never having touched a cigarette in their lives.  However, the findings are not a green light for a lucky few to strike up a 40-a-day habit. Tobin said: \u201cSmoking is the biggest lifestyle risk factor for COPD. Many, but not all, smokers develop the disease. Genetics play a big part, as they do in smoking behaviour. \u201cOur research helps to tell us why, paving the way for improved prevention and treatment. Stopping smoking is the best way to prevent smoking-related diseases such as COPD, cancers and heart disease.\u201d Hall and Tobin\u2019s team were also able to identify five sections of DNA shown for the first time to relate to being a heavy smoker. These seemed to affect the brain\u2019s function in response to nicotine, although their precise role still needs to be confirmed. Further investigation could lead to a better understanding of smokers\u2019 addictions, and how to help them beat them. Hall said: \u201cThe drugs we use to prevent or treat diseases target the proteins in our bodies, and our genes influence the production of proteins. Understanding how the genes are involved in disease or in addiction to tobacco, can help us design and develop better and more targeted treatments that are likely to be more effective and have fewer side effects.\u201d   Related: Is Britain ready for outdoor smoking bans?

The team selected 50,000 of these participants based on their lung health and whether or not they were heavy smokers or had never smoked. They compared these factors with 28 million genetic variants in each participant, finding parts of the human genome never before associated with a person\u2019s lung health, as well as the five sections of DNA shown for the first time to relate to being a heavy smoker. The findings were presented at this year\u2019s European Respiratory Society meeting in Amsterdam and are published in the Lancet Respiratory Medicine.

It tells the story of her family who live in Frankfurt, Germany and suddenly have to go into hiding as a result of Hitler and the Nazi Party\u2019s treatment of Jews in Europe during the second world war. They escape to Amsterdam where they go into hiding with other Jews. The diary ends suddenly on 1 August 1944. There are many important messages in this book, but the most important message is that all people have the right to live in freedom. Anne\u2019s story shows us that just because people may be a different religion or race, doesn\u2019t mean that they should be treated differently. The terrible treatment of Jewish people during the war has shown this. Her diary shows us things that people don\u2019t think about now, for example how every day the people in hiding worried about maybe being found and punished.      I liked that Anne was a really happy and cheerful person even though she and her family were in an awful situation. Anne enjoyed writing and describing others. She was talkative and inquisitive and could be selfish. She was a typical teenage girl and she didn\u2019t always understand how difficult life was for her mother and the other adults around her. She commented on the people who shared their hiding space. Sometimes this wasn\u2019t very nice, but it shows how everybody\u2019s life was challenging because they had to be quiet and not bring attention to themselves.

Ask where they were when Lehman Brothers collapsed, and many will struggle even to remember the correct year. The 158-year-old Wall Street bank filed for bankruptcy on 15 September 2008. As the news broke, insiders experienced an atmosphere of unprecedented panic. One former investment banker recalled: \u201cI thought: so this is what the threat of war must feel like. I remember looking out of the window and seeing the buses drive by. People everywhere going through a normal working day \u2013 or so they thought. I realised: they have no idea. I called my father from the office to tell him to transfer all his savings to a safer bank. Going home that day, I was genuinely terrified.\u201d A veteran at a small credit rating agency who spent his whole career in the City of London told me with genuine emotion: \u201cIt was terrifying. Absolutely terrifying. We came so close to a global meltdown.\u201d He had been on holiday in the week Lehman went bust. \u201cI remember opening up the paper every day and going: \u2018Oh my God.\u2019 I was on my BlackBerry following events. Confusion, embarrassment, incredulity ... I went through the whole gamut of human emotions. At some point my wife threatened to throw my BlackBerry in the lake if I didn\u2019t stop reading on my phone. I couldn\u2019t stop.\u201d Other financial workers in the City, who were at their desks after Lehman defaulted, described colleagues sitting frozen before their screens, paralysed \u2013 unable to act even when there was easy money to be made. Things were looking so bad, they said, that some got on the phone to their families: \u201cGet as much money from the ATM as you can.\u201d \u201cRush to the supermarket to hoard food.\u201d \u201cBuy gold.\u201d \u201cGet everything ready to evacuate the kids to the country.\u201d As they recalled those days, there was often a note of shame in their voices, as if they felt humiliated by the memory of their vulnerability. Even some of the most macho traders became visibly uncomfortable. One said to me in a grim voice: \u201cThat was scary, mate. I mean, not film scary. Really scary.\u201d I spent two years, from 2011 to 2013, interviewing about 200 bankers and financial workers as part of an investigation into banking culture in the City of London after the crash. Not everyone I spoke to had been so terrified in the days and weeks after Lehman collapsed. But the ones who had phoned their families in panic explained to me that what they were afraid of was the domino effect. The collapse of a global megabank such as Lehman could cause the financial system to come to a halt, seize up and then implode. Not only would this mean that we could no longer withdraw our money from banks, it would also mean that lines of credit would stop. As the fund manager George Cooper put it in his book The Origin of Financial Crises: \u201cThis financial crisis came perilously close to causing a systemic failure of the global financial system. Had this occurred, global trade would have ceased to function within a very short period of time.\u201d Remember that this is the age of just-in-time inventory management, Cooper added \u2013 meaning supermarkets have very small stocks. With impeccable understatement, he said: \u201cIt is sobering to contemplate the consequences of interrupting food supplies to the world\u2019s major cities for even a few days.\u201d      These were the dominos threatening to fall in 2008. The next tile would be hundreds of millions of people worldwide all learning at the same time that they had lost access to their bank accounts and that supplies to their supermarkets, pharmacies and petrol stations had frozen. The TV images that have come to define this whole episode \u2013 defeated-looking Lehman employees carrying boxes of their belongings through Wall Street \u2013 have become objects of satire. As if it were only a matter of a few hundred overpaid people losing their jobs: Look at the Masters of the Universe now, brought down to our level! In reality, those cardboard box-carrying bankers were the beginning of what could very well have been a genuine breakdown of society. Although we did not quite fall off the edge after the crash in the way some bankers were anticipating, the painful effects are still being felt in almost every sector. At this distance, however, seven years on, it\u2019s hard to see what has changed. And if nothing has changed, it could all happen again. * * * A typical education in the west leaves you with more insight into ancient Rome or Egypt than into our financial system \u2013 and while there are plenty of books and DVDs for lay people about, say, quantum mechanics, evolution or the human genome, before the crash there was virtually nothing to explain finance to outsiders in accessible language. The City, as John Lanchester put it in his book about the 2008 crash, Whoops!, is still \u201ca far-off country of which we know little\u201d. As a result, ordinary people trying to form an opinion about finance over the past decades have had very little to go on, and many seem to have latched on to the images provided by films and TV.   Related: Sign up to the long read email    The British stereotype of the boring banker began to change in the 80s when finance was deregulated. Following Ronald Reagan\u2019s dictum, \u201cGovernment is not the solution to the problem, it is the problem\u201d, banks were allowed to unite under one roof activities that regulation had previously required to be divided between separate firms and banks. They were able to grow to sizes many times bigger than a country\u2019s GDP \u2013 the assumption being that the market would be self-regulating. The changes also meant that bankers became immensely powerful. Hollywood provided the City with a new hero: the financier Gordon Gekko, from Oliver Stone\u2019s 1987 film Wall Street, who brought us the phrase \u201cGreed is good\u201d. In his portrait of bond traders\u2019 raging ambition, Bonfire of the Vanities, novelist Tom Wolfe coined the term \u201cMasters of the Universe\u201d. It all seemed innocent entertainment, before 2008: tales about a far-off country where boys behaved badly, scandalously even, but above all, reassuringly far away from the comfort and safety of our own homes, something like watching a Quentin Tarantino film or an episode of The Sopranos. This was the era when a Labour chancellor, Gordon Brown, could give a speech to a gathering of bankers and asset managers and tell them: \u201cThe financial services sector in Britain, and the City of London at the centre of it, is a great example of a highly skilled, high value-added, talent-driven industry that shows how we can excel in a world of global competition. Britain needs more of the vigour, ingenuity and aspiration that you already demonstrate that is the hallmark of your success.\u201d Those words were spoken in 2007, and a year later the world found itself in the middle of the biggest financial panic since the 1930s. In the end, it was only through a combination of pure luck, extremely expensive nationalisations and bailouts, the lowest interest rates in recorded history plus an ongoing experiment in mass money printing, that total meltdown was averted. The post-Lehman panic was followed by a wave of investigations and reconstructions by journalists, writers and politicians. More than 300 books have been published about the crash in English alone. Every western country held extensive hearings and produced detailed recommendations. Everything you need to know about what is wrong with finance and the banks today is in their reports; the problem is that there is so much more that needs to be explained. Most areas inside banking had little or nothing to do with the crash, while many players outside banking bore a heavy responsibility, too, including insurers, credit rating agencies, accountancy firms, financial law firms, central banks, regulators and politicians. Investors such as pension funds had been egging the banks on to make more profits by taking more risk. Unless you had a firm understanding of finance, the causes of the crash were very unclear, and this must be part of the reason why the clearest and most urgent lesson of all would get lost or buried: the financial system itself had become dangerously flawed.    It\u2019s back to business as usual. We went from 'We nearly died from this'  to 'We survived this.'    After the crash of 2008, ignorance among the general public, reticence among complicit mainstream politicians and a deeply skewed and sensationalist portrayal of finance in the mass media conspired to create the narrative that the crash was caused by greed or by some other character flaw in individual bankers: psychopathy, gambling addiction or cocaine use. (A whole genre of City memoirs sprang up with titles such as Binge Trading: The Real Inside Story of Cash, Cocaine and Corruption in the City. Gordon Gekko returned for a sequel, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, and Leonardo di Caprio scored an immense hit playing the title role in The Wolf of Wall Street, about a whoring and cocaine-snorting financial fraudster.) From there it was a small step to the notion that we can fix finance by getting rid of the \u201cjerks\u201d, as the plain speaking former Barclays CEO Bob Diamond put it. When Diamond was forced to resign in July 2012 over a scandal involving interest rate rigging by his traders, his successor, Antony Jenkins, also promised to focus on changing the culture. And so the same banks that brought us the mess of 2008 eagerly embraced the need for cultural change \u2013 which alone should arouse our suspicions. If there is one recurring theme in the many conversations I had with City insiders, it was the need for structural rather than cultural change; not so much different bankers, but a different system. \u201cSometimes I feel as if finance has reacted to the crisis the way a motorist might after a near-accident,\u201d said the City veteran at a small credit rating agency whose wife had almost chucked his phone into a lake at the height of the panic. \u201cThere is the adrenaline surge directly after the lucky escape, followed by the huge shock when you realise what could have happened. But as the journey continues and the scene recedes in the rear-view mirror, you tell yourself: maybe it wasn\u2019t that bad. The memory of your panic fades, and you even begin to misremember what happened. Was it really that bad?\u201d He was a soft-spoken man, the sort to send a text message if he is going to be five minutes late to a meeting. But now he was really angry: \u201cIf you had told people at the height of the crisis that years later we\u2019d have had no fundamental changes, nobody would have believed you. Such was the panic and fear. But here we are. It\u2019s back to business as usual. We went from \u2018We nearly died from this\u2019 to \u2018We survived this\u2019.\u201d * * * The City is governed by a code of silence and fear of publicity; those caught talking to the press without a PR officer present could be sacked or sued. But once I had persuaded City insiders to talk (always and only on condition of anonymity), they were remarkably forthcoming. \u201cI have the wrong accent and I went to a shit school,\u201d said one City veteran, after explaining that for many years he had made millions at a top bank only to move to an even better-paying hedge fund. \u201cForty years ago, I wouldn\u2019t even have been given an interview in the City. Finance today is fiercely meritocratic. Doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re gay or black or working class, if you can do something better than the other person, you\u2019ll move up.\u201d He was a mathematician by training, and his direct manner reminded me of stallholders at the biggest open market in my hometown of Amsterdam \u2013 tough guys with a highly developed mistrust of pretentiousness. He fuelled himself with Diet Coke and coffee and teased me for ordering cranberry juice. Before he was recruited by the bank in the early 1990s, he had taught at a university; his only idea of an investment bank was based on two books he had read: Liar\u2019s Poker by Michael Lewis and Barbarians at the Gate by Bryan Burrough and John Helyar. \u201cTraders as loud, crass, bad-mouthed, macho dickheads. The sort of guys with red braces who shout \u2018buy, buy, sell, sell\u2019 into their phones and have eating competitions.\u201d Many outsiders still believe that these are the people occupying the top positions in big banks, he said, and taking the biggest risks. \u201cThat\u2019s over,\u201d he told me. \u201cSome of the best traders are now women. Totally unassuming, cerebral and talented. Trading is no longer a balls job. It\u2019s a brains job. To be sure, the kind of maths traders now have to be able to do is not of the wildly hard variety. But it requires real skills in that area.\u201d He described the basic flaw in the banking system as it has evolved over the past decades: other people\u2019s money. Until deregulation began to liberate finance from the constraints placed on it after the last major crash in the 1930s, risky banking in the City was carried out in firms that were organised as partnerships, which were not listed on the stock exchange. The partners owned and ran the firm \u2013 and when things went wrong, they were liable. Hence the system of bonuses: if you put your personal fortune on the line and things go well, it stands to reason that you deserve a big bonus. Because if things go the other way, you are personally liable for the losses.      Back in the days when his bank was still a partnership, the former banker had drawn on his gift for maths to build a complex financial product that he thought was very clever. \u201cI was very new and maybe a bit cocky,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I went over to the head of trading and showed it to him, saying, \u2018Look, we can make a lot of money with this.\u2019 The head of trading was a partner in the traditional sense. He looked at me and replied: \u2018Don\u2019t forget, this is my money you\u2019re fucking with.\u2019\u201d The problem with the way banks are now organised is not that they take risks \u2013 that is their job. The problem with today\u2019s banks is that those who accept the risks are no longer those who get stuck with the bill. A bank that is listed on the stock market loses control to the new owners; that is, the shareholders. When these shareholders, which can include insurers, wealthy dynasties or pension funds, start demanding ever greater profits, then greater profits are what you have to deliver. In 2007, in an inadvertent moment of candour, the then CEO of the megabank Citigroup, Charles O Prince, summarised this relationship: \u201cAs long as the music is playing, you\u2019ve got to get up and dance.\u201d This dynamic became all the more dangerous as globalisation began to create a single market for finance. Not only were partnerships allowed to be listed on the stock exchange or taken over by a publicly listed bank, they were also allowed to go on a global shopping spree. Wave after wave of mergers and acquisitions meant banks could generate higher profits than the GDPs of their host countries, resulting in the institutions that we now know as \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d \u2013 so big that if they go bust, they can bring down the system with them. When excessive risk turns sour, it\u2019s the taxpayer who suffers. In a functioning free market system, incompetence and recklessness are punished by failure and bankruptcy. But there is currently no functioning free market at the centre of the global free market system. I heard City workers scoff at the employees of banks that cannot be allowed to fail \u2013 calling them overpaid civil servants who play a game they cannot lose. Risk-taking at a bank that will always be saved, they said, is like playing Russian roulette with someone else\u2019s head.    The problem with today\u2019s banks is that those who accept the risks are no longer those who get stuck with the bill    In the old days, veterans told me, there was an office party almost every Friday: celebrating the anniversary of someone who had stayed with the firm for 20 years or longer. That is all over now, and in its place has come a hire-and-fire culture characterised by an absence of loyalty on either side. Employment in the City is now a purely transactional affair. It is exceedingly rare to find people who have stayed with the same bank for their entire career. Many of the insiders I spoke to had stories about abrupt sackings: You get a call from a colleague, saying: \u201cLook, could you do me a favour and get my coat and bag?\u201d She is standing outside with a blocked security pass. One morning, you swipe your pass only to hear a beep and find your entrance barred. You turn to the receptionist who says, after a glance at her computer screen, \u201cWould you please have a seat over there until somebody comes to fetch you?\u201d In the City, sudden dismissals of this kind have a name: \u201cexecutions\u201d. Add to these the quarterly \u201cwaves\u201d when headquarters decides to reduce headcount and a certain percentage of staff worldwide are given the sack, all on one day. Some banks operate a \u201ccull\u201d. Every year, prestigious banks such as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan routinely fire their least profitable staff. \u201cWhen the cull comes ...\u201d people would say, or: \u201cOh yes, we cull.\u201d \u201cWhen you can be out of the door in five minutes, your horizon becomes five minutes,\u201d one City worker told me. Another asked: \u201cWhy would I treat my bank any better than my bank treats me?\u201d If the threat of being culled influenced bankers\u2019 behaviour through fear, there were also powerful motivations. Deregulation has allowed perverse incentives into the very fabric of global finance. People are faced with immense temptations to take risks with their bank\u2019s capital or reputation, knowing that if they don\u2019t act on them, their colleague across the desk will. Before the deregulation of the 80s and 90s, the City was far from perfect: it was a snobbish, antisemitic and misogynistic place. But the City \u2013 and Wall Street \u2013 of old was a world that Gus Levy, head of Goldman Sachs in the 70s, famously described as \u201clong term greedy\u201d; you made money with your client and your firm. Because partners were personally liable, they had an interest in keeping their firm on a manageable scale and making sure their employees told them of any risks. In a few decades, this system has evolved into one that Levy called \u201cshort term greedy\u201d; you make money at the expense of the client, of the bank, of the shareholder or of the taxpayer. This did not happen because bankers suddenly became evil, but because the incentives fundamentally changed. Until the mid 80s, the London Stock Exchange\u2019s motto was dictum meum pactum, \u201cmy word is my bond\u201d. These days the governing principle is caveat emptor, or \u201cbuyer beware\u201d \u2013 it is effectively up to the professional investor to figure out what the bank is offering. As one builder of complex financial products explained to me: \u201cYou have got to read the small print. You need to bring in a lawyer who explains it to you before you buy these things.\u201d * * * Perhaps the most terrifying interview of all the 200 I recorded was with a senior regulator. It was not only what he said but how he said it: as if the status quo was simply unassailable. Ultimately, he explained, regulators \u2013 the government agencies that ensure the financial sector is safe and compliant \u2013 rely on self-declaration; what is presented by a bank\u2019s internal management. The trouble, he said with a calm smile, is that a bank\u2019s internal management often doesn\u2019t know what\u2019s going on because banks today are so vast and complex. He did not think he had ever been deliberately lied to, although he acknowledged that, obviously, he couldn\u2019t know for sure. \u201cThe real threat is not a bank\u2019s management hiding things from us, it\u2019s the management not knowing themselves what the risks are.\u201d He talked about the culture of fear and how people are not managing their actions for the benefit of their bank. Instead, \u201cthey are managing their career\u201d. He believed that the crash had been more \u201ccock-up than conspiracy\u201d. Bank management is in conflict, he pointed out: \u201cWhat is good for the long term of the bank or the country may not be what is best for their own short-term career or bonus.\u201d If the problem with finance is perverse incentives, then the insistence on greed as the cause for the crash is part of the problem. There is a lot of greed in the City, as there is elsewhere in society. But if you blame the crash on character flaws in individuals you imply that the system itself is fine, all we need to do is to smoke out the crooks, the gambling addicts, the coke-snorters, the sexists, the psychopaths. Human beings always have at least some scope for choice, hence the differences in culture between banks. Still, human behaviour is largely determined by incentives, and in the current set-up, these are sending individual bankers, desks or divisions within banks \u2013 as well as the banks themselves \u2013 in the wrong direction. How hard would it be to change those incentives? From the viewpoint of those I interviewed, not hard at all. First of all, banks could be chopped up into units that can safely go bust \u2013 meaning they could never blackmail us again. Banks should not have multiple activities going on under one roof with inherent conflicts of interest. Banks should not be allowed to build, sell or own overly complex financial products \u2013 clients should be able to comprehend what they buy and investors understand the balance sheet. Finally, the penalty should land on the same head as the bonus, meaning nobody should have more reason to lie awake at night worrying over the risks to the bank\u2019s capital or reputation than the bankers themselves. You might expect all major political parties to have come out by now with their vision of a stable and productive financial sector. But this is not what has happened. Not that there has been no reform. Banks are taxed when they get beyond a certain size, for example, and all banks must now finance a larger part of their risks with equity rather than borrowed money. American banks are banned from using their own capital to speculate and invest in the markets, and the European commission, or national governments, have forced a few banks to shrink or sell off their investment bank activities \u2013 the Dutch bank ING, for example, was told to sell off its insurance arm, Nationale Nederlanden. But change has been largely cosmetic, leaving the sector\u2019s basic architecture intact. If a bank collapses, the new European banking union \u2013 set up in 2012 to transfer banking policy from a national to a European level \u2013 is meant to step in and wind it down in an orderly fashion. But who is propping up that European banking union, if several banks should fail at the same time? The taxpayer. A bonus cap in banking was introduced by the EU, so instead of paying widely publicised million-pound bonuses, banks now simply offer higher salaries.    If you blame the crash on character flaws in individuals you imply that the system itself is fine    Perhaps the most promising change in the UK is the so-called \u201csenior person regime\u201d that makes it possible to prosecute bankers for reckless behaviour \u2013 but only after they have wrecked their bank. Virtually all big banks remain publicly listed or are doing everything they can to get back on the stock exchange. They have never allowed staff to talk openly about what went wrong before 2008 and why. The code of silence remains intact. The banks have not sacked the accountancy firms or credit rating agencies that failed to raise the alarm over the erroneous or misleading items on their balance sheets. Banks have certainly not joined hands to fight for a globally enforced increase in capital buffers (the minimum capital they are required to hold), which could help them absorb and survive severe losses. Indeed, they have spent millions lobbying to keep any increase in buffers as low as possible. \u201cBack to business as usual.\u201d This is how many interviewees described the post-crash atmosphere in the City. As the senior regulator put it with chilling equanimity: \u201cIs the sector fixed, after the crisis? I don\u2019t think so.\u201d What we have now, he added, is \u201cwhat you get with free-market capitalism \u2013 consolidation of all wealth into fewer and fewer banks, which end up dividing up the market as a cartel.\u201d * * * When it comes to global finance, the most startling news isn\u2019t news at all; the important facts have been known for a long time among insiders. The problem goes much deeper: the sector has become immune to exposure. \u201cIf I had a million pounds for every time I have heard a possible reform opposed because \u2018it wouldn\u2019t have prevented Northern Rock or Lehman Brothers going bust\u2019, I might now have enough money to bail out a bank,\u201d the Financial Times columnist John Kay wrote in 2013. \u201cThe objective of reform is not to prevent Northern Rock or Lehman going bust ... The problem revealed by the 2007-08 crisis was not that some financial services companies collapsed, but that there was no means of handling their failure without endangering the entire global financial system.\u201d Only last year Andrew Haldane, chief economist at the Bank of England, told the German magazine Der Spiegel that the balances of the big banks are \u201cthe blackest of black holes\u201d. Haldane is responsible for the stability of the financial sector as a whole. He knowingly told a journalist that he couldn\u2019t possibly have an idea of what the banks have on their books. And? Nothing happened. It made sense in 2008 for those in the know not to deepen the panic by talking about it. Indeed, one of the most powerful figures in the EU in 2008, the almost supernaturally levelheaded Herman van Rompuy, waited until 2014 to acknowledge in an interview that he had seen the system come within \u201ca few millimetres of total implosion\u201d. But because the general public was left in the dark, there was never enough political capital to take on the banks. Compare this to the 1930s in the US, when the crash was allowed to play out, giving Franklin D Roosevelt the chance to bring in simple and strong new laws that kept the financial sector healthy for many decades \u2013 until Reagan and Thatcher undid one part, and Clinton and Blair the other.      Tony Blair is now making a reported \u00a32.5m a year as adviser to JP Morgan, while the former US Treasury secretary Timothy Geithner and the former secretary of state Hillary Clinton have been paid upwards of $100,000 a speech to address small audiences at global banks. It is tempting to see corruption in all this, but it seems more likely that, over the past decades, politicians as well as regulators have come to identify themselves with the financial sector they are supposed to be regulating. The term here is \u201ccognitive capture\u201d, a concept popularised by the economist and former Financial Times columnist Willem Buiter, who described it as over-identification between the regulator and the regulated \u2013 or \u201cexcess sensitivity of the Fed to financial market and financial sector concerns and fears\u201d. With corruption, you are given money to do something you would not have done otherwise. Capture is more subtle and no longer requires a transfer of funds \u2013 since the politician, academic or regulator has started to believe that the world works in the way that bankers say it does. Sadly, Willem Buiter never wrote a definitive account of capture; he no longer works in academia and journalism. He has moved to the megabank Citigroup. The European commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, memorably said in 2013 that European politicians know very well what needs to be done to save the economy. They just don\u2019t know how to get elected after doing it. A similar point could be made about the major parties in this country: they know very well what needs to be done to make finance safe again. They just don\u2019t know where their campaign donations and second careers are going to come from once they have done it. Still, the complicity of mainstream politicians is not the whole story. Finance today is global, while democratically legitimate politics operates on a national level. Banks can play off one country or block of countries against the other, threatening to pack up and leave if a piece of regulation should be introduced that doesn\u2019t agree with them. And they do, shamelessly. \u201cOK, let us assume our country takes on its financial sector,\u201d a mainstream European politician told me. \u201cIn that case, our banks and financial firms simply move elsewhere, meaning we will have lost our voice in international forums. Meanwhile, globally, nothing has changed.\u201d This then opens up the most difficult question of all: how is the global financial sector to be brought back under control if there is no global political authority capable of challenging it? Seven years after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, it is often said that nothing was learned from the crash. This is too optimistic. The big banks have surely drawn a lesson from the crash and its aftermath: that in the end there is very little they will not get away with.

Today, however, the experience around these stories, to draw customers even closer, is becoming more important, whether online, on the high street or at a brand event. As more and more businesses look for new ways to entice customers, here are some thoughts about what makes these experiences work. Elevate every detail Disneyland was the original visitor experience and is perhaps still the best. Walt Disney was the master of engaging customers, telling magical stories and introducing all-singing, all-dancing staff, not to mention the three o\u2019clock parade that brought the world of Mickey Mouse to life. Focusing on and elevating every detail, from talking trees to the interactive characters along Main Street, is why the theme park attracted 16.7 million visitors in 2014. Today, the brand is making technology a seamless part of the visitor experience, which is stronger for it. Its MagicBand system allows for a more carefree visit to another of its experiences, Walt Disney World. The band takes care of long queues, allocates seats at particular shows and makes eating out fuss-free. It also unlocks \u201cspecial surprises\u201d dotted around the resort, personalised for the user. All this goes some way to making a visit to the resort worth its premium charge, because Disney has optimised every second of your time, delivering more delight per minute. But elevating the ordinary in a visitor experience isn\u2019t only for fairytale settings. While Disney worked hard to eliminate experience-dampening frustrations, Banksy\u2019s Dismaland worked hard to create the ultimate depressing day out. The parody park packaged itself as a family day out, yet unsuitable for children, and an interactive art exhibition, yet intent on being as unremarkable as possible. With long queues at the front gate (and at every onward point) and deliberately grumpy and irritable staff, Banksy\u2019s dystopia proved that even dismal experiences can be alluring if you pay attention to the small stuff. The experience drew 150,000 visitors in six short weeks, giving Weston-super-Mare a \u00a320m economic boost. Immersion in legends  Events are naturally more arresting when you\u2019re a part of them, not merely a spectator. By their very nature, immersive experiences can make even the most mysterious of brands deeply understood. It\u2019s something we at StartJG are working on in the All Blacks Experience, to launch in Auckland, New Zealand in 2017. The jet black jerseys, the faultless team spirit and, of course, the haka have turned the All Blacks into rugby\u2019s most famous brand. But it\u2019s what makes them different to other sports teams that we want to address in this brand experience. Seasoned brand managers know that immersion has more impact than external promotions, which is why the experience is being built using the science of emotional sensory design. Basically, we want to make people feel. Tourists and fans will be able to experience Maori culture and its connection with the team\u2019s passionate belief system, to locker-room rituals and the feeling of facing the team on the pitch. They\u2019ll even get the chance to test their skill against the players. Embedded in heritage, this will be an access-all-areas experience that makes visitors happy, sad, inspired, scared and more. It will hopefully enrich them and connect them directly to New Zealand\u2019s rugby culture. Conquer through curiosity  People are fascinated by oddities. It\u2019s this insight that drove Heineken to \u201clitter\u201d the streets of Amsterdam with strategically placed, GPS-enabled beer bottles, each cleverly containing a compass to take curious minds straight to the Heineken Experience. It worked; the curiosity test helped clinch 730,000 customers in 2014 alone.  Based on the premise that handing out flyers doesn\u2019t always capture people\u2019s curiosity, the ploy also communicated the inventive nature of the brand. The event has had a strong impact in reshaping how Heineken is perceived: no longer just a beer, but playful and entertaining. To make a real difference, brands must go much further than simply advertising. Exposing the deeper truths of a brand and allowing people to touch, feel and interact with them, can attract new advocates and customers.

But on a recent Sunday, another battle was raging at the Armory. This was the final day of the first New York coffee festival, a convocation for the caffeine-obsessed.  In the massive drill hall, coffee roasters, espresso machine manufacturers, bean specialists and milk mongers gathered to sing the praise of their favourite beverage.     Coffee experts at work. Photograph: Devon Knight    Starbucks was also there, with a large booth called Starbucks Reserve, complete with hipster sans serif type and fancy coffee machines like siphons and Clovers. Jordan Michelman, the bearded, bespectacled editor of the coffee website Sprudge.com, said the multinational was going through a \u201cmidlife crisis. They\u2019re like a dad who goes out to buy a Ferrari to try to be cool.\u201d Nearby, an artisanal apron maker from Amsterdam sold leather aprons at a discount. Normally $199, the aprons were going for just $125.  But by far the most action was taking place in the southeast corner of the hall, where a custom-built bar had been constructed, and the Coffee Masters competition was in full pitched battle. Humanity\u2019s urge to transform every action into a competition has never been more easily gratified. In this era of late-period reality television, everything from dating to cooking to haggling has become a sport. It was only a matter of time before baristas, too, could earn the chance for glory through a latte.      The Coffee Masters competition follows in the footsteps of the World Barista Championships. Photograph: Devon Knight    The Coffee Masters competition, which held its inaugural event in London in May, is actually not the first or even the largest barista competition. That laurel belongs to the World Barista Championships, first held in Monte Carlo in 2000.  There is a cottage industry of coffee-related competitions, from the US Latte Art Championships to the World\u2019s Richest Barista Competition. Each event is a highly specialized, highly pressurized contest into which competitors sink thousands of dollars and hundreds of hours. Few offer substantial monetary prizes. But then again, neither do the Olympics.  Today, however, there is a $5,000 prize. The Coffee Masters is a multidisciplinary on-the-fly marathon. \u201cIf the World Barista Competition is the F1 of coffee competitions,\u201d said Michelman, \u201cthis is the Nascar.\u201d The 20 selected contestants \u2013 culled from 40 video applications \u2013 must prove adept in many departments. They have to be skilled at cupping, which is the art of tasting coffee, here demonstrated by tasting six cups of coffee, memorizing their flavor profiles and rearranging them in order; brewing, in which the barista must brew a coffee using manual methods to the best of his or her ability; signature drink, in which a signature coffee-based cocktail is made; espresso blending, which is what it sounds like; latte art, the crowd favorite; and handling orders, a skill proven by making 10 drinks in nine minutes.     An espresso-based cocktail. Photograph: Devon Knight     As Sunday evening approached, Ryan Fischer, a bearded barista from Commonwealth Coffee in Denver, Colorado, and Ben \u201cThe Latte Art Cowboy\u201d Murrow from Melbourne, Australia\u2019s St Ali\u2019s coffee roasters, battled in the final round. This was the third day of the competition and both men were suffering from fatigue and over-caffeination, which turns out to be a common malady in barista competitions.  This was the second hourlong stretch of the day, and even the emcees sounded adrift. With nothing left to announce, Michelman began quizzing Frankowski about US state capitals. \u201cCapital of Vermont?\u201d he asked. \u201cProvidence,\u201d was Frankowski\u2019s incorrect answer. The crowd shifted in their seats as San Francisco was incorrectly named capital of California and Anchorage the capital of Alaska.  Meanwhile, at their machines, the baristas were considering how best to brew the perfect cup of coffee. It was high drama. Fischer had chosen a Kalita Wave, famous for its flat bottom. Murrow had chosen a Ceramic Hario V60, for a little more flow. They contemplated temperature and worked feverishly.  According to Frankowski, Coffee Masters is meant to be \u201cpart game show, part competition\u201d but after five hours, it felt more like an ordeal. \u201cSeems stressful,\u201d said one observer, before wandering off to sample espresso.  Perhaps the most lively of the disciplines was latte art, in which competitors were asked to execute a complex pattern determined by a special set of latte art dice.  Among the motifs were a rosette, a heart and a swan. Though, there were also a phoenix, which looked like an advanced swan, and a \u201cfree pour\u201d. Morrow, who has competed in latte art competitions in the past, proved the more adept man when it came to dairy drawing. His swans were so realistic they could have taken flight from the cappuccinos which held them.     Brewing at the Coffee Masters competition. Photograph: Devon Knight    As the baristas sweated it out, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder whether barista competitions are more like competitive eating bouts or track and field events.  Competitive eating really has no practical application. It isn\u2019t eating done very well. It\u2019s eating done very quickly. A sprint, on the other hand, is running done exceedingly well. It is the highest form running takes.  Was becoming a \u201ccoffee master\u201d more like eating 62 hot dogs in 10 minutes or running a mile in less than four minutes?  According to Jeffrey Young, whose company created the New York coffee festival, the Coffee Masters competition \u201cis all about baristas becoming better and better at their job\u201d. But according to Michelman, the allure of a competition can be destructive. \u201cI know some baristas,\u201d he said, \u201cwho have gone completely bankrupt from the competitive coffee world.

Walker was responding to a set of proposals from Transport for London (TfL), revealed on Tuesday, which are said to reflect the mayor\u2019s concerns about traffic congestion in London. Johnson is the chair of TfL. The IoD boss called the measures \u201cheavy-handed\u201d and said they would \u201cdamage London\u2019s reputation for innovation\u201d. Walker said: \u201cTfL is right to take an interest in the way companies like Uber have disrupted the way we travel around the capital.

Walker\u2019s outburst came as Uber fought back against a possible crackdown on its services with the publication of a petition that was signed by nearly 90,000 Londoners by mid-afternoon.  The measures being considered by TfL could include the introduction of an interval of at least five minutes between a booking and the start of a journey.  Other proposals involve a requirement for drivers to pass an English language test and a map reading assessment, while firms could have to operate a fixed landline telephone and accept bookings up to seven days in advance.  The escalating row over the future of Uber\u2019s service in London took place against the background of further controversies in Europe. Earlier this week, Dutch police raided Uber\u2019s office in Amsterdam as part of a criminal investigation and on Wednesday two executives from the firm appeared in Paris for the start of a trial, facing a range of charges, including some under a law that bans the company\u2019s low-cost Uberpop car-sharing service. In London, TfL chief operating officer for surface transport, Garrett Emmerson, said: \u201cWe are launching a public consultation in order to inform and improve the regulations that govern the capital\u2019s private hire trade.\u201d  Uber is urging its customers to sign the petition, saying \u201cthese rules make no sense\u201d.

Titian\u2019s Diana and Actaeon, 1556-59, bought jointly by the National Gallery and National Galleries of Scotland. Photograph: The National Gallery    Yes, if you count England and Scotland as separate countries. The National Gallery in London and the National Galleries of Scotland jointly purchased two masterpieces by Titian a few years ago. Diana and Actaeon and Diana and Callisto are now shown alternately between the two galleries. And if you\u2019ve ever wondered why the National Galleries of Scotland and the V&amp;A both have a version of Canova\u2019s Three Graces, it\u2019s the same sculpture, jointly owned.  But in sharing two Rembrandts \u2013 wedding portraits of Maerten Soolmans and Oopjen Coppit painted in 1634 \u2013 across the borders of two nation states, France and the Netherlands are pointing the way for the custodianship of great art to become truly universal. No great artist belongs to one nation alone. Rembrandt is the property of the world. On traditional nationalist lines, the Dutch claim on him might seem secure: he never travelled outside his own country. But his art has. Even in his lifetime, Rembrandt sold works abroad. His great painting Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer was nearly lost while being sent by ship to Sicily. Today, it hangs in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. There are also Rembrandts of the highest calibre in St Petersburg, Stockholm, London, Edinburgh, Paris and, of course, Amsterdam, where the artist lived, worked and suffered.  Rembrandt\u2019s universality is not a coincidence. He himself was open to influences from all over Europe. His art abounds in conscious echoes of the Italian art of Titian and Caravaggio, the Flemish art of Rubens and the German art of D\u00fcrer. In other words, it is pan-European. On those grounds he belongs as much in Paris as in Amsterdam and this deal acknowledges the European tradition as a common heritage.     Nearly lost at sea ... Aristotle Contemplating the Bust of Homer by Rembrandt. Photograph: History Archive/Rex Shutterstock    But it\u2019s not even just about Europe. Napoleon said all geniuses are French, to explain why he was taking the treasures of Italy to Paris. In reality, all genius is universal. The future of great art will be to be shared between a United Nations of museums, a network of world-class galleries that span the planet. This kind of deal must become ever more common because we cannot let civilisation be narrow or let nationalism blind people to art\u2019s human value. The reason Greece is wrong to claim the Parthenon sculptures as an exclusive national property is the same reason that this is a noble agreement: because art is for everyone. It does not have any borders. Not even language is a barrier to understanding it. I struggle to read Dante, but find it easy to appreciate a painting by Simone Martini. Art is the true Esperanto, the one form of culture that is genuinely beyond national limitations. Even classical music is more exclusive, with opera often sung in the original language, and a smaller audience trained to appreciate it.  France and Holland have shown the way.

Uber, which is backed by investors including Wall Street institution Goldman Sachs, is already facing the threat of a major crackdown on its business practices in London following the announcement earlier this week of a public consultation.   Related: Uber fights back with petition after TfL launches consultation    An Uber spokesman said on Thursday: \u201cThe proposals, and the court case, are designed to protect the black-cab industry rather than help them adapt to what people want.\u201d TfL, which provisionally took the view that Uber\u2019s app was lawful, subsequently referred that decision to the court. \u201cThe court will be dealing with what is a distinguishing part of the Uber offering,\u201d said Liam Griffin, chief executive of Europe\u2019s biggest minicab firm, Addison Lee. \u201cThis court case could potentially have a devastating effect on Uber\u2019s London business,\u201d he added.

The trial has been delayed until mid-February so that both sides can review more data.  In the Netherlands on Tuesday, the group\u2019s Amsterdam offices were raided as part of an ongoing criminal investigation into whether it is violating the country\u2019s laws over a super-cheap service using untrained drivers. On the same day, in Rio de Janeiro, Uber and other similar smartphone taxi apps were banned from operating. London\u2019s black-cab operators, who number more than 25,000, have long been arguing they want Uber to face tougher regulations so that the competition can be fairer. Uber, meanwhile, is arguing that regulation of the whole industry should be reduced, while adhering to tough safety standards. The black-cab drivers were given a boost yesterday when Hailo, an app firm, signed a new deal that boosts their tech offering in the battle against Uber. The black cabs have other app deals, with groups such as Gett and TaxiToo. Uber has launched a petition, which has so far attracted nearly 120,000 names, to support its fight against the new TfL proposals in London. It says: \u201cThese rules make no sense\u201d.

Yesterday, seven London Tory councillors, led by Peter Cuthbertson, asked Johnson to \u201cthink again\u201d on Uber, concerned that his relatively relaxed view about the firm was changing.  Cuthbertson told the Guardian: \u201cThere are some concerns with Uber, such as its policy on insurance, but these proposals don\u2019t look at that.

But that growth could be checked in the high court on Monday when London\u2019s transport regulator, Transport for London (TfL), asks a judge to decide whether Uber is breaking the law.    Related: From Rio to Paris - Uber is fighting battles across the globe    TfL, controlled by the London mayor, Boris Johnson, has been an ally of Uber in the past but it stepped up the pressure before the hearing this week by launching proposals to curb its business. The development has been welcomed by black-cab drivers, who have staged protests against a smartphone app that they claim operates as a surrogate metering system. This undercuts black-cab operators who must adhere to a metering tariff set by TfL.   Related: Uber fires back in high court row with TfL    Warren Cresdee, 52, says: \u201cI\u2019ve been driving a black cab in London for 29 years and I\u2019ve definitely noticed a bit of a downturn with the advent of Uber. At first I did wonder whether it was a bit of a fad for youngsters with that app. But if you don\u2019t have to obey all the regulations, you can undercut everybody.\u201d Uber, whose financial backers including Goldman Sachs have invested nearly $10bn (\u00a36.5bn) in the firm, views TfL\u2019s recent moves as an assault on its growth in Europe\u2019s largest city. However, London is far from the only metropolis to take against Uber. Its services were banned in Rio de Janeiro in Brazil this week while drivers in New South Wales, Australia, have had their licences suspended. Other cities where taxi drivers have staged protests, or authorities have challenged Uber, include Amsterdam, Delhi and Vancouver.  In London, Uber quickly launched a petition against the TfL proposals, asking its customers to let the regulator know they felt \u201criders and drivers come first\u201d. Within hours, about 100,000 supporters had signed their names appealing to TfL not to make life any harder for Uber.  TfL\u2019s proposals include: insisting on a five-minute delay for bookings; preventing operators from showing vehicles that are available for instant hire via an app; and new controls on ride-sharing that could threaten Uber\u2019s plans to introduce a car-sharing service. That petition will carry little weight in the high court on Monday, when TfL will ask a judge to decide whether the way Uber\u2019s app calculates fares breaks the law. Addison Lee, Europe\u2019s biggest minicab company with 4,000 drivers in London, has called on the courts to stop what it says is Uber\u2019s \u201cunchecked, unregulated and unlawful taxi metering system\u201d.    Related: Why won't Boris Johnson let Uber break the cab 'cartel'? Votes, maybe?    The Uber system, which was provisionally approved by TfL, \u201cgives Londoners the worst of all possible worlds with untrained drivers choosing any route they want to maximise fares\u201d, says the minicab firm. Black-cab operators use TfL-regulated meters, which protect drivers from losing money in the event of being held up in congestion or roadworks, a frequent occurrence in London. As the taxi ticks over in a traffic jam, so does the meter. Black cab operators argue that Uber should not be afforded this protection because it is not regulated as onerously and therefore does not deserve such a privilege. Cab firms such as Addison Lee are not metered and they offer fixed fares ahead of a journey. With the Uber app, passengers request a ride which drivers accept; the driver then shows the route and destination. The fare is calculated by the app as well, which makes it similar to a meter. Uber\u2019s rivals argue that this method incentivises the drivers to take longer routes since they will produce bigger fares. Addison Lee\u2019s chief executive officer, Liam Griffin, says he is in favour of a two-tier regulatory system, that distinguishes black-cab operators from others. \u201cThe regulations should be designed to make the private hire experience an efficient one but not the same as a black-cab one.\u201d Griffin says the court case \u201ccould potentially have a devastating effect on Uber\u2019s London business\u201d, if it goes the wrong way.   Related: Want a cheap Uber taxi? Wait till no one else wants one    Griffin believes TfL has found itself in a dilemma by not sticking to its regulations all along and allowing a fudging of the rules that has let Uber on to the capital\u2019s street. \u201cIf TfL had wanted to enforce the rules and had the inclination and foresight to do so, we would not be in this position now,\u201d Griffin says. Uber has always argued that an app on a smartphone is not a meter and does not have the physical equipment or processes to replicate a black-cab meter system. It thinks the case highlights the challenges with detailed regulations, but feels it will be able to operate whatever the outcome, although with a potentially less customer-friendly app in the future. \u201cAll these regulations and requirements \u2013 and this court case \u2013 are designed to protect the black-cab industry,\u201d says Uber. News that TfL was even considering such a clampdown on some of Uber\u2019s practices took many by surprise since  Johnson has usually appeared sympathetic to Uber and even recently described the black-cab drivers as \u201cluddites\u201d. The head of the Institute of Directors lobby group, Simon Walker, called on the mayor to stand by his free market principles and leave Uber alone. A number of Conservative councillors have written to the mayor, urging him to think again over a possible crackdown.   Related: Will Uber kill the black cab?    Not surprisingly, the proposals do not go down well with most Uber drivers. \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t be punished for doing something that makes life cheaper and more comfortable,\u201d says Uber registered partner Ali Alnasari, who is writing a thesis on the taxi market at Middlesex University when he is not driving a car. \u201cI admire the black-cab operators and they are an iconic symbol of London.

The pair, Thibaud Simphal and Pierre-Dimitri Gore-Coty, face up to five years in prison and fines of \u20ac300,000 (\u00a3220,000) per charge over allegations of fraudulent commercial activity, operating an illegal taxi service and maintaining illegal databases containing personal information of drivers and passengers.

Canada Uber\u2019s efforts to break into the Vancouver taxi market have been met with resistance from cab drivers who took out an injunction against the firm in 2014. Uber adviser David Plouffe recently told the city\u2019s board of trade that it was a shame the firm had not been welcomed.

Takano, 21, from Maidenhead in Berkshire, is at the end of his first week of lectures at university. But though this is the sort of thing that happens to freshers with alarming predictability, it\u2019s a bit more complicated in his case. Takano isn\u2019t in Leeds, or Manchester, or Durham, and he can\u2019t just pop into the nearest branch of his bank. He\u2019s in Copenhagen, roughly 600 miles from home. Over the last fortnight, approximately half a million new undergraduates have embarked on student life at universities across the UK. They\u2019ve unpacked their new kettles and their fresh-from-Ikea duvet covers. They\u2019ve made a few friends (and, in many cases, already had their first regrettable romantic encounters). But, just as they begin to settle into lectures, thousands more British students like Hiroki Takano are already a month or so into their studies at universities across mainland Europe. They have swapped crowded halls of residence for Copenhagen flats, pub crawls for bonding forest campfires in Finland. As tuition fees in the UK have risen, studying for a degree abroad has become an appealing alternative. So much so that, according to British Council research published earlier this year, up to a third of British students are considering overseas study. In February, Ucas, the organisation that handles applications to almost all British universities, announced it would consider adding European universities to admissions forms to reflect the growing number of courses taught in English across the continent. According to StudyPortals, a search platform for undergraduate and postgraduate courses, there is now a \u201ccritical mass\u201d of English-taught programmes on offer across non-English-speaking Europe. Its database now lists around 1,800 such courses for undergraduates alone. You can choose psychology in Groningen, art management in Lithuania, even medicine in Plovdiv, a former industrial town in Bulgaria with a population of 340,000. \u201cI had been looking at Sofia, but then I saw Plovdiv,\u201d says Sereen Fatima, 20, a third-year medical student from Manchester. \u201cIt\u2019s such a pretty town \u2013 very small, very old, lots of cobbled streets. I like showing it off when my family come to visit.\u201d Fatima had planned to study medicine in the UK, and she already had a couple of conditional offers, \u201cbut then I ended up missing the grades I needed by a very small margin.\u201d So she started looking at alternatives, using an online consultancy company, Tutelage, to research universities across Europe. Her six-year course \u2013 all taught in English, with additional lessons in Bulgarian provided by the university \u2013 is recognised by the General Medical Council, and she doesn\u2019t think her foreign qualification will stand in the way of getting jobs when she returns to the UK. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken to doctors about it, and they say that where you studied doesn\u2019t affect your employability. It\u2019s more about getting the right kinds of experience.\u201d     Sereen Fatima is studying medicine at Plovdiv, Bulgaria. Doctors have told her that it\u2019s experience that matters, not where she studies. Photograph: Monique Jaques for the Guardian    Arriving in Plovdiv for the first time was a bit of an adjustment, she says. \u201cI remember getting lost a lot\u2026 And most people here don\u2019t speak English.\u201d Now, a lot of the time, she forgets she\u2019s in another country. \u201cI don\u2019t really miss anything, apart from Nutella.\u201d She has just spent a couple of weeks on campus before the beginning of her third year, helping new British students to get settled, and she\u2019s already noticing differences between their experience and her own, two years ago. \u201cWhen I first came here, property was very cheap. The apartment I share with two girls costs me around \u20ac150 [\u00a3110] a month. I don\u2019t think the students arriving now will be able to find anything for that amount.\u201d For some, like Fatima, studying abroad is a way of keeping your career plans on track when A-level results don\u2019t go quite to plan, but the most common motivation for heading overseas seems to be money. With tuition fees of up to \u00a39,000 a year, many students feel as if they\u2019re being priced out of higher education in the UK. A 2014 report commissioned by the Sutton Trust found that students in the UK will graduate with an average of \u00a344,000 of debt. For some, the figures are even higher. \u201cI had been offered a place at the Royal Veterinary College in London, but when I sat down and worked out roughly how much it was going to cost me, including my living costs, it came to over \u00a3100,000,\u201d Takano says. \u201cThat was pretty depressing. I looked into all sorts of alternatives. I even looked at joining the army because they help you out with the costs of university.\u201d   Related: Will international love help your language skills blossom?    Takano is the first in his family to go to university, although he\u2019s currently trying to persuade his younger sister to join him in Denmark. He looked at courses in Germany, Slovakia and Amsterdam, before settling on Copenhagen, partly, he says, because his girlfriend is Danish \u2013 they met at an international youth camp six years ago \u2013 so he was already familiar with the country. Instead of veterinary medicine he\u2019s studying design, business and technology at KEA, the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology. It\u2019s a bit of a leap. Does he have any regrets? For a moment, he looks shocked. \u201cNo one\u2019s ever asked me that. I haven\u2019t really thought about it. No. I think I\u2019m in the right place.\u201d He\u2019s extremely enthusiastic about his new home town (\u201cI love the Assistens graveyard. I don\u2019t know if that sounds weird, but it\u2019s very cool. S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard is buried there\u201d), and he\u2019s already writing for the student newspaper. Financially, he is much better off. His accommodation costs him around \u00a3230 a month, including bills. He\u2019s living off savings, with a bit of financial help from his parents. \u201cI\u2019m budgeting quite carefully, so right now I\u2019m surviving on rye bread and tins of food. And I\u2019m looking for a part-time job, because there\u2019s a scheme here where, if you get a job working 10-12 hours a week, then the government will give you \u00a3250 a month. You\u2019re also eligible for 0% interest loans.\u201d And, of course, his tuition is free.     \u2018I think I\u2019m in the right place.\u2019 Hiroki Takano, from Berkshire, with Elizabeth Sonubi, from Essex. Both are students at the Copenhagen School of Design and Technology. Photograph: Alastair Philip Wiper for the Guardian    If you\u2019re an EU citizen, you can receive a free university education \u2013 with all your lectures taught in English \u2013 in around half of all European countries, including Denmark, Austria, Norway and Greece. In other countries such as France, university fees are often as low as \u20ac180 a year. If you speak another language, countless more options open up. England, Wales and Northern Ireland now have the highest tuition fees in the European Union. With rents in cities such as London and Manchester soaring, it\u2019s also becoming one of the most expensive places to survive as a student. By contrast, Germany is one of the cheapest, and now has more universities ranked in the top 500 world\u2019s best than the UK, according to the global QS university rankings. A 2015 TES survey of the top 100 under 50 (institutions established in the last 50 years) ranked Maastricht University, where tuition fees start at \u20ac1,984 (\u00a31,465) a year, at number six, higher than any UK university (Warwick was the highest placed, at number nine). Looked at like this, studying abroad seems like the smart option. The trend is still comparatively young. At present, Amsterdam Fashion Academy is the only EU university using the Ucas admissions service, but it seems likely that will change, and soon. A question many British employers may begin to ask is, will we lose a generation of bright, bilingual, adventurous graduates to their host cities? \u201cOne thing I\u2019m set on is staying in Denmark after I\u2019ve graduated, and not just because of my girlfriend,\u201d Takano says. \u201cI want to contribute back into this system. I don\u2019t just want to get my free education and run.\u201d \u201cThe evidence from recent student surveys does suggest that paying tuition fees has made students more aware of the return they\u2019re getting on their \u2018investment\u2019,\u201d says Professor Rebecca Hughes, director of education at the British Council. While she\u2019s confident many young people still want to invest in an education in the UK, students today are far more likely to ask, is this course really worth nearly \u00a345,000 of debt? Will I get a job that\u2019s worth it? Jaska Clifford, 26, from Great Yarmouth, found that his first degree (music technology at Leeds Metropolitan University) didn\u2019t leave him with many employment options. \u201cI made a hasty decision to go into it and when I graduated there really wasn\u2019t much work available, unless I wanted to move to London.\u201d He ended up finding casual work in cafes and bars, as a kitchen porter in a large hotel and for the Royal Mail as a Christmas temp \u2013 nothing that made use of his qualifications. It\u2019s a fairly familiar tale. Although the latest figures suggest that the job market for graduates has improved slightly, recent research from the Higher Education Statistics Agency showed that a third of working graduates were in non-professional jobs, such as cleaning and customer service, six months after leaving university. Clifford decided to retrain in a more marketable skill; but studying in the UK proved too expensive. He used StudyPortals to research courses in different countries, eventually settling on a course in construction management in H\u00e4meenlinna, Finland, a city of roughly 70,000 people. \u201cI knew that tuition was free, their English is very good and that the level of education here is high,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m the first person to come here from England in a really long time, apparently. There are only two Finnish people in my class of 21. I think nine are Russian, then there\u2019s a guy from Ghana, two guys from Nepal, a Chinese guy, two from somewhere further east and two from Kosovo.\u201d Clifford is enjoying the different culture. \u201cIn Leeds, my first experience of freshers\u2019 week was lots of binge-drinking. Here, we\u2019re doing a group presentation at an event in the woods on Friday.\u201d He can already see new opportunities. \u201cOnce my four years here are up, I might be able to work in Finland, or in the UK, or I\u2019ll have all these contacts in different countries. It gives you a wider pool of people to draw on.\u201d But first he has to graduate \u2013 and that\u2019s not always so easy outside the UK. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realise there\u2019s a big failure rate in year one,\u201d says Martin Hyde of The Student World, which places medical and dentistry students at universities across Europe. \u201cIt\u2019s not like in the UK, where often the first year is a bit of a coasting year. You\u2019re expected to work hard from day one.\u201d \u201cThere were a lot of students from the UK when I started out. But there weren\u2019t quite so many by the end of my first year,\u201d says Sam Hufton, 23, who graduated with a BA in arts and culture from Maastricht this summer. He applied after a family member heard about English-language tuition on a radio programme. If he hadn\u2019t, he probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered with university at all, now that the fees are so high. In the end, he enjoyed his degree in Maastricht so much, he\u2019s about to start an MA. But he can see why others might struggle. \u201cThe workload is intense, and people aren\u2019t prepared for it. I think quite a lot of people found that their course didn\u2019t exactly resemble the one they thought they\u2019d signed up for.\u201d     \u2018I came to Maastricht the day after my A-level results,\u2019 says Emily Fau-Goodwin. \u2018It felt sudden. It was a bit frightening.\u2019 Photograph: Tim Dirven for the Guardian    Perhaps one of the biggest differences for students abroad is the extent to which they\u2019re left to fend for themselves. \u201cWe like to make families aware that it\u2019s not quite the same as studying in a UK university,\u201d Hyde says. \u201cFor example, there isn\u2019t the same kind of infrastructure for accommodation. There aren\u2019t student halls. You have to go out and find a flat in the local town.\u201d \u201cEverywhere is so full,\u201d says Elizabeth Sonubi, 19, from Essex. She chose a course in architectural technology and construction management at KEA in Copenhagen after her mother paid a visit to a university fair at the Emirates Stadium in London, and came home with armfuls of prospectuses. But Sonubi has spent the first few weeks of her new life in a hostel near the harbour. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely not a long-term solution. It\u2019s really, really hard to find accommodation, because no one ever leaves. Students come here, love it, find themselves a nice Danish boyfriend or girlfriend and decide to stay. There\u2019s just no room.\u201d Back in Maastricht, Emily Fau-Goodwin, 18, from Nantwich, has just started a degree in European law. \u201cI came here the day after my A-level results. It felt pretty sudden. It was a bit frightening.\u201d She is renting a studio flat in a large house, \u201cbut I\u2019ve not really seen anyone else in the house. I share my bathroom with one other person, but I think they must be away quite a lot, because I haven\u2019t met them yet.\u201d   Related: Go Dutch and save yourself \u00a350,000    She admits to feeling homesick at first. \u201cIt did feel quite strange, living on my own.\u201d For freshers\u2019 week she was teamed up with a group of Dutch students. \u201cThey all spoke English most of the time, but sometimes they\u2019d forget. At first I remember thinking, \u2018Please, God, help me find another English person.\u2019\u201d Now, she says, she has settled into student life, with a circle of friends of different nationalities (\u201cEveryone speaks good English\u201d); but it\u2019s easy to see how her experience might have overwhelmed others her age. In the UK, there\u2019s been a much greater focus on the mental health of students over the last few years. But do students abroad feel supported in the same way? \u201cThere have been team-building exercises,\u201d Jaska Clifford says. \u201cThey have a welfare office that seems to be hands-on with help.\u201d But with such a diverse range of study opportunities on offer, it won\u2019t be the same for every new student settling into life abroad. In some cases, students are taking matters into their own hands. Sereen Fatima is part of a group in Plovdiv trying to start their own international students\u2019 association. \u201cWe hope to create a platform for students to raise their concerns, get more organised events going and have a bit more integration with the Bulgarian students\u2019 union.\u201d She\u2019s already part of a tradition where British students in the years above help nervous new freshers to settle in. \u201cWe all remember what it\u2019s like,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t think you ever forget your first few weeks, do you?\u201d  This article was amended on 5 October 2015.

Stephan Templ, the author of Unser Wien (Our Vienna), a book that catalogued hundreds of prominent Jewish-owned properties seized by the Nazis that were never returned, received a one-year sentence as punishment for having omitted the name of an estranged aunt in an application on behalf of his mother for the return of property seized from his Jewish relatives in 1938. Templ\u2019s book, co-written by the historian Tina Walzer, created a huge stir when it was published in 2001. It included little-known accounts of Viennese landmarks \u2013 from the city\u2019s famous ferris wheel to luxury hotels \u2013 that had been Aryanised and for which owners or heirs had been either never, or insufficiently, compensated.  The book triggered a wave of legal claims against the Austrian state from around the world.  The property at the centre of Templ\u2019s legal battle with the state is a huge, elegant 19th-century villa near the Ringstrasse in the centre of Vienna that was once a private birth clinic belonging to Lothar F\u00fcrth, a cousin of Templ\u2019s grandmother.     The ferris wheel in Vienna\u2019s Prater amusement park was revealed by Templ to have been among property seized from Jewish owners by the Nazis. Photograph: David Levene for the Guardian    A month before the building was expropriated by the Nazis on 3 April 1938, F\u00fcrth, the head of the clinic, and his wife, Sue, were forced by a caretaker to clean the pavement in front of the building using toothbrushes in an ultimate act of humiliation. The couple then retreated to the operating room at the top of the hospital and injected themselves with poison.  F\u00fcrth wrote in a suicide note: \u201cWe have had enough.\u201d In 2005, Templ filed a restitution claim on behalf of his now 82-year-old mother, Helene, a Holocaust survivor, for her share of the building. He had discovered only by chance through media reports that an arbitration panel \u2013 set up as a result of a restitution treaty between the US and Austria to facilitate the return of Nazi-confiscated properties that had remained under Austria\u2019s control for decades \u2013 had decided to return the building to heirs in the US, UK and Switzerland. \u201cThe sanatorium had in fact appeared as one of the Aryanised properties listed in my book, but at the time I did the research on it I had not known that my mother had any claim to it,\u201d Templ told the Guardian.   Related: Paintings found in Austrian home not stolen by Nazis, says elderly collector    A first group of heirs had been tracked down by a genealogist and a notary, who was also working for the state, and to whom all the non-Austrian residents were required to pay a 40% contingent fee. Such fees are illegal in Austria, which is why Templ supporters suspect his mother, who lives in Vienna, was never contacted and the family had to find out for themselves that they were among the heirs. After a lengthy legal process, the building was returned to the heirs \u2013 39 of them in all. When it was sold in 2010 to be turned into luxury apartments, Helene received \u20ac1.1m (\u00a3800,000) for her share. In 2011, the same notary contacted Helene\u2019s sister, Elisabeth Kretschmar, who Helene had been estranged from for several decades, telling her she had missed the deadline to claim for her share. A state prosecutor started criminal proceedings against Templ, accusing him of defrauding Austria on the grounds that had his aunt chosen not to claim her share, it could have gone to the state. A judge ruled that Templ had \u201cdamaged the Republic of Austria\u201d, even though Kretschmar, 86, has gone on record in front of a court to say she she would never have relinquished her share to the state. Templ was sentenced to three years in prison, which was reduced on appeal to one year on the grounds he has not offended before. But legal experts in Austria have said Templ, 54, a Czech-Austrian who lives in Prague, was never under any legal obligation to contact other heirs. Even the arbitration panel has stated in previous restitution decisions that the responsibility does not lie with restitution applicants to name other potential heirs.

Photograph: AP    Eva Blimlinger, who headed the Austrian Historical Commission\u2019s search for stolen property said: \u201cIt\u2019s the duty of the arbitration panel to find out if there are other heirs, not that of Stephan Templ and his mother.\u201d Templ told the Guardian: \u201cOwing to the fact that the state stole the property from my family, the obligation should be on them to track down the relatives. My only obligation as far as I was concerned was to assure those deciding on the restitution that my mother\u2019s claim was bona fide.\u201d  He has since discovered another heir living in Berlin, who he says the Austrian authorities also failed to contact. Robert Amsterdam, a leading human rights lawyer from Canada who defended the Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, is representing Templ on a pro bono basis. He said Templ\u2019s case, which he believed was \u201cinextricably tied to the horrors of the Anschluss\u201d (the 1938 annexation of Austria to Nazi Germany) and the subsequent theft by the Nazis of Jewish-owned property, was \u201can affront to justice\u201d and full of flaws. \u201cIt is fraught with legal abnormalities from beginning to end,\u201d he said. \u201cSome of the prosecutors have tried to defame Stephan by accusing him of playing a stereotypical greedy Jew, but if there\u2019s a greedy party it\u2019s the state of Austria, who stole the property in the first place. \u201cIt\u2019s an obscenity \u2013 akin to a robber suing you because he\u2019s left behind the tools he used to break into your house. \u201cThe fact we\u2019re seeing this 70 years after the end of world war two is a terrible personal tragedy for Stephan, and a crime against personal memory.\u201d Last month, the Austrian president, Heinz Fischer, rejected a request for clemency, saying the punishment was just because according to the court ruling Templ had \u201cdamaged Austria\u201d by his actions. Seventy-five Holocaust historians from around the world, including Prof Deborah Lipstadt, author of History on Trial, Prof David S Wyman, author of The Abandonment of the Jews, and Prof Walter Reich, former executive director of the US Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, have signed a letter to the Austrian government urging it to cancel Templ\u2019s prison sentence, which is unprecedented in the history of Austrian restitution law. Another Templ supporter, Karl Pfeifer, a veteran Austrian journalist and a Holocaust survivor who has followed the case, said: \u201cThe only reason Templ was prosecuted is that he touched a nerve with his book, which reminded the Austrians of how they stole Jewish property.\u201d Stuart Eizenstat, a former deputy secretary of the US Treasury and former US ambassador to the EU, who helped set up Austria\u2019s restitution system, called the prosecution \u201calmost inexplicable\u201d, and said the burden should be on the state to find heirs. \u201cOnce an heir brings a claim, the government should publish it and say \u2026 are there any more [heirs] out there?\u201d he said.  The general settlement fund, an intergovernmental organisation set up to recommend the return of Nazi-looted property from the state to its former owners or their heirs, did not respond to the Guardian\u2019s request for a statement. Its website states that it \u201cdoes not wish to comment on the criminal proceedings\u201d and refers inquirers instead \u201cto the publications of the supreme court\u201d.   Related: Austria bans Nazi-referencing car number plates    The justice ministry said it was unable to comment on the case because it did not want to \u201ccreate the impression we\u2019re trying to influence the jurisdiction of the independent courts\u201d. But it added that according to the court\u2019s ruling, Templ had \u201cintentionally sought unjust enrichment\u201d. Templ\u2019s lawyers said that even when he is behind bars they will continue to fight for a reprieve or for the case to be reopened. Templ said he felt trapped in an \u201cabsurd and Kafkaesque\u201d situation. \u201cAnd imagine the nightmare for my mother as a Holocaust survivor,\u201d he added. \u201cShe says it\u2019s as if the Nazi persecution continues for her, because they treat us as if we were profiteering from the anti-Jewish laws and Austria was a victim of the Nazi era.\u201d In a further blow, two of the stolpersteine, or brass plaques \u2013 about 50,000 of which have been set into pavements across the territories of the former Third Reich as reminders of the Jewish citizens who once lived there \u2013 have been removed by the new owners of the former sanatorium. They were engraved with the names of Lothar and Sue F\u00fcrth and the date of their deaths. \u201cI suppose it would be too uncomfortable for the new residents to be reminded every time they went through the door of the Jewish citizens who once lived there and the circumstances in which they died,\u201d Templ said.", "sentences": ["Robert Amsterdam, a leading human rights lawyer from Canada who defended the Russian oligarch Mikhail Khodorkovsky, is representing Templ on a pro bono basis."], "title": "Holocaust historians criticise Austria\u2019s jailing of Jewish author", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/04/holocaust-historians-criticise-austrias-jailing-of-jewish-author-stephan-templ", "tags": ["Austria", "Nazism", "Holocaust", "Judaism", "Second world war", "Europe", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-10-04T15:33:12Z", "article": "PSV Eindhoven ended Ajax\u2019s unbeaten start to the season and blew the Eredivisie title race wide open with their 2-1 win in Amsterdam on Sunday.

Each year, about 1.5 million tourists visit the city to legally consume cannabis in specially licensed coffee shops, and every time their doors open to welcome a new customer, a potent waft escapes with the force of a jet missile into the street. Whatever your views on the subject, the scent of marijuana and hashish is strong. The distinctive and easily identifiable smell curls along the narrow streets of De Wallen, lingers among the pubs, clubs, bars and coffee shops of the red light district and wafts across the open expanse of Stationsplein as newcomers in transit cram in a full, enhanced, poly-sensory experience of the city.  As an urban smellscape researcher and mapper, I was genuinely curious to discover to what extent Amsterdam\u2019s notoriously famous odour pervaded and to explore the other aromas floating around the city, from the constant and subtle presence of any background smells to the episodic scents of specific neighbourhoods and the unexpected and curious aromas as detected by a local population. To explore the urban smellscape, I organised a series of smellwalks with perfumers, landscape architects, university students, design thinkers and members of the general public. The walks took place over four particularly windy days in the spring of 2013. Instead of just marijuana, what 44 urban smellwalkers uncovered was a vast range of 650 perceived scents, some belonging to the city and others more in line with expectations of walks in the countryside or a meander in a foreign land.     Instead of just marijuana, what urban smellwalkers uncovered was a vast range of 650 perceived scents       The smell from Amsterdam\u2019s coffee shops, though powerful, is not the only noticeable odour in the city.  Photograph: Alamy    The distinctly urban scents, as delineated by the late urban smellscape specialist Victoria Henshaw, included food (waffles, asparagus, bakery, cheese, fat and grease, bacon, Dutch sausages, coffee and beer), traffic and exhaust fumes, synthetic odours (rubber, plastic, spray paint, cleaning products, bleach, chemicals), construction (wood, asphalt, paint) and plants (greenery, garden, grass).  Specifically localised smells (known in the trade as \u201cepisodic\u201d odours) encountered during the series of walks included Albert Heijn (a local supermarket with a peculiarly distinctive smell at the entrance to many of the stores), wet fish (at the fishmonger stalls in the street markets), incense and Chinese spices (in Chinatown). Scent marketing, an increasingly common extension of branding, ensured that the scent of a well-known US-based clothing company was clearly identified some distance from the shop itself. In Vondelpark and Sarphatipark, the flowers and the rain each proffered nuances of green, leafy volatiles. Time and again, we encountered seasonal specialties: the scents were those of fresh growth, of the spring.  One of the more enjoyable aspects of my slightly transgressive practice is seeing the faces of sniffers (\u201colifactors\u201d) as they discover a smell that they were not expecting. Smellwalking is an active practice, the whole body is involved as olifactors stoop, bend and stretch. Smell-hunting, they seek out olfactory possibility; road drains, keyholes, inside bushes, along park benches, materiality, humans, non-human animals and plants are all homes to scent. In seeking out the smell of urine, apparently a common occurrence in the half basements of Nieuwmarkt, the smellwalkers instead happened upon a completely unexpected odour. Their bodies jolted upright, indignation and astonishment on their faces as they instead encountered the whiffs of old books, musty and forgotten, slightly damp and strong enough to escape through the cracks in the metal-framed glass doors. They all leaned back in to reaffirm the finding.      Another detail of Kate McLean\u2019s Amsterdam map. She views her maps as \u2018tools and drivers for further exploration\u2019     An early morning stroll in the south east of the city unveiled another unexpected odour, whimsically listed in the smellnote as \u201clight horse\u201d by the olifactor. Scanning the misty landscape of Oosterpark, we saw a fairground company packing up to leave, and in its midst of it stood a couple of ponies. We nodded sagely, quietly acknowledging smell\u2019s occasional capacity to pre-visualise the world we walk through.  The wind is both a destructive and a productive force in smellscape mapping. On the one hand, it serves to remind us of the temporal nature of the smellscape; very few smells pervade insidiously into our everyday city existence as the breeze disperses them, disrupting an attempt to identify or share a smell. But then a steady wind can bring the most unexpected smells into play. One smellwalker wrote a follow-up note to the walk saying that the city sometimes contains a hint of chocolate powder in the air. Further research indicated that the chocolate factories of Zaandam were the source \u2013 perceptible only with a northwesterly wind.   All of Amsterdam\u2019s scents were perceived to exist against a background aroma of the canals \u2013 a subtle tone of slight decay and mould, a savoury smell akin to that of a coat bought at a jumble sale or a plastic bag containing a two-day-old used swimsuit and towel.   Smells are more pronounced in warm and humid environments: just think of a gym changing room for a second and you\u2019ll get where I\u2019m coming from. Odour molecules move more slowly as the temperature drops, so while there are fewer smells to detect on a cold day, hot days can appear to be super-stinky. Water is the conduit to transfer scent molecules to our 400 olfactory receptor cells.     Smells are more pronounced in warm and humid environments \u2013 just think of a gym changing room for a second \u2026       Pamplona \u2026 Smellwalking is an active practice, and the whole body is involved. Photograph: Vicky Lydford    It occurred to me that Singapore, with its equatorial climate and average temperatures of 30C would make an interesting comparison to a cold spring smellscape in Europe. Singapore rates highly on the \u201ccontrolled olfactory\u201d city scale. The law prohibits a smelly fruit, the durian, in the underground transportation system and the city has a predilection for indoor malls artificially fragranced with signature scents. The research visit was a nose-opener. The Katong area was dominated by roti-prata and curry, cooked in buildings that open fully on to the streets. As one smellwalker exclaimed: \u201cWas smelling a very rubbish flower. Then out of nowhere \u2026 Dinner!\u201d Smells quickly jump to fill a space without indicating their appearance, and just as swiftly are gone. Described as \u201cintoxicating\u201d, the scent of (soon to be illegal) shisha was only detected in Kampong Glam, and only at night. Both Chinatown and Little India contained a cacophony of smells, day and night \u2013 from the herby, bitter, minty, musky aromas of traditional herbal medicines to further intoxication in the form of jasmine garlands.  Unexpected odours in Singapore included stale sweat in the Gardens by the Bay, and chlorine by the beach in East Coast Parkway. And, surprisingly, there were relatively few smellnotes citing car and diesel fumes. But Singapore is highly regulated with regards to air pollution, and is a clean city. Spices of cooking food and a residual humidity form the background aromas to Singapore\u2019s smellscape as \u201cdeep dark secrets\u201d and \u201cthe smells of a hard life\u201d emerged as local curiosities.     Kate McLean\u2019s Glasgow smellmap     The other cities explored nose-first as a part of my art and design practice are Paris, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Milan, Ellesmere Port, Canterbury, Newport (Rhode Island), New York, Pamplona and Marseille. Each city\u2019s smell profile is necessarily complex and very much in the nose of the beholder, as every one of us will pick and mix from odours to assemble an olfactory profile of the place. This combination then becomes an individually memorable city scent m\u00e9lange. Both culture and expectation weigh heavy on a city\u2019s smellscape. Edinburgh retains a heavy industrial scent of the brewery \u2013 an endangered and disappearing smell from many cities as the major beer factories move out of town. On certain days, the yeast extract pervades Edinburgh\u2019s air, travelling seemingly as a cloud for miles across the undulating, volcanic terrain from Slateford Road to the top of Carlton Hill. One curious scent in Edinburgh is that of the penguins at the zoo. Penguin colonies in the wild are stinky, cited as \u201cthe worst smelling odour you will ever encounter in your life\u201d. This emanates from a combination of mud, penguin poo and regurgitated fish for feeding the young that often misses its destination! Thankfully, it is both localised and slightly out of the city centre. Pamplona\u2019s autumn smellscape reflects the city population\u2019s fixation with food. Glasgow\u2019s winter smellscape is of building and construction, the scents of regeneration underpinned by greasy food particles hanging in the omnipresent dreich, with a highly specific smell of the clockwork orange subway system \u2013 damp, metallic sponge is a descriptor, but really it is just the smell of the subway that starts as you descend the inner stairs to the platform.    A smellmap is an indication of possibility \u2013 there might be an odour in the location indicated \u2026 or there might not be           An animated version of Kate McLean\u2019s Amsterdam map    Every city\u2019s underground transportation system has unique smell. In Paris, the metro even smells different to the low-stop commuter trains of the RER, which may be partially due to the fragranced water used to wash the platforms. The summer scents of Canterbury included the literal \u2013 fresh strawberries in the market place \u2013 and the lyrical \u2013 the smell of history embedded in the ancient architecture. New York\u2019s summer smellscape is rife with garlic, green macrobiotic wheatgrass drinks and spilled beer \u2013 evocatively described as \u201cthe smell of broken dreams\u201d. My process of smellmap creation involves taking data directly from the comments of the smellwalkers and transcribing them into symbols on a digital or physical map. Some of the newer maps are animated. The symbols may be watercolours or digital icons in the form of morphed isolines or tiny dots. Each map is also full of white space, alluding to the massive smell voids where we simply don\u2019t notice the aromas around us. Whereas some maps are scientifically accurate symbolic representations of the reality of the earth\u2019s surface, the mapping that I use in my practice is exploratory \u2013 pointing out transient and ephemeral phenomena. Ultimately, this means any final, printed smellmap can only ever be an indication of possibility: there might be a real odour in the location indicated by my iconography, but there again, there might not. As the security of the map is lost, it becomes instead a tool and a driver for further exploration \u2013 the map as a guide and a pointer to the more evanescent aspects of our lived environment.   Related: How Amsterdam became the bicycle capital of the world    Smellwalking reveals how \u2013 despite the human desire for control \u2013 temporal flows and fluctuations remain. Amsterdam did not emerge as being primarily a city of the scent of cannabis during my initial week of research, but on a return visit, the heady scent of marijuana assailed my nostrils both day and night. The urban smellscape is highly temporal \u2013 emanating from the rhythms of the city, the rhythms of its people and affected by incremental vagaries of the weather as well as seasonal growing patterns. The range of scents in the urban smellscape is a salutary reminder of our inability to exercise complete control over the environment, and a smellscape\u2019s tendency to swiftly evaporate serves as a reminder of how the challenges of the unexpected are short-lived. To become more aware of everyday smells, beyond the binaries of good and bad, requires curiosity and a willingness to spend five of minutes of each day walking nose-first, reorienting your primary perception of the world from visual to olfactory. The process is often surprising and results in a richer experience of place, mindfulness as you slow to consider smell and a new understanding of the world.

The club from the small town of Almelo \u2013 situated 30 kilometres from the Dutch border with Germany \u2013 spent Friday night on top of the Eredivisie after securing a sixth win in seven matches, including a famous victory over the reigning champions PSV Eindhoven last month. Having never finished higher than sixth during a decade in the Netherlands\u2019 top division, their blistering start under manager John Stegeman has been greeted with an air of disbelief among long-standing supporters, even after dropping back down to third after the rest of the weekend\u2019s matches. But just as things are going right on the pitch, a ghost of the past has returned to haunt the people of Almelo. In March, Steve \u201cKalamazoo\u201d Mokone died in hospital in the United States at the age of 82. Heracles supporters held a minute\u2019s silence at their next home fixture in honour of the man who had a stand in the club\u2019s Polman Stadium named after him having starred for them during the late 1950s. A few weeks later, the ashes of the first black South African to play in the Football League when he joined Coventry in 1956 and then enjoyed brief spells at Cardiff, Torino, Barnsley, Marseille, Barcelona and Valencia, were scattered in South Africa following a ceremony at Johannesburg\u2019s FNB Stadium. That adulation \u2013 and after the Guardian published an article telling the story of what happened to Mokone when his football career was over \u2013 prompted Mokone\u2019s daughter, Thandi Chase, to speak out. Her blog in the New York Times at the end of July, \u201cFather, Apartheid Trailblazer and Domestic Abuser\u201d, which alleged that he was a violent and abusive man who had \u201csexualised\u201d her, was a bombshell for Heracles. \u201cI am very shocked by the news,\u201d said chairman Jan Smit. \u201cThey are nasty accusations. He is now deceased, the case should be properly sorted out after that incriminating letter. Whether a stand in our new stadium will be renamed after him is now part of government consultation.\u201d Chase, who lives in Atlanta, has since appeared in several media outlets in South Africa and on the BBC radio show Have Your Say, where she detailed some of the horrific abuse she suffered, including an accusation that Mokone would masturbate next to her while she was in bed. \u201cI no longer fear my father or his retribution,\u201d she explains to the Guardian. \u201cI had really never thought about coming forward and sharing any of this \u2013 I don\u2019t even like to talk about his story because it almost sounds made up. \u201cAfter the recent memorial service at the FNB Stadium commemorating him as a national hero and lauding him as this legend and hero, I just found it so disturbing. While he was to some point, it was such a sharp contradiction of the man that I knew. He was no hero in my life. \u201cIt was ironic, as if this man had done nothing wrong,\u201d Chase adds. \u201cBut he was physically abusive, violent and sexualised me as a child. What\u2019s troubling to me is that these famous athletes are dealt with using a different set of standards and I think they ought to be held accountable. We don\u2019t value women in sports culture.\u201d The story of Mokone\u2019s life after football in America is complex and riddled with inconsistencies. Inspired by his father\u2019s memories of the striker\u2019s two seasons at Heracles, the Dutch journalist Tom Egbers published De Zwarte Meteoor (The Black Meteor), which was made into a film in 2000. After nearly four decades away, Mokone was invited over to the Netherlands for the premiere, attended by Ruud Gullit, Guus Hiddink and Frank Rijkaard, among other luminaries.    It was ironic, as if this man had done nothing wrong  Thandi Chase     \u201cWe drove from Amsterdam to Almelo and all the town was out having a big party,\u201d remembers Egbers. \u201cThere was a street in the town named after him and when the new stadium was built, it was decided that one of the stands should be named after him as well.\u201d It was only a few days later that Egbers discovered Mokone \u2013 who was working as a social worker at a hospital in New Jersey \u2013 had spent almost 12 years in prison for two crimes. Having waived trial and pleaded guilty for a lye attack on his wife in 1977, Mokone was then charged with paying one of his former patients to throw sulphuric acid in the face of his wife\u2019s lawyer, Ann Boylan Rogers, who was representing his wife in the custody battle over Thandi. He was convicted by the jury in New York while co-defendant, Isaiah Campbell, who it was alleged had actually carried out the attack, was found not guilty despite the defence\u2019s argument that both should be cleared. \u201cWhy was Steve Mokone sentenced but the man who supposedly committed the crime was not guilty and could just walk out? How is that possible? It is very strange,\u201d says Egbers. \u201cBut that\u2019s what happened.\u201d Convinced of his innocence after investigating the case files in New York, Egbers wrote a second book. Twaalf Gestolen Jaren (Twelve Stolen Years) alleged that Mokone had been framed by the US authorities in collaboration with the South African Department of Internal Affairs (DIA). He discovered that the former striker had been actively involved in ANC activities throughout his life and wrote articles condemning South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime for a respected left-wing journal. Egbers also has evidence that Mokone\u2019s South African-born son, Ronnie Sello, was forced to testify against his father by the District Attorney because he had been told he would otherwise be thrown out of the country \u2013 a theory that is totally rejected by Chase. \u201cMy brother was never threatened with deportation but I\u2019ll leave it at that,\u201d she says. \u201cI know he\u2019s had a lot of strong feelings about the allegations made about him, particularly the passport and being threatened with deportation. I suggested if he wanted he could put the record straight but it\u2019s in his own time.\u201d Chase also claims that Egbers did not call her back when they first spoke at the start of May, although he denies that is the case. But in an article for Almelo\u2019s regional newspaper Tubantia last month, Egbers admitted that the allegations about Mokone had \u201cmade his stomach turn\u201d and questioned Chase\u2019s motives for going public after her father had died.

Photograph: Bettmann/CORBIS    \u201cI had so many questions from television and newspaper journalists that I thought I don\u2019t want to have to tell the same story 55 times. I did it for the people of Almelo because they were affected very much. They were devastated because he was their hero,\u201d he says. \u201cI wanted to write something to state my point of view and try to bring an end to this. I have a lot of questions but you have to be very careful with a victim of something like that. I wrote these questions in the article and ended it by saying I don\u2019t really want to dig any deeper into this tragic family crisis.\u201d Egbers adds: \u201cBut now this is out in the open, he is portrayed as a very dangerous man. If somebody was tell to me my father was like that and write articles about it, then it no longer is a private matter. My father would be publicly damned. It is quite something to do that. \u201cOf course, she does have a right to speak out but I just sincerely hope she has considered everything thoroughly because you can\u2019t turn this around any more. The damage has been done to his reputation.\u201d Having since established a grassroots campaign against intimate partner violence called Why Speak Now?, Chase says she has no interest in hearing Egbers\u2019 side of the story. Her close family at first attempted to dissuade her from detailing the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father but now say they are fully behind her. \u201cI have no qualms about people celebrating my father\u2019s life and acknowledging him,\u201d she says. \u201cNobody would argue that he did a lot for the sport. I just think it\u2019s important that people understand who the whole person is, that\u2019s all. Underneath the fame was also a man who was a father and a husband, and not a very nice one. \u201cI realise that I\u2019ve been given an amazing platform to speak out against domestic violence,\u201d Chase adds. \u201cBut if my father was not who he was in sporting terms, nobody would be interested in speaking to me. I think this is yet again an example of our society\u2019s unquestioning glorification of professional athletes. Perhaps Mr Egbers and his fans alike may have been blinded by his own unadulterated adoration of my father? \u201cTo my brothers it was like: \u2018I know but that was the past. Can\u2019t we move on?\u2019 But where do we move to? For the victims of this. For me, talking about this is moving on. But it\u2019s always hard when the first person speaks out in the family.

The Sacramento police department said officers responded to a report of a stabbing in an area of midtown Sacramento known for its nightlife at 12.46am on Thursday. The victim, identified later by police as Stone, was believed to be out with a group of friends when a physical altercation broke out, and led to him being stabbed multiple times in his upper body, police said in a statement.

Stone, who is assigned to Travis air force base in California, almost had his thumb sliced off during the struggle when the gunman pulled a box cutter and stabbed him.

Timothy Ader did not, initially, like the idea of staying at Wenckehof, a student village in Amsterdam made up of 1,000 recycled shipping containers. But three years after moving in, he has no regrets.  \u201cMy first impression of the containers was, \u2018It\u2019s ghetto stuff \u2013 I\u2019m not living there,\u2019\u201d recalls the 24-year-old. \u201cBut I started visiting a friend of mine living here and started to like the place. Then I moved in and I realised how good it was. I\u2019m really comfortable in my container and I have a lot of space of my own. I wouldn\u2019t want to live anywhere else in the world right now.\u201d  The Wenckehof, completed back in 2006 and formerly known as Keetwonen, remains the largest development of its kind anywhere in the world. Although it was built as a temporary housing experiment, it proved so popular with students it was given permanent status by the Amsterdam authorities in 2011. And its success has intrigued architects and housing organisations looking for low-cost solutions to housing shortages in cities around the world.  In Berlin, repurposed shipping containers have been used for student accommodation, and, more recently, to house asylum seekers. In London, Forest YMCA have begun moving young working adults struggling to pay high rents and at risk of becoming homeless into 20 \u201cmYPad\u201d containers in Walthamstow\u2013 though occupants can only stay for a maximum of one year.    We\u2019re still trying to overcome the idea that a steel box is not a good place to live  Quinten de Gooijer, architect        Forest YMCA\u2019s 20 \u2018mYPads\u2019. Photograph: Forest YMCA     Advocates for shipping container homes say speed of installation, cost savings on materials and the capacity to re-use units in new locations make it a serious option for urban housing. The latest exhibition at The Building Centre in central London captures the trend. Designers are offering lunchtime tours of a model shipping container home, asking whether these \u201chighly adaptable and move-able\u201d objects might play a much bigger role in easing the housing crisis.  So what\u2019s it like to actually live in one? Ader says his Amsterdam container is cosy: each one has a living space, bathroom and balcony. Insulated panels and radiators help keep the place warm in winter. Privacy has not been a problem. In fact, Ader found it too quiet. He helped organise block parties and \u201ceat with your neighbour\u201d events to make Wenckebachweg a little livelier.  It\u2019s also cheap. Residents here pay \u20ac450 a month (\u00a3335) and also qualify for a \u20ac140 monthly housing subsidy, making it much less expensive than the \u20ac600 a month Ader says students often pay to share a flat in central Amsterdam.  \u201cThere aren\u2019t many disadvantages,\u201d Ader concludes. \u201cI myself wouldn\u2019t want to share with my girlfriend \u2013 the container is a bit too small for that, although we do have some couples living here and they\u2019re happy. I think this kind of housing works best for single people who need something a little bit cheaper.\u201d     The container village in Amsterdam. Photograph: Tempohousing    Wenckehof\u2019s architect is Quinten de Gooijer. His company Tempohousing has also created multi-story container estates for Amsterdam\u2019s Salvation Army and a \u201clabour hotel\u201d for temporary Polish workers in the city. De Gooijer concedes that so far, most clients have been looking to fulfill some short-term need. \u201cProviding basic, simple housing \u2013 it\u2019s true that has been our customer base,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s because it\u2019s a cost-effective solution.\u201d  \u201cYou can put all kinds of cladding around the structure, put roofs on, do a lot of different things, but it all comes at extra cost,\u201d he adds. \u201cWe\u2019re still trying to overcome the idea that a steel box is not a good place to live. People think bricks and mortar are eternal, but that\u2019s not the case. Gradually the psychology is changing. I think we will see many more housing projects using containers in future.\u201d  Architects are already dreaming big. Or more accurately, dreaming high. CRG Architects has unveiled a proposal to replace slum housing in developing countries with \u201ccontainer skyscrapers\u201d: enormous towers made up of brightly-painted units stacked to look cylindrical. Another colourful design for high-rise container towers is aimed at easing pressure in Mumbai\u2019s Dharavi slum.  Not everyone is convinced steel boxes in the sky are the future of mass housing. Mark Hogan, principal architect at San Francisco-based practice OpenScope, thinks devoting shipping containers to housing \u201cdoesn\u2019t make any sense\u201d. That\u2019s mainly because cost savings begin to disappear as soon as you start playing around with containers\u2019 basic structure, try to meld units together, or do anything fancy with stacking arrangements.    For some people, having their own place with their own front door is a great first step  Andy Winter, BHT chief executive        The Container Skyscraper.  Photograph: CRG Architects     De Gooijer of Tempohousing concedes stacking containers neatly, one on top of the other, is the only way to make it significantly cheaper than using traditional building material and construction methods. \u201cIf you treat it like Lego, you have to add expensive sub-structures to give it stability,\u201d he says.  There remains the larger question about who, ideally, shipping container homes are supposed to be for. If projects continue to be pitched as emergency or temporary fixes, are shipping containers destined to be housing for the poor?  In Brighton, on the English south coast, developer QED struck a five-year deal with the Brighton Housing Trust (BHT) to install 36 shipping container homes on a former scrap metal yard. The cost of preparing the site and converting the old units cost QED \u00a3900,000 - around \u00a325,000 per container. The charity now rents them out to \u201ctenancy-ready\u201d people stuck in hostels or sofa surfing with friends. At \u00a3650, the monthly rent is not cheap, but it is 75% of the market rate in Brighton.  After residents moved into the Richardson\u2019s Yard site in 2013, there were complaints about anti-social behaviour and the containers being too cold in winter. But BHT chief executive Andy Winter is confident new heaters, added insulation and a lock on the front gate have all improved matters. \u201cThe feedback from the residents is that the place has worked remarkably well,\u201d he explains.     The Brighton Housing Trust shipping container homes. Photograph: Simon Callaghan/QED Property     Winter thinks the UK needs more temporary housing, and believes public bodies could be more creative about freeing-up land on a short-term basis. \u201cShipping containers could be used across the country,\u201d he says, encouraged by the idea of starter flats for young people. \u201cUsing it for student housing would certainly free up family homes. We\u2019re all on a housing journey. For some people, having their own place with their own front door is a great first step.  The impression that shipping containers provide only transitory, bog-standard homes frustrates many designers. Determined to prove what could be done, Canadian architect Keith Dewey used 8 shipping containers to build his own large, 3-bedroom family home in the city of Victoria in British Columbia.  Calling it the Zigloo Domestique, the house features underfloor heating and high-end lighting systems. Although the project cost $415,000 (\u00a3210,000) to build back in 2006, Dewey sold it last year for $675,000. \u201cWe were very happy there for seven years, then someone made us an offer we couldn\u2019t refuse,\u201d he says.   Related: Ideas to solve London\u2019s housing crisis \u2013 in pictures     Dewey now sells conceptual plans to other shipping container self-builders. \u201cFor the most part, people do come to me a little starry-eyed about it,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019ve read somewhere on the internet that you can build a house for a few thousand dollars. So there\u2019s a wake-up call when I let them know that it\u2019s a cost-effective build, but that you may only save around 10% compared with traditional methods.\u201d  Yet Dewey believes shipping container housing has an important role to play. \u201cThere\u2019s longevity built into this kind of steel,\u201d he says. \u201cIt can be used again and again. I see this as one of the first recycled solutions to housing that\u2019s really taken the imagination by storm. It\u2019s going to become a bigger question: how are we going to make old materials useful again?\u201d  The advantages of shipping container housing \u2013 sustainability and cost \u2013 may well prove too good to ignore. Yet its champions could learn some lessons from the world of the self-builders. People the world over want homes which feel permanent. So containers will have to overcome the perception of being stop-gap, make-do dwellings if they are ever to become a popular solution to the housing crisis.

It was a shock, a terrible blow to my body, to my head, to my soul. But in a nice way.\u201d Riccardo Chailly, 62, has never forgotten his first rehearsal with the Leipzig Gewandhaus Orchestra nearly 30 years ago, at the Salzburg festival. The work was Richard Strauss\u2019s early tone poem Don Juan, which bursts forth with strings soaring up like a fleet of rockets, brass detonating in mad retort. Those opening bars intoxicate and overwhelm, even from a safe seat in the audience. How much more electrifying to be on the podium, knowing a single flick of your baton has created this bolt of energy. Back then, Chailly was a fervent, 33\u2011year-old Italian with reddish-chestnut flowing hair, a slightly unruly beard and a glittering career ahead of him. He was already music director of the Radio Symphony Orchestra Berlin, an ideal training ground for a fast-rising young conductor. His unlikely rival in the same, western half of a still-divided city was Herbert von Karajan, nearly 80, silver-haired and impeccably tailored, with most of his achievements as music director of the illustrious Berlin Philharmonic already in the past. Karajan remained, nevertheless, the most powerful figure in classical music and an unexpectedly generous mentor. \u201cIt was Karajan\u2019s idea to put us together,\u201d Chailly chuckles. \u201cThis young Italian and this oldest of European orchestras with a glorious tradition dating back to the 18th century.\u201d Its past music directors include Felix Mendelssohn, Arthur Nikisch and Wilhelm Furtw\u00e4ngler. \u201cAnd you know Richard Strauss conducted the Gewandhaus, too. People ask how you can have a heritage of sound. But players might be in the orchestra 40 years. They talk, rehearse, travel together. Living traditions are passed on and grow.\u201d It was the start of a long relationship that led to Chailly\u2019s appointment, in 2005, as music director of the Gewandhaus (the name means \u201ctextile hall\u201d). Next week Chailly returns to the Barbican with the orchestra for their third residency (with one concert in Birmingham). This is his last such collaboration. In June 2016, after 11 years, 220 concerts and 40 tours, he will leave Leipzig to concentrate on his new jobs at the helm of both La Scala, Milan and the Lucerne Festival Orchestra. His Leipzig successor, from 2017, will be Andris Nelsons. As Chailly dislikes guest conducting, he will be a less regular presence in the UK \u2013 hurry while stocks last. The London and Birmingham concerts will combine Strauss\u2019s epic tone poems with concertos by Mozart (with Maria Jo\u00e3o Pires and Radu Lupu, piano, Christian Tetzlaff, violin and Martin Fr\u00f6st, clarinet as soloists). Following a family concert, the full orchestra\u2019s series opens, fittingly, with Don Juan. \u201cThis Strauss/Mozart project is close to my heart. Strauss admired Mozart deeply, it makes sense to bring their works together. I\u2019ve never done these six tone poems as a complete series.\u201d Chailly is an enthusiast for complete cycles, of Beethoven, Mahler, Bruckner. His recent Brahms Symphonies, reissued this month as part of a seven-CD set, won almost every recording prize available. \u201cThese Strauss works span 12 years of his life, and are unimaginably hard. We have to study from scratch, to rehearse anew each time. They are so difficult.\u201d This is hard to grasp. With the exception of the early Macbeth, this is all mainstream repertoire. A gauge of popularity is the BBC Proms: Till Eulenspiegel has been played 102 times, Don Juan 89 (compared to 119 for Beethoven\u2019s Ninth).Chailly is one of the tiny cluster of unrivalled maestri in the world, now at his peak. Before Leipzig he was chief conductor of the illustrious Amsterdam Concertgebouw (1988-2004). Can Strauss really be such a challenge? \u201cYou have a huge orchestra, but it must sound transparent, controlled, almost neoclassical. And then your ideas about it change. I\u2019ve been studying Ein Heldenleben again. It always used to take me 41 to 42 minutes. Last night we played it and it took 46 minutes!\u201d How so? \u201cThe consequence of new interpretative ideas. Some of the writing embraces violent extremes and is virtuosic; the conductor has to have a terrific technique!\u201d Fortunately he has. Born into a musical family in Milan in 1953, Chailly was able to witness great conductors at close quarters. His father, Luciano, was a composer and administrator, first in charge of music programmes for RAI television, then artistic director of La Scala, Milan. Aged 10, Riccardo heard Zubin Mehta rehearse Mahler and knew that he, too, was destined to become a conductor. By 19 he was assistant to Claudio Abbado at La Scala, learning so much of his right-hand technique from the maestro that he worried he was merely imitating him. Typically, Chailly went back to basics and reconstructed his technique to suit his own style. \u201cIn the right hand \u2013 for most people \u2013 you hold the baton. That hand keeps complete control of rhythm and tempo. The left hand is for colour, flexibility, expression.\u201d He makes it sound quite straightforward. Then he shifts gear. \u201cBut conducting is, above all, a gift of nature, your body\u2019s constitution, how you feel the movement of the music. That\u2019s what counts. It\u2019s almost mystical, alchemical, what happens between you and your players and the music. You can\u2019t talk in a concert, after all, except with gesture.\u201d Chailly studied composition and piano but never had any doubt about his chosen path, taking conducting courses in Milan and Siena. His father, knowing the formidable gifts needed, was not at first encouraging, once telling an interviewer that his son\u2019s piano playing \u201cwas not particularly sensational\u201d, but that he wasn\u2019t bad at the drums (he played in a free-jazz group called the Nameless). Despite these supposed shortcomings, Chailly gave his first public concert in Padua, when 14, and by 25 he had become the youngest person to conduct at La Scala. \u201cIn a way my father was protecting me. He hated the idea of any kind of nepotism. He wanted me to engage with other studies, and also learn languages.\u201d He is fluent in four, including Dutch. \u201cWe never fell out, just battled a bit. But he was proud when he saw that I was succeeding.\u201d         Riccardo Chailly conducts Maria Jo\u00e3o Pires     Mild-mannered and soberly dressed, Chailly is self-possessed, not liable to be cajoled into gossip. He is too sage, and one suspects too generous, to resort to any bad-mouthing of colleagues. Despite his chosen career, and his affability, he has an air of introversion. He won unexpected fame on social media for footage of a public rehearsal in which Pires arrived expecting to play one Mozart concerto, only realising once she heard the orchestral introduction that it was in fact a different one being performed. Chailly coaxed her into a perfect performance with his reassuring comments, trusting her fine musicianship. His \u201cgood guy\u201d reputation might be tested to its limits at La Scala, where politics, strikes and out-of-date working practices are rife. As principal conductor, he will open the season with Verdi\u2019s Giovanna d\u2019Arco, starring Anna Netrebko, in December. Under his predecessor Daniel Barenboim the repertoire has been heavily Germanic; Chailly aims to restore Italian opera to the forefront. Ever committed to new music, he also plans at least one contemporary opera each year, and he wants to develop the scope of the Filarmonica della Scala orchestra, with concerts and touring. The completist in him will be satisfied with a projected series of all 12 Puccini operas, to be relayed by RAI and issued on DVD by Decca. In an almost literal passing of batons, Chailly will also succeed Abbado, who died in 2014, as music director of the Lucerne Festival Orchestra, opening next summer\u2019s festival with Mahler\u2019s Eighth Symphony, \u201cthe only one Claudio, a wonderful Mahlerian, didn\u2019t do. We will dedicate the concert to his memory.\u201d Many assume Lucerne was the reason he decided to leave Leipzig before the end of his contract in 2020. There was also a cancelled Rachmaninov recording series with the Gewandhaus that may have caused tension. Chailly denies all this. \u201cNo, not at all. I am pleased to be succeeding Claudio but this will only take up a few weeks a year. I wanted to leave [the Gewandhaus] because of my age and because I have had so many, many high points in my years here. But I have also had to sacrifice so much of my private life.\u201d He has been married to Gabriela Terragni since 1982. She has a son, and he a daughter, from previous marriages. There are two young grandchildren. \u201cI want to do things differently. It means a lot to be working in my home country. I am an uncharacteristic Italian, an awkward Milanese.\u201d Chailly certainly shows no signs of Italianate fire \u2013 except on the podium, where he is exhilaratingly explosive. \u201cI have lived in Berlin eight years, Amsterdam 16, Leipzig 11. This way of life is fascinating, but intense and demanding. Now I must find the energy to say \u2018no\u2019, to stay healthy, have time to think and study, live at home with my wife.\u201d He used to be addicted to extreme sports: motorbikes, speedboats, parakiting.

Today, their house is scheduled for demolition. Hundreds of earthquakes have wrecked the foundations of the Heites\u2019 home and made it unsafe to live in. Annemarie\u2019s biggest fear is the safety of her daughters. She points to a room. \u201cThis is where my children sleep,\u201d she says, \u201cand everyday I\u2019m just picking up pieces of bricks and stuff from the ceiling.\u201d   Related: UK experiences three earthquakes a year due to human activity, study says    Heite fears that her children may not be any safer at school.

At the heart of it are two oil companies, Shell and Exxon Mobil, and a government that, for two decades, denied responsibility for its actions and ignored the voices of citizens and scientists. The scandal has already cost the oil companies \u20ac1.2bn [\u00a3880m], but last month a landmark court ruling gave the victims fresh hope that their voices could be ignored no longer. And if they are right, the consequences could be profound: a compensation bill that could stretch to more than \u20ac5bn in Holland, an energy security headache for Europe, and an invocation for the world to think about the real cost of burning fossil fuels.     \u2018Everyday I\u2019m just picking up pieces of bricks and stuff from the ceiling\u2019 \u2026 Heite\u2019s earthquake-damaged family home.  Photograph: Hans Knikman/Demotix    Groningen is farming country \u2013 far from outgoing Amsterdam or the cosmopolitan Hague \u2013 where impeccably flat green fields stretch out in every direction and the smell of manure is, if not exactly pleasant, somehow pure. Underneath this simple, orderly landscape is one of the biggest and most profitable gas fields in the world. In 1963 the Dutch petroleum company Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij (NAM) \u2013 jointly owned by Shell and Exxon Mobil \u2013 first tapped into the 2.8tn cubic metres of gas reserves. The Dutch government cut a deal with the oil companies, and now it owns a 40% stake in NAM\u2019s parent company. The three parties each made fortunes in a honeymoon period of nearly 30 years. The Netherlands is now the EU\u2019s biggest gas producer, and Groningen, generating billions of euros every year, is the jewel in its crown. Groningen does not sit on any fault lines, and before Shell and Exxon Mobil arrived, it had no history of seismic activity. But the earthquakes that ruined Heite\u2019s house and many others are, everyone now accepts, manmade. Manuel Sintubin, professor of geodynamics at Leuven University in Belgium explains: \u201cWhen you extract gas, it changes the pressure in the gas reservoir and causes compaction in the reservoir sandstone, which causes earthquakes.\u201d   Related: US government says drilling causes earthquakes \u2013 what took them so long?    As more gas was extracted \u2013 the field is about two-thirds empty now \u2013 pressure changes deep underground become more severe and unpredictable. Nearly 1,000 manmade earthquakes, ranging from 0.1 to 3.6 on the Richter scale, have occurred in Groningen since the early 1990s. A 3.6 magnitude earthquake is not a terrifying experience, although in 2012 it was strong enough to shake groceries off the shelves in a Groningen shop. But because the earthquakes take place at the shallow depth of 3km, and many Groningen buildings are built on soft clay, the damage caused is greater than their small Richter-scale magnitudes suggest. When the first earthquakes were reported, NAM and the government denied the causal link between gas extraction and earthquakes. Later, they accepted the link but claimed that any damages would only be minor, and maintained this argument for nearly 20 years, despite growing evidence of major damage to buildings. NAM has received more than 50,000 damage complaints from people seeking compensation. This year the Dutch Safety Board published an investigation into NAM and the Dutch government\u2019s approach to citizen safety between 1959 and 2014. Until 2013, the report concludes, both parties ignored citizen safety for decades when making decisions, conducting risk assessments and planning research programmes. Instead, they made sure the gas kept flowing, maximised revenues and ignored independent scientific research and advice.

Photograph: Hans Knikman/Demotix    For many of the people affected, the authorities\u2019 indifference had severe consequences \u2013 financial as well as emotional. In 2011, Nicolette Marie and her husband, Duco, 52, wanted a fresh start in a new place, after Duco had recovered from a three-year illness. The couple put their house on the market for \u20ac225,000, but shortly afterwards the biggest earthquake in Groningen\u2019s history struck and the market flatlined. During the following two years, Nicolette and Duco dropped the price, bit by bit, to \u20ac135,000. \u201cWe had a lot of people visiting, people come to view bargains,\u201d she says, but after they learned about the quakes they lost interest. They only ever received one offer, of \u20ac105,000. By 2014, the depressed housing market had left Nicolette, Duco and their two children trapped in their remote village, where they watched cracks grow up the walls of their house and worried about the damage the next quake might wreak. Desperate to leave, she applied to an independent committee financed by NAM to assist people who have been adversely affected by the earthquakes. She was disappointed by its response: \u201cThey did not buy our home, they did not compensate us for our loss of income due to stress and sickness, they did not cover the cost for psychological help we\u2019ve sought.\u201d The committee told Marie that if she could sell her house, and the sale price was lower than \u20ac135,000, it would compensate the difference, up to a maximum of \u20ac30,000. \u201cThey don\u2019t give a damn,\u201d Marie says.   Related: Oil and gas drilling triggers man-made earthquakes in eight states, USGS finds    Four years after deciding to leave, Marie is still trapped in a house she can\u2019t sell. She has now instructed a lawyer to begin seeking compensation. \u201cThe only thing that keeps me going is my anger,\u201d she says. \u201cBut you can\u2019t do that indefinitely, because anger eats away at you.\u201d In September, a Dutch judge gave Marie and thousands of people in her situation some potential reprieve. The court ruled that all owners of real estate in areas affected by earthquakes have the right to claim compensation from NAM for loss of market value. It is the first time a company has been held responsible for damaging a market. Crucially, real-estate owners must be compensated now, and not when they sell their property, which in Marie\u2019s case has proved near-impossible. Jan Brouwer, a professor of law at Groningen university and director for the Netherlands\u2019 Centre for Public Order and Public Security, says it is also the first time that NAM admitted in law that it was responsible for the earthquakes, although it had implicitly accepted liability for years. Legal discussion on how to evaluate damages are now under way between NAM and De Haan, the law firm that brought the class action, although NAM has also appealed the ruling, so a final settlement is some way off. It is too early to say what NAM\u2019s full liability might be, but Pieter Huitema of De Haan thinks the market is damaged enough to cost NAM more than \u20ac5bn, in hundreds of thousands of payouts. However, the judgment is only concerned with damage to the housing market, and is no help to anyone with widening cracks in their floors or collapsing walls. In these cases, individual citizens must pursue their cases independently. But NAM has a reputation as a hardball negotiator and getting a fair settlement is allegedly a difficult task.     \u2018They take you for a fool. We have to build a new house, and a contractor calculated the cost is nearly \u20ac800,000. NAM offered us \u20ac200,000\u2019 \u2026 Jur Huizinga.  Photograph: Hans Knikman/Demotix    Jur Huizinga, 62, knows that to his cost. His house is also scheduled for demolition. He is a stout farmer with a broad face who grows sugar beets, sweet potatoes and winter wheat on a 400-acre plot. Four generations of his family have lived and worked on this land since 1864. Last year the government ordered the demolition of Huizinga\u2019s home after earthquakes irreparably damaged its foundations. He now lives with his wife in a dismal \u201ctemporary unit\u201d built out of several Portakabins. Here, he eats his meals in a poky, plastic-floored kitchen and contemplates the destruction of the only house he has ever lived in. Huizinga has been trying for more than a decade, unsuccessfully, to claim compensation for damages to his house. He says: \u201c[We\u2019ve been] negotiating for 12 years. For the first six or seven years, they denied that the damage came from earthquakes.\u201d NAM now accepts the damage is caused by quakes, but disputes the cost of replacing his house, which has frustrated Huizinga. \u201cThey take you for a fool,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have to build a new house, and a contractor calculated the cost is nearly \u20ac800,000. NAM made a calculation and it was \u20ac200,000.\u201d Huizinga also resents NAM\u2019s dual role in this process: \u201cThe company who destroys your house also says how much money you get.\u201d One independent damage-assessor says NAM routinely acts like this. The assessor says: \u201cNAM always denies the cause of the damage is an earthquake, and puts the house owner in a position to provide absolute proof, although there are no signs for reasonable doubt,\u201d he says. Then, if it accepts liability, \u201cNAM always starts with a very low offer and waits to see whether the house owner is able to negotiate properly or not. Then they use specially trained negotiators for the tough ones.\u201d NAM says it has been inundated by damage complaints since a big earthquake in 2012, and in the past three years it has received more than 50,000 compensation claims. In an effort to process complaints more efficiently, it now funds a dedicated unit called the Centre for Safe Living, which is operated by two NAM contractors. NAM says that most cases are for small amounts of money and \u201cin 88% of the claims, compensation is offered to the house-owner\u201d and that \u201c95% of the inhabitants agree with the first offer for compensation\u201d. It says there were a small minority of hard-to-resolve cases. The damage assessor adds: \u201cNAM\u2019s strategy is to solve the minor problems and focus on that in the media.\u201d He says he has watched the fire in citizens slowly peter out over years of negotiations. Claimants suffer weight loss and develop health problems from the stress. But Huizinga is adamant he will continue fighting. \u201cWe live here so long and it is not our fault. I cannot agree that I don\u2019t get back what\u2019s rightfully mine. It is injustice. If you give up, what then?\u201d NAM says its latest offer is \u20ac500,000. The experiences of Heite, Marie and Huizinga are typical in Groningen, and anger is are widespread in local communities. Even the region\u2019s churches have come together to express their outrage. Public trust in NAM and the government is reaching an all-time low. Meanwhile, the earthquakes have forced the Dutch government to cut production in Groningen, from 54bn cubic metres (bcm) in 2013 to 30bcm this year, in a bid to reduce risk. Critics say this is not enough, with some calling for a lower limit of 21bcm, and others demanding a total shutdown.     A NAM gas drilling site in Groningen. In the past three years NAM has received more than 50,000 compensation claims from houses damaged by earthquakes.  Photograph: Hans Knikman/Demotix    But the effects of this cap will be felt in Westminster and Brussels. The Netherlands was the EU\u2019s biggest gas producer last year, with around 15% of total supply, but the cap in Groningen has caused the country\u2019s production to plummet by 58% to its lowest level in 30 years. This gives UK and EU politicians a headache and exposes them to potential embarrassment, because it makes them even more reliant on Russian gas. Russia is already the top importer to the EU, but with the situation in Ukraine still tense and new rifts emerging over Syria, Europe is seeking to be less \u2013 not more \u2013 dependent on Vladimir Putin.   Related: Fracking 'probable' cause of Lancashire quakes    As Europe looks on, a government effort to make reparations is under way. In November 2013, an independent committee recommended that NAM invest roughly \u20ac1bn into Groningen during the next 20 years. But a report commissioned by the Groningen government estimates the cost of repairing properties and protecting them against future earthquakes at \u20ac30bn during the next 30 years. There is also concern that authorities are not acting fast enough. Brouwer says human lives could soon be at risk: large buildings such as schools, offices and apartment blocks are not built to withstand quakes of high magnitudes. He says the authorities could be held criminally accountable in future for their failure to act now, and believes that government bodies are violating the human rights of Groningen citizens by failing to exercise the precautionary principle, which holds that to protect public safety, officials should err on the side of caution. An earthquake of magnitude 4 or 5 is now considered possible, and could strike anytime, which means structural reinforcements should be made immediately. Sintubin says: \u201cThis is a bit like Russian roulette. You have to start from the premise that \u2018the big one\u2019 can happen tomorrow, in a week or in 50 years.\u201d He adds that the St Walfridus school, and all of Groningen should now be practising earthquake drills like the ones done in California. But in the sleepy countryside there are few signs that anyone is taking the threat that seriously. In February, as the Dutch parliament debated the future of gas extraction, it was left to the community\u2019s Christian leaders to sound the alarm. In a chorus of protest as ominous as it may be futile, the churches of Groningen, most of them now damaged by the earthquakes, rang their bells.", "sentences": ["Photograph: Hans Knikman/Demotix    Groningen is farming country \u2013 far from outgoing Amsterdam or the cosmopolitan Hague \u2013 where impeccably flat green fields stretch out in every direction and the smell of manure is, if not exactly pleasant, somehow pure."], "title": "Shell and Exxon's \u20ac5bn problem: gas drilling that sets off earthquakes and wrecks homes", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/oct/10/shell-exxon-gas-drilling-sets-off-earthquakes-wrecks-homes", "tags": ["Gas", "Earthquakes", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news", "Energy", "Fossil fuels", "Environment", "Gas", "Business", "Homes", "Life and style", "Royal Dutch Shell", "Oil", "Oil and gas companies", "ExxonMobil"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-10-10T12:19:00Z", "article": "\u201cWe were like one of those comets you see flying across the night sky.

You may have seen the footage: Motson, with a kipper tie and unfathomably large hair, and the tiny waver in his voice when he sets off with a slightly rambling first question. And Clough: straight-backed, telegenic, sitting there like the emperor of Yorkshire. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of questions all in there, John,\u201d he says, with that glint of supremacy in his eye. \u201cAnd, by the sound of your voice, you\u2019re just about getting them out.\u201d That clip was on Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s phone when we met a few weeks ago, behind the fingerprint-recognition system that buzzes visitors through Chelsea\u2019s training ground, and the manager of the reigning champions started to reel off some of his favourite Cloughisms. Mourinho\u2019s office is upstairs at Cobham and it is important to keep a straight face when there are two life-sized cardboard cutouts to negotiate even before the real-life version comes into view behind his desk. The walls are lined with dozens of framed Mourinho photographs. The coffee table is stacked neatly with Mourinho biographies and picture books, in various languages, and it is almost a surprise when a cup of tea is brought out that it is not a Mourinho mug.     Brian Clough took over at Nottingham Forest in 1975 when they were struggling in the old Division Two. Within five years they had won the Division One title and the European Cup twice. He is pictured with the 1980 Cup, their second.

Related: New Brian Clough film might interest Manchester United | Richard Williams    Mourinho was 16 when Trevor Francis landed on the shot-putters\u2019 circle at the Olympiastadion, Munich, after the decisive header to win the trophy in 1979, and 17 when Forest repeated the trick a year later on a sweet-scented night at the Bernab\u00e9u. He remembers all the players, the finals, the look \u2013 red shirt, white shorts, three Adidas stripes \u2013 and, typically, even the small tactical details, such as the way Viv Anderson had carte blanche to stride forward in a way that was unheard of for right-backs of that era.

Photograph: Popperfoto    The film premieres on Sunday night at the City Ground and, to put the story into perspective, perhaps the best place to start is to imagine Huddersfield Town, 13th in the Championship last season, winning promotion next May, then the Premier League at the first attempt, back-to-back Champions Leagues, a couple of Capital One Cups and creating a record for going unbeaten in the top division \u2013 42 matches in Forest\u2019s case \u2013 that would last a quarter of a century. Forest were that team: 13th in the old Division Two when Clough landed his coat on the peg for the first time, on 6 January 1975. They did all the above within five years, as well as knocking Liverpool, the double European Cup winners, off their perch, long before Sir Alex Ferguson coined the phrase. They did it with five players \u2013 Anderson, Martin O\u2019Neill, Ian Bowyer, Tony Woodcock and John Robertson \u2013 who were there from the start and the journey took them from five points off the relegation places into Division Three, with sub-8,000 gates, to Camp Nou, taking on Barcelona for the Super Cup. Another trophy was added to the collection and when they left the stadium that night there was a mob waiting outside. \u201cTwo rows of Barcelona fans, eight deep, all the way from the exit to our coach,\u201d John McGovern, the captain, recalls. \u201cThey were all very quiet and I thought: \u2018We could be in trouble here.\u2019 It was then they started clapping. As we walked to our coach they clapped us all the way. Not a Forest fan in sight, all Barcelona fans. Clapping us out of their own stadium.\u201d The story will never happen again but, equally, it had never happened before either. People forget that Forest went up with 52 points, the fifth-lowest of any promoted team in history, and that they lost to York, Peterborough and, twice, Bristol Rovers before Peter Taylor joined Clough\u2019s side and everything suddenly clicked with a team described in one newspaper as \u201ca mix of fresh and well-worn faces who ought to be slogging it out at the bottom of the table\u201d.     Trevor Francis, England\u2019s first \u00a31m player. Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images    Kenny Burns had a reputation at Birmingham City as an untamed, hard-drinking pub-brawler until Forest\u2019s management duo converted him from a marauding centre-forward into what Taylor described as the Scottish Bobby Moore. \u201cDon\u2019t buy him,\u201d Birmingham\u2019s chairman, David Wiseman, had warned Clough, \u201che\u2019s trouble.\u201d Larry Lloyd\u2019s signing-on fee was a washing machine Clough pinched from the laundry department. Frank Clark was a free transfer from Newcastle, on the verge of signing for Fourth Division Doncaster Rovers. Robertson, with his chip-fat grin and nicotine-laced chuckle, was drifting so badly Clough\u2019s predecessor, Allan Brown, tried to offload him to Partick Thistle. Peter Shilton arrived as the most expensive goalkeeper in the league and Francis later became the first \u00a31m man, but it was an unlikely assortment of free transfers, bargain buys, rogues and misfits, all turning out to be exceptionally gifted footballers. They piggy-backed through nettles and played hide-and-seek in what passed as training sessions. They held team meetings at a greasy-spoon cafe called McKay\u2019s, where the standard order of 14 chip cobs meant the owner, Bill, had to order more supplies of bread and potatoes. And, against every conceivable expectation, they produced a story that will never be replicated. Garry Birtles was a \u00a32,000 signing from Long Eaton United working as a carpet-fitter and doubling up in Nottingham\u2019s Sunday alehouse leagues with Long Eaton Rovers until Clough and Taylor turned him into the European young player of the year. Birtles\u2019s amateur career ended against a team called Clumber Kitchens and Bathrooms amid the stale beer fumes of Victoria Embankment, Nottingham\u2019s equivalent of Hackney Marshes. His first goal for his hometown club helped knock Liverpool out of the European Cup and when Forest brought the trophy back to the Old Market Square he was presented with a special award from Roy of the Rovers magazine. \u201cEvery time I watch Liverpool now I look for the flags on the Kop because there\u2019s a two-year gap in the dates. They go from \u201977 and \u201978 to \u201981. And I always think: \u2018That\u2019s us, that gap. We did that.\u2019\u201d This was the team that prepared for a European Cup semi-final against the great Ajax side by walking round the red-light district of Amsterdam, settling down for some late-night beers in a bar full of potheads and sex tourists. Shilton\u2019s training for the final took place on the roundabout of a dual-carriageway, surrounded by cars tooting their horns, because it was the only piece of grass he could find in their Spanish resort. And the film doesn\u2019t stray from the five-year period, as the director Jonny Owen explains, when \u201cClough was peerless,\u201d kicking off with that stunning piece of television, Goodbye Mr Clough, on the night he was sacked at Leeds, when his verbal jousting with a flint-faced Revie concludes with the presenter, Austin Mitchell, laying it on the table. \u201cWhat\u2019s going to happen to Brian Clough now?\u201d he asks. \u201cWho\u2019s going to touch you with a bargepole?\u201d When Forest took the punt four months later the club were so skint they held a cheese and wine event to raise a few quid in his first summer. The training ground was a squelchy piece of public grass beside the Trent, long before the days when dog-walkers bothered with poop bags, and at least one player used a Shipstone\u2019s Brown Ales beermat as a tax disc. In keeping with the decade, some of their best moments came on muddy, wet-weekend-at-Glastonbury pitches where the players might have been at risk of trench foot. Yet Forest, at their peak, passed the ball as though they were playing on a bowling green and, if there is any justice, the spotlight will shine more brightly now on those players who have always felt they did not get the recognition they deserved.

Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images    Bob Wilson, in his early days as a BBC pundit, said the \u201cbubble would burst\u201d. It turned out the bubble was made of something more substantial than soap and water, but even when Forest won their first European Cup the team award in the 1979 BBC Sports Personality of the Year show went to the British show-jumpers (\u201cfour effing horses,\u201d as Forest\u2019s secretary, Ken Smales, was heard to exclaim). Equally, just consider the six teams in the hall of fame at the National Football Museum. Manchester United\u2019s European Cup winners from 1968 are honoured, as are the Busby Babes of the 1950s. The Liverpool team of 1978 have been inducted, along with England\u2019s 1966 World Cup winners, Preston\u2019s Invincibles and the Manchester City side that won the league, the FA Cup and European Cup-Winners\u2019 Cup from 1968 to 1970. Only teams that played over 25 years ago can be nominated. Aston Villa, European Cup winners in 1982, are the sixth and, in all those cases, nobody could possibly argue it was undeserved. There is, however, one notable exception and, having spent time with the relevant players in the process of the book-writing, it is clearly a source of irritation that they are remembered as what Robertson calls a \u201crag-tag and bobtail outfit\u201d. Robertson is the case in point. \u201cWhen I try to tell people how good he was it can be difficult because it was over 30 years ago,\u201d McGovern says. \u201cSo what I generally say is: \u2018You know a few years ago there was a guy called Ryan Giggs who played until he was 40 and was regarded as one of the best left-wingers of all time?

But when you look at what Finney and Matthews had to offer, John had a bit of both \u2013 and something extra on top.\u201d That Robertson is not widely remembered outside Nottingham, and perhaps Merseyside, as one of the all-time greats is an anomaly that stems, in part, from the way everyone was fixated on the walking ego in the dugout with the green sweatshirt and shiny, thick hair. \u201cWho is this McGovern?\u2019 G\u00fcnter Netzer, the German midfield legend, asked after Forest had knocked Cologne, the Bundesliga champions, out of the 1979 semi-final. \u201cI have never heard of him, yet he ran the game.\u201d Then there was the chief football correspondent from the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf who interviewed Shilton after the same game and told Forest\u2019s goalkeeper: \u201cOut of your entire team, your name is the only one that is familiar to me.\u201d \u201cWell, you\u2019ll know us all now,\u201d Shilton replied. The legacy, 35 years on, is that Nottingham has won the competition more times than London, Paris, Berlin, Moscow and Rome altogether. It took Manchester United 31 years to win the European Cup for a second time and it was not until 2012 that Chelsea finally notched up one for London. And the world sees Sherwood Forest county differently because of it. \u201cAll of a sudden, Nottingham didn\u2019t just have Robin Hood,\u201d McGovern says. \u201cWe had Robin Hood, Brian Clough and Nottingham Forest.\u201d Mourinho spoke with great warmth, describing Clough as \u201cthis super profile, like he is Prime Minister\u201d, and the book is released next month, on the coat-tails of what Irvine Welsh reckons is the \u201cbest film about football you will ever see\u201d. All the boys of 1979 and 1980 will be at the premiere \u2013 along with 3,500 ticket-holders \u2013 apart from O\u2019Neill, who is away with Republic of Ireland and not tempted to emulate Clough (who often deserted Forest to take a mid-season holiday). The various Clough and Taylor children and grandchildren will also be there, in the ground where there are stands named after both men. The last film about Clough, The Damned United, caused the relatives great distress on the basis, as Nigel bluntly puts it, it was \u201cfull of shit, not artistic licence\u201d. For this one, Owen brought them together for a private showing that was emotional for everyone. \u201cThe beauty of this story is that it\u2019s told by the people who were there,\u201d Nigel says. \u201cThey know what Forest were in 1975 and they know what they were five years later, and they were part of that story.\u201d I Believe in Miracles tells it beautifully and is in the cinemas, nationwide, from Tuesday.

As the executive director of a big bicycle club, she wants to show people that you don\u2019t need fancy gear to ride a bike \u2013 so she rides in her skirt and office shoes. But she does wear a helmet. If she didn\u2019t, she would risk a $102 (\u00a367) fine. Seattle is one of the few big cities in the world where cyclists of all ages are legally required to wear a helmet. \u201cThere\u2019s an interesting conversation going on about this, because it could dissuade people from cycling,\u201d says Kiker. \u201cAnd yet, it is safer if you fall. I once slipped with my bike and fell on my helmet and I was glad I was wearing it.\u201d Five thousand miles to the east, Marco te Br\u00f6mmelstroet cycles to his job as director of the Urban Cycling Institute of the University of Amsterdam. The wind is blowing freely through his hair. \u201cCycling without a helmet is something I take for granted, I never give it any thought,\u201d he says. \u201cBut it does amplify the feeling of ultimate freedom.\u201d In Amsterdam, adults don\u2019t wear helmets while riding city bikes \u2013 they don\u2019t even consider it an option. Helmets are mainly worn by tourists and expats, whom the Dutch regard with bemusement, even ridicule. They know their country is a very safe place to ride a bike: in the Netherlands, the number of cyclists killed per travelled mile is the lowest in the world.    Cycling without a helmet is something I take for granted, I never give it any thought  Marco te Br\u00f6mmelstroet        Marco te Br\u00f6mmelstroet is the director of the Urban Cycling Institute of the University of Amsterdam     Should cyclists in cities wear helmets? And should there be such a thing as a helmet law? Only last week, Britain\u2019s transport minister Robert Goodwill was criticised because he urged cyclists to wear helmets \u2013 while admitting he rides bareheaded through London himself. The helmet question has stirred up a heated debate for a long time and it\u2019s not likely to end very soon. Both critics and advocates seem to have a point. \u201cHelmets are very effective in preventing head injuries and there are many studies to prove it,\u201d maintains Randy Swart of the American Bicycle Helmet Safety Institute. \u201cThese are medical studies, some of them based on emergency room data, some of them based on crash data from accident scenes. Just as important is the information that comes from bicycle clubs and organisations. From their experience, they confirm what the medical studies show: that helmets are effective. There\u2019s a lot of argument about the precentage of injuries that can be prevented by wearing a helmet, but I estimate it to be somewhere around two thirds.\u201d Te Br\u00f6mmelstroet does not agree. \u201cThe problem is precisely that there are not so many studies and that most of the existing studies are methodologically not very sound,\u201d he says. According to him, there only are a limited amount of scenarios in which helmets provide protection. \u201cThat is when the cyclist falls without being involved in a crash. But when you collide with a car that drives faster than 20 miles an hour, a helmet does nothing to save you.\u201d In the US, where rules on helmets vary from state to state, Seattle made them mandatory 12 years ago. The helmet law came about mainly due to pressure from people who worked in local health care. \u201cIt didn\u2019t come about because Seattle would be more dangerous for cyclists than other cities,\u201d Kiker says. \u201cThere has been some debate lately, because it was feared the helmet law would hurt our new bike share programme, but it hasn\u2019t. They have been very innovative about how to incorporate the helmet law into the programme. You can now check out a helmet when you check out a bike.\u201d The answer to the helmet question is not as simple as it seems, says Te Br\u00f6mmelstroet. \u201cIt is important to realise that wearing a helmet can have negative effects. It does not always make cycling safer. Cyclists with helmets are liable to take more risks because they consider themselves safe. And an English study has shown that motorists give considerably less space whilst overtaking cyclists with helmets than when they overtake cyclists that go bareheaded. If you look at it this way, wearing a helmet could lead to more injuries than not wearing one.\u2019\u2019     Cycling in Melbourne. Helmets are compulsory for cyclists across Australia and New Zealand.  Photograph: Alamy    That wearing a helmet can lead to more aggression from motorists, at least in the Netherlands, is something Te Br\u00f6mmelstroet knows from experience. \u201cI cycle to work on a city bike without a helmet, but at the weekends, I wear one while riding my racing bicycle. In the last case, I encounter more aggression. I suddenly seem to belong to a group that triggers a lot of anger.\u2019\u2019 Although they disagree on the safety that helmets provide, Swart, Kiker and Te Br\u00f6mmelstroet all agree on one thing: it\u2019s not helmets that make cycling truly safe, but the amount of cyclists on the road. \u201cIn all American cities where bike riding has gone up, crashes have come down,\u201d says Kiker.  The big question here, of course, is: do cycle helmets increase or decrease the number of cyclists in a city? \u201cIf you want to encourage cycling, helmet laws are certainly not a good idea,\u201d says Te Br\u00f6mmelstroet. \u201cWhen you make helmets mandatory, people will think that cycling is impractical and even dangerous. For example, in Australia the number of cyclists went down drastically after helmets became mandatory.\u201d \u201cIf a helmet law were going to reduce cycling significantly, I would say you\u2019d have to think very seriously before passing it. It is a valid consideration,\u201d Swart agrees. \u201cBut Australia is half a world away. Compulsory helmets might start a revolution in one place but can be just fine in another. A lot of what we are talking about is simply cultural. In the US, we do not have any documented situations where passing a helmet law reduced cycling.\u201d    It was feared the helmet law would hurt our new bike share programme, but it hasn\u2019t  Elizabeth Kiker        If Elizabeth Kiker did not wear a helmet in Seattle she could be fined $102    \u201cIn Seattle, the amount of cyclists has definitely gone up,\u201d says Kiker. \u201cOf course, there are fewer bikes on the road than in Dutch cities. But I do feel safe while riding through the city. And I ride everywhere. My bike is how I get around.\u201d When the numbers of cyclist go up, there is a clear impact on how drivers treats cyclists. Swart explains: \u201cIn most cities in the United States, drivers are not expecting bicycles. So they aren\u2019t looking in the right direction when they overtake one. In some places, drivers don\u2019t even know how to react to a cyclist. When more people cycle in a city, drivers become accustomed to them, they accept them and they learn how to safely deal with them. More cyclists means greater safety, so we should do all we can to encourage cycling. \u201cIn cities where there is a lot of cycling, the majority of the motorists also often ride a bicycle. So they are much more aware of the impact of their driving style on cyclists,\u201d says Te Br\u00f6mmelstroet. \u201cCar speeds come down in cities where cycling is important, and this opens opportunities to mix traffic in such a way that motorists behave as guests. In the Netherlands, you can see this in so-called fietsstraten, or bicycle-streets, where cyclists are the dominant mode of transport.\u201d The problem is not only that helmet laws would reduce cycling, he says. \u201cWhen governments make helmets compulsory, they leave the responsibility for safety in the hands of the cyclists. They are blaming the victim. Whereas in the Netherlands, we believe in the responsibility of the motorist. That\u2019s why our government has introduced strict liability.\u201d   Related: The most cycle-friendly cities in the world \u2013 your pictures and stories    This means that in Amsterdam, in case of a crash, the motorist is liable for financial damage, unless he can prove that the cyclist was at fault \u2013 but then he still will be liable for half of the damage.  Swart is not totally convinced whether this is a good measure: \u201cThere are two considerations here. One is: it will make the motorist more careful. And that is very good. But secondly, I can also imagine that the motorist will consider it unfair when the cyclist didn\u2019t wear a helmet and is then subject to an injury that would not have happened if he were wearing one.\u201d \u201cAs a scientist and as a father, I am not against helmets,\u201d says Te Br\u00f6mmelstroet. \u201cBut I am certainly against helmet laws. If you want to make cycling safer, start with good infrastructure: build segregated cyclepaths. I am against the false idea of security that helmets offer. They may have some protective value, but not as much as people tend to think. And why all this focus on protecting the head?\u2019\u2019 he adds jokingly. \u201cIf you want to be really safe, you should also consider elbow, knee and back protection. And why all this emphasis on the need to wear helmets on bikes?

Sweeney said: \u201cI think what we are going to hear is that the plane was blown out of the sky, and hopefully everybody died instantly.\u201d The DSB will provide a technical account of how the plane came down near Grabovo in eastern Ukraine, but it will not deal with \u201cblame and culpability\u201d.

It is expected to answer the most politically charged question of who shot down MH17. Tuesday\u2019s report is expected to indicate whether some passengers survived the initial impact of a missile strike, after the body of one passenger was found with an oxygen mask around his neck. Sweeney said he hoped none of the passengers survived the initial impact. Speaking to BBC Radio 4\u2019s Today programme, he said: \u201cI think once the missile hit the plane the decompression [would have meant] people were unconscious or dead within seconds. It\u2019s a hard situation to comprehend.\u201d He said he was not frustrated by the length of the inquiry, which has been dogged by problems of investigators gaining access to the crash site. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long time but I think the Dutch have had to be very meticulous \u2013 it is not something that they could do straight away,\u201d Sweeney said. The report is also expected to provide answers as to why the Dutch authorities took up to four days to inform relatives of the death of passengers. Sweeney said he found out about Liam\u2019s death on a Newcastle United fan site, a day after the crash. He said: \u201cI basically found out on social media the next morning. I wasn\u2019t sure what flight Liam was on \u2013 he just said he was going to New Zealand to watch Newcastle United and that was it. I got in touch with emergency lines and I wasn\u2019t getting anything back. I found out on NUFC.com.\u201d   Related: MH17 crash report is set for release, but it is unlikely to offer closure    Contributors to the forum wrongly assumed that the Sweeneys knew of their son\u2019s death at the time.  Two-thirds of those on board were Dutch. The remaining passengers were from nine other countries, including 10 from Britain. It is widely assumed that Russia-backed separatists were responsible for bringing down MH17, but the US has stopped short of blaming Moscow directly. The Kremlin, meanwhile, has blamed Kiev. It has variously suggested a Ukrainian military jet shot down the Boeing, or that a missile was launched from a government-held area. In Moscow, the makers of Buk missile systems, Almaz-Antey, gave a press conference on Tuesday morning apparently aimed at distracting attention from the Dutch report. The manufacturer said it had performed two experiments which it says proves one of its missiles could not have been launched from areas under pro-Russian separatist control.  Representatives of the defence concern said they had used the carcass of a decommissioned Ilyushin-86 aircraft, similar in shape to a Boeing 777, as they did not have any decommissioned Boeings, and showed video of ground-based experiments in which Buk missiles were fired at the front section of the plane. The press conference was held in a huge hall, and attended by journalists from around the world, some of whom had been flown in at the expense of the organisers to cover the event. The company\u2019s technical director gave a long presentation packed with graphs and data which he claimed backed up the Russian manufacturer\u2019s results, but did not address why so much eyewitness evidence put the Buk missile system inside separatist territory.

In my opinion that is not the only point. Malaysian Airlines should not have flown over Ukraine, no one should have. They closed it after MH17 but it was too late.

Related: MH17 crash report: rival Dutch and Russian claims focus on Buk missile fragments    Much of the text is dedicated to ruling out options for the loss of the aircraft \u2013 such as catastrophic malfunction, an air-to-air missile or other more exotic possibilities such as a meteorite strike \u2013 but it is more precise than many had predicted on the actual cause of the plane\u2019s destruction, even naming the model of Buk warhead the Dutch safety board believes was involved. It also notes multiple cases of vital evidence going missing from the crash site and concludes that no commercial airliners should have been allowed to fly over the war zone in the first place.  On what hit the plane  The aeroplane was struck by a 9N314M warhead as carried on a 9M38-series missile and launched by a Buk surface-to-air missile system. This conclusion is based on the combination of the following: the recorded sound peak, the damage pattern found on the wreckage caused by the blast and the impact of the fragments, the bow-tie and cubic shaped fragments found in the cockpit and in the bodies of the crew members in the cockpit, the injuries sustained by three crew members in the cockpit, the analysis of the in-flight break-up, the analysis of the explosive residues and paint found and the size and distinct, bow-tie, shape of some of the fragments.    Related: The MH17 report \u2013 a guide to the flight's final moments    The bow-tie fragments appear to be crucial, but only two were identified among the 43 pieces of unalloyed steel believed to be shrapnel from the missile. One of those two was recovered from the body of the pilot, and the other from the remains of the cockpit. They were found to have the same weight and shape \u2013 allowing for impact and abrasion \u2013 as pre-formed fragments on the 9N314M warhead, which was consistent with two missiles fired by the Buk anti-aircraft system, the 9M38 missile or its later variant, the 9M38M1. On the launch site The Dutch board carried out computer simulations on the various trajectories that could have brought the missile together with the plane. That produced a 320 sq km swath of eastern Ukraine. Simulations by a Ukrainian forensic research institute and by the Buk manufacturer in Russia, Almaz-Antey, came up with different, smaller areas \u2013 both within the Dutch board\u2019s grid.   Mh17 missile launch site   On whether MH17 should have been there In the period between April and July 2014, the Ukrainians reported that 16 of their military aircraft, both helicopters and planes, had been shot down. Two of those planes had been flying at an altitude above 6,000m, and thus must have been downed by powerful missiles capable of hitting civilian airliners. The blame for allowing commercial planes to continue to fly over the war zone lies primarily with Ukraine, the report said.  In the international system of responsibilities, the sovereign state bears sole responsibility for the safety of the airspace.  On missing evidence  It should be noted that many pieces of the wreckage were not physically examined by the Dutch Safety Board until four months after the crash. During this period some parts were removed, therefore it was not possible to retrieve all wreckage pieces. Wherever possible, the photographs taken immediately after the crash were used in conjuction with the wreckage found.  Among the missing pieces of fuselage were sections of the upper left side around the business class cabin, which were pockmarked with shrapnel holes and covered in soot, presumably from the detonation of the explosives. On the passengers  The impact was entirely unexpected, which means that people were barely able to comprehend the situation in which they found themselves. There was hardly any time for a conscious response. The occupants were exposed to extreme factors almost immediately. Depending on variables such as the occupant\u2019s location in the cabin at the moment of impact, the factors were not the same for all the occupants. A number of occupants immediately sustained severe injuries as a result of the factors, probably causing death. For others, the exposure caused reduced awareness or unconsciousness within moments. It could not be ascertained at which exact moment occupants died, but it is certain that the impact on the ground was not survivable.   It seems that one passenger was conscious enough to put on an oxygen mask which dropped from the ceiling. The strap was found still around the passenger\u2019s neck and the mask was around the throat. Radar data  The Russian Federation did not provide the radar data stating that no radar data was saved, but instead provided the radar screen video replay, which showed combined surveillance primary and secondary radar. In the absence of the underlying radar data (so-called raw data), the video information could not be verified  The report notes that \u201cstates are required to automatically record data from primary and secondary surveillance radar equipment\u201d for at least 30 days, longer if there has been an accident.  The Russia\u2019s federal air transport agency told the Dutch board that it didn\u2019t save radar data because the incident happened outside Russian territory. The Dutch board said that Russia\u2019s own official procedure does not mention any exception to planes outside Russian territory.

Cindy Sherman\u2019s untitled work of 1989, in which she poses as the Virgin and Child of Jean Fouquet\u2019s 1450 diptych, faces the original. Sherman\u2019s version is deliberately, comically haphazard: Fouquet\u2019s solemn cherubim in demonic colours have been replaced by a charity-shop net curtain, the elegant gown rendered as a jacquard frock from a dressing-up box and \u2013 most noticeably \u2013 Fouquet\u2019s improbably round breast, offered to an uninterested, rather stern baby, becomes in Sherman\u2019s version a prosthetic that, if it didn\u2019t come from a seaside joke shop, should have done. There is wit and sadness in Sherman\u2019s photograph, which is part of her often-imitated History Portrait series; motherhood in Fouquet\u2019s painting belongs in an entirely different emotional frame. From the parodied super-roundness of the Virgin Mary\u2019s breast to the creepily alabaster skin of both Mary and the Christ child, all the imagery is of power. Her breasts echo the roundness of the jewels in her crown: she is unfamiliarly, outrageously wealthy, the Queen of Heaven with the pomp and finery to match, her mother status the source of her power.     \u2018Mother and child communicate on a level so instinctive that their eyes appear to be moved by the same nervous system\u2019 \u2026 Mary Cassatt\u2019s The Child\u2019s Bath, painted in 1893.  Photograph: DeA Picture Library/The Art Archive    There\u2019s not very much tenderness in the dyad; rather, the eerie perfection of mother and child expresses a kind of shock. If she can produce that with her vagina, the composition seems to say, what on earth is she going to do next? The Virgin Mary as the (not necessarily trustworthy) holder of superpowers is still a concern in Alonso Cano\u2019s Saint Bernard and the Virgin, circa 1650, in which a doleful-looking mother removes a disapproving Christ from her breast so she can squirt milk directly into the mouth of Saint Bernard. This is more than a feat of breast-dexterity; the milk itself had curative properties. (In another version of the story, she squirts it into his eye and cures him of blindness \u2026 or astygmatism. History doesn\u2019t relate.)    If she can produce that with her vagina, the composition seems to say, what on earth is she going to do next?    These mothers are depicted with equal parts suspicion and awe, as they unleash a power with which no one else can compete. The portraits of mothers ceded to a more dynastic ideal \u2013 less Virgin and Child, more matriarch and six children, all unmistakably resembling some father just out of frame. The soppy, idealised portraits of motherhood as a state \u2013 the mother fulfilled by, tethered to, her baby \u2013 was driven by later, female painters such as Marguerite G\u00e9rard in the 18th century. It was not the mainstream of maternal identity through history, even though it is this idealisation that contemporary depictions of motherhood are often reacting to and against. Before the rush of 20th-century reality \u2013 the ectopic pregnancies and caesarian scars \u2013 that dynastic purpose of procreation ceded to the impressionists, who found profundity in the everyday motherhood of the bourgeoisie. Again, this had to wait for a female painter to find its expression; there being fewer of those, the topic is and has always been underrepresented. Cassatt\u2019s The Child\u2019s Bath, painted in 1893 by the only American to exhibit with the impressionists, takes the most quotidian act (washing a child\u2019s feet) and invests it with poignancy merely through the direction of their gaze; the mother and child communicate on a level so instinctive that their eyes appear to be moved by the same nervous system. Gustav Klimt\u2019s Three Ages of Women, painted 12 years later, puts a downer on things with a memento mori; the post-menopausal age, a woman holding her head in despair that she is no longer able to procreate or, worse, adorn her hair with daisies like all the rest of her Klimtian stable. Nevertheless, the two other ages of woman \u2013 infancy and motherhood \u2013 are sacred states, the child\u2019s splayed hand and the mother\u2019s tilted head shimmering with the simplicity of their physical love for one another. That is visible, too, in the 90s series of mothers with newborns by the Dutch photographer Rineke Dijkstra, but there is much more in these besides. The physical toll of the whole messy business is there in a single track of blood down the model\u2019s leg; visible and shocking, after centuries of an aesthetic norm in which the tribulations of Christ were fair game but the trials of childbirth mainly taboo. (In fairness, Bill Viola\u2019s Nantes Trytich, two years earlier, begins with a young woman giving birth, and it\u2019s no walk in the park.) Dijkstra\u2019s subject is also visibly frightened, which is perhaps the greater taboo \u2013 that while the role might be genetically predetermined, that doesn\u2019t mean you know how to do it or that you take naturally to the erasure of your former self. The tenderness is there, but is the source of her terror; even as she stands naked, it is her tiny baby that is her undefended flank.     Tenderness and terror ... Tecla, Amsterdam, Netherlands, May 16 1994, by Rineke Dijkstra. Photograph: Courtesy the artist and Marian Goodman Gallery, New York.    Tierney Gearon\u2019s I Am Camera project, from 2000, upturns not the role of mother but that of child \u2013 her son and daughter on a beach, naked, wearing masks of rubber doll faces, the language of their bodies deliberately unsettling without the reassurance of their faces. The popular press responded with outrage at the time, finding the images plainly paedophilic, since why else would you photograph your own child naked unless you wanted to engage the world in lascivious imaginings? The News of the World described them openly as \u201cperversion under the guise of art\u201d, unflustered by how perverse it was of them to jump to such a conclusion. The police considered shutting the exhibition down. Even while it is a modern and hopefully passing prurience to be unable to see a naked child without assuming an abusive subtext, these images do convey something that is habitually unsayable about motherhood: that the vulnerability of the child is the burden of ages, and the urge to adult-ify one\u2019s children, putting them in adult poses, in adult masks, wars constantly with the desire to infantilise them, or keep them infants (ideally, of course, put them back in, where you can be sure that nothing will happen to them). And it is this that makes motherhood the vexed state that it is, not so much for the mother but for the child, who cannot possibly fulfil this requirement that they simultaneously grow up and return to the womb. About 1,500 years ago, mothers held superpowers. Now we are merely ordinary women who ask impossible things. It\u2019s progress of sorts.  Body of Art is published by Phaidon.

It\u2019s no longer enough to have clean streets and a passable metro; cities must now be able to have all that and use data to calculate consumption, resource usage and traffic management.  The Digital Agenda for Europe (2010) highlighted the importance of more open data across the EU, which will be used to improve public services and create smarter cities across the continent.  Dietman Offenhuber is an assistant professor at Northeastern University, Boston, Massachusetts, in the department of art, design and public policy. He says: \u201cA smart city needs the capacity to sense a current condition, interpret the resulting data to find patterns, and react \u2013 or create the capacity for city managers to react \u2013 appropriately.\u201d A smart city aims to improve the quality of life for its citizens, and should be well placed to react to urban challenges. As data opens up, the smarter our cities, the more connected we are as citizens \u2013 and the higher our quality of life. Amsterdam     An Amsterdam canal. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    Amsterdam is as connected as they come. Link-ups between local companies, the government, and citizens have helped Amsterdam Smart City grow into a platform with more than 100 partners. Ron van der Lans, programme manager for open and big data for Amsterdam Smart City, says his goal is about making data available for partners of the city, such as the police or local companies: \u201cWe want to add extra value to the use of data\u201d. He explains how open data has contributed to a more user-friendly, streamlined city. One example is how open data and an app forged from information gathered about Amsterdam has helped disabled people navigate the city. If they run into issues, or divert off the usual route, a call centre will get in touch. Another creation is City Alerts, which warns the fire brigade of issues that concern privacy or safety. \u201cA fireman was once stabbed by a mentally unstable resident after responding to an emergency call. Now we warn him with colour codes from the police and the mental health service\u201d says Van der Lans, explaining how much smarter and safer a city can be by utilising open and shared data. Manchester      Manchester city centre at night including the Arndale Centre and the Printworks.

Data GM is a site that claims to \u201cfree greater Manchester\u2019s public data\u201d. Created by public sector organisations in Manchester, it includes data on public transport, road accidents, bus stops and libraries. By opening up this data, members of the public and developers have been able to help Mancunians live more efficiently.  A staggeringly large number of public bodies are committed to sharing data, including Manchester city council, the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities, and Transport for Greater Manchester. This has resulted in projects such as those developed by the Trafford Intelligence and Data lab to make a \u201chot housing heatmap\u201d that helps buyers work out which areas are best to buy in. Being a smart city is about making the city easy and navigable.  Helsinki     A marketplace in Helsinki. Photograph: Alamy    For the last century, the Finnish capital has kept up-to-date statistics documenting the city, its citizens and its services, all now open to the public and available online. This is a boon for developers, journalists, and city planners, who are able to use the data to develop the city and help it to evolve. As well as receiving the EU\u2019s prize for public administration in 2013, the city\u2019s collected data \u2013 called Helsinki region infoshare \u2013 has opened up the city and helped it to become smart. One app, Blindsquare, helps visually impaired people to navigate the city by layering public transport data with information from Foursquare. The app also gives information about museum exhibitions and art galleries which enables Helsinki\u2019s visually impaired residents to lead a culturally rich and active life.

It\u2019s a city that prides itself on turning ideas into realities. Smart cities try to foster personal and business development by using new technologies and managing resources efficiently, something Barcelona is doing well. One of its main focuses has been on making public and social services more transparent \u2013 all appointments for council services can now be made online. The local council is encouraging contactless connections across the city, a service it believes will enable citizens to find out what is going on in their area at any given time. It\u2019s all about making life easier by using technology.  Stockholm     Snow covered Stockholm. Photograph: Alamy    Green technologies are key when developing a smart city, and Stockholm, one of Europe\u2019s most connected cities, knows this. It has a green IT strategy which works in partnership with inhabitants, public services, and local companies to promote a green agenda. By 2030, the city is aiming to have implemented environmentally efficient transport based on new technology, worked out how to use energy sustainably, and propagated environmentally friendly waste management.  Being a smart city, Stockholm is keen to promote digital solutions for its problems. For example, there is a city-wide initiative to replace face-to-face meetings with digital ones, promote cycling, and implement green IT by cutting down on paper usage. Stockholm prides itself on being one of the most connected cities, not only in terms of physical connections, but digital ones too. For Stockholm, part of being a smart city is having an excellent fibre cable network to spur economic progress and encourage more businesses to move there.

His work is beloved by the public \u2013 though he snubbed the Rolling Stones when they requested an album cover \u2013 and by mathematicians, doctors and dentists, but almost ignored by museums and major galleries, the curators say. There is only one Escher in any UK public collection, at the Hunterian in Glasgow, a print that was left on a geography professor\u2019s office wall.     A previously unknown Escher sketch obtained by the Escher Museum in The Hague, Netherlands. Photograph: Escher Museum    There was a time when no student abode was complete without a poster of a Escher\u2019s hands drawing each other, or his glum figures trudging up an impossible staircase turning at right angles and continuing wearyingly upwards into eternity.  Gallery director Ian Dejardin, who once had the hands print on his wall, said: \u201cHe is one of the most well known artists of the 20th century, by image if not by name. I think the really remarkable thing is that there has been no great show before.\u201d Escher, born near Amsterdam in 1898, son of a civil engineer, was a respectable and occasionally prickly character, who hated his new fame when San Francisco hippies began pirating his work in the 1960s, and declined to create a Stones album cover because he was offended when the letter from Mick Jagger addressed him by his first name, Maurits. \u201cHe may have been the only person in the world who had never heard of the Rolling Stones,\u201d Dejardin said. \u201cYou have to like a man who said no to Mick Jagger \u2013 and in the 1960s at that.\u201d Micky Piller, former curator of the Escher Museum in The Hague, said the Stones frontman was genuinely fascinated and told friends he was reading a book about him every night \u2013 \u201cI would have thought Mick Jagger would have been doing other things at nights,\u201d she added.     Escher\u2019s Metamorphosis II (1939-40). Photograph: Ray Tang/Rex    Escher is famous for his impossible geometrical shapes, landscapes where reality lurches out of kilter, and tessellating patterns where a beehive can turn into a bee, a bird, a fish and finally an Italian church. \u201cDentists like to put them on their walls,\u201d she said. \u201cThey think it\u2019s a great way of getting people engaged and forgetting about reality.\u201d Two young mathematicians who became among the most famous in the world, the Briton Roger Penrose and the late Canadian HSM Coxeter, were dazzled by Escher\u2019s work as students in 1954. Escher in turn was inspired by Penroses\u2019s perspectival triangle and Coxeter\u2019s work on crystal symmetry. The exhibition includes Escher\u2019s pencilled notes on an essay by Coxeter in the transactions and proceedings of the Royal Society of Canada, and the four increasingly complex prints he made emulating the crystal forms. He wrote thanking Coxeter for the essay, but insisted it was \u201cmuch too learned for a simple, self made plane-pattern man like me\u201d.     A woman photographs St Paul\u2019s Cathedral in London from the top of the Endless Stair, an installation inspired by Escher\u2019s surreal drawings of neverending staircases. Photograph: AFP/Getty    When Penrose\u2019s uncle, artist and critic Roland Penrose, showed the triangle and Escher\u2019s versions of it to his contemporary Pablo Picasso, Picasso had heard of the British mathematician but not of the Dutch artist. The exhibition covers the span of Escher\u2019s creations from student work through to the meticulous drawings of Italian landscapes and Moorish tiles to his final print, of snakes writhing through a disc of chain mail, made in 1969, three years before his death. Patrick Elliott, curator at the Scottish National Gallery of Modern Art, where the exhibition opened before heading to Dulwich, said Escher was a brilliant artist and superb craftsman. It was the gallery\u2019s second most popular show after Van Gogh. \u201cThe public love Escher \u2013 it\u2019s only museum folk who don\u2019t,\u201d he said. \u2022 The Amazing World of MC Escher is at the Dulwich Picture Gallery until 17 January.", "sentences": ["I think the really remarkable thing is that there has been no great show before.\u201d Escher, born near Amsterdam in 1898, son of a civil engineer, was a respectable and occasionally prickly character, who hated his new fame when San Francisco hippies began pirating his work in the 1960s, and declined to create a Stones album cover because he was offended when the letter from Mick Jagger addressed him by his first name, Maurits."], "title": "MC Escher exhibition pays tribute to Dutch master of illusion", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/oct/14/mc-escher-exhibition-dutch-master-illusion-dulwich-picture-gallery", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "Illustration", "Culture", "Exhibitions", "Design"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-10-14T14:50:04Z", "article": "ORANJE-DOOM Tuesday was billed as D-Day for the Holland football team in their last-ditch quest to stay in the running for Euro 2016 qualification and so it came to pass: D for \u201cDutch defeat at the hands of the Czech Republic\u201d, D for \u201cdidn\u2019t make the play-offs\u201d and D for \u201cd\u2019oh!\u201d as Robin van Persie put the tin hat on a thoroughly miserable campaign by scoring past his own goalkeeper with a header even more memorable than that beauty he famously scored against Spain.

With popular local beat music combo Super Furry Animals, purveyors of such bleep-infused tunesmithery as The Man Don\u2019t Give A F**k, The International Language of Screaming and the catchily titled Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch, the ecstatic Welsh players were photographed celebrating their recent success by cavorting around the pitch, doing the Joe Ledley and glugging heartily from large bottles of champagne. Despite this carousing, it is a sign of their newfound football maturity that they still sobered up in time to beat Andorra 2-0 and round off their most successful qualifying campaign since the Cold War.     This is a thing, isn\u2019t it.

FIVER LETTERS \u201cRe: J\u00fcrgen Klopp headlines (yesterday\u2019s Fiver letters). If he is ever forced to resign after a poor run of form, with the final straw being an attack on former Sunderland, Newcastle and West Ham forward Bryan Robson in a police station, then you can have the following: Top Flop Klopp Chops Pop in Cop Shop to Cop Kop Chop. I am bored. Sorry\u201d \u2013 Rob McEvoy. \u201cIf it all goes wrong for Sam Allardyce at the Stadium of Light and he\u2019s dismissed on 27 February, you can have this headline on me: Wham Bam Thank You Sam, Boss Gets Can After West Ham Sham\u201d \u2013 Simon McKenzie. \u201cBeing the relentless, sneering, self-loathing, nihilistic Englishman that I am, I\u2019ve always considered your coverage of the Three Lions to be positively jingoistic. Either way, I feel Stuart Comer\u2019s criticism was particularly unfair (yesterday\u2019s letters). The Fiver\u2019s got at least a dozen tedious jokes it regularly falls back on. THREE! MORE!

If indeed he did \u2018read yesterday\u2019s Fiver for the first time in about three years\u2019, that means the first time he read it was roughly 1,095 days ago. So, if Stuart is reading this either in the future or the past, could he please let me know if Herr Klopp will indeed snaffle Liverpool a title within the next four years and save me the chewed finger nails?

As he says, the game has a \u2018whole cult of socially inadequate obsessives\u2019, blew people away when it was first released, only for many to grow quickly bored, and continues to divide public opinion (hello Stuart Comer). In the game, players even take on the role of a Guardian.

As well as having one of the largest pride weeks in the world, there are LGBTQ events, workshops, parties and projects on a weekly basis, from large-scale film festivals (Inside Out) to monthly dance parties like Yes Yes Y\u2019all. It also has plenty of dedicated LGBT bars/clubs/restaurants. The city as a whole is extremely inclusive. The Drake hotel, located on what is called \u201cQueer West\u201d (Queen St West) works with LGBT artists for pop-up exhibitions, throws an annual pride party, and employs several LGBT staff. Its general store sells fun LGBT products and the hotel hosts many LGBT wedding ceremonies. I feel safe in Toronto, and proud of the city, which is the most LGBT-friendly destination I have ever visited.\u2022 Doubles at the Drake from \u00a3100 room-only, thedrakehotel.caJessrod26 Amsterdam     The canal parade, part of gay pride week, Amsterdam. Photograph: Corbis    The city has gay hotels, bars, pubs, saunas, clubs, and even a gay coffee shop, and there is the homomonument, which commemorates gay people who have been persecuted. For detailed LGBT information try the Pink Point, on Westermarkt near the homomonument, which also sells gay souvenirs. Pride is a party weekend, starting on the last Saturday in July, right across Amsterdam and its canals. Other annual highlights for the gay community include New Year\u2019s Eve, the King\u2019s Day parade in late April and, next week, Leatherpride (22-26 October). The main gay business areas are Reguliersdwarsstraat, Amstelstraat, Kerkstraat, and Warmoesstraat. With appeal for gay people I\u2019d recommend hotel Amistad (doubles from \u00a345) and the boutique Mauro Mansion (doubles from \u00a375). Club Church (Kerkstraat 52) is a cruise club aimed at males, while the bar Vivelavie (Amstelstraat 7) is probably the most popular venue for lesbians. TrellBurton Edinburgh     94DR, Edinburgh    I stayed at the gorgeous 94DR guest house-hotel-boutique B&amp;B with my other half and our lesbian friends. First, it is stylish and luxurious and everything you wish for in a B&amp;B. Second, the location is perfect for the Scottish capital, being near Arthur\u2019s Seat and the Royal Mile. Third, it is perfect for LGBT couples and friends. The warm welcome of the owners and hosts is great \u2013 getting it just right between enthusiastic suggestions and leaving you in peace to enjoy your holiday. Of course, Edinburgh itself is a great gay-friendly city \u2013 and the owners gave us great tips on bars and spots to visit. Definitely tap them for their local knowledge.

Every neighbourhood has its own bloco \u2013 free street parties offering visitors an opportunity to experience carnival like a local. The Banda de Ipanema bloco attracts a huge and friendly gay crowd, while around the arches in Lapa there is a smaller, more bohemian scene. We recuperated at a gay beach \u2013 Ipanema Farme \u2013 a great place for people watching and queijo coalho (hot cheese on a stick) snacks.ID090252 Barcelona     Metro Disco, Barcelona    Beautiful beaches, amazing architecture and naughty nightlife \u2026 Barcelona has it all. Spend a day walking the city, taking in the sights: the Sagrada Familia, Parc G\u00fcell and the amazing Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana. Have a late tapas dinner at Casa Jaime, which is just a short walk from Atame, a fun, vibrant gay bar usually with a drag queen cabaret. Finish the night dancing in Metro Disco, a gay nightclub with added extras. The following day, recover by taking a short train ride to Sitges and spend the day lounging and people-watching on Platja Bassa Rodona, a popular gay beach brimming with bronzed bodies.Terry Buzec Bangkok     Thailand is one of the more tolerant countries in south-east Asia towards LGBT couples. Photograph: Corbis    Having lived in there for the best part of two years, I got a real sense of why Thailand is considered to be one of the most forward and gay-friendly countries in Asia. There is a real feeling of warmth and acceptance from the Thai people. Although it is not the Thai custom to overly express affection, especially in public, this is no different for same-sex couples as for opposite-sex couples. Bangkok has many hot-spots in the Sukhumvit road and Silom areas where you can eat, drink and dance to your heart\u2019s content in venues aimed at the LGBT community. In short, Thailand is a place where you can truly be free to be yourself.basilbus66 Tel Aviv     Hilton beach, Tel Aviv. Photograph: Alamy    Tel Aviv may not conjure up visions of dazzling nightlife, hip restaurants, stylish boutiques, and busy streets hopping with clubs and cafes \u2013 all of which are all inclusive and gay-friendly. But this vibrant city is an undisputed queer capital of the Middle East. It offers a huge array of gay attractions. I love going to Hilton beach, taking in the sights that the sea and sand have to offer (including bronzed six-packs). At night, Rothschild Boulevard is where gay and straight people mingle amid trendy eateries and stylish sculptures. Make sure to check out Rustico, a fantastic Italian restaurant with a great atmosphere and even greater food.jamesleestevens\u2022 Why Tel Aviv is among the world\u2019s most gay-friendly cities  Chongqing, China     Karaoke bars and restaurants in Chongqing.

As the country that had the world\u2019s first out lesbian prime minister, J\u00f3hanna Sigur\u00f0ard\u00f3ttir, Iceland welcomes one and all. We stayed at the reasonably priced White Swan guesthouse. There\u2019s lots to see and do: whale watching, the Blue Lagoon, Gullfoss waterfall, geysers \u2013 all set in magical landscapes.

The Rainbow Reykjavik website has lots of information for LGBT people.NeetieNoots Copenhagen     Preparations for gay pride under way in Rainbow square, Copenhagen. Photograph: Corbis    Of all of the places I have been, Copenhagen has to be the most LGBT-friendly. After all, Denmark was one of the first countries in the world to do same-sex registered partnerships. Definitely worth a visit is what is said to be Europe\u2019s oldest gay bar, Centralhjornet, where there are amazing cocktails and a lot of fun. Another place to visit is Rainbow Square, which used to be called Town Hall square but has been renamed by the city council to honour the LGBT community. With lots of amazing LGBT accommodation and events to celebrate equality and the LGBT community, Copenhagen is a must.Cerys John", "sentences": ["I feel safe in Toronto, and proud of the city, which is the most LGBT-friendly destination I have ever visited.\u2022 Doubles at the Drake from \u00a3100 room-only, thedrakehotel.caJessrod26 Amsterdam     The canal parade, part of gay pride week, Amsterdam.", "Pride is a party weekend, starting on the last Saturday in July, right across Amsterdam and its canals."], "title": "LGBT-friendly cities, hotels, restaurants and clubs: readers\u2019 travel tips", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/oct/15/lgbt-lesbian-gay-travel-tips", "tags": ["Gay and lesbian travel", "Travel"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-10-15T06:00:10Z", "article": "I was kicked out of school at the age of 15. I was glad \u2013 but what was I going to do? This was Belgium in 1952, just after the war, and life wasn\u2019t easy. So I became an assistant to my father, who was a photographer. He never told me he liked my work, but I know from friends he did. At the age of 18, I got a job with HUMO magazine, which sold 250,000 copies a week. It\u2019s not intellectual, but it\u2019s full of ideas and humour. I did whatever they asked, driving about 60,000km a year. Belgium\u2019s a small country, but I always thought that what was around my street corner was as interesting as Africa. I still believe that. American soldiers stationed in Germany used to cross over the border and spend their weekends in Antwerp. They\u2019d bring their records to the pubs and leave them there, so rock\u2019n\u2019roll started to become popular \u2013 and HUMO was one of the first publications to cover it. All the other papers hated rock\u2019n\u2019roll. One of the first concerts I was sent to was a show called Jazz at the Philharmonic \u2013 on a single night, you could see five or six world famous stars, people like Ella Fitzgerald. I didn\u2019t know it back then, but I was one of the first rock photographers. I was always more of a Rolling Stones man than a Beatles man, though. I shot them in 1964, then again in 1966, when they were in a bad mood after a very hectic performance in Amsterdam. I was in their dressing room and Mick Jagger said: \u201cGet out, I hate you!\u201d But if you aren\u2019t demanding, people soon forget you\u2019re there. I hate to make people pose. I\u2019m too lazy and shy to ask Mick Jagger: \u201cPlease stand there.\u201d I prefer spontaneity. This is from when I saw them next, in 1973, playing to 16,000 people at the Antwerp Sportpaleis. I was allowed to take photos from the stage front for three songs, then I had to go back into the crowd. But I had a telephoto lens and actually took this later, from the crowd, where photography was forbidden. I hope they don\u2019t sue me for it. Mick looks like the devil, just for this one split second. When you\u2019re working, you hardly notice what you\u2019re seeing. But later, you look at your contact sheet and think: which of these is telling my truth? A lot of my photos are accidents, but luck is like a streetcar \u2013 when it passes, you have to jump on. When I was 65, HUMO asked me to do half the work I was doing for half of the money, which was a fantastic offer. But they added that they\u2019d like there to be a \u201cgood feeling\u201d in my pictures. I was driving home thinking: \u201cA good feeling?\u201d So I said sorry, I quit. I\u2019m not interested in that kind of picture. Devilishness is more interesting.  Herman Selleslags: The Archives is at 88 Gallery, London, until 24 October      Herman Selleslags.

We can now work from home or a coffee shop, hire a studio in a communal workspace alongside other startups, or work from an office operating a hot-desk policy, where desks are shared and not allocated to one person. As companies become more portable, the concept of office space is being revoutionised. One company tapping into the trend is The Office Group (TOG), which leases more than 20 offices and working spaces to anyone from freelancers to medium-sized businesses. \u201cAs people continue to work in a more mobile way, there\u2019s a greater need for companies and individuals to drop into different places,\u201d says TOG co-founder Charlie Green. Today\u2019s new crop of innovative offices are not only catering to a mobile workforce, but also ensuring their designs are highly sustainable. Take the forthcoming White Collar Factory in Old Street, London. Here the central environmental aim is to reduce the level of mechanical air conditioning through the use of chilled water circulated through pipes embedded in the concrete slabs (cool slabs).  Another key trend within sustainable buildings \u2013 and featured in the White Collar Factory \u2013 is the use of exposed concrete walls. \u201cIt reduces energy and materials,\u201d says Simon Allford, co-founder of Allford Hall Monaghan Morris, the architect firm behind the multi-use building. The thermal mass of concrete absorbs and releases heat so it reduces the need for air-conditioning. Also, as it\u2019s exposed, it doesn\u2019t require finishing materials, so that cuts out extra waste. At The Edge, a multi-tenant complex in Amsterdam, green features include collecting rainwater to water the gardens and flush the toilets and enabling workers to regulate the climate and light over their workspace via an app on their smartphones. The latter not only saves money and helps the environment, but also provides insight into how the building is run, helping overall efficiency.  Some small businesses are already on track to achieving high environmental credentials. Nicolas Tye Architects\u2019 office in Maulden, Bedfordshire, features frameless glass panels, to boost natural-light levels, underfloor heating, a wind turbine, rainwater harvesting and compost facilities.

Eight minutes have passed in the 2002 Champions League final and nothing of any significance has occurred yet, other than Carsten Ramelow leaving one on Zinedine Zidane. Real Madrid and Bayer Leverkusen are still in the awkward getting-to-know-you phase, a little unsure of themselves, neither of them wanting to make a false move and spill their drink over the other. The ball goes out of play, the pace slows, the intensity dips. Leverkusen, the emphatic underdogs, relax.  Bad move. A supreme goalscorer lurks up front for Madrid, biding his time, just begging his markers to drop their concentration for all the time it takes the average person to decide whether or not inserting their genitals into a dead pig\u2019s mouth is a good idea. Roberto Carlos receives the ball and Ra\u00fal puts it in Leverkusen\u2019s net eight seconds later. If it only takes a second to score a goal physically, the mental process begins several seconds earlier, great forwards set apart by their supernatural knack of sensing where and when an opening is about to develop, something in their mind alerting them to several different scenarios and their clarity of thought enabling them to pick the right one. Leverkusen dropped their gloves without even realising it and Ra\u00fal landed a blow on their jaw before there was time for the Germans to contemplate the possibility of a punch coming their way.    Related: Golden Goal: Angelos Charisteas for Greece v Portugal (Euro 2004 final) | Niall McVeigh    In a way it was a quintessential Ra\u00fal goal, a curious mixture of perceptive cunning and cheerful scruffiness, and it would later be swallowed up by Zidane\u2019s outrageous winning volley. Everyone remembers Zidane\u2019s goal (I have a miniature figurine of a mid-volley Zizou on my desk) but it requires a YouTube visit to remember Ra\u00fal\u2019s crucial role in Madrid winning their ninth European Cup, so close to La D\u00e9cima they could almost taste it. Carlos, briefly performing the role of an extremely rich man\u2019s Rory Delap, managed to inject a Samba flavour into that most mundane and forgettable of activities, the throw-in, and from just inside Leverkusen\u2019s half he spotted Ra\u00fal\u2019s run off L\u00facio\u2019s shoulder, took a short run-up and hurled an almighty throw in his direction, the ball scorching into the area like a meteor flying through space. This was Ra\u00fal at his best, always scheming, always switched on, creeping away from L\u00facio\u2019s clutches simply because of his footballing intelligence, his alert movement allowing him to shake off one of the toughest defenders of the decade.  Realising that his man had given him the slip, L\u00facio charged across, but that split second in which he had dropped his guard meant that he was too late. He was bigger and stronger than Ra\u00fal and a month later he was winning the World Cup with Brazil, but he was taken to school here. Ra\u00fal shot first time with his left foot and even then there was something gloriously, well, Ra\u00fal, about the goal, the way he managed to get the ball past Hans-Jorg Butt despite hitting it with all the pace of a truck-driving Hans Moleman transporting the birthplace of Edgar Allen Poe along a busy road. Butt reacted as urgently as a man bending down to scoop up an adorable kitten, seemingly lulled into a false sense of security by the deceptive tameness of the shot, and the ball trundled past him and into the far corner. A defensive disgrace from Leverkusen\u2019s perspective but they were hardly the first or last side to be outwitted by Ra\u00fal\u2019s speed of thought, his decision to let fly as soon as possible catching Butt out. That was Ra\u00fal \u2013 smart, crafty and never in danger of allowing aesthetics to lead him away from the simple business of winning the game. For years he was the face of the most aristocratic side in the world but he was not one to turn his nose up at any kind of goal. Ra\u00fal had been at it for years. This was the 34th of his 71 Champions League goals and his second in a final, having scored Madrid\u2019s third in their 3-0 victory over Valencia two years earlier. Few players have embraced the competition with such relish. It was only recently that he was overhauled as the top scorer in its history, first by Lionel Messi and then by Cristiano Ronaldo. It began against Ferencvaros 20 years ago, a teenage Ra\u00fal plundering a hat-trick in the 6-1 win for Madrid in front of a lovestruck Bernab\u00e9u crowd in only his third Champions League appearance, further endearing himself to the Madridistas who already admired the kid who joined them when Atl\u00e9tico Madrid canned their youth system in 1992. Hats off to Atl\u00e9tico\u2019s owner, Jes\u00fas Gil, for coming up with an idea that in a less forgiving society would have resulted in him being loaded into a rocket and fired into the sun. Atl\u00e9tico did not let a 13-year-old Ra\u00fal slip through the net, they cut it open for him, and he spent the majority of his time at Madrid rubbing their noses in it.  Atl\u00e9tico must have felt especially sick on 18 October 1995. Ra\u00fal had broken into the first team during the previous season with his manager, Jorge Valdano, playing him instead of the legendary Emilio Butrague\u00f1o, and the youngster played his part in Madrid winning La Liga for the first time since 1990.  Madrid dominated the European Cup during its early years but they had not won it since 1966 and as the Champions League was still doing what it said on the tin, admitting only champions, they had not been in it for a while. Now they were back, drawn in a group with Grasshoppers Zurich, Ferencvaros and the reigning champions, Louis van Gaal\u2019s Ajax, who put Madrid in their place in their opening match, Marc Overmars scoring the only goal. Ajax were superior. Although they were unable to retain their trophy, losing the final to Juventus on penalties was nothing to be ashamed about given how strong the Italian side were, and along the way they produced one of the great away performances at the Bernab\u00e9u, beating Madrid 2-0 in November thanks to late goals from Jari Litmanen and Patrick Kluivert.             Van Gaal\u2019s side won a top-heavy group with ease. Madrid finished six points behind them in second place and ended up losing a tight quarter-final to Juventus. A goal from Ra\u00fal secured a 1-0 win in the first leg but Alessandro Del Piero was inspired in Turin and Juventus went through 2-1 on aggregate. Madrid were developing, the splendour and extravagance of the Florentino P\u00e9rez gal\u00e1ctico era a few years away. After so long away from the pinnacle of European football, the sight of those white shirts drew respect rather than instant fear and subservience. Serie A was the strongest league in Europe by a considerable distance and Juventus were an incredibly tough team. Yet Madrid\u2019s time was coming. They had their revenge when they beat Juventus in the final two years later, Predrag Mijatovic\u2019s clever dink sparking a spell of dominance that saw them win the Champions League three times in five years. Ra\u00fal and Roberto Carlos started in all three finals. Back to the Ferencvaros demolition, though. Ra\u00fal had failed to score in his first two appearances in the Champions League, first in that 1-0 reverse in Amsterdam, then in a 2-0 victory over Grasshoppers that was secured by Iv\u00e1n Zamorano\u2019s double. Yet the third time was a charm. When Madrid won a corner on the left in the 24th minute, Ra\u00fal pounced with a goal that bears a passing resemblance to Ole Gunnar Solskjaer\u2019s winner against Bayern Munich in the 1999 final. Michel sent the ball towards the near post, Zamorano flicked it into the six-yard box and Ra\u00fal stooped to head in from close range. Right place, right time. It was amazing how how often he knew where to be, a skill that so often trumps charging around like a maniac. There he is doing nothing. There he is contributing bugger all. There he \u2026 wait. Where is he? Oh, he\u2019s scored. Ra\u00fal was able just to drift into a place that was occupied by no one else, quietly, secretly, furtively, like a cat roaming unnoticed around the house and finding a warm little hideaway to spend the day sleeping. It is a gift that few players possess. The Bernab\u00e9u heaved. The kid was off the mark and a minute later he was bearing down on goal again, sent clear by Zamorano. He took a touch and casually stroked the ball into the bottom-left corner with his left foot.    Related: Golden Goal: Ian Wright for Arsenal v Leeds United (1995) | Rob Smyth    What was striking about a large portion of Ra\u00fal\u2019s goals was there was rarely any self-consciousness or anxiety about the way he shot. He never gave the impression that he was trying too hard. He did not have to force it. Scoring came naturally to him. Roger Federer has spent much of his career proving that a big server is not necessarily a great server. He does not have to hit the tennis ball with all his might, he just picks his spot, keeps his opponent guessing and trusts his accuracy. Only Novak Djokovic, the best returner in tennis, has worked out how to counter the Federer serve. Doing so was beyond the game\u2019s second best returner, Andy Murray, at Wimbledon in July. Ra\u00fal had that quality. He sometimes favoured the caress over the bludgeoned drive. He was subtle. Yet at the same time he did not seem to care too much about beauty. For a player who demonstrated such great technique, it sometimes ranked surprisingly low on his list of priorities. He was single-minded and scored goals that were down to sheer bloody-minded persistence and desire, although this stupendous lob against Real Sociedad demonstrated that individual brilliance was well within his grasp. He cared about winning and he embraced the old cliche about goals winning games. He was Madrid\u2019s top scorer with 323 goals until Ronaldo broke his record. The best goalscorers are inherently selfish and that is only a problem when their one-track minds hinder the team. Madrid benefited from his greed. He was relentlessly productive. To put it into context, Ronaldo has one trophy for every 81 goals he has scored for Madrid. Ra\u00fal has one trophy for every 36 of his goals.  He was never voted the best player in the world. The closest he came was when he finished third behind Lu\u00eds Figo and David Beckham in Fifa\u2019s World Player of the Year vote in 2001. He was not the quickest player or the strongest. Others were more skilful or more glamorous and fashionable. Some doubted if he would make it to the top and he often flattered to deceive for Spain. His best goal for his country was a superbly controlled volley against Nigeria at the 1998 World Cup but defeat contributed to a first-round exit. At Euro 2000 he scored a stunner against Slovenia but he sent a last-minute penalty over the bar against France in the last eight and Spain went out. He was injured when they lost on penalties to South Korea at the 2002 World Cup. He was their top scorer with 44 goals until David Villa overtook him but he was not involved when Spain finally banished the perennial dark horses tag at Euro 2008 and turned into a winning machine. Yet he always survived when a new gal\u00e1ctico arrived in the first P\u00e9rez era. His managers appreciated him because, well, what else were they going to do, and opposition managers feared him. Sir Alex Ferguson said Ra\u00fal was the best in the world after he destroyed Manchester United at the Bernab\u00e9u in 2003, twice beating Fabien Barthez with cool finishes with his left foot. When Ra\u00fal left Madrid in 2010, Ferguson tried to sign him. \u201cRa\u00fal is so difficult to play against when he starts taking up the positions he did tonight,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cHe always seems to be an outlet for them and we never contained that part. We know Zinedine Zidane and Lu\u00eds Figo are great players but we could have handled that. Ra\u00fal was very difficult. Real Madrid have bought some great players over the last few years but, at the moment, Ra\u00fal is the best in the world.\u201d Ra\u00fal was a varied player, a contradiction of sorts. He could play in a withdrawn role as a creator, linking the play, and at times he was part of an ultra cerebral little and large partnership with Fernando Morientes, but he was somewhere in between a No9 and a No10. He wore different outfits for different occasions. He could be a fox in the box or he could prowl outside it.  Some strikers make the art of goalscoring look as difficult as tackling a whole lobster with a pair of chopsticks. Ra\u00fal made it look simple. Efficiency was at the core of his game. He could be almost Gerd M\u00fcller-ish in the penalty area. Everything happened for a reason. If he chipped or rounded a goalkeeper, it was because it represented the clearest route to goal. After 25 minutes against Ferencvaros, Ra\u00fal was on a hat-trick. He went through on goal nine minutes later. Bursting with confidence, he decided to scoop the ball over the goalkeeper with the outside of his left boot, an impudent, cocky piece of skill, a devastating putdown and an understated exhibition of genius at the same time, but his effort hit the bar. Zamorano nodded the rebound into the empty net. File it under the great goals that never were. Ra\u00fal carried on. He created a second goal for Zamorano in the 47th minute with a cross from the right and the moment the Bernab\u00e9u had been waiting for finally arrived with six minutes remaining. When Bayern Munich beat Borussia Dortmund 5-1 last month, Thomas M\u00fcller was anonymous for 25 minutes. Ten minutes later, he had scored twice. It would be interesting to know if modern football\u2019s ultimate space investigator has studied and based any of his game on Ra\u00fal.             Luis Enrique runs down the left. Ra\u00fal is not in the picture. He twists one way. Ra\u00fal is not in the picture. He twists the other way. Ra\u00fal is not in the picture. He crosses. Ra\u00fal is not in the picture. The ball reaches the far post. Ra\u00fal is not in the picture. It is headed back into the middle. Still no Ra\u00fal. But then it is cushioned back and \u2026 here he is! An urgent little sprint and his marker is left eating dust. Ra\u00fal opens up his body, then he opens up his left foot, then he sidefoots the ball under the Ferencvaros goalkeeper. He materialises, he scores, ruthlessness personified. Shoot first, ask questions later, Madrid\u2019s very own Raylan Givens. Even then, his reaction to scoring his first Champions League hat-trick at the age of 18 is astonishingly calm. At first there is barely a hint of a smile. Don\u2019t be surprised. Enjoy me, I\u2019ll be doing this for a while. Ra\u00fal remains the youngest scorer of a hat-trick in the Champions League. Sure, it was not as memorable or special as a teenage Wayne Rooney\u2019s hat-trick against Fenerbahce on his Manchester United debut. Actually it was pretty run of the mill.

The \u200eride-hailing app firm, which is worth up to $50bn (\u00a332bn), could have been forced to make major changes to its app should Lord Justice Ouseley have decided, as rivals claimed, that it has been used as a meter. Under current legislation only black-cab drivers are allowed to use taximeters to calculate fares, giving them the potential to charge more in the event of traffic hold-ups or roadworks.   Related: Uber wins high court case over taxi app    What is Uber and how does it work? Uber is a company that operates an app connecting drivers and passengers directly. The app detects a passenger\u2019s location and then connects the customer with the nearest Uber-registered driver. The app gives the passenger a price estimate and the fare is paid via a cashless account to Uber rather than to the driver. Who owns Uber and what is it worth? Uber is backed by a number of high-profile investors, including the investment bank Goldman Sachs, the Chinese search engine Baidu, Californian venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, tech giant Microsoft, the Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, Uber chief executive and co-founder Travis Kalanick, the Qatar Investment Authority and Google. When it revealed plans earlier this year to raise $1.5bn to $2bn in new funding, it did so at a price that valued the company at $50bn or higher. Why did Transport for London (TfL) seek a high court ruling about whether Uber was breaking the law in London? Since Uber started operating in London in 2012, the capital\u2019s transport regulator, TfL, has judged that its app is not masquerading as a meter, which is the preserve of the more tightly regulated black-cab operators. Private hire vehicles are barred from using meters. The transport authority backed Uber\u2019s right to operate in the city, using its app, over the fierce objections of London\u2019s 25,000 black-cab drivers and the existing minicab industry. In recent months, the climate has changed and TfL has initiated a consultation process which could result in a regulatory clampdown on Uber. It also decided to defer to a court its decision over whether Uber\u2019s app is legal or not. That was the subject of Friday\u2019s ruling. Why does the meter matter so much? Black-cab drivers are the only taxi operators allowed to use meters in London, in recognition of the fact that they have trained hard to learn the roads in the capital and are therefore trusted to take the quickest route to a passenger\u2019s destination. They argue that the Uber app, which calculates a fare, is effectively a meter. The key privilege of a meter is that it protects drivers from traffic congestion and other delays \u2013 by ticking over while the vehicle is stationary \u2013 but there are fears it could be knowingly abused by drivers who take longer routes to a destination. What\u2019s the difference between a black-cab and an Uber driver? A black-cab driver has taken the Knowledge, which involves driving around London for several years memorising all the roads and routes, giving them a unique grasp of the capital\u2019s streets and ways to navigate them. Black-cab drivers have their vehicles checked and are regulated by TfL. Uber drivers, of which there are now 18,000 in London, are less highly regulated but they are rated by passengers. Around 1 million people in London are estimated to have signed up to be Uber passengers. Why do black-cab and minicab drivers dislike Uber? Uber\u2019s rivals don\u2019t like business being taken away from them and they argue that Uber has entered the market without strict enough regulations, enabling them to undercut their competitors on fares. They also say that by diverting its revenues via the Netherlands, Uber is not paying its fair share of UK tax, and this also gives the business a cost advantage. Uber argues that regulations should be reduced across the board and that it is a startup company which will pay more taxes if and when it becomes profitable.

Uber\u2019s offices have been raided in Amsterdam, two of its executives have been charged with criminal offences in France, and one of its services, the cheaper Uberpop, has been banned in Berlin, Delhi, Seoul, Madrid and Rio de Janeiro. Accusations include predatory pricing, offering illegal and possibly unsafe taxi services and breaching competition rules. Earlier this month, Boris Johnson, the previously Uber-friendly mayor of London, accused the firm of \u201csystematically breaking the law\u201d in the way it used its app technology to effectively hail a taxi, a process only black cabs are legally allowed to carry out. Will legal cases like this hamper Uber\u2019s growth? Inevitably the high court case in London and the controversies around the world divert resources from the day-to-day business of increasing Uber\u2019s market share.

Portrait of Catrina Hooghsaet, dating from 1657, was described by former director of Oxford\u2019s Ashmolean museum Christopher Brown as \u201cone of the greatest Old Master paintings in the country and one of the finest portraits ever made by Rembrandt\u201d. It has been on public display for much of its time in the UK, principally at the National Trust property Penrhyn Castle but also in recent years at the National Museum of Wales in Cardiff and at the Ashmolean. But it is privately owned and a sale has been arranged. It will be exported unless anyone can match the asking price. The culture minister, Ed Vaizey, has placed a temporary export bar on the painting. He said: \u201cThis Rembrandt painting has been enjoyed by the UK public for more than 250 years and provides a fascinating glimpse into history, helping us to better understand how society and art have evolved over the centuries. \u201cIt\u2019s important that paintings, especially one as famous as this, are available for our students to learn from.\u201d Vaizey made the decision on the recommendation of an advisory committee. It said the painting had a close association with British history and national life, and had \u201coutstanding aesthetic importance\u201d. One committee member, Aidan Weston-Lewis, said: \u201cThis is an exceptional portrait of a fascinating sitter, about whom there is still much to be discovered. Its departure abroad would be particularly unfortunate in view of its long presence in the UK, notably in Wales, which currently has no publicly owned painting by Rembrandt.\u201d The subject, Catrina Hooghsaet, was a wealthy woman and a Mennonite, which meant she had to dress plainly and austerely. She was unusual in that she was separated from her husband, and in the painting she stares towards a possible substitute, her pet parakeet. The work was included in last year\u2019s Late Rembrandt show at the National Gallery and the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

He was often head and shoulders the biggest kid on the pitch and scored goals for fun, but he was also the quietest. Likewise at the University of Connecticut, the 6ft 2in striker was a force to be reckoned with but rarely talked the talk to go with his goal-scoring walk. The physical attributes were there for all to see. The mental ones? It was hard to say. Which is why Orlando City admit they couldn\u2019t be sure what they were getting when they selected Larin first overall in this year\u2019s MLS SuperDraft, prior to their inaugural season in the league. The pick has paid off handsomely, though, with Larin scorching to 17 goals in just 26 appearances this season, including two more in last Friday\u2019s dramatic 2-1 win over New York City. He has broken the previous best for a first-year MLS striker by six \u2013 with one game to play \u2013 and is an absolute no-doubt for the Rookie of the Year award. It amounts to arguably the most impressive rookie campaign in the league\u2019s 20-year history, yet there was no real hint this kind of output was in the offing, especially as Larin was firmly buried on the Orlando depth chart when the season started. Most observers \u2013 notably his coaches at both Sigma and UConn \u2013 felt the Canadian kid from Brampton, Ontario, was a no-brainer. In terms of his sheer physicality, he was the prototypical centre-forward, and he had a seemingly insatiable appetite for goal-scoring. But there have been plenty of athletic players who have failed to make the MLS grade, with previous can\u2019t-miss choices such as Nikolas Besagno, Danny Mwanga and Omar Salgado all struggling. The jump from college to pro level has also become something of a chasm in recent years with the influx of talent into the league ranks serving to raise the level of both on-field quality and the fitness requirements that go with it. College players typically churn through no more than a 20-game season, spread over four months, with much of the travelling of the regional variety and training strictly limited by NCAA rules. In the pro ranks, the demands escalate dramatically to a 34-game season, plus US Open Cup games, friendlies, training every day, and, in a few cases, internationals. The travelling is nationwide and the soccer year lasts almost 10 months with the pre-season and play-offs. With the 20-year-old Larin being the strong, silent type, it was hard to gauge his readiness for the grind of a full MLS campaign, coupled with regular calls from the Canada national team to far-flung outposts like Puerto Rico, Belize and Dominica. So Orlando wound him up, pointed him in the right direction \u2013 and held their breath. Now, the Lions can well and truly exhale after a spectacular season in which he was never intended to be the starter in Adrian Heath\u2019s 4-2-3-1 formation. Injuries and fitness worries over the four men in front of him forced the coach\u2019s hand in the first month, and the rest has been truly history-making. There have already been comparisons with Christian Benteke and Patrick Kluivert, with the Silent Giant hitting the back of the net at a rate of a goal every 1.6 games, one of the highest strike ratios in the league. He really grabbed national attention with his hat-trick against New York City in July and followed it up with another three-goal salvo against New York Red Bulls on 25 September \u2013 left foot, right foot and header, the perfect scorer\u2019s treble. He has scored both inside the box and out, tap-ins and pile-drivers, to mark him out as, if not the finished article just yet, then certainly a far more polished product than the diamond in the rough that started the season. It has left head coach Heath in no doubt it is the start of a major career. \u201cThis year was always going to be a learning process for Cyle and, to be honest, we weren\u2019t sure what we were going to get out of him,\u201d Heath said. \u201cHe has always been bigger and stronger than anyone at college level, but that isn\u2019t going to work on its own in the professional world, so the question was could he be smarter as well? Could he take the stuff we work on in training and implement it on the field? The pleasing thing is he has. \u201cWe\u2019ve obviously got a lot more out of him than we thought but the most important thing is that he\u2019s learning. It is not just a case of scoring a goal but taking the information on board and making it work in a game situation. Now he is being smarter, and the good thing from his point of view is that he is only going to get stronger. He has a big future ahead of him.\u201d In many ways, it shouldn\u2019t have come as a surprise Larin lived up to his top pick status. He had impressed every coach on his journey from the ranks of Brampton Wildcats as a six-year-old, when he discovered an innate ability to put the ball in the net and the desire to keep doing it. \u201cI kind of knew I had the talent for it from an early age,\u201d Larin admitted. \u201cAnd, when I went to Sigma at 11, that\u2019s when I really thought I could take it to the next stage. I went overseas a lot and saw a different lifestyle associated with the game and I loved it. We played against the Ajax youth team in Amsterdam and that really opened my eyes. This was what I wanted to do.\u201d At Sigma, the young Larin came under the tutelage of technical director Bobby Smyrniotis, a UEFA-registered coach who had worked with the youth teams at both Olympiakos in Greece and Ajax, and he immediately made a big impression. Smyrniotis, who most likens Larin to former Dutch international Kluivert, recalled: \u201cHe was playing at a good level at that age but the most important thing was that he always wanted to learn. He had a sense of maturity about him, even as a kid.  \u201cHe always paid a lot of attention to what he had to do on the field and what he had to do to get better. With many developing players, it is a question of not letting them get too excited about their successes and not letting them get too down about other things, and that was something Cyle was always able to balance in his head. \u201cHe had some special tools but he was always looking to develop the finer points, an understanding and intuition for the game itself. Clubs overseas would ask, \u2018Can he play at the next level?\u2019 And there was never any doubt in my mind. He has the intangibles and the mentality to stay humble about the game and to succeed in it.\u201d It was at Sigma that Larin picked up his nickname. \u201cYes, he was the silent giant,\u201d Smyrniotis confirmed. \u201cEven when he complained to the referee, he would be practically whispering. He was always a very quiet kid but he was always a responsible young man with his mother and his younger siblings. He was a big brother figure at home and that sense of family has been important to him.\u201d Indeed, it played a big part in his choice of college and, ultimately, his decision to opt for the MLS SuperDraft instead of following up interest in him from Europe, notably from Racing Genk in Belgium \u2013 who saw him as the next Benteke \u2013 as well as a team in Germany and two in England, including a Premier League outfit. Larin admitted: \u201cI had been to visit Syracuse and Oregon State before UConn but, once I saw the environment at UConn, I knew it was for me. It was a very professional set-up, the fans came out to support the team in big numbers and the coaches took good care of me. I wanted to feel comfortable and feel part of something, and I think that\u2019s the most important thing for me, that sense of belonging.\u201d UConn associate head coach Tim O\u2019Donohue had spotted Larin in Toronto during his senior year at high school, and head coach Ray Reid confirmed they were all in on the youngster. \u201cTimmy saw him and just fell in love with him in playing terms. He was a big, athletic, strong kid with a nose for goal, a great kid with a great family, and we try to make it a good family environment here, where guys can grow as people and learn more than just football. \u201cI think that stuck with Cyle and, when it came time to decide if he was going to turn pro, we had multiple conversations with Orlando general manager Paul McDonough \u2013 who had been my assistant here for six years \u2013 about finding the right environment for him and, while we would have loved to have had him for a third year, it was a good choice for him.\u201d The Lions won the lottery with fellow expansion outfit New York City for the No1 pick and there was never any doubt they would select Larin. \u201cI had seen a lot of Cyle in his freshman year at UConn and the guys I trusted also confirmed he had a real talent,\u201d McDonough explained. \u201cAs the draft approached, we looked at him harder and harder and decided he was pretty much our guy. You have to listen to offers with the top pick but there was nothing that approached our valuation of him. And, knowing how much he likes strikers, Adrian would have killed me if I traded him. \u201cNow I think everything has been fully justified. Adrian has done an amazing job of mentoring him, and being hard on him when he\u2019s needed to be, and Cyle has listened and taken it on the field with him. Sigma gave him good fundamentals, UConn built on that and Adrian has taken it to a whole new level.\u201d Larin himself is still the quiet, almost studious type who rarely speaks up and has reporters straining to pick up his words at post-game media conferences. For his size, he has yet to make a physical impact on defenders in the same way as the 6ft 2in Kluivert did and the equally formidable Benteke has done with Genk, Aston Villa and Liverpool. The comparisons with big-name European strikers may be a touch premature but there is no doubt scouts in that part of the world are aware of him already and will pay close attention to his exploits, especially in his sophomore MLS season. Equally, there is no question the striker has found his home for the time being. \u201cIt is a great environment for me,\u201d he insisted. \u201cI\u2019m really close with the team, and Orlando is a good place to be. The fans are amazing and I\u2019m always being pushed to do the right things and get better each day. This is where I can develop properly and where I am comfortable. It has worked out perfectly for me.\u201d And the Silent Giant bit? \u201cI was quiet since I was a little kid. My mum told me I was quiet from very early on and the only time I was ever a problem was if I was hungry! I\u2019m not an outgoing guy \u2013 I just play, keep things simple and like to relax.\u201d There might not be too many defenders who are allowed to relax when Larin is on the prowl in future.", "sentences": ["We played against the Ajax youth team in Amsterdam and that really opened my eyes."], "title": "Silence is golden: rookie sensation Cyle Larin quietly realizes the hype in Orlando", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/20/silence-is-golden-rookie-sensation-cyle-larin-quietly-realizes-the-hype-in-orlando", "tags": ["Orlando City", "US sports", "Football", "MLS", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-10-20T11:40:24Z", "article": "Starbucks and Fiat Chrysler are expected to be billed for tens of millions of euros in additional taxes as the European commission prepares to rule that they had unlawful deals with the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Starbucks has for years made the Netherlands its European hub while Fiat has based a lucrative internal financing subsidiary in Luxembourg. In both cases, the multinationals approached the local tax authorities to seek assurances that their controversial tax structures in these countries would not be challenged.  These assurances \u2013 often known as \u201ccomfort letters\u201d \u2013 are expected to be torn up on Wednesday when Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, confirms the commission has concluded that the two tax rulings constitute illegal state aid. The decision into the sweetheart tax deals follows a 15-month investigation. At the heart of the dispute over Starbucks\u2019s tax rulings is the amount of taxable profits the US group attributes to a bean-roasting subsidiary in Amsterdam. Because of favourable tax treatments available in the Netherlands, the coffee group\u2019s tax planners have been keen to ensure as much of its income as possible is channelled through the country. But the commission is expected to say Starbucks artificially inflated the internal price at which its Dutch roastery bought beans from another Starbucks company in Switzerland. The Financial Times, citing sources close to the investigation, estimated the group\u2019s likely additional tax bill could be about \u20ac30m (\u00a322m). The decision against Fiat\u2019s sweetheart tax deal is expected to be more costly. In both cases, additional tax would be payable to the authorities in the Netherlands and Luxembourg. Tax campaigners say this is inappropriate because these countries have effectively allowed the multinationals to avoid tax that should have arisen elsewhere.  Fiat and Starbucks are believed to have been paying a fraction of the headline tax rates in Luxembourg and the Netherlands for many years. Both nations are among the most successful at persuading multinationals to relocate their European hub operations within their borders.  Under European state aid regulations, investigations into tax rulings have no powers to tackle tax avoidance directly. They can only intervene if it can be demonstrated that any such avoidance was part of a sweetheart deal and therefore not available to competitor firms. Many senior European politicians have called for stronger powers to tackle prolific tax ruling programmes in several member states. Luxembourg became the focus of criticism after the LuxLeaks scandal exposed the industrial scale on which such rulings were being granted there. The Grand Duchy felt it had been unfairly singled out, arguing it used generous tax policies to attract inward investment just as other countries did. The commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker, who was previously prime minister of Luxembourg, responded to the LuxLeaks scandal by pressing for greater coordination on taxation between member states, ultimately allowing multinationals to file a single European tax return. Such plans are fiercely resisted by several countries, including Britain and Ireland, and are unlikely to receive the required unanimity among member states to be adopted. The action on tax rulings awarded to Starbucks and Fiat is not expected to be the last word from Brussels\u2019 state aid investigators. These will soon be followed by decisions on more controversial cases involving Amazon\u2019s tax affairs in Luxembourg and Apple\u2019s arrangements in Ireland.  Starbucks, which has shifted its European corporate headquarters in the UK, said it \u201ccontinues to cooperate with the commission\u2019s state aid investigation in the Netherlands\u201d.

A second deal between Fiat Chrysler and Luxembourg\u2019s tax authorities also violated European state aid rules, the commission confirmed. The two companies are expected to face tens of millions of euros in additional tax bills. The move is part of a Brussels crackdown on private tax deals some member states strike with large multinationals. Commission officials are looking at similar deals secured by Amazon in Luxembourg and Apple in Ireland. Margrethe Vestager, the competition commissioner, said: \u201cTax rulings that artificially reduce a company\u2019s tax burden are not in line with EU state aid rules. They are illegal. I hope that, with today\u2019s decisions, this message will be heard by member state governments and companies alike.

While the decision was technically against the Dutch state for endorsing Starbucks\u2019 controversial structure, the coffee firm said those accused of receiving illegal state aid were entitled to appeal against such a decision in the European courts.   The commission estimates that since 2008 the Dutch tax ruling allowed Starbucks to avoid tax of between \u20ac20m and \u20ac30m (\u00a314m-\u00a322m). The same sum was estimated to have been avoided at Fiat in the last three years.  Last year, Starbucks\u2019 Dutch unit paid less than \u20ac600,000 in tax while Fiat\u2019s Luxembourg subsidiary paid less than \u20ac400,000. There were strong hints of appeals from Luxembourg and the Netherlands, too. The grand duchy\u2019s government said: \u201cLuxembourg notes that the commission has used unprecedented criteria in establishing the alleged state aid. In particular, the commission has not established in any way that Fiat \u2026 received selective advantages with reference to Luxembourg\u2019s legal framework.\u201d The Dutch government said it was \u201csomewhat surprised\u201d by the decision and would study it before deciding whether to lodge an appeal. \u201cWithin the Dutch tax system profit is taxed where value is created.\u201d Starbucks has for years made Amsterdam the heart of its European operations, while Fiat set up group financing activities in Luxembourg. Income from many other countries was shifted into the Netherlands and Luxembourg via interest, royalties and other intra-group payments. Starbucks and Fiat had separately set up complex tax avoidance structures there that meant their income was subject to very low rates of tax.   Graphic showing Fiat\u2019s tax deal with Luxembourg.   The commission found the avoidance structures should not have been sanctioned by Luxembourg and the Netherlands in tax rulings, sometimes known as \u201ccomfort letters\u201d. They said the member states had endorsed \u201cartificial and complex\u201d structures, devised by Fiat and Starbucks tax planners, that did \u201cnot reflect economic reality\u201d. Brussels competition officials have no powers to challenge generous tax deals offered to multinationals directly. They are only able to intervene if it can be shown that a specific deal was offered to one or more companies and not made available to competitors.  Vestager said the decisions in relation to Starbucks and Fiat sent \u201ca clear message: national tax authorities cannot give any company, however large or powerful, an unfair competitive advantage compared to others\u201d. As well as ongoing investigations into Apple\u2019s affairs in Ireland and Amazon\u2019s deal with Luxembourg, she said: \u201cMore cases may come, if we have indications that EU state aid rules are not being complied with.\u201d However, she added that state aid investigations were \u201cjust one part of a wider package that needs to come together to effectively address corporate tax avoidance\u201d. Greater tax coordination between member states was necessary to eliminate loopholes and the mismatches between national tax systems that were being routinely exploited by multinationals, she said.  Proposals for such coordination were set out by the European commissioner for tax, Pierre Moscovici, in June, but are deeply unpopular with several governments. Countries such as the UK and Ireland have seen their economies strengthen as they have offered increasingly more generous tax breaks to global companies prepared to invest locally and create jobs. As a result they have made clear they will not be part of commission plans for greater tax coordination.", "sentences": ["\u201cWithin the Dutch tax system profit is taxed where value is created.\u201d Starbucks has for years made Amsterdam the heart of its European operations, while Fiat set up group financing activities in Luxembourg."], "title": "Starbucks and Fiat sweetheart tax deals with EU nations ruled unlawful", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/oct/21/starbucks-and-fiat-tax-deals-with-eu-nations-ruled-unlawful", "tags": ["Starbucks", "Tax avoidance", "Fiat Chrysler", "Business", "Corporate governance", "Food & drink industry"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-10-21T10:26:30Z", "article": "Shares in Ocado are moving higher after news that one of its key investors has raised its stake.

But the arrival of a new cycle made available at a super-budget price would be hard to ignore even if it was only half decent, and to judge from this first instalment, the Naxos Ring could be much better than that. The plan is for Jaap van Zweden to conduct the four music dramas in concert with the Hong Kong Philharmonic across four years, and for an edited recording to be released on disc later the same year. This Rheingold comes from a pair of performances given in the Hong Kong Cultural Centre in January this year; Die Walk\u00fcre is scheduled there for the beginning of 2016. Van Zweden established his credentials as a Wagner interpreter with the superb Parsifal that he conducted in the Amsterdam Concertgebouw in 2010, which subsequently appeared on Challenge Classics. The qualities that marked out that performance characterise this recording of Rheingold, too. The orchestral textures have a spaciousness and transparency, and an unforced sense of architectural shaping and dramatic flow; some may prefer their Wagner more monumental and confrontational, but that is not Van Zweden\u2019s way. In terms of classic Rings on disc, his approach is much closer to that of Herbert von Karajan than any other conductor. But the real surprise here is Matthias Goerne\u2019s performance as Wotan. His handling of the text is as exemplary as anyone would expect from such a seasoned lieder singer, but it\u2019s the power and gravitas that Goerne brings to the role that are so startling. There\u2019s real dark authority to the lower reaches of his voice, and a range of colour of the upper registers that conjures up an intriguingly complex character psychologically; I can\u2019t tell how much of that would be conveyed in a stage performance, but on disc it sounds extremely effective. The rest of the cast may not quite be on the same level, but there are still some very fine contributions. Peter Sidhom\u2019s Alberich combines real malevolence with a touch of the panto-mime villain; Kim Begley\u2019s Loge is a mixture of quick intelligence and darker, deeper intent. As Fricka, Michelle DeYoung\u2019s time will surely come in the next instalment, Walk\u00fcre; here she does everything that\u2019s required of her. Kwangchul Youn and Stephen Milling are a robust pair of giants, David Cangelosi a not too caricatured Mime, and Eri Nakamura, Aurhelia Varak and Hermine Haselb\u00f6ck make a nicely differentiated trio of Rhinemaidens.

Twenty four hours later, you wake up with a headache in a haunted house attraction (the fairground deserted) with your fellow party-goers. Between you, you appear to have written a mashup of the collected works of Oscar Wilde, the history of the Old Bailey and the Sylvanian families catalogue; it\u2019s brilliant at some points, with a slightly ramshackle sense of progression.

And so, with the essentials of the novel resolved, onto the plot we go: Our (true) author leads us through 1600s Amsterdam, a city that was already printing banned books but still doused in religion, shoving us into one of the weirdest three-strand plots since Game of Thrones, though her description of the Brandt family, the main focus of the book. Petronella Brandt \u2013 newly married and barely legal by today\u2019s standards \u2013 has arrived at her husband Johannes\u2019 canal-side house in central Amsterdam. Her sister-in-law Marin, and husband Johannes are up to all sorts of shadowy activities and the family\u2019s merchant business is stagnating. Struggling to understand the house\u2019s internal dynamics, and belittled by her outrageously ugly and expensive wedding present of a cabinet house (doll\u2019s house) that seems to mock her inability to control her household, Burton then throws Petronella into the deep end, with other characters\u2019 prior actions setting the stage for tragedy.       It\u2019s very much a book filled with every kind of angst and discrimination: race, gender, sexuality, harassment, social boundaries... reminding everyone of the consequences of intolerance, with the Brandt family\u2019s fate. It was a bit preachy at times, but nothing too dramatic, which made it bearable. The Miniaturist is all about what is right, what is not and the predetermined factor involved. The writing is pretty good and elegant and the descriptions are wonderfully textured, although there is the odd moment when some details feel unnecessary and only there in order to be \u2018cute\u2019 (which is not adorable in the slightest).

A spokeswoman for the auction house said that given the desire of the Department for Culture, Media and Sport to keep the painting in the UK, it is likely the export licence application will be withdrawn, though nothing is yet finalised.

On 16 October, the government placed a temporary ban on the export in an effort to find a buyer who could raise the funds needed to keep the painting in the UK. Culture ministerEd Vaizey said he hoped a UK buyer could \u201csave it for the nation\u201d.  He said: \u201cThis Rembrandt painting has been enjoyed by the UK public for more than 250 years and provides a fascinating glimpse into history, helping us to better understand how society and art have evolved over the centuries.\u201d The portrait is important not only as a product of Rembrandt\u2019s late career, but also as a study of Dutch society. Catrina Hooghsaet, the subject of the painting, was a wealthy Amsterdam Mennonite who was married but separated from her husband, and the portrait reflects her strength of character and independence. Her pet parrot, who featured in her will, accompanies her. The decision to defer granting an export licence followed a recommendation by a committee administered by Arts Council England.  The recommendation was made on the grounds of the painting\u2019s close association with British history and national life, its outstanding aesthetic importance and its significance for the study of Rembrandt\u2019s art and in particular his late works.  The Art Fund, which had intended to announce a campaign on Monday to save the painting from export, said the future of the painting remained \u201cperilously unsafe\u201d and that it was of \u201csupreme national importance\u201d.  The national fundraising charity for art said in a statement: \u201cBy mounting a public appeal at this critical point, the Art Fund had aimed to ensure that this masterpiece could be acquired by a UK public collection, and at a favourable price: net of tax the price had been agreed at [about] \u00a322.5m. Indeed significant funds from charitable sources had already been raised since the 16 October announcement (of the temporary export ban).  \u201cThe Art Fund is deeply concerned by this turn of events, and will leave no stone unturned in our efforts to ensure that the public interest is better served, in this and in other matters concerning the protection of our national cultural heritage.\u201d The vendors of the painting are the trustees of the Penrhyn Settled Estates. It has been on loan and on public display at the National Museum of Wales, the National Trust\u2019s Penrhyn Castle \u2013 for which it was bought in 1860 \u2013 and most recently at the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford.

Instead of sharing Rodolfo\u2019s grief as Mimi lies dying, you start wondering who\u2019ll be first to drop the ball in their game of catch.     Zach Borichevsky (Rodolfo) and Corinne Winters (Mimi) in La boh\u00e8me. Photograph: Tristram Kenton    American soprano Corinne Winters was an attractive Mimi, vocally secure but never, on first night, exploring the full colours of Puccini\u2019s music. Ashley Riches as Schaunard and Nicholas Masters as Colline had good moments. As Musetta, Lois is full of promise both as singer and actor, but seemed unsure how to characterise the role. It was not her fault. The American tenor Zach Borichevsky looked tremendous but sounded uneasy. He and Winters were so far apart on that sustained final note of Act I, it\u2019s a wonder the conductor, Xian Zhang, let them hang on in agony for so long. Under her baton, the orchestra played with some style, but the pace felt stilted, with awkward pauses for uncertain applause. As the anguished final chords rang out announcing Mimi\u2019s death and Rodolfo\u2019s grief, this great work suddenly broke free and tugged at the heart, too late. Francesca Zambello\u2019s 2006 staging of Carmen \u2013 the one with quadrupeds, acrobats, impressively glittering crowd scenes and curved walls like Richard Serra maquettes \u2013 is back at the Royal Opera House for its fifth revival. I appreciate it more now than in the past, not least for its competence, clarity and strong chorus work. Zambello knows how to move people around a stage (I\u2019d add animals too, but never has a live horse, or donkey, looked more like a Madame Tussauds hire-in), and the final scene, in its sudden switch from public spectacle to private tragedy, is powerfully handled.

Photograph: Tristram Kenton    Conductor Bertrand de Billy set off at a cracking pace, which resulted in some lapses of ensemble. This wasn\u2019t the best of casts, but had its strengths. The Russian mezzo Elena Maximova, russet-voiced and absolutely secure in technique, convinces in the title role, but lacks that final electrifying power you hope for but rarely get in a Carmen. Bryan Hymel as Don Jos\u00e9 can do anything vocally \u2013 lyrical in the first two acts, ever more urgent and searing in Acts 3 and 4 as he reels towards his fate. His high notes are precise and compelling. He makes a glorious sound, though his acting remains stolid. Jonas Kaufmann and Yonghoon Lee take over the role in later performances. Alexander Vinogradov makes an engaging, dark-toned Escamillo, as long as you\u2019ll pardon his French \u2013 true of most of the singers, especially in the leaden-paced spoken dialogue. The show-stealing performance came from Nicole Car\u2019s Mica\u00ebla, sweet, muscular and affecting. She\u2019s back at the Royal Opera House in December as Tatyana in the revival of Tchaikovsky\u2019s Eugene Onegin. She may steal that show as well.

The plans for a new venue on a site near St Paul\u2019s cathedral, due to be made public next month, are already dividing music experts and performers and threatening the most discordant of overtures to Rattle\u2019s reign at the LSO. \u201cThe cost of building in the middle of the Square Mile is prohibitive \u2013 half a billion pounds, at current estimates. [A] ridiculous amount compared to the general global cost of a concert hall,\u201d the veteran critic and music writer Norman Lebrecht fumed in his online blog as word leaked out last week of the content of a long-awaited \u00a31m feasibility report. The proposed hall on the current site of the Museum of London would, Lebrecht added, simply be replacing \u201cone concrete monster with another\u201d, while music promoter Raymond Gubbay told the Observer the scheme is unnecessary since London is not \u201cso badly off\u201d for concert halls. \u201cRather than build yet another one, may I suggest they consider transporting Symphony Hall the 110 miles from Birmingham to London? It\u2019s by far the best concert hall in the country,\u201d he said. Rosemary Johnson, the director of the Royal Philharmonic Society, welcomed any new spending on classical music, but said her organisation had not been consulted. \u201cIt is vital for everyone in the orchestra world to combine our resources on this,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think you can bolt something new on that will just serve one community, if some of the money is coming from the government.\u201d     World renowned cellist Julian Lloyd says the money for a new London concert hall would be better spent on musical education. Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Observer    The draft proposal for a new Centre of Music was drawn up under the chairmanship of Sir Nicholas Hytner, the former artistic director of the National Theatre, and is being privately considered by the mayor of London and the Treasury before it goes before the public. Yet presentations made in the city in the past few days have made it clear the feasibility study has settled on the London Wall site, which will be vacated when the Museum of London moves to Smithfield market. The new hall would then be likely to operate as an extension to the Barbican, where the concert auditorium is widely regarded as not good enough to be home to the LSO. Rattle, one of the world\u2019s leading conductors, will return from Germany to lead the LSO in 2017 after a 15-year stint conducting the prestigious Berlin Philharmonic. Among groups gathering to fight the recommended site are those worried about an expensive new facility that might come to be dominated by just one London orchestra and those who think the City of London is the wrong place to attract new audiences. Timothy Walker, chief executive and artistic director of the London Philharmonic Orchestra, welcomed any move to invest in London as the cultural capital of the world, but said: \u201cIf we have only one chance for a state-of-the-art concert hall then it should benefit all five London orchestras. I am realistic enough to understand that if all the funds are raised from, and it\u2019s operated with, non-public sources, then that wish is unlikely to happen.\u201d    If we are to make a once-in-a-generation investment, then this really is not good enough  Jonathan Rose, New Queen's Hall Orchestra     Some musicians and classical concert-goers are also concerned about the poor sound quality provided by the potential fan-shaped, or \u201cvineyard\u201d, design of the auditorium. An oblong, or \u201cshoebox\u201d, hall is thought to give a truer sound. Amsterdam, Birmingham and Vienna all benefit from shoebox halls. \u201cIf you want to play in the best concert hall, it should be a shoebox,\u201d said Julian Lloyd Webber, the renowned cellist who runs the Birmingham Conservatoire. \u201cBirmingham has the best halls and when it comes to London they should have rebuilt the Queen\u2019s Hall in London 60 years ago. But why do we need a legacy building as a grand gesture? What I would do instead is put the money into music education.\u201d Jonathan Rose, a trustee of the New Queen\u2019s Hall Orchestra who hopes to build a hall elsewhere, is also perturbed by the proposal. \u201cIf we are to make a once-in-a-generation investment, then this really is not good enough,\u201d he said. The ambitious draft proposal for London Wall will go out to wider consultation at the end of the year and is an attempt to harness investment in the city\u2019s cultural infrastructure along the tourist and commuter corridor that runs from Tate Modern over the Thames to St Paul\u2019s. If approved, it is thought it would not be completed until 2020 at the earliest, but Mark Boleat, chairman of the City corporation\u2019s policy and resources committee, told the body\u2019s Court of Common Council last week that the proposals are already supported in principle \u201cby government, the Greater London Authority and other organisations such as the Arts Council\u201d. He urged the City of London to do its bit to provide more funding. Although proposals for a new building were announced just before Rattle agreed to move to the LSO, the conductor has since said that a concert hall was not a condition of him taking up his role. Fiona Maddocks, the Observer music critic, said: \u201cHowever fond we are of London\u2019s two main concert halls \u2013 the Barbican and the Royal Festival Hall \u2013 the best acoustics are to be found outside the capital: Birmingham, Manchester, Newcastle. Several halls with good acoustics have been built around the world in the past few years \u2013 Paris, LA, Miami, the far east.

For one, I was on my European book tour, having done almost nothing else in the past one and a half month but speak to German and Dutch audiences about my novel, an epic love story set against the backdrop of the Indonesian anti-communist purges of 1965. In D\u00fcsseldorf or Erfurt, Amsterdam or the Hague, I encountered nothing but genuine empathy and solidarity for Indonesians\u2019 collective struggle to come to terms with our violent past as well as to render tangible justice for an untold many. It was particularly so in Germany, with its experience of national trauma. This brings us to the irony of current domestic politics. For have Indonesians not, in the past 17 years since the fall of the Suharto regime, enjoyed a measure of hard-earned freedom from fear, censorship, and from restrictions to creativity?  Have we not witnessed the unprecedented burgeoning of new expression, in forms and language so alien to the 32-year pit out of which it was born? Have we not experienced, in the Ubud Writers and Readers Festival, a literary forum which for 12 years has been able to keep the \u201c1965\u201d discourse alive without any state intervention? Have we not pledged ourselves to the quest for alternative histories, for new ways of seeing and thinking about the world? Have we not seen the infrastructure of freedom so long devalued \u2013 bookstores, publishing houses, the press \u2013 finally standing up for themselves and giving people their voices back?      Indonesian troops control a crowd of students following the abortive coup of 1965. Photograph: Keystone/Getty Images    Have we not heard of private screenings \u2013 known by the abbreviation nobar (nonton bareng; watching together) \u2013 of Joshua Oppenheimer\u2019s film The Act of Killing? Screenings that keep popping up despite crackdowns by the authorities, suggesting that Indonesians know what they want and are resourceful enough to get it?  Up until a month ago, we still tended to look on the 17 years of political and cultural renaissance as a triumph of the collective memory. Or, rather, the failure of Fascism\u2019s central conceit: that domination does not breed resistance to itself.  If the calamity of authoritarianism gave Indonesian democracy its cause, this past month threatens to show that the rifts Suharto tore in our body politic may never be mended. That censorship should coincide with the 50th anniversary of the genocide might be the key to understanding why that is.  However, if in the past month I was tentative in my public discussion of the festival censorship \u2013 stopping short, in other words, of saying that there is a rise of neo-anti-communism in Indonesia \u2013 it has become harder to do so now. Similar incidents that occurred within a few days of each other smack of a disheartening return to old tropes of official neurosis: taken together, they suggest an eerie revival of the Suharto era.  Take the case of Tom Iljas, a 77-year-old former political exile in Sweden. He was arbitrarily arrested and deported earlier this month for visiting a mass grave of 1965 victims in West Sumatra, in search of the final resting place of his father.   Related: The Act of Killing has helped Indonesia reassess its past and present | Joshua Oppenheimer    The irony of having been barred from coming home 50 years ago, only to be banished once more in so-called peaceful times, tests the limits of humiliation. In a statement, Iljas and his supporters said: \u201c[J]ust to look at the mass graves of family members we still get terror and intimidation ... We recognise that what is happening is the result of efforts for reconciliation and the fulfilment of the rights of victims.\u201d Even by the standards of post-totalitarian nations, with their lingering paranoia and tendency to be consecrated to the memory of official ideology and legitimacy of power, this incident was quite stunning in its audacity. It was utterly lacking in substance \u2013 legal, moral or otherwise. The other case, no less Suhartoesque, concerns the confiscation and burning of the Satya Wacana University student magazine Lentera. The students produced a special 10 October edition, which explored the 1965 purges in Salatiga. Reportedly, the mayor, police and military complained after the magazine was distributed. The student editors were interrogated on 18 October, and the whole 500-copy print run was torched. Editor Bima Satria Putra told Tempo magazine that the university \u2013 incidentally no stranger to reformist activism and progressive thought \u2013 was also reprimanded by the police. \u201cWhere they have burned books, they will end in burning human beings,\u201d Heinrich Heine famously said, and yet, in present day Indonesia, there is something almost caricatural to this offence. For one, it brings us right back to the second half of the 80s and the first half of the 90s, when you couldn\u2019t count the number of student arrests for producing and distributing \u201csubversive\u201d material. The normalisation of campus life (Normalisasi Kehidupan Kampus) decree of April 1978 and coordinating body for student affairs (Badan Koordinasi Kampus) formed the NKK/BKK policy that forced Indonesia\u2019s system of higher education to its knees. That acronym became shorthand for the death of universities and the death of thinking in Suharto\u2019s Indonesia.     Indonesian troops in Jakarta following the attempted 1965 coup. Photograph: Carol Goldstein/Getty Images    The other inglorious incident that occurred within the past month happens to concern myself, although I would not lose sleep over it. The morning I arrived in Frankfurt, some 10 hours before the opening of the 67th Frankfurt Book Fair in which Indonesia was the guest of honour, the press officer of our National Committee informed me that some Muslim groups had been demonstrating against me and a fellow author in front of one of the ministries in Jakarta. When I asked whatever for, he replied: \u201cFor being at the forefront of the national committee\u2019s alleged active promotion of Communism at the fair.\u201d My first instinct at the time was perversely self-congratulatory in nature. Not for being demonstrated against, but, rather, for encountering some kind of confirmation of a deeply-held personal theory: that in the past 17 years, the great dichotomy that used to characterise the Suharto dictatorship \u2013 the state, versus civil society \u2013 has been replaced by the increasing aggression of hard-line Muslim groups seeking to force their values on the vast diversity that is Indonesia. Yet I came to this conclusion before the news of the repatriation of Tom Ilyas and the barbaric act committed against the student body of the Satya Wacana University had reached my ears.    Political Islam in Indonesia rarely ever acts alone in its quest for hegemony.    Indeed, there appeared a darker, older supervising power that has kept this process under surveillance all along, and the realisation that this was the case hit me quite hard. For the truth of the matter is that political Islam in Indonesia rarely ever acts alone in its quest for hegemony. Its alliance with the military has seen its members, particularly from the Nahdlatul Ulama, committing many of the killings between 1965 and 1968. Stoked by frequent evocations of the Madiun Affair of 1948, in which Communist rebels murdered some Muslim leaders before they were defeated, many Muslims were sold on the idea that they were victims of Communist aggression. For many youths, executing Communists was a religious duty.  This symbiotic relationship was demonstrated again less than a month ago at the 50th anniversary commemoration of the murder of six army generals and one lieutenant \u2013 part of an attempted coup that was attributed by Suharto to the Indonesian Communist party. At the start of the event, both the Jakarta chief of police and the head of the menacing hardline Muslim group Islamic Defenders Front grandly denounced Communism in one of the starkest public shows of their partnership to date.  I should have realised it then, as I should have heeded an earlier portent: the moment the chief of South Jakarta police turned up with a militant Islamic group at an art centre three years ago, to crack down on a public lecture by the reformist Muslim intellectual Irshad Manji.  However, to say Communism is an empty threat, given Suharto made sure that nothing was left of Communism in Indonesia, is of course to miss the point. Anti-Communist propaganda has worked before as a legitimising basis of power and control, and a variation on it will work again given how deeply conditioned a large majority of Indonesians still are by the old regime\u2019s official history. What we are witnessing is not the rise of neo-anti-communism per se, even if it seems that way on the surface; instead, anti-communism is merely a pretext for state terrorism and heightened control in the larger, and a more concerning scheme of a re-militarisation of government.     Indonesian students protest in 1966. Photograph: Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone via Getty Images    To many seasoned analysts of Indonesian politics, this volte-face might come as no surprise. Yet the hard-earnedness of reformasi \u2013 the period of democratic transition that followed Suharto\u2019s reign \u2013 may have imprinted a certain intractability upon those who had fought for it, if not a downright refusal to accept the possibility of a regression of any kind.    Related: It is 50 years since the Indonesian massacre of 1965 but we cannot look away | Laksmi Pamuntjak    Still. There is no denying the telltale signs. The return to anti-communist rhetoric as a pretext for state intimidation. The return to the culture of fear when there is nothing to fear of except for the healthy probings of historical inquiry that are essential to a nation\u2019s healing. President Joko Widodo has not helped matters much through his refusal to apologise to victims of the anti-Communist slaughter. His last message on the issue \u2013 that an apology is impossible when both sides claim to be victims \u2013 may give us no relief. However, despite civil society\u2019s best efforts, it may be the clearest picture yet of where we are in our struggle against forgetting. This does not mean we should lose hope.

Two police officers radio to a colleague up the road who pulls him over and writes out a \u00a350 on-the-spot fine. The Metropolitan Police hand out around 3,000 of these fixed penalty notices a year to cyclists for running red lights: many motorists would like to see them issue more \u2013 but could the offence instead be scrapped altogether? When Paris changed the rules this summer to allow cyclists to ride through 1,800 red lights, the French capital joined Brussels and cities in Germany and the Netherlands which have been doing just that for years. There\u2019s a row over proposals to introduce similar changes in San Francisco \u2013 cyclists protested against a police crackdown by rigidly obeying traffic laws and brought traffic to a halt. Now, the four main candidates to replace Boris Johnson as mayor have said they will consider such a move in London. Johnson and Transport for London requested permission for a trial back in 2009, but it never took place. TfL has concentrated instead on remodelling junctions to allow \u201cearly release\u201d (where cyclists get a green light before cars) and \u201chold the left-turning traffic\u201d (keeping cyclists and cars apart on left turns). Last month, Johnson explained that the idea of allowing cyclists to run red lights had been considered but \u201cit was recognised that there are many legal and practical barriers, as well as justifiable concerns about the impact on road safety for all users. While TfL and the Department for Transport have not ruled out testing this concept in the future, they currently remain committed to the proven concept of using appropriate traffic signals to control the movement of different road users.\u201d     Cyclists in central London wait for a traffic light to change. Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP    But the rule change \u2013 often referred to as the Idaho Law after the US state where cyclists can stop and roll through a red light if the way is clear \u2013 is back on the agenda. Campaign group Stop Killing Cyclists asked the main candidates in May\u2019s mayoral election to support its 10 by 2020 safety challenge, which includes a call to increase spending on cycle infrastructure, the pedestrianisation of Oxford Street and \u201cthe introduction of the Idaho law, allowing cyclists to turn left when traffic is free at junctions, with full legal priority for pedestrians\u201d. The group\u2019s co-founder Donnachadh McCarthy was surprised by the positive replies. Labour candidate Sadiq Khan said he was \u201cstrongly in favour of adopting a variant of the Idaho Law\u201d, while his Conservative opponent Zac Goldsmith said he was \u201cinterested in the idea \u2026 [which is] worth exploring\u201d. Lib Dem Caroline Pidgeon said she would back a trial, and the Green party\u2019s Sian Berry said she would consider it as an emergency measure. Their full responses can be read here.    If a cyclist waits for green, and a bus or HGV wants to turn left \u2026 that\u2019s how most cyclists in London are being killed  Donnachadh McCarthy     While McCarthy welcomes TfL\u2019s moves to improve signalling, he says remodelling 20 or 30 intersections is taking years and costs millions of pounds each time. Changing the rules on red lights could be implemented almost instantly and could affect all of the city\u2019s 10,000 junctions. \u201cIt\u2019s a problem which needs dealing with now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf a cyclist waits for green, and a bus or HGV wants to turn left, then they are in real danger \u2013 that\u2019s how most cyclists in London are being killed. If someone on a bike can turn left before the light turns green \u2013 watching out for pedestrians of course, and we\u2019re very clear that pedestrians have priority \u2013 then you can be away before the bus or HGV starts moving and you can avoid getting squashed.\u201d Variations on the Idaho Law are already in place in a number of cities across Europe, where most countries drive on the right. The European Cycling Federation says there are more than 5,000 right-turn-on-red intersections in Germany, while the Netherlands allows cyclists to turn right where they see a sign. Brussels started a trial in 2012 and, after a study by the Belgian Road Safety Institute found no increased danger, is expanding the scheme to more than 250 junctions. Trials in French cities including Strasbourg and Nantes have yielded similar results.     When they see the sign, cyclists in Paris can go straight ahead at T-junctions or turn right when the lights are red. Photograph: City of Paris    The changes in Paris are part an attempt to triple the amount of journeys by bike by 2020, which has seen the city introduce its free V\u00e9lib\u2019 hire scheme, install more than 400 miles of segregated bike lanes and ban articulated HGVs from the centre during rush hour. A three-year pilot scheme established that allowing cyclists to run red lights improved the flow of traffic and cut the number of collisions, especially those involving a vehicle\u2019s blind spot. So, this summer, signs were fixed to 1,800 traffic lights telling cyclists that when the signal is red, they can \u2013 if the way is clear \u2013 jump the lights. The change only affects right turns or going straight on at a T-junction \u2013 where the rider can stay close to the pavement. Kiki Lambert of the campaign group Mieux Se D\u00e9placer \u00e0 Bicyclette (Better By Bike) says the scheme has been working well and hopes it will soon be extended to cover left turns on red too. As well as being safer, she says it saves cyclists time and energy, and helps the city work better. \u201cIf you say to people, \u2018don\u2019t do that \u2013 just obey\u2019, then they don\u2019t think about what they\u2019re doing. If you give people more responsibility, it works better. Traffic lights are there to slow cars down and allow pedestrians to cross. Bikes are much lighter and much slower so, when there are no pedestrians and the way is clear, it is stupid that a cyclist should have to stop.\u201d         San Francisco cyclists protest by obeying the rules    In the US, the Idaho Law, which came into effect in that state in 1982, allows cyclists to treat a red light as a stop sign, and a stop sign as a yield sign. Variations have been adopted in a few small cities in Colorado but, until now, no big American cities have followed suit. What works well in Boise or Aspen, the thinking goes, wouldn\u2019t be practical in a larger metropolis. That may soon be put to the test. San Francisco\u2019s Board of Supervisors looks likely to pass a rule-change making the enforcement of stop signs for cyclists the lowest priority for the city\u2019s police \u2013 in effect introducing the \u201cstop as yield\u201d part of the Idaho Law. The change is supported by the majority of the board, but may yet get vetoed by Mayor Ed Lee.   Related: Should bike helmets be compulsory? Lessons from Seattle and Amsterdam    The issue came to a head this summer after one police captain ordered his officers to crackdown on cyclists who rolled through stop signs on the Wiggle \u2013 a popular zig-zagging bike route which avoids the city\u2019s biggest hills. A group of cyclists protested by strictly obeying traffic laws \u2013 coming to a complete halt at every intersection and only moving on once they had clear right of way. Traffic was gridlocked in minutes. \u201cThe thing you say you want \u2013 every cyclist to stop at every stop sign \u2013 you really don\u2019t want that,\u201d one of the organisers told SF Weekly. Washington may get in on the act too after city councillor Mary Cheh introduced a bill last month which would bring a version of the Idaho Law to DC. Running reds is a controversial issue even among cyclists, with some arguing it is bound to anger motorists and pedestrians, and set back the cause of cycling. If it continues to work for other cities around the world, though, could a trial in London, or another British city, one day get the green light?

Long the first port of call for cash-strapped new arrivals in the city \u2013 Irish, Jews, Bangladeshis and many others \u2013 the East End was changing, said Fuck Parade\u2019s organisers. They explained that they were protesting against increasing economic segregation: the construction of \u201cluxury flats that no one can afford\u201d instead of \u201cgenuinely affordable housing\u201d. London certainly is a very inequitable city. The richest 10% of its residents own 60% of the city\u2019s assets. The top 10th of London earners take home around 4.5 times as much as the bottom 10th. However, according to new research, and unlike many European cities, between 2001 and 2011, London did not actually become more economically segregated ... largely because the city was so divided to start with.  \u201cIn the central parts of London, housing is extremely expensive and segregation is already high,\u201d says Maarten van Ham, professor of urban renewal at Delft University of Technology and the University of St Andrews. Van Ham co-authored the study, which measured a range of variables associated with segregation: income, occupational status, education and more.    Without inequality, there wouldn\u2019t be any segregation by income  Maarten Van Ham        Peabody housing estate just off Poplar high street in East London. Canary Wharf is in the background. Photograph: Photofusion/Rex Shutterstock    The research found that, in the decade from 2001, segregation increased in 11 of 13 major European cities (the other exception, along with London, was Amsterdam.) In Scandinavia, for example, the traditional Nordic model seems to be fraying at the edges. In Stockholm, social housing is being sold into the private sector; even in famously equal Oslo, rich and poor are increasingly living parallel lives in different parts of the city. Across the Baltic Sea, Vilnius and Tallinn have gone from Soviet cities with limited private ownership of housing to hyper-capitalist ones in just 25 years.  Throughout Europe, inequality is on the rise. Our cities are looking and feeling very different, as middle-class professionals flock to central neighbourhoods while immigrants increasingly congregate together, often in suburban enclaves. \u201cWithout inequality, there wouldn\u2019t be any segregation by income,\u201d says Van Ham. \u201cIf inequality increases in a city, you expect segregation to rise, too.\u201d            The researchers identified four main factors behind the rise in segregation in Europe\u2019s cities: globalisation; economic restructuring; the withdrawal of the state; and the investment (or lack of) in social housing.  For example, the city where segregation increased the most among the 13 studied was Madrid \u2013 not due to an influx of property speculators, but rather a lack of affordable housing, which, for example, forced young people to stay living with their parents. In Vienna, the number of professionals has doubled in the past decade, squeezing out poorer residents. In 2005, riots broke out across the Parisian banlieues. The insurrection was, in part, a protest against inequality, and yet segregation has increased in the years since.    Parts of Riyadh are split along gender lines, with women-only shopping centres, restaurants and a women's day at the zoo    Over the past three decades, it has increased in most US cities, too. The most extreme economic examples are concentrated in college towns \u2013 in part because the vertiginous cost of American university education attracts only the wealthiest. But it affects larger cities, too: New York, Philadelphia and Chicago are segregated along economic lines and are getting worse. North of the border, in Winnipeg, a \u201cgreat divide\u201d has opened up between the 80,000-strong indigenous population and the rest of the city\u2019s residents. Most of Winnipeg\u2019s First Nations community live in the inner city and the North End, two of the poorest postcodes in Canada. On a whole host of indices, from access to housing to exposure to violent crime, aboriginals fare worse.     Research shows that Detroit is the most racially unequal metropolis in the US. Photograph: Rebecca Cook/Reuters/Corbis    But for the starkest examples of segregation, we have to look beyond Europe and North America. In Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, hundreds of thousands of erstwhile nomads live in felt-covered \u201cger\u201d tents on scrubland on the outskirts of the city, while downtown, the nouveau riche shop in expensive designer stores. And in Johannesburg, walls \u2013 often topped with broken glass and surveillance cameras \u2013 separate the wealthy from the hoi polloi. The South African city, once strictly segregated along racial lines, is now divided by income. Cities, of course, are not just divided by money. Belfast, too, has walls \u2013 in this case iron \u201cpeace walls\u201d, some almost 20ft high, built to separate nationalists and unionists. In the Indian state of Gujarat, scene of vicious anti-Muslim riots in 2002, many Hindus and Muslims live in separate, sprawling ghettos. Parts of the Saudi Arabian capital, Riyadh, are split along gender lines, with women-only shopping centres and restaurants, and even a dedicated women\u2019s day at the local zoo. Indices of dissimilarity \u2013 which measure the evenness of two groups (such as ethnic or occupational) in any given area \u2013 can be used to chart segregation. According to one study, Detroit is the most racially unequal metropolis in the US, with a dissimilarity score of almost 80: a largely black inner city, with whites living predominantly in the surrounding suburbs.    Racial segregation may not be inevitable in large multi-ethnic cities. In LA, segregation has actually decreased       Belfast\u2019s \u201cpeace walls\u201d are almost 20ft high, built to separate nationalists and unionists. Photograph: Antonio Olmos for the Observer    And yet, racial segregation may not be inevitable in large multi-ethnic cities. In Los Angeles, for example, segregation has actually decreased, according to new research. In 2000, 40% of LA\u2019s population lived in strongly segregated neighbourhoods; by 2010, it was one-third. The biggest fall has been in the number of heterogeneous white areas. \u201cDiversity and heterogeneity is the new structure of urban society,\u201d the authors conclude. In Europe, however, cities are likely to become more divided as the impact of the 2008 financial crisis really starts to bite. \u201cThe crisis has probably caused inequality to rise in Europe,\u201d says Van Ham. \u201cBut there is a serious time lag \u2013 five to 10 years \u2013 between rising inequality and when it affects cities.\u201d   Related: Where is the world's most stressful city?    Compared with other cities around the world, however, Europe\u2019s capitals are still relatively mixed. The oil-rich Angolan capital of Luanda has been, in some measures, the world\u2019s most expensive city for each of the last three years. The super-rich live in gated, high-rise apartments; hotel rooms cost upwards of \u00a3250 a night for the most rudimentary. Poorer residents, meanwhile, struggle to survive in makeshift housing, unable to afford the eye-watering prices for basic staples such as milk and tomatoes.

Here\u2019s a traditional parlour game that might help. It\u2019s called the \u201cLondon garage test\u201d, and it lets you assess the value of your home against the capital\u2019s most exclusive outhouse.  In my home town of Hull, the proceeds from the \u201cmost expensive garage in Britain\u201d \u2013 currently a \u00a3550,000 former coach house in Southwark \u2013 would easily buy you a large Victorian mansion in Newland Park, a neighbourhood so posh they\u2019ve probably still got actual parlours there.   Hull is cheap; London is expensive. So what? It\u2019s not as if I\u2019m about to trade in my \u00a3150,000 three-bedroom terrace for a bedsit in the capital. I\u2019d never have room for all my second-hand books. Hull suits my \u201crelaxed\u201d career path. And who cares if my paltry freelance earnings are barely enough to trouble the taxman most years? At least I can afford my share of the mortgage \u2013 something more and more Londoners are struggling to do.  For chippy northerners, the recent coverage of the housing crisis just confirms what we\u2019ve always suspected about the \u201cbeating heart of our nation\u201d: that its stupidly inflated property market would one day be its undoing. Just how long can a city function when the minimum income needed for a mortgage is now a cool \u00a377,000? As for it being a place of opportunity \u2013 you can be as hard working and \u201ccareer oriented\u201d as you like, you\u2019re still never going to outbid an oligarch for one of those \u201cdeposit boxes in the sky\u201d.     There are no Russian oligarchs laundering their money here \u2013 just Polish builders washing their socks       While gentrification in London creates billionaires and paupers, in Hull it barely seems to register. The sort of mass speculative surges that price London\u2019s poorest out of their own neighbourhoods and spawn hipster-owned cereal cafes just don\u2019t seem to happen here. How could they, in a place where property values bump along at more or less the same happy level, year after year? There are no Russian oligarchs laundering their money here \u2013 just Polish builders washing their socks. In Hull, houses aren\u2019t about making an investment \u2013 they\u2019re for living in.   Is Hull really Britain\u2019s last bastion of affordability? Officially, very much so: along with Southport and Barrow-in-Furness, it is the only place in England where the government\u2019s new \u201cstarter homes\u201d would be affordable for people on the proposed \u00a39 minimum wage.   Hull\u2019s cheapness (and presumably Southport\u2019s and Barrow\u2019s too) is usually explained by the lack of career and leisure opportunities here, in turn put down to our isolation from Britain\u2019s economic centres. But are there benefits to missing out on the \u201cgrowing menace\u201d of gentrification? And what are the chances of my city staying safely under the property radar?      Humber Street, site of the former docks fruit markets, has been transformed into a burgeoning arts quarter. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian    My first attempt to get a handle on these questions involves putting a call out to artists. With the contraction of affordable studio and living spaces having long priced skint creative types out of the capital, I\u2019d heard that some of them were now considering Hull as an alternative.  One young artist who\u2019s made that move already is Clare Holdstock. The 23-year-old Camberwell Arts School graduate was encouraged to return home to Hull following the success of its bid to become the 2017 UK City of Culture. But the real drive was economic: \u201cWhen I was a student in London, I was OK because I had a grant,\u201d she says. \u201cBut after I graduated, I had to work full-time just to pay the rent. It was impossible to make new work, never mind have exhibitions.\u201d   Ironically, Clare had been inspired for her final degree show by the nearby Heygate Estate, the 1970s social housing development then in the process of being demolished to make way for luxury private flats. \u201cThe Heygate prompted my interest in modernist architecture. I saw some graffiti on a bridge there that could either be read \u2018now here\u2019 or \u2018nowhere\u2019, and it got me thinking about utopian design. Now all the residents have been forced to move, that graffiti has become very poignant.\u201d   Things have started looking up for Clare since she moved home to live with her mum. A part-time pub job leaves her plenty of space for her art, and she recently contributed a public commission for Freedom, Hull\u2019s growing arts and music festival. But her optimism is tinged with regret and anger at the way she was forced to leave the capital.  \u201cI really miss London,\u201d she says. \u201cI miss the feeling of excitement that Hull doesn\u2019t have. I think gentrification is a horrible thing. In the past, when artists moved into an area, it made it desirable. Now London has stopped making the most of its artists. It\u2019s become a hyper-capitalist bubble.\u201d My first thought is: she won\u2019t have to worry about hyper-capitalism back in Hull. But it turns out gentrification has longer tentacles than I\u2019d realised.     Hull is no more an owner/occupier utopia than anywhere else in Britain. In fact, buy-to-let investors are doing especially well here. Photograph: John Giles     I catch up with another London exile. Writer and creative consultant Leanne Cloudsdale was forced to leave the capital, her home for 13 years, after a split with the boyfriend who owned their shared flat left her with nowhere to live. \u201cFriends were saying I could sleep on their sofas \u2013 but I was head of design at the time. I couldn\u2019t turn up to work looking like that. As a single woman with nowhere to live, no savings and no options, the only thing to do was move back home to Hull.\u201d  For the last two years, Leanne has lived a dual existence: mainly working in London during the week, then coming back to Hull at the weekend. Hard work has brought rewards: this summer, she managed the arts offering at another popular Hull festival, the Humber Street Sesh, and had a role in producing the latest promotional film for city of culture.   But despite all the work, Leanne still can\u2019t get on the property ladder. That might be understandable in London, but even living somewhere as seemingly affordable as Hull, she feels resigned to never owning her own place.   Of course, Hull is no more an owner/occupier utopia than anywhere else in Britain. In fact, buy-to-let investors are doing especially well here. Attracted by low prices and high rental yields, an increasing number are shifting their focus from the capital to more affordable locations in the north.   This isn\u2019t much comfort to Leanne or the other \u201cgeneration renters\u201d trapped in often poorly maintained properties with no security of tenure. Her home in Hull is a grand Victorian town house, split into flats for rent. The owner lives in London. \u201cThe couple in the flat above me are borrowing the deposit for a house from their parents,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t have that option. I feel like I\u2019ll always have to rent.\u201d    Over 95% of Hull's houses were damaged during the second world war, and more than 150,000 people made homeless    One remedy for housing inequality is to build more affordable homes \u2013 a challenge Hull has faced in the past, with mixed results.  At the end of the second world war, the place was in ruins. The most heavily bombed British city outside London, it lost more than 1,200 people in the Blitz, with over 95% of its houses damaged and more than 150,000 \u2013 about half its population \u2013 made homeless.  The legacy of that destruction and the subsequent rebuilding was far too many poorly designed, system-built homes with made-up names and oddly shaped roofs. Coming across a stand of \u201ccaspons\u201d in east Hull, tinned up and unloved, is a Ballardian experience. If it wasn\u2019t for the late summer tangle of Buddleia and brambles choking up the pathways, you\u2019d almost swear the residents had just popped out to the shops.  But the day of the caspons and \u201cwingets\u201d and all those other symbols of post-war housing failure is now, supposedly, over. The council has teamed up with private developers and housing associations to replace them with 4,000 new homes, a mix of council and affordable houses as well as properties for the open market.      Hull was the most heavily bombed city outside London, losing more than 1,200 people in the Blitz. Photograph: Local World/REX Shutterstock    With the first stage of the \u00a3500m housing renewal programme about to begin, I was expecting councillor John Black, Hull City Council\u2019s portfolio holder for housing, to be in a good mood when I met him at Hull Guildhall. Instead, I find a worried man.  An apparently throwaway announcement in July\u2019s \u201cemergency\u201d budget is ruining his summer recess. Under chancellor George Osborne\u2019s latest edict, councils and housing associations will be compelled to reduce rent by 1% a year for the next four years. Black is expecting the subsequent \u00a3120m revenue shortfall to delay Hull\u2019s planned building programme drastically. On top of the limitations imposed by the Bedroom Tax, benefits cap, abolition of tax credits and removal of housing benefit entitlement for under 21s, it further threatens the city\u2019s ability to build and let affordable stock.  \u201cIt\u2019s on all fronts. I had to gasp,\u201d the councillor tells me. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 1,100 tenants, 21 and under, who won\u2019t be able to claim housing benefit. We won\u2019t be able to let [our larger] properties because the people who need them won\u2019t be able to afford them.\u201d     A more modern Hull estate. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for the Guardian     He likens Osborne\u2019s pursuit of more and more local authority revenue to King Henry VIII\u2019s sacking of the monasteries, and says the uncertainty of funding flows has already put paid to one planned housing scheme \u2013 to build 500 new bungalows for older people, freeing up the three- and four-bedroom houses they\u2019d previously occupied for families.   It\u2019s the sort of provision they could badly do with on Preston Road, where Leanne Cloudsdale grew up. Instead, council houses are having to be adapted to meet the shortfall of suitable accommodation for elderly and disabled people. \u201cOne\u2019s got a lift through the floor and there\u2019s another old lady having to sleep downstairs because the council haven\u2019t got a bungalow for her,\u201d local community centre volunteer Janine White tells me. The larger homes aren\u2019t much use either for people already struggling with benefit cuts. The majority, says Janine, are the \u201cworking poor\u201d. On zero-hours contracts in part-time, minimum-wage jobs, they rely on the weekly food parcels the centre provides. \u201cThere\u2019s always a queue of people outside the courts who owe money because of the Bedroom Tax. They can\u2019t afford to pay and there\u2019s no housing for them to move to.\u201d     If there is a demand deficiency in the economy, a few thousand new jobs won't make a real difference to property values  Dr Mike Nolan      For councillor Black, who has been involved in housing for almost 40 years, the present political climate is uniquely grim: \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating that Hull has the land but we\u2019re unable to deal with the housing situation. We were almost ready to kick start it and then we were stopped in our tracks.\u201d But surely it can\u2019t all be bad news? After all, Hull has just signed a \u00a3310m deal to bring Siemens\u2019s new wind turbine factory here. It\u2019s expected to create 1,000 jobs directly, plus many more through its supply chain, and boost everything from income to education in a city that desperately needs it.  What\u2019s more, somehow we\u2019re to be the UK\u2019s next City of Culture, belated recognition for the place that gave the world Philip Larkin, The Housemartins and the pattie butty.   No one is quite sure how these developments will affect housing. Certainly, property prices in Hull are nowhere near as static as I\u2019d thought. In the six years up to 2007, the median sale price for houses in Hull more than doubled. But Dr Mike Nolan, senior economics lecturer at Hull University Business School, isn\u2019t expecting a speculative gold-rush.  \u201cProperty values should be buoyant,\u201d he says. \u201cBut if there is some demand deficiency in the local economy generally, a few thousand jobs would not be likely to make a decisive difference. After all, some employees will continue to follow the current pattern, living outside Hull itself.\u201d   The construction industry seems to be responding positively to the good news anyway \u2013 yellow signs for new estates are everywhere. Out on my bike in east Hull, I spot a newbuild that would make Clare, the London art school exile, squirm. \u201cCamberwell,\u201d claims the marketing blurb, offers buyers \u201cgreat new homes in a great location.\u201d None of your modernist rubbish here \u2013 just \u201cquality two- and three-bedroom houses, built to exacting standards\u201d.      Siemens are set to develop the city\u2019s Alexandra Dock into Green Port Hull, an offshore wind-turbine facility. Photograph: Christopher Thomond for The Guardian     The name, I\u2019m told, is taken from the nearby Camberwell Way \u2013 but follows a time-honoured tradition of aping the capital. Back in the 1860s, local entrepreneurs banked on the snobbery of Hull\u2019s bourgeois financiers and shipping merchants by naming a new development on the city\u2019s then northern boundary St John\u2019s Wood.   The modern-day equivalent is probably Kingswood Parks, a \u201cnew town\u201d of boxy newbuilds wedged between a retail park and ring road. It\u2019s not my idea of heaven, but for the young professionals they\u2019re aiming at \u2013 soon to include employees from the Siemens turbine plant \u2013 Kingswood\u2019s claims to be \u201cthe best place to live in Hull\u201d might not seem that far-fetched. These are modern family homes in a \u201cnice\u201d neighbourhood, with plenty of choices for shopping and leisure nearby. The Kingswood formula seems to meet such an obvious need that the council and its partners, Keepmoat Homes, now want to repeat it next door. Despite Philip Larkin\u2019s famous quip about Hull being \u201cnice and flat for cycling\u201d, Wawne Road offers a panoramic view over alluvial wheat fields, undulating gently towards the market town of Beverley to the north-west. If the poet tried biking it up here, he\u2019d be knackered.  I park my car up a country lane; nearby a space-age silver bus is surrounded by be-suited project partners overheating in the sun. They\u2019re here for a public consultation exercise about the proposed new 1,600-home Wawne View development.  The scheme has its critics, among them local residents who have launched a petition protesting at the destruction of a valuable natural habitat. Why build on precious green belt when there are so many brownfield sites left undeveloped in Hull?  Hull City council\u2019s partnerships and development manager, Mark Hill, explains that sites such as Wawne View help to leverage Hull\u2019s more costly housing renewal schemes elsewhere. \u201cWithout it, we\u2019d have struggled to bring forward development on Preston Road that really needs it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have been able to offer any new stock there without huge grants which just aren\u2019t available.\u201d  But are the houses even needed? Is there sufficient demand to warrant yet another estate in the area?     Empty houses in the Springburn Street area behind Hull\u2019s Hessle Road. Photograph: Don McPhee for the Guardian     Matt Hesketh, assistant partnerships manager for lead developer Keepmoat Homes, insists there is, citing the popularity and affordability of schemes in other parts of the city. Construction projects, he says, also provide many jobs, because of the high quota the council sets for local labour. \u201cGrowth stimulates growth, I guess. If we didn\u2019t have new jobs, we didn\u2019t have construction, what would Hull be like? It would be a city in decline. What\u2019s the alternative?\u201d  I can see his point. What is the alternative? A couple of years ago, an Economist editorial suggested that Hull people would be better off giving up on our \u201curban ghost town\u201d and commuting to thriving cities such as Leeds and Manchester instead. It\u2019s a horribly dismissive argument. But are pseudo new towns like Kingswood or Wawne View really the answer? The only trace you\u2019ll find these days of Hull\u2019s original gentrified quarter is the St John\u2019s Hotel, a lovely, laid-back real ale pub, more redolent of Amsterdam than NW8. The middle-class suburb failed to take off, partly because new railway lines cut straight across the planned grand boulevards \u2013 and the intended residents settled in other parts of Hull and the East Riding. As Dr Mike Nolan suggests, those lucky enough to find work in the renewable energies sector may also opt to take their wealth elsewhere.    A couple of years ago, an article suggested that Hull people would be better off giving up on our 'urban ghost town'    Meanwhile, what will become of those left behind by the green boom? It\u2019s the week of the 2015 Conservative Party conference, and the Tories\u2019 1980s retro-fest is in full swing. Every day brings new announcements of brutal welfare cuts, unconvincingly spun as ushering in a new \u201centerprise culture\u201d.   Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, the richest member of the cabinet\u2019s plutocrat club, suggests that the abolition of tax credits will make us harder-working \u2013 like the Chinese and Americans. The next day, still seething, I visit the Hull Families Project for a reality check.   The charity helps those in poverty \u2013 particularly the working poor \u2013 to overcome personal problems and to manage their finances better. The cuts of the last five years, says project co-ordinator Keith Wardale, have hit them \u201clike two tidal waves\u201d. \u201cThey\u2019re beginning to overcome their own personal circumstances \u2013 things such as alcohol and drugs problems \u2013 and then they\u2019ve got these external factors they can\u2019t do anything about.\u201d  The worst cases, he says, involve older people. \u201cThey\u2019re having to leave homes they\u2019ve been in all of their lives. The Blitz built a sense of community all across Hull \u2013 everyone had been through the same thing. Now that generation is being forced out because of Bedroom Tax. They\u2019re very frightened. They think: \u2018What\u2019s going to happen to me if I have to move somewhere miles away?\u2019\u201d  I can imagine the same fears spreading across Hackney, Tower Hamlets, Haringey and all the other London boroughs where low- and middle-income earners can no longer afford to live. There, it\u2019s gentrification breaking up communities; in Hull, it\u2019s Tory welfare policies that are finally achieving what years of Luftwaffe bombing couldn\u2019t. And if the place with the cheapest mansions in Britain is no longer affordable, where the hell is?  In his party leadership campaign, Jeremy Corbyn promised to build thousands of new social and affordable homes, damping down rampant speculation and providing decent rental accommodation for people subsisting on low wages and zero hours contracts. But the summer of Corbyn is over and, as the Tory juggernaut rolls on, some of Britain\u2019s poorest people are facing the prospect of another \u00a31,300 being lifted out of their pockets in tax credit cuts.   The protests have already started in London where gentrification of once affordable areas has galvanised dissent in Camden, Brixton, and at a certain cereal outlet on Brick Lane.    Related: To Hull and back: the rebirth of Britain\u2019s poorest city    It\u2019s hard to say where the flashpoint will come in Hull. I can\u2019t see the city ever falling victim to gentrification in the same way London has. It\u2019s not that we don\u2019t have our well-to-do areas \u2013 I live near one of them. The Avenues are almost contemporary with the never completed St John\u2019s Wood, and were originally aimed at the same clientele. These days, the massive Victorian and Edwardian town houses are home to lecturers, artists, broadcasters, musicians and writers as well as teachers, occupational therapists and social workers.   Middle class then \u2013 but not shamelessly so. In such an overwhelmingly working-class city, any pretensions are quickly punctured. Leanne Cloudsdale says her family in east Hull call the Avenues \u201cthe muesli belt\u201d \u2013 but the residents of HU5 are as fiercely proud and protective of their home city as anyone. And I think it\u2019s this down-to-earthness \u2013 as much as economics \u2013 that stops gentrification in its tracks somewhere west of Hessle.   Even some local Tories have got their feet on the ground. David Davis, MP for Haltemprice and Howden, warns that the tax credit cuts could be this government\u2019s poll tax. If so, I predict a riot. The difference is, in Hull, it won\u2019t be Rice Crispies that spark the snap, crackle and pop. Steve Walsh is a freelance writer based in Hull.

We offered Pel\u00e9 an honorary degree and he said yes, so we put on a fancy ceremony in London at the V&amp;A. Pel\u00e9 came on, said some stuff and was given the degree. It was my job to get him off the stage and to his car.  Anyway \u2013 and perhaps predictably \u2013 everyone and his dog wanted a piece of him. Selfies, autographs, the lot. He had a massive smile for everyone, took photos, and signed everything. I finally managed to get him away from the crowds and to his car. My colleague says to him: \u201c[My name], I\u2019m sure you\u2019d like to get a photo with Pele, wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d I mumble something about how I\u2019m just doing my job and wouldn\u2019t want to intrude. So Pel\u00e9 gives me a massive grin, and says, \u201cWell [my name], I want a photo with you, OK?\u201d And he shakes my hand and makes me pose for the picture with him. One of the best moments of my life, to be honest. Silencer Johan Cruyff     Johan Cruyff. Photograph: Eamonn McCabe for the Guardian    I met Johan Cruyff as a kid, when he played for Feyenoord. To the great dislike of my family, who were all living in Amsterdam area, I turned into a Feyenoord fan instantly. What can I say? He was the magnificent JC; the club he played for didn\u2019t matter to me. When signing my T-shirt he asked me if I wanted to become a footballer. I told him I already was one. He said I looked very young to play but for my age I was just very tiny and thin as a pipecleaner. I said I was old enough, just not big enough to become as good as he was. He said that he always was as thin as a straw too, but that it was because it was so difficult against those muscled big players that he became so good eventually. That simple remark always stayed in the back of my mind. When I was struggling against better or bigger players, I kept going because that was going to make me great. I\u2019m hoping to become a certified trainer this winter and, when I see a youth match, I look at the weakest players going all out and I think, \u201cKeep on struggling, because that is how you get there.\u201d Koeien Ryan Giggs I once saw Ryan Giggs in HMV in Manchester Market Street. Looking through the Ryan Giggs calendar. I kid you not. 70114usa  Eric Cantona Eric Cantona\u2019s first game for Manchester United was an exhibition match in Lisbon against Benfica as part of Eusebio\u2019s 50th birthday celebrations. I gatecrashed the post-match party at the Estoril Casino so that I could ask him why he had left Leeds. \u201cC\u2019est la vie,\u201d was his response. 69and74  Jack Charlton     Jack Charlton. Photograph: David Benett/Getty Images    In about 1999 I was playing a Sunday football match in Regents Park. We were useless \u2013 a few of the team and come straight from the Fabric nightclub and, at best, we were hungover. Our opponents that day were all very fit and athletic and, approaching half-time, we were 6-1 down.  Out of the corner of my eye I noticed a very familiar figure walking towards the pitch with his wife. Jack Charlton and Mrs Charlton stopped on the side of the pitch and watched the last couple of minutes of the half. The ref blew his whistle and we congregated near the touchline for our captain\u2019s team-talk. By then I had pointed out our celebrity football legend standing about five metres away.  Through the cloud of cigarette smoke, I shouted over to him \u201cJack, what\u2019s your advice here mate? We\u2019re 6-1 down at half-time and they\u2019re all over us.\u201d Jack looked at us, looked at the opposition, then back and forth between the two groups of players several times, before turning to me and in a deadpan voice and saying: \u201cGo home lads!\u201d and walked off. AlexEvs Graeme Souness My Mam once thumped Graeme Souness. On a night out in Liverpool with the Pilk Recs rugby league team \u2013 for whom my Dad played full-back \u2013 my Mam and a pal of hers were accosted at the bar by the mustachioed one and permed runner-arounder Craig Johnston. Suffice to say Mr Souness\u2019s charm wasn\u2019t what he thought it was, and my Mam decided to lamp him one. He took offence, but she reminded him of the crowd of rugby players in the corner and he decided to take one off a lass rather than off St Helens\u2019 finest. She didn\u2019t know he\u2019d later go on to play for Rangers, but I like to think that if she did she\u2019d have hit him twice as hard. Arraiga2  George Best I met George Best in a bookies\u2019 near Green Park tube station in about 1981. He was on his own minding his own business and I just walked up to him and thanked him for all the brilliant memories he\u2019d given me over the years. I told him that a kid at school once made money by forging his autograph and selling them. He laughed, signed a betting slip and said: \u201cThere\u2019s a real one for you.\u201d NapoleonXIV  Stuart Pearce Two days after England were knocked out of Euro 96 I was crossing a road in Nottingham and I realised the man coming across the other way was none other than Stuart Pearce. As a massive Forest fan, and having watched him score his redemption penalty against Spain only days before, I desperately wanted to say well done, but no words would came out. I had to do with mumbling \u201cthat\u2019s was Psycho\u201d to another equally speechless bloke who\u2019d crossed the road at the same time. BigTimmyA  Brian Clough     Brian Clough. Photograph: PA    When I was a sixth form student in the very early 1980s, I wrote for our school magazine and we managed to get Brian Clough to come in for an interview as he lived quite near our school. Aged 17, I was given the job of doing the interview. The first thing he said was, \u201cHave you been smoking young man?\u201d I had and must have stank. He then gave me a lecture on the evils of smoking. By this point I was shitting myself. However, after he had made his point he was a complete gentleman, answered the questions happily and it all turned out well. I can see why his players generally did what he asked \u2013 a real force of nature. Markol  Louis van Gaal When Louis van Gaal was managing Barcelona, I saw him and the rest of the Bar\u00e7a team at the airport boarding a flight to Santander. Knowing this and seeing Van Gaal on his own \u2013 Kluivert, Overmars and Mendieta were ambushed by fans, of course \u2013 I approached him, heart pounding. I could ask him anything but said: \u201cWho are you playing this weekend, Louis?\u201d \u201cRacing Santander.\u201d\u201cThanks Louis.\u201dI proceeded to walk away, wanting the ground to swallow me up. Mark Lardner Bill Shankly I knocked at Bill Shankly\u2019s house around the corner from Melwood once. He wasn\u2019t in but his lovely wife Nessie invited two scruffy eight-year-olds in for orange juice and biscuits on a hot day. As we were walking back home down his street, Shankly pulled up in his car. He probably noticed our Liverpool scarfs and said: \u201c\u2018I hope you\u2019re not off to Melwood, training\u2019s finished.\u201d\u201cNo, we\u2019ve just been to yours for orange juice and biscuits Mr Shankly.\u201d\u201cOh and I suppose you\u2019ll be around for Sunday dinner.\u201d\u201cNo, I can\u2019t this week because it\u2019s me Ma\u2019s birthday.\u201dTo which he laughed and drove off shouting, \u201cWell give your Ma a big kiss from me.\u201dMy Ma wasn\u2019t best pleased when I told her. She\u2019s an Everton fan. elephantwoman John Barnes     John Barnes. Photograph: Richard Saker    We were on a family holiday at a Center Parcs in the mid-1990s. My mum and dad were looking to change cars to a Ford Galaxy. My mum spotted a gentleman driving his family in said car in and out of the car park during our stay. Mum was determined to ask him about the car and stopped him on the way into the swimming pool. He was really friendly and gave her a full run-down of the pros and cons of the car, and said that he\u2019d been given it by Ford to try out. She had no idea that it was John Barnes. Scrabopower  Paul Merson My first job was at the McDonald\u2019s in Teesside Park at the tender age of 16. It was around the time Paul Merson was at Middlesbrough. He came through the drive through, where I was stationed that afternoon. He ordered a couple of meals for his family and I asked him if he wanted Coke with them \u2013 as per my training. He gave me a funny look, drove away in disgust and I was promptly called into the manager\u2019s office and told why. I still chuckle now when I see him on Soccer Saturday. Mobatron 3000  Chris Coleman Chris Coleman bought me a beer and later high-fived me on three different occasions when we were at the same venue for a night out about 10 years ago. Also, when I did make conversation with him at the bar, he put up with me being a bit of a drunken idiot for longer than he really was obliged to before, I think, faking a phone call and leaving me be. GhostWiper Bert Trautmann At my parents\u2019 golden wedding celebration by pure coincidence my dad\u2019s boyhood hero, Bert Trautmann, just happened to be in the same hotel restaurant. Bert was a superb gentleman and took time for photos and a chat and even introduced us to his family. Dad died a year before Bert, but the memory of that evening will live with me forever. saraonlydecentfergie  George Best I was working for a BBC chat show many moons ago where George Best was a guest. In the green room he was on his own, that much of a star that no one would approach him, so I did. \u201cDon\u2019t suppose you\u2019re free next Tuesday, we play five-a-side and if you fancy a game?\u201d I asked. \u201cLove to,\u201d replied George, \u201cBut I\u2019ve got a charity do that night with Denis Law and somebody\u2019s got to get Denis home.\u201d thewinslowboy  Bobby Robson     Bobby Robson. Photograph: Alex Morton/Action Images    I went to Portman Road more years ago than I care to remember to Derby play Ipswich and lost my bearings on the way back to the station. After an hour or so, I returned to the football ground to get my bearings and start again. It was pouring rain and I must have been standing there looking lost because this bloke came over to me, umbrella in hand, and said: \u201cAre you lost?\u201d It was Bobby Robson himself. I explained my situation and he told me to wait there a minute. He came back with a member of staff and said the guy would drive me to the station as it was only 10 minutes away. All I could say was \u201cThank you\u201d \u2013 I even forgot to ask for his autograph! What a gentleman - one of those few characters in the game that nobody has ever thought badly of. He didn\u2019t have to do what he did. Could just have pointed me in the right direction or ignored me. LordMoore  Johan Cruyff Me and my old man walked into Ajax\u2019s old Meer Stadium back in the 1970s just before their third European Cup final victory over Milan. We went upstairs to snoop around (something you couldn\u2019t do at an English ground), and lo and behold, there was the one and only Johan Cruyff sat reading the newspaper. He heard my excited gasps, looked up and then invited me to sit down with him and bought me a cola. I can remember I told him I was a Leeds fan, to which he raved about Giles, Bremner and the rest. After a few minutes he invited me and my old man to watch the training, where I got to meet Neeskins, Brandenburg, Kroll and the rest. Talk about being stunned! leedsdevo  Paul Gascoigne     Paul Gascoigne. Photograph: Karen Robinson for the Observer    Back in 1999 a childhood friend of mine was unfortunately diagnosed with leukaemia and I wanted to do something for him that would help lift his spirits. He was a Geordie lad, who loved football and loved Gazza. At the time Gazza had just joined Middlesbrough, my team, so I decided to go along to the training ground to try to get an autograph from him and maybe a little message that I could give to my friend. So there I was at the training ground in the pouring rain, waiting with a pen and a card for him to sign. He was the last person to come off and, when I told him why I was doing it, he told me and my dad to come inside as it was pouring with rain and to wait at reception for him. He came back out 15 minutes later, with a few pair of his boots, signed balls and signed shirts, with the card and a very long message and heartfelt message inside it. He then provided me with a bag of treats, including signed balls, signed training gear, a signed home shirt from the entire first team squad and told me it was all for being a good lad.  People always say that you shouldn\u2019t really meet your heroes as they\u2019ll let you down, but I always have this story to fall back on and know that if you\u2019re lucky they can sometimes exceed your expectations. tmilb1989 David James I was in a pub back in the day watching boxing on TV. We were just down the road from Luton Airport where the England team regularly fly in and out from when David James popped in. He had a bit of a chat with us and was a nice bloke. When he left, after buying a couple of bottles of wine to carry out, he pointed to some beers on the bar and he\u2019d only bought us an unprompted round \u2013 top man. thecruiseboy  George Best It was about 22 years ago and I was flying from Belfast to Heathrow. Having plonked myself down beside a man and his son we soon got chatting. He had the most amazing eyes and a slight Northern Irish accent. He was extremely charming, asking me where I came from and when I said Donegal he said he knew someone from there. I asked who and he said Patrick Bonner. I was so impressed he knew our local hero yet I still didn\u2019t have a clue who this charming man beside me was \u2013 until I asked him his name just before we landed. When he said \u201cGeorge Best\u201d I laughed, saying sorry I didn\u2019t have a clue and he thought this was hilarious. When we arrived at Heathrow we left the little plane together to retrieve our bags and when I walked out with him seeing my boyfriends face at the time was priceless. I must say he was by far one of the most charming men I have ever meet \u2013 and yes it\u2019s true what they say, he did have a twinkle in his eye. Polly Skene Alan Hansen I once met Alan Hansen in Macy\u2019s in New York. It was a Saturday afternoon so I asked him if he had heard any of the football scores. He asked me what team I wanted to know about and I said Forest. He laughed at me and said: \u201cI only look out for scores of the big teams, son,\u201d and walked off! In case you\u2019re wondering, I subsequently found out Forest had lost 2-0 to Watford. peteym  Matt Busby     Matt Busby. Photograph: PA/Empics    My first football match, at the age of four, was Manchester United v Sunderland at Old Trafford in 1991. My dad, a Sunderland supporter who was working in Manchester, had managed to get some tickets in the home end, and warned me before the game that we had to pretend to support United so we didn\u2019t annoy anyone around us.  A couple of goals into the game, my dad realised he had lost his car keys somewhere. Panicking that we\u2019d be stuck in Manchester with no easy way home, he dragged me off to find a steward and see if the keys had been handed in. We were directed into what must have been a hospitality suite to wait, while the steward went to check the lost and found.  While waiting around, an older man came over and spoke to my dad. At some point, he asked me: \u201cHas your daddy been a silly man?\u201d and being four, I mumbled that he had before they carried on chatting. On returning, the steward told us that no keys had been handed in, and saying goodbye to the older man, we wandered off to look in the car park. Once we were a good distance away, my dad asked me if I knew who we had just met. I had no idea, so he told me it was Matt Busby, and that he was one of the football greats. It took me a good while to learn who this Matt Busby man was, but I\u2019ll always remember him as being that nice man that I met with my dad at my first football match. It didn\u2019t turn me into a United fan though, and a couple of years I settled for Bolton. In the end, my dad found he\u2019d left the keys in his car door. lukecl David Moyes I had a good old chat with David Moyes when he was flying to Italy a few years back. He asked who I supported and, when I said Arsenal, he told me a great story about having Aaron Ramsey and dad in his front room literally poised to sign from Cardiff City when his dad took a call from Ars\u00e8ne Wenger. His came off the phone and, with the contract on the table, said: \u201cPut the pen down Aaron, good boy.\u201d Then told Moyes he was off to sign for Arsenal! Moyes said it was the closest he ever got to signing a player without it actually happening. mattp68  Mario Kempes     Mario Kempes. Photograph: Steve Powell/Getty Images    When Mario Kempes was playing for Valencia, he and his new wife, Mavi, had a flat at the top of the block where a mate of mine lived. We used to see him quite frequently and chat about football. He was a very nice, humble bloke, especially considering that he had just become a global superstar after the 1978 World Cup.  One day, after lunching very well, I headed for home. I tripped at the top of the last half-flight of stairs, rolled down into the foyer and landed flat on my back, just as Mario came in the street door. Fortunately, I could feel no pain. He helped me up and brushed me down. I tried to thank him, but he was laughing so hard that tears were running down his cheeks and he couldn\u2019t talk. After that, he always had a big grin on his face when he saw me. I heard he had serious heart surgery a little while back. Hope he\u2019s well. farabundovive  Alex McLeish I met Alex McLeish in a queue for food at Lord\u2019s earlier this summer. I turned around and stared fractionally longer than I should have. He smiled and said \u201cDon\u2019t worry lads, I\u2019m supporting England.\u201d Which was nice. tomsmells  Bobby Robson In September 1986 I was hitching towards Bury St Edmunds and at Royston a smartish Astra pulled over for me. I got into the car and, following a serious double take, I realised that I was riding with Bobby Robson. He talked about rugby and other things now lost in the mists of time, and carefully and politely declined to answer my questions about \u201cthe hand of god\u201d. When he dropped me off he told me to take care and seemed genuinely concerned about my safety. That day he treated me with kindness and courtesy. When we parted I was left reflecting on the fact that I had just spent half an hour with a decent and self effacing man who I was privileged to have met. oleluke Carlos Queiroz Me and my girlfriend stayed at the Hilton in Manchester several years ago. Downstairs at breakfast sat the Manchester United squad and staff. As a huge United fan, this was a dream come true. My girlfriend isn\u2019t the keenest follower of football. In the queue for breakfast I noticed assistant manager Carlos Queiroz was in front of my girlfriend.  As we reached the buffet, my girlfriend started a conversation with Queiroz \u2013 not knowing who he was. She asked whether he was going to the match and Queiroz said yes. \u201cWhere are you sat?\u201d Just as I was about to interrupt, Queiroz stated he was sat, \u201cNext to the boss, Sir Alex.\u201d Just as I couldn\u2019t be more mortified, it got worse. \u201cWow, what fantastic seats. Have a nice day!\u201d I\u2019ve never eaten breakfast so quickly. ragingcandy  Kenny Dalglish     Graeme Souness, Alan Hansen and Kenny Dalglish. Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images    I was about 13 and I heard that Kenny Dalglish was signing autographs at the shop around the corner so off I went to have my Liverpool scrapbook signed. I expected a long queue and for him to just sign everyone\u2019s stuff and leave. There was no queue and he was in a talkative mood. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019t understand a word he said so I just nodded and shook my head alternately and hoped I was getting it right. It seemed to go on forever. wonderwife  Bobby Robson Working as translator at the Stade de France during the 1998 World Cup, I saw various former players at the buffet \u2013 Trevor Brooking, Gary Lineker, Ron Atkinson \u2013 but the only one who kind of deigned to join us at our table was Bobby Robson. Not only was he natural, pleasant and humorous, he was genuinely curious about the who, why, when and what of our missions. We passed an agreeable hour or so chatting about football and well, life. What a gentleman and a down-to-earth person before him being a football-type. An albeit brief encounter with a legend but one that has stayed with me to this day. Jimmy Armfield joined us for a while and he was equally gregarious and sociable. Men from another age. francaise  Martin Peters In the late 1970s, Sheffield University had a Spurs Supporters Society, which was a wheeze whereby we got Student Union funds to subsidise our travel to Spurs away games. It was the 1977-78 season and Spurs were briefly in the second division, visiting outlandish places like Oldham. The society (all 12 of us) had a grand end-of-season dinner and invited Martin Peters to attend as guest of honour \u2013 no fee involved \u2013 which, unbelievably, he did.  Somehow I ended up sitting next to him and still have a signed menu. He was an absolute gentleman to all of us star-struck oiks \u2013 friendly, entertaining, patient. The funny thing is, in my memory it was convenient for him to attend because he was at Sheffield United. But I\u2019ve just looked it up and I see that in 1979 he was still at Norwich, which somehow makes his attendance more laudable, and puzzling. Doleywino  Ian Rush     Ian Rush. Photograph: Bob Thomas/Getty Images    Me, my brother, dad and uncle were in an airport in Zurich in 2003 when my brother spotted Ian Rush about 50 yards away. Me and my brother popped off to go and find something entertaining to do \u2013 we were 12 and 13 so a beer was off the cards \u2013 during which time my dad and uncle went to speak with Rush and ask him if he could come over and speak to us when we were back.  When we returned, we queued for boarding and felt a tap on our shoulders. We turned round and Rush was standing there. \u201cExcuse me, aren\u2019t you the Milburn brothers \u2013 can I have your autographs?\u201d he asked. My brother, quick as a flash, says to him: \u201cYeah we are, but sorry we\u2019re in a bit of a \u2018rush\u2019.\u201d He appreciated the terrible pun and after we had boarded he came and signed our boarding cards for us. tmilb1989  Joe Jordan In 1974 Joe Jordan was sharing a house in Middleton, Leeds (not something you could ever imagine happening today in Miggy. Even our crap players wouldn\u2019t live there). My mate Mick and I decided to visit for autographs. Mr Jordan, bedecked in 87\u201d flares, 13 hectares of shirt collar and 14\u201d platforms, answered our polite request (\u201cplease\u201d and \u201cMr Jordan\u201d) with a robust: \u201cFuck off, ah\u2019m his twin brother,\u201d followed by a robust door slamming.  My friend and I (similarly clothed to Jordan, now I think about it) needed two seconds to assess our options; we knocked again. Jordan\u2019s housemate \u2013 who I forgot to say was Gordon McQueen \u2013 answered and was all charm as he gave us his autograph. My friend said \u201cCan Joe\u2019s twin brother do it too or do we have to fuck off again?\u201d (We were 11, from South Leeds, and hence mouthy). Jordan returned and signed with unsurprising bad grace. MiggyBelleIsle Martin O\u2019Neill     Martin O\u2019Neill and George Graham pose before the Worthington Cup final. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA    My first job at 16 was working for a small, Coventry-based production company. I was a roadie who helped to set up DJ equipment, mostly at weddings. The company had a contract with a hotel in Hinckley, where Leicester City had chosen to host the after-party to the 2000 Worthington Cup final, win or lose. Thankfully they won it. As a Leicester fan, I naturally bought my Leicester kit along with me and asked my boss if it was OK to drape the kit over the front to the DJ decks. During one of the bands, the club chairman came up to the DJ booth and asked if he could borrow my Leicester top for a few photos as all of the team kits had been left on the bus. I obviously agreed and asked him to please bring it back when the were finished with it.  The night wore on, the dancing got even worse and I started to wonder where my kit was. I went for a wander to see if I could find it and I spotted Matt Elliott taking the cup with my shirt wrapped around it up to his room. I was half chuffed but half kind of wanting my kit back. The following week I decided to write a letter to the club to explain what had happened. I received a call from Martin O\u2019Neill, who was very apologetic and offered to send me an away kit as all of the home kits had sold out due to the cup victory. I thanked and congratulated him. A couple of months later O\u2019Neill left Leicester for Celtic and I never received the kit! I got a story though. richedwards", "sentences": ["To the great dislike of my family, who were all living in Amsterdam area, I turned into a Feyenoord fan instantly."], "title": "Pel\u00e9, Cruyff, Best and Barnes: our readers\u2019 best stories about meeting footballers", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/oct/30/pele-cruyff-best-barnes-stories-meeting-footballers", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Pel\u00e9", "George Best", "Johan Cruyff", "Bobby Charlton", "Ryan Giggs", "Eric Cantona", "Stuart Pearce", "Brian Clough", "Louis van Gaal", "Bill Shankly", "Paul Gascoigne", "David Moyes", "Kenny Dalglish"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-10-30T16:02:25Z", "article": "When I first hear the news about the boat sinking in the Aegean sea on the radio, I think of the SOS call I made to the Turkish coastguard that afternoon about what might have been this very boat.

Today the Aegean is rough with high waves. The volunteers working through online solidarity networks knew it would be a day full of distress calls. By disseminating translations of weather warnings into many languages they tried to warn refugees about the dangerous conditions, urging people not to attempt a passage today \u2013 but too often this information does not reach the people who need it most. I find out about the shipwrecks through different mediums. This time I received information via Facebook: a screenshot of Google Maps with coordinates sent by an Arab contact. I ask the usual questions via today\u2019s translator. Who is the contact on the boat? How many people? How many women and children? Are there any elderly or disabled? Sometimes it\u2019s the family and friends of the refugees that sound the alarm themselves. They can hear the screams and the pleas of their loved ones fearing for their lives. Everyone tries to stay calm \u2013 we have to. So the language we use is almost military. This time the number of people alarms me: 180 \u2013 more than the average of 50 people on a 15-person boat. I check with Alarmphone, an organisation that monitors the coastguards and pressures them into making quick rescues, to see whether they are already on the case. Then, after identifying which country\u2019s waters the boat is in, I call the Turkish coastguard. Often we cannot reach the guards: we are put through to answering machines or fax machines; are shouted at or hung up on. Sometimes I resort to calling my local Dutch coastguard and asking them to call their foreign colleagues. This time I\u2019m able to give the coordinates to someone who speaks English in one phone call. We ask the people on the boats lucky enough to have a phone and reception to call 112 so that they can be tracked by emergency services. But so often we hear of operators unable to communicate with the refugees. We are told they hang up on drowning people. After all these months, there are still no translators. I ask the Turkish guard to confirm that they will send a search-and-rescue team. \u201cOf course,\u201d he replies. But to me, that is not self-evident. It might seem incomprehensible that refugees continue to board these unsafe vessels. But volunteers like me, who are in daily contact with migrants, know how they often run out of money and are unable to stay on dry land another day. They see no option but to board the boats with the smugglers, who sometimes force them at gunpoint. Refugees tell us that the coastguards sailing past can see thousands of them on the shore ready to leave but just move on. Some told me: \u201cTheir rescue boats sometimes vanish when the rubber boats appear.\u201d Later that night, when someone asks me whether I\u2019ll be able to sleep, I say that, like most volunteers, I\u2019m often too exhausted by the never-ending flood of urgencies not to. More and more often I have to say no to people asking for my help. I tell them I wish I was a legion. Knowing they will probably not receive help from official organisations or NGOs, I choose the worst cases. I have to ask one question: \u201cIs a life in danger?\u201d These days, when I turn off my phone to go to sleep, I wonder who will watch over the boats. I fear people will die. Why is it us who try to guard these waters, as well as these lands? Why it is me that agonises over whether I handled the case right, retracing my steps in my head? Whose responsibility is all of this really? Later I see the details of the shipwreck all over the news. There are pictures of a baby boy from the boat whom the paramedics are trying to revive; a little boy and girl are being given CPR. They remind me of my niece and nephew.

What was the first ever record or cd you bought?      Stevie Wonder Innervisions album Photograph: .    Stevie Wonder\u2019s Innervisions. He\u2019s one of my favourite musicians and I never get tired of his music - it will live forever! What was the last piece of music you bought?  Annie Lennox\u2019s latest, Nostalgia. She\u2019s another of my favourite musicians and I think this album is one of her best. She brings so many new flavours to old tunes. If you found yourself with six months free to learn a new instrument, what would you choose? Guitar. I always envied people who could play this beautiful instrument. It\u2019s such a great sound when it accompanies the violin.            Is applauding between movements acceptable? It\u2019s both acceptable and very welcome. When people react spontaneously to music that moves them, they should be able to express it. I\u2019m always happy to hear the audience\u2019s reaction.  What single thing would improve the format of the classical concert?  I think they should be more lively. Lots of people are afraid to come to classical concerts because they think there are many rules that they must abide by. What\u2019s been your most memorable live music experience as an audience member? There are so many I could name. But off the top of my head, a couple of years ago, I heard the Deutsche Kammerphilharmonie with Paavo J\u00e4rvi conducting the Schumann Symphony No 3, and the whole orchestra played as though it was one instrument. It was just breathtaking.  We\u2019re giving you a time machine: what period, or moment in musical history, would you travel to and why?  It has to be the 70s. Such amazing musicians were making their best music at this time like Stevie Wonder, Earth Wind &amp; Fire, Herbie Hancock, just to name a few.             Which conductor or performer of yester-year do you most wish you could have worked with?             Carlos Kleiber. Even though he performed very rarely and I never went to any of his concerts, I have a few recordings of his. His famous concert which was filmed in Amsterdam (the Beethoven Symphonies) is one of my favourite concerts to watch. I think it would\u2019ve been amazing to work with him \u2013 he was an incredible musician, his way of making music was so exceptional and extraordinary I\u2019ve been mesmerised watching videos of him conducting. What, in your opinion, is the best new piece written in the past 50 years? It\u2019s not possible to say! For me, art and music are incredibly subjective and depends entirely on the listener, the time etc. For example I like very much the music of Arvo P\u00e4rt, but there are lots of amazing pieces of music from the last 50 years that are not classical. The list would end up being very long! What\u2019s the most overrated classical work? - is there a warhorse whose appeal you really don\u2019t relate to? For my taste, I think it\u2019s the Tchaikovsky Violin Concerto. I much prefer his symphonies.  What do you sing in the shower?  I don\u2019t sing out loud in the shower, but I constantly have music going round in my head, although never with words or lyrics, only the melody.

I\u2019ve endured the multi-tasking frenzy and mammoth workload of the startup scene since the beginning of my career and, after two years of running my own business, I was on the brink of walking away. I had sacrificed a long-term relationship and almost every penny I had for that business; to be frank, I was sick of the sight of it. A family friend offered her place in Amsterdam for a month in return for minding the cats. It was just after my birthday, so in lieu of presents I didn\u2019t need, I asked for contributions to a sanity fund, topped up with meagre savings (try GoFundMe, Patchwork Present or Trevolta if you\u2019re tempted to do the same). Until my departure I\u2019d been a card-carrying member of the cult of busy and secretly proud of it. Psychologist Oliver James has written extensively about this; one of the side-effects of capitalism, he argues, is that it encourages women to define their self worth almost exclusively through their careers, to the detriment of other roles. I\u2019d never realised just how tightly, and unhealthily, my identity was bound up with the nine-to-five. The first week of freedom was lovely. I left my phone and laptop at home and walked the city for hours. I took in galleries, books and mountains of pancakes. Then I started feeling twitchy and it took all my self-control not to start checking email and Twitter. I needed a distraction, and fast. Tinder seemed as good a solution as any, though perhaps not the healthiest option, in hindsight. Everything I\u2019d hated about the app in London was great in a new city. My request for conversation and cocktails was met by a very clever American, who told me about his yoga practice and political affiliations over drinks. While he was interesting, I was worried about what I\u2019d say when conversation turned to me. Sure enough, I spent the whole time talking about work. \u201cWow, sounds like you\u2019re really in a difficult place\u201d, he said. \u201cMaybe you should stop taking work so seriously. Have some fun.\u201d This was followed by an unhelpful reminder about the startup \u201cvalley of death\u201d and an anecdote about a self-made millionaire relative. We went home separately. After a few more depressing dates, I resolved to avoid talking about the business at all costs. I was horrified to find, , however, that when another well-meaning companion inquired about my interests I had absolutely nothing to say. Work had dominated every aspect of my life for as long as I could remember, save for a handful of weddings and birthday drinks. I\u2019d formed no new opinions, discovered no new cities, made no new friends. For the rest of the month, I had fun like it was, well, my job. It took a while to remember how, and solo nights out were particularly challenging (until I got to drink number three). Every time I got the urge to run to the computer, I\u2019d go to a yoga class, doodle, or have coffee with a friend. Some days the anxiety got really bad and I\u2019d just sit there, remonstrating with myself for not doing more or trying harder. I\u2019m aware while writing this that I was very lucky to have the break at all; it\u2019s hard enough to find the time and funds for a weekend away, let alone a six-week sabbatical. But it was as valuable an investment as a new qualification \u2013 what is really at a premium in our frantic culture is the space to get some perspective. Now I\u2019m making better decisions.

And unlike the millennium development goals that preceded them, the SDGs \u2013 also known as the global goals \u2013 will apply to all countries, both rich and poor.  We asked students to share their views on the role wealthy nations should play in implementing the goals. Can the new agenda succeed? And given that the 17 goals equally apply to high- and low-income countries, which of them should wealthy countries prioritise? The response was mixed. Some students believed the world\u2019s poorest should be front-and-centre in the new agenda, while others thought it was more important for wealthy countries to tackle problems in their own backyards.   Related: Can Beyonc\u00e9, Ed Sheeran and Coldplay make the global goals famous? \u2013 podcast    Below is a selection of our favourite responses. \u2018The new global goals represent a paradigm shift\u2019 Whereas the millennium development goals focused mainly on the developing world, the SDGs are meant to be \u201cglobal goals\u201d equally applicable to all. As such, rich and poor countries alike need to focus on achieving the targets of the SDGs. This truly is a paradigm shift because, under the MDGs, rich countries were \u201cdeveloped countries\u201d, suggesting development was complete. Under the SDGs, pure growth and economic success are insufficient: social equity and environmental impact must be considered. With the global goals, there is room for everyone to improve and, in a global environment and interconnected community, we need everyone to improve. However, in working to achieve these goals at home, rich countries should not exclusively turn inwards in isolation. The international community needs to [unite] to achieve the SDGs globally. With the new paradigm, though, assistance should not unilaterally flow from rich to poor. Instead, universality suggests partnerships. Thus, while the role of rich countries still needs to include aid, technology transfers, security assistance, the view of poor countries needs to shift from dependents to partners. For example, many developing countries are aggressively tackling sustainability and have lessons to teach the so-called developed countries. Likewise, mutually beneficial business endeavours can be created between rich and poor. The global goals are about working and succeeding together. So, what\u2019s the role of rich countries in the new global goals? Accepting that there is room to improve domestically and engaging in global partnerships to achieve the goals everywhere.  Ryan Brenner, Michigan State University College of Law, US  \u2018The goals must be more than a set of ideals lumbered on the poor\u2019 The SDGs are a first world problem. The sustainability challenges identified by the SDGs are not unique to poor countries. The UN\u2019s SDGs and their 169 proposed targets are a complex set of unwieldy yet aspirational goals. Just as the SDGs invoke scepticism as to what can be achieved in poor countries, the relevance of the SDGs to rich countries is equally contested. Accomplishing the global and social changes embodied in the SDGs requires rich countries to prioritise sustainable development in their national policymaking. Accordingly, their efforts must extend beyond mere lip service to the actual ratification of the UN goals. I doubt that a rich country like Australia, however, will voluntarily pursue target 13.2, which seeks to \u201cintegrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning\u201d.  As the first developed country to repeal a carbon tax, Australia\u2019s current political climate \u2013 under Liberal leadership and the pressures of big business \u2013 makes the implementation of substantive climate change mitigation policies highly unlikely. Looking forward, the SDGs need to become more than a set of normative ideals espoused by the rich and lumbered on the poor. The developed world must work together to enact legally binding commitments. The new global goals provide a timely opportunity for rich countries, such as Australia, to reorient their development trajectories, address problems in their own backyards, and give the cause of sustainable development more \u201cteeth\u201d.  Claire Guiver, University of New South Wales, Australia  \u2018We cannot lose sight of the ultimate goal - to assist the world\u2019s poorest\u2019 The SDGs have been conceived to try to dismantle the global north-south divide, through a framing that makes them applicable to all nations, regardless of wealth. While achieving equity among nations on this front is a worthy aspiration, it is important that, in pursuit of their own objectives, wealthier nations do not lose sight of the SDGs\u2019 primary purpose: dramatically improving quality of life for the global poorest. Incorporating more affluent nations in a way that allows active engagement with targets is admirable, but it is important that this does not distract from helping those most in need. This is highlighted by the current gap that exists in nutritional funding: recent research by the Lancet has estimated that deaths among children under five could be reduced by 15% globally if 10 nutrition interventions, ranging from iron supplementation to salt iodisation, were scaled to 90% coverage worldwide. The projected cost of doing this is $9.6bn (\u00a36.2bn), yet the Countdown Collaboration estimates nutritional funding for 2012 as only $324.5 million. While there has been some progress in addressing this disparity (the Department for International Development has committed to tripling its nutrition funding between 2013 and 2020), a huge gap in what is needed and what is available still exists. It is vital that the focus of more affluent nations, the largest aid donors, remains on closing this gap and others like it, and that the shift of focus from poorer nations to all nations that accompanies the adoption of the SDGs does not trigger a concomitant shift in funding away from the global poorest.  Charlie Whittaker, University of East Anglia, UK  \u2018The SDGs provide a golden opportunity for rich countries to act\u2019 It is outdated thinking that poorer countries are the sole recipients of development. The SDGs must apply to all, including rich nations. There are development issues faced by all the world\u2019s countries, no matter their prosperity. For example on SDG 7, prosperous countries must tackle their gender pay gaps just as much as poorer nations eradicate female genital mutilation. Rich nations must also take action on issues that directly affect poorer countries\u2019 ability to meet the SDGs. Climate change is an important example. Sustainability is another. An area of the Amazon rainforest the size of 100 football pitches is cut down every hour for grazing cows, to keep up with the levels of meat consumption demanded by rich countries. Therefore it is inconceivable to promote sustainable development (SDG 15) without rich countries first acting on consumption (SDG 12).   Related: When will Britain's grand ambitions on the global goals be put into action? | Helen Dennis, Ruth Fuller, Kate Munro    However, this isn\u2019t to suggest that poorer countries are no longer the priority. Richer nations mustn\u2019t lose focus on the deprived nations the SDGs aim to help. It is the responsibility of the relatively rich to help those in need, including the 700 million in extreme poverty. Also, the government, private sector and public of every rich nation has a fundamental role to play in raising the large investment needed to meet the goals, for instance the \u20ac3.3tn (\u00a32.3tn) for global infrastructure called for under SDG 9. The ratification of the SDGs and COP21 makes 2015 a golden opportunity for change. Going forward, we must ensure rich countries play their fullest role at home and abroad, in helping the world reach the SDGs.  Chujan Sivathasan, London School of Economics and Political Science, UK  \u2018We have to be sceptical of wealthy countries\u2019 agendas\u2019 The SDGs represent a modern take on the ideal society. While the millennium development goals focused on aspects of global health and economy, the introduction of an explicit focus on sustainability is a key point that distinguishes the SDGs.  These goals represent a real attempt to implement policy changes on a global scale, in line with modern sustainable development theories. I am, nevertheless, sceptical of the commitments made by rich countries to achieving these goals. Current levels of resource and energy consumption indicate that not all of the world can achieve high levels of development. While countries like India and China are closing the gap, rapidly growing populations, transboundary resource disputes and water shortages forecast worrying future scenarios for the next 50 years.  There is an unhealthy tendency in the west, however, to conflate sustainability targets with the politics of the left and right. In Australia, the political right often tries to sweep efforts to mainstream sustainable practices under the rug. Just as they claim that pursuit of these goals would make the country economically vulnerable, massive industrial constructions along the Great Barrier Reef promise to seriously degrade the surrounding environment. It is imperative that rich countries make sustainable development less of a political choice, and more an integral part of the system. Only then will their sustainability efforts become truly \u201csustainable\u201d, serving also as a model for developing countries to emulate.  Damian Meduri, University of New South Wales, Australia  \u2018Big polluters must be held to account\u2019 Since the narrative of the SDGs and the agenda behind them are products of the global north\u2019s imagination and construction, rich countries should inevitably be held accountable on the sustainability progress they make. However, their scenario for the adoption of the SDGs will differ substantially from the path developing countries have to take.  From my vantage point, rich countries should join forces to keep climate change at bay. The current development model is based on growth that is at odds with our planet\u2019s finite resources. In this context, never ending pledges to get on more environmentally benign tracks are often hypocritical. Take Germany, with its ambitious Energiewende plan to cut emissions 40% by 2020 and almost completely decarbonise by 2050. With this in mind, it is easy to forget that Rhineland Coalfield, according to Klimacamp, is the largest source of carbon dioxide emissions in Europe. One of its coal plants alone emits 29m tonnes of CO2 a year, which is an equivalent of nearly one tonne a second. The global north is fortunate enough to be able to prioritise certain SDGs and it should be goal 13 they take urgent action on. We share this planet with 7.2 billion people and the potential success of other SDGs will pale beside the fact that climate change continues to grip the Earth and rich countries do not change their course from mindless pursuit of growth to a more sustainable model.

We both saw Thursday night\u2019s premiere of a new production at the Metropolitan Opera \u2013 celebrated visual artist William Kentridge\u2019s new take on Alban Berg\u2019s modernist 20th century masterpiece, Lulu. You cover the art world; I write about music. (And I interviewed Kentridge during rehearsals at the Met, last week.) So the idea here is that we\u2019ll (hopefully) be able to hit on all sides of what amounts to a crossover high-art phenomenon in New York\u2019s fall season. I won\u2019t belabor my own headline-takeaway from last night: I loved it, top to bottom. (Marlis Petersen is a great Lulu \u2013 and the rest of the cast ranged from passable to excellent.) I\u2019m probably going to see it again \u2013 perhaps in a movie theater, when the Met simulcasts a Saturday matinee performance on 21 November.  I went into the opera with an appreciation for Berg\u2019s dramatic achievement, in adapting the two scabrous, bleak Lulu plays by Frank Wedekind. (Those dramas tell the story of a much-desired young woman who leads a series of admirers to grim ends, before she is in turn killed by Jack the Ripper.) More than that, though, I admire the composer\u2019s musical achievement \u2013 fusing Schoenberg\u2019s 12-tone method with sultry late-Romanticism.  While I was a fan of Kentridge\u2019s first collaboration with the Met (directing Shostakovich rarity The Nose), I was concerned that some of his tricks \u2013 all those paper-and-ink video projections and animations \u2013 might not work as well in presenting the sometimes complex stage action of Lulu. Or that those tricks would become stale over a four-hour opera. Happily (for me), none of that came to pass.  But what about you? Though I expect we\u2019ll both give judgments from our respective critical beats, I\u2019m also interested in your experience of the music. (In New York anyway, this repertoire is thought to be a hard sell, at least to the regular classical ticket-buying audience). I know that, as I did, you saw the Met\u2019s final presentation of the foregoing production in 2010. So how did this new version hit you?             Jason Farago: Like you say, this Lulu is less hyperactive than Kentridge\u2019s The Nose. For good reason. The Nose, Shostakovich\u2019s 90-minute one-act, is pretty inert dramatically, and Kentridge recharged it with a battery of imitation Soviet film reels and wild costumes. Lulu, by contrast, already has an almost overwhelming dramatic intensity, borrowed from Wedekind\u2019s decadent plays. So Kentridge has not made too many radical changes to the book: although he\u2019s added a pair of mute characters, notably a dancer writhing inside a piano who remains onstage throughout, he\u2019s played it pretty faithfully. The invention is in the images. But I ought to get my personal headline out here, too: this is a landmark production in the history of the Met. Along with the shorter Wozzeck, Lulu is very possibly the most important opera of the last hundred years (though Berg left it unfinished upon his death in 1935). In every way, Kentridge\u2019s version supersedes the Met\u2019s previous production \u2013 a competent if staid one from the 1970s, when Lulu was finally presented in a full-three act version, with the last act\u2019s orchestration completed by Friedrich Cerha.   Related: William Kentridge on Lulu: 'You know there\u2019s going to be a body on stage'    Petersen nailed the title role last night. She first hit it big in New York when she stepped into the role of Oph\u00e9lie two days before opening night of Hamlet in 2010 \u2013 but Lulu is her part. And she can actually act! She pouts, she prances, she transforms from gamine to hag. She\u2019s announced this will be her last Lulu, and I understand why she\u2019s giving it up. It\u2019s a young singer\u2019s role, and you can only do such devastating material so many times. Which means: if you want to see one of the great Lulus, get to New York now.      Lulu: Kentridge\u2019s production includes projections and animation. Photograph: Ken Howard/Metropolitan Opera    Seth: I like what you said about the invention being in Kentridge\u2019s images. But it\u2019s not just that his images are cool (though they are), it\u2019s that they serve the story well on the level of stage action. There\u2019s a lot of ushering folks on and off the stage, which can get confusing if the director is more interested in a \u201ctake\u201d than in doing Berg\u2019s opera.  Unlike a lot of \u201cradical\u201d stagings of Lulu, this one doesn\u2019t try to add any new director\u2019s \u201cideas\u201d to the opera \u2013 it just tries to get at everything that Berg\u2019s music and drama contains. (The opera is plenty sophisticated already: about sexual politics, about capitalism, about human relations generally. It wasn\u2019t one of philosopher Theodor Adorno\u2019s favourites for nothing.)  So while a description of this production can sound like one of those meddling-director\u2019s efforts to graft new meaning onto an old work, Kentridge\u2019s great achievement here involves using his considerable skills as an artist to present this piece clearly. And the reason Kentridge\u2019s image factory winds up being a great fit for the material is that this opera is about image-making: the fantasy images of Lulu that the succession of men \u2014 as well as her lesbian admirer, the Countess Geschwitz \u2013 construct in lieu of actually knowing her.     Joanna Dudley in a non-singing role as an onlooker atop a piano. Photograph: Ken Howard/Metropolitan Opera    Jason: Precisely. At a few instances we see Kentridge slather black ink in a dictionary, close the book, and then reopen it \u2013 creating a Rorschach inkblot. Rorschach, a Swiss, was a contemporary of Berg, and the inkblot is of course an abstraction that says more about the beholder than it does about the creator. So is Lulu. \u201cI\u2019ve never pretended to be anything but what men see in me,\u201d she sings in act two. The men in her life give her different names \u2013 Mignon, Eva, Nelly \u2013 and no one, not even her putative father, knows much about who she really is. Only the woman is unknowable, of course; we could use a real feminist production of Lulu. Seth: It\u2019s strange, by the way, that the Met\u2019s English titles didn\u2019t translate the explicitly feminist angle of the Countess\u2019s final scene. In the German libretto I\u2019m looking at right now (from Pierre Boulez\u2019s recording on Deutsche Grammophon), she says she\u2019s going to law school in order to Frauenrechte k\u00e4mpfen (\u201cFight for women\u2019s rights\u201d), given all she knows about the ways women are abused. But the Met titles just rendered it as \u201cgoing to law school\u201d or some such? That was weird.     Marlis Petersen as Lulu: \u2018I\u2019ve never pretended to be anything but what men see in me.\u2019 Photograph: Ken Howard/Metropolitan Opera    Jason: Whoa, it\u2019s crazy that you caught that too. I only noticed because by the third act I had switched the little Met titles in front of my seat from English to German. Which, Gott im Himmel, sounds like the most pompous thing in the world to say, but let me explain: Kentridge was projecting the English text directly onto the stage, on screens papered with dictionary pages. Language is a key element in Kentridge\u2019s artistic toolkit, and meaning is often slipping away: he likes to project pithy, off-center phrases, such as \u201cHearts than move mountains\u201d or \u201cHere you\u2019ll find peace\u201d \u2013 here being the grave, I suppose. Most of the ink paintings in this production are done on pages torn from an old Oxford English Dictionary, though there\u2019s also a foreign language dictionary projected at a few points: I\u2019m not sure if it was Afrikaans (Kentridge lives and works in Johannesburg) or Dutch (this production first appeared in Amsterdam). I happen to think last night\u2019s production marked a big step forward for Kentridge. He first came to prominence for his hand-drawn animations \u2013 above all the doleful Felix in Exile, completed in 1994. In those animations, Kentridge would film one drawing, then erase it, draw the next, film it, erase it \u2026 such that, when the animation was projected, smudges and remnants would remain. The films bore the mark of their own making, their own history. Which felt especially powerful in the first years after the end of apartheid. He\u2019s moved past that now, and the projected images take the form of ink paintings on dictionary pages, or else woodcuts and linocuts in the manner of German expressionism. Things were moving fast last night and I didn\u2019t catch every reference, but there\u2019s a pendant exhibition of Kentridge\u2019s preparatory materials now on view at Marian Goodman gallery. None of the drawings there are named, but Kentridge employs clear quotations of Weimar-era painting \u2013 Christian Schad\u2019s 1928 painting Sonja, for instance \u2013 and even depicts Berg himself, looking very louche and Oscar Wilde-like.     Petersen and Paul Groves as the African Prince. Photograph: Ken Howard/Metropolitan Opera    Seth: I definitely need to check out that show. But maybe not until I go see Lulu again. There are several great performances in this cast. Bass-baritone Johan Reuter gave a dramatically nuanced performance as Dr Schoen: sometimes conniving, sometimes playing the victim. And tenor Alan Oke\u2019s multi-role part \u2013 including the Prince in act one, and the Marquis in act three \u2013 was a revelation. (While projecting an attractive, house-filling sound in both parts, he was buffoonish in the former, and menacing in the latter.)  Given the quasi-grindhouse nature of the first two acts, there\u2019s sometimes a tendency to make Lulu seem all-powerful, like a one-dimensional femme fatale. And when Lulu is having an argument with this or that admirer, sometimes the acting just goes full-throttle intense at the beginning of a scene, and stays there. But Petersen\u2019s interactions with Reuter in the first and second acts had an appealing ambiguity: as though both characters were trying to figure out exactly what kind of spell they were casting on one another.      Lulu has her portrait painted. Photograph: Ken Howard/Metropolitan Opera    Jason: Unknowability is at the heart of this opera. It starts right in the first scene of act one, when Lulu is having her portrait painted. In Wedekind\u2019s play, Lulu is dressed up as the clown Pierrot, a stock character from commedia dell\u2019arte. Here, we see Lulu posing in a low-fi, Kentridge-standard getup: a giant paper glove on one hand, some ink drawings on her dress. Additional ink drawings get pinned to her as the scene goes on. But although Lulu hangs onto the painting until her grim end in a London garret, we never actually see it as an object on stage; it appears as a projection, and it\u2019s never the same twice.  A fragment from the outfit Lulu poses in stays pinned to Petersen throughout much of the rest of the opera: a square sheet of paper inked with a crescent and a dot, which sits on her right breast. It\u2019s a marker of femininity, of course, but an abstract one. It\u2019s so spare, in fact, that it barely looks like a breast at all \u2013 it\u2019s more of a sign or a symbol than a representation of the female form. (A musical symbol, actually. It\u2019s an upside-down painting of a fermata: the bit of musical notation used to indicate a dramatic pause.) Lulu is always carrying on her body this marker of abstraction. Unknowability again: she recedes from a woman into a free-floating sign. One other thing: Given that Berg\u2019s music was banned by the Nazis, it\u2019s hard not to see the symbol pinned to Lulu\u2019s chest as a harbinger of other, more vicious markers pinned to clothes in the 1930s and 1940s. Joseph Goebbels loathed 12-tone music, which he called a symptom of \u201cthe Jewish intellectual infection [that] had taken hold of the national body\u201d. Perhaps I\u2019m being too literal. But images of Nazis \u2013 Leni Riefenstahl, for one, and also Hermann Goering \u2013 appear in both the projections at the opera and in Kentridge\u2019s preparatory drawings.     Johan Reuter as Jack the Ripper. Photograph: Ken Howard/Metropolitan Opera    Seth: I noticed Kentridge\u2019s drawing of Berg himself haunting Alwa\u2019s solo feature, in the third scene of the first act. But I did not clock all the other extra-narrative references in the projections. (That\u2019s one reason I\u2019m going back!) Another great thing is that, in this production, the act one painting can loom as large for the audience \u2013 thanks to the projection \u2013 as it does for the characters. Jason: And it can mutate in a hundred different ways. Lulu appears dressed or nude, childlike or feminine, with a boa constrictor around her neck at one point. Some of the projected paintings are, by the way, the most erotic artworks of Kentridge\u2019s whole career. At one point he projects a painting of Lulu as an odalisque, bare bottom high in the air. Seth: In a way, Berg\u2019s multimedia interest was too advanced for the operatic production practices of his day. He called for a silent film to be showed during the act two orchestral interlude, and a lot of productions just ignore this. But Kentridge actually made the film (starring the pianist-avatar version of Lulu), and it works fantastically well. For me, it really connected the two different halves of the second act in a way I\u2019ve never experienced before.            Jason: Well, in fairness, there were attempts to introduce multimedia into the theatre of the Weimar era. In the theatre of Erwin Piscator, for example \u2013 whose production of Hoppla, Wir Leben!, from 1927, featured projected films making use of high-speed montage. Or Meyerhold, in the Soviet Union, was experimenting with projections on stage. But you\u2019re quite right that the film component of Lulu has proved a step too far for most directors. Last time I saw Lulu, in 2010, they just left it out. It\u2019s funny to think that the Met needed to bring in a visual artist to do what opera directors considered avant-garde nearly a century ago. And the film is one of the strongest parts of this night. It depicts Lulu\u2019s time in prison, after murdering her third husband (the first two have already kicked it, one from a heart attack, one from a razor to the throat). An actor in a Louise Brooks bob appears in a mugshot alongside a drawn version of Lulu; we see her try to seduce the prison doctor. And then, in giant letters: DIE SCHULD. Which is the German word for guilt, but also, as everyone in the Greek finance ministry can tell you, also means debt. Money, sex, murder: it\u2019s all one. Seth: So, we\u2019re agreed: this is a monster show, and everyone needs to know.      The Met brings it: Petersen in the title role and Daniel Brenna as Alwa. Photograph: Ken Howard/Metropolitan Opera    Jason: And goodness knows the house needs one. Since 2006, when Peter Gelb became general manager, the Met has been promising more serious and more ambitious stagings than the horns-and-breastplates showcases of a previous generation \u2013 and yet often failing to deliver. This Lulu stands alongside a few other productions (Willy Decker\u2019s La Traviata, Phelim McDermott and Julian Crouch\u2019s Satyagraha, Fran\u00e7ois Girard\u2019s Parsifal) as a rare case when the Met brought it. Seth: I think there are a couple more successes in the mix, too. But it\u2019s true that the recent track record has been uneven. Partly, this has to do with the way that the Met serves many different audiences, with different tastes. (Opera lovers are thought of as a uniform cadre, in the broader cultural conversation. But saying you like opera is like saying you like books. Do tell! Which ones?)  People who are afraid of \u201c12-tone\u201d (or \u201catonal\u201d) music really owe it to themselves to hear this particular production. For this run, conductor Lothar Koenigs is stepping in for Met music director James Levine, at short notice. The sound he gets from the Met orchestra leans hard on the score\u2019s Romantic attributes. (Which makes sense, since that\u2019s generally how Levine has conducted Berg at the Met, over the decades.) My notes from last night are strewn with exclamations about various sumptuous effects, like the saxophone playing that sways through some of Lulu\u2019s music in the first act, or the lushness of the string music that stalks the Countess, later on. It\u2019s a glorious performance, on a level of sound. And Petersen has the vocal toolkit Berg wanted for this role, including refined coloratura as well as blazing dramatic power. Jason: I totally agree. Though I\u2019ve never heard Levine conduct this opera. Lulu (and Wozzeck) are two of Levine\u2019s signature works, but the conductor was already in ill health back in 2010, the last time Lulu appeared here. He pulled out of that production too.  I\u2019m hardly the first person to say that Levine\u2019s refusal to retire is part of a larger crisis of leadership at the Met \u2013 the largest performing arts organisation in the United States, but one beset by financial and artistic hardships. Neither Levine nor Gelb seems to have what\u2019s needed to turn the place around, and the Met doesn\u2019t have an artistic director, someone who could make the company feel like the vital American and global institution it should be. And yet, every now and then, we get a night like last night\u2019s Lulu: the sort of production that reminds you of opera\u2019s unique power, and what can happen when music and theater and visual arts inform one another at the highest calibre.

I spent it in Chile, and learned a lot more Spanish and real life skills than I ever would have done sat in a lecture hall. But for some students, a year abroad isn\u2019t an option. Either it\u2019s not offered as part of their course, or a year is just too long to spend away from home.  For those who don\u2019t want to miss out on the benefits of globetrotting while they study but can\u2019t take a full year out, there are still many opportunities available that can offer an equally valuable international experience. Here are five suggestions. Working abroad Summer jobs and internships are a great way to experience working life in another culture and will help you find out if a career overseas would suit you. Charlie Hutchinson, 22, a recent graduate from the University of York, spent six weeks during the summer of her second year working in a family bed and breakfast in Castillon-la-Battaile, France. She says: \u201cBeing in a small village where nobody spoke English was a struggle at first as I hadn\u2019t practiced French since school. But working with the owners of the B&amp;B helped me to pick it back up quickly.\u201d To find internships abroad, build an online profile with AISECC, which matches students with opportunities. Alternatively, you could become an au pair abroad. Registering with Aupairworld.com will connect you to host families in a variety of countries. Volunteering abroad From wildlife conservation, to teaching, to healthcare \u2013 getting involved in a volunteering project can help make a big difference to communities worldwide. Jozef Butterfield, 21, a postgraduate student at the University of York, spent a month during the summer of his second year teaching English to young monks in a monastery in Kathmandu, Nepal.   Related: How teaching English on my year abroad improved my French    He says: \u201cEven as their teacher, I learned a lot from the kids about traditions of Buddhism and how it influences their daily lives in the monastery.\u201d If you\u2019re interested in volunteering abroad, conservation organisation Frontier can help you organise a placement. Fundraising abroad If you enjoy taking part in sponsored cycles or running marathons in the UK, then you may be interested in similar fundraising events abroad. Robert Houseago, 21, a graduate from the University of Hull, completed a sponsored climb of Mount Kilimanjaro in aid of Childreach International in July this year. He says: \u201cThe climb itself was tough but extremely rewarding as I managed to reach the summit as well as raise money for a good cause.\u201d UK charities run events in a number of different countries.

Studying at a summer school Spending next summer studying may not sound appealing, but the idea of summer school is to balance learning with having fun abroad.

The communities say the IFC has \u201cdestroyed their livelihoods\u201d by reducing fish stocks and damaging the environment in Gujarat. The case is filed in the District of Columbia circuit of the federal court system, as that is where the World Bank is based. But in a move decried by human rights advocates, the IFC says the complaint, filed by the NGO EarthRights International in April this year on behalf of those affected, \u201cmust be dismissed in its entirety\u201d because the IFC is entitled to immunity from prosecution in the US under a treaty signed in 1945. According to the IFC, the International Organisations Immunities Act of 1945 gives it \u201cthe same immunity from suit and every form of judicial process as is enjoyed by foreign governments\u201d. A verdict on whether the IFC\u2019s immunity defence will hold, or whether the court will hear the case, is not expected before January 2016.   Related: Anger over enduring 'environmental horror' in oil-rich, polluted Niger delta    \u201cWhat are they afraid of?\u201d asks Kristen Genovese, from the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO) in Amsterdam. \u201cAny other institution \u2013 you can sue your government, you can sue corporations. Why can\u2019t you sue the Bank? Why is it above the law? You need to have checks and balances.\u201d At the moment, she adds, \u201cthe entire World Bank group essentially plays by its own rules\u201d. The IFC is the branch of the World Bank that invests in the private sector in developing countries.  In 2008, it announced a $450m loan for the 4,000 megawatt Tata Mundra \u201cultra mega power plant\u201d near the port town of Mundra in Gujarat. The project was billed as critical to providing cheap and reliable power for India\u2019s industrialisation, but critics have long raised questions about its environmental footprint.  Asked for a response about the US legal case, the IFC said it could not comment on the suit.  It noted that after a negative internal report was released following local complaints in 2011, the operating company, Coastal Gujurat Power, voluntarily agreed on an \u201caction plan\u201d, including new \u201cmitigating measures\u201d. Frederick Jones, IFC spokesman, said this month: \u201cThe importance of electricity in ending poverty and building prosperity cannot be understated. Lack of electricity impairs opportunities for education, healthcare, clean water, freedom of movement, and jobs.\u201d He added that the project \u201cprovides reliable power to rural and urban-based domestic consumers\u201d across northern and western India. But local communities say it has done more harm than good, and that they are struggling to survive in its wake.     The Tata Mundra plant, in Gujarat. Photograph: Matt Kennard    Standing on a sandy beach a mile or so downstream from the power plant, Bharat Patel looks dejected. He is general secretary of Machimar Adhikar Sangharsh Sangathan (MASS), a body representing fishermen in the area. During the fishing season, this area is full of people trying to make a living. In the distance, behind the few rudimentary living quarters on the beach, the power plant\u2019s imposing chimneys belch grey smoke into the sky. Patel says its operations have changed the temperature of the water gushing down into the fishing area and caused their catch to migrate. \u201cThe World Bank is meant to reduce poverty, but this type of investment by the IFC has created poverty,\u201d he says. \u201cFor this project, they want good engineers \u2026 and in our area and our communities, people are not very well educated. The literacy rate is 20%, so they are obviously not going to be involved in this project. Around 200 to 300 are working [at the power plant], so you destroy 10,000 fishermen\u2019s livelihoods for 200 people\u2019s jobs. It\u2019s not justifiable.\u201d Nearby is the small village of Navinal, where many of the fishermen live. Its sandy, uneven streets are dotted with cows, and welcoming residents tell you to step inside their homes to eat. \u201cIndustries came here but not for the benefit of the local people. They have benefited outsiders,\u201d says Gajendrasinh Jadeja, the charismatic 29-year-old head of the village. \u201cThe locals have lost their livelihood; they haven\u2019t got any benefit from the companies.\u201d  \u201cEveryone is in debt apart from 1% that gets rich,\u201d says Salim Umar Vager, 47, a fisherman who works in the area downstream from the power plant. The Tata Mundra project has been the subject of long running disputes. A former IFC senior official, who worked at the institution when the Tata Mundra investment was approved, and spoke on the condition of anonymity, said there was a \u201chuge debate\u201d internally, among staff, about the project and its potential environmental impact even before the deal was signed. In a statement to EarthRights in July 2015, the IFC argued that it should not be accountable in court because its internal accountability mechanism, the Compliance Advisor Ombudsman (CAO), \u201cprovides plaintiffs with an alternative means of recourse\u201d. In 2011 local communities filed a formal complaint with the CAO. In response, it published a report on the Tata Mundra project, concluding that the IFC had failed to adequately consider its \u201cpotentially harmful effects\u201d. But the IFC largely dismissed the findings in its response to the CAO, which said it was \u201cconfident that the company\u2019s management system effectively addresses [environmental and social] risks and impacts\u201d \u2013 prompting more than 100 organisations in India and 68 globally to write to an open letter to World Bank President Jim Yong Kim in outrage. \u201cIt\u2019s a weakness in the system. There\u2019s nothing that can compel the IFC to actually do what they\u2019re meant to do or to remedy the harm that they\u2019ve contributed to,\u201d says Genovese, the Amsterdam-based researcher.   Related: On the shores of Malawi\u2019s lake of stars, activists raise uranium fears | Santorri Chamley    The IFC has come under the spotlight in recent years for investments associated with alleged human rights abuses and environmental damage. In the past, civil society groups have called for a portion of the investment proceeds from the IFC to be put aside for some sort of compensation fund for when projects cause harm \u2013 though no such thing currently exists. Luiz Vieira, coordinator of the Bretton Woods Project, which tracks the World Bank and IMF, says: \u201cThere\u2019s no remedy, there\u2019s no fund where IFC then says, \u2018We made a mistake \u2013 you lost your livelihoods, so we\u2019ll provide you compensation.\u2019\u201d The current case is important, says Michelle Harrison, a legal fellow working for EarthRights International, not just for the plaintiffs to \u201cget redress for their own suffering but also to ensure that other communities around the world don\u2019t endure what they\u2019ve endured\u201d. Meanwhile, back in Gujarat, the farmers and fishermen who filed the case say they cannot wait. Ranubha Ranmalji Jadeja, a 60-year-old farmer, says he is struggling with the coal dust from the plant that is settling on his crops, causing his harvests to shrink. \u201cWe are a welcoming people,\u201d he says. \u201cBut this type of project destroys our livelihood.\u201d \u2022 This article was reported with support from the Pulitzer Center on Crisis Reporting", "sentences": ["Related: Anger over enduring 'environmental horror' in oil-rich, polluted Niger delta    \u201cWhat are they afraid of?\u201d asks Kristen Genovese, from the Centre for Research on Multinational Corporations (SOMO) in Amsterdam.", "There\u2019s nothing that can compel the IFC to actually do what they\u2019re meant to do or to remedy the harm that they\u2019ve contributed to,\u201d says Genovese, the Amsterdam-based researcher."], "title": "Fishermen and farmers sue World Bank lending arm over power plant in India", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2015/nov/10/fishermen-farmers-sue-world-bank-lending-arm-ifc-power-plant-india", "tags": ["Global development", "Environmental sustainability", "World Bank", "India", "World news", "South and Central Asia", "Business"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-11-11T06:30:10Z", "article": "Side One, Warsaw With the phenomenal music that was made during the communist days and the unique design that often accompanied it, it\u2019s no wonder that Poland punches way above its weight.

Unfortunately, there is just one survivor with those characteristics now. Discos Paradiso was opened by Gerardo L\u00f3pez and Arnau Farr\u00e9s in 2010. It\u2019s a true paradise for lovers of new and classic releases alike. As soon as you open the door, you can understand perfectly why it\u2019s called Discos Paradiso. Everything is highly organised, 12ins and LPs are always protected in plastic, prices are reasonable and the owners are quick to find common ground with the customer. Another thing I love about this store is that there are always things happening (special record releases and live performances), plus it\u2019s a great meeting place to catch up with another artists and label owners.

I\u2019ve been going here since I was about 15. Nowhere else in the city matches up to it because it almost feels like a secret for the music obsessed. I\u2019ve found everything from Blur to The Rolling Stones there, mixed in with dozens of other bands I would never have known about without them.

It\u2019s the kind of place I\u2019ve wandered into on a rainy day on my own, but it\u2019s also where I recently saw one of my favourite bands (the incendiary Girl Band) launch their album in the tiny little record store where they had played their first gig.

When I was younger I used to find it really intimidating, which is pretty laughable to me now. Even above the small but carefully and beautifully curated selection of records for sale, and the wealth of technical information (and opinions) available from the staff, the most striking thing about the place is the genuine warmth emanating from it; a rarity for a record shop like that in my experience.

The secondhand scene has always been a big part of the vinyl shops in Stockholm and at Snickars it\u2019s easy to see why. There are thousands of records to check out and every genre is represented. The main focus is dance, though it also spans soul, funk, disco, hip-hop, jazz, techno, pop and rock. If you\u2019re after New Detroit techno or obscure free jazz from Mexico City, you\u2019ll find it here. DJ and producer Mika runs the shop together with Jessica and together they organise events and in-store sessions with local labels nd DJs. Every now and then they sell entire collections and also make room for Saturday scratch sessions in the store. What makes the shop unique is the community feel.

There were a couple of attempts ages ago, but the market here just doesn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s an expensive hobby by our standards. That being said, there is an absolute gem here which is a real heaven for serious crate diggers. Yugovinyl is the place where Gilles Peterson, Ron Morelli, Jeremy Underground, Young Marco, Chee Shimizu, Interstellar Funk and many others rushed into when visiting Belgrade.

He digs the records from private collections and international vinyl markets. The experience of listening to these records is also outstanding as it has a soundsystem you rarely see in a regular record shop.

He said Black Friday had changed the shape of the festive season so there were now three peaks \u2013 the US-inspired discount day on 27 November; the weeks before Christmas and the post-Christmas sales.

There was no proof, after all. And she would never want to be seen as a sore loser \u2013 no matter how much it hurt when she missed the podium in a major competition. Now, following Dick Pound\u2019s revelations about systemic doping in Russia, Pavey has found her voice, and she warns that solving athletics\u2019 problems will require money, persistence and a willingness to rattle skeletons in even the mustiest of closets. \u201cWe need more funding for anti-doping,\u201d she says. \u201cThe World Anti\u2011Doping Agency\u2019s entire budget is $30m a year [\u00a319.8m], which is less than some Premier League clubs spend on one player.\u201d           The secrets of doping: how Russia makes its winners    She also wants more robust testing \u2013 perhaps by an independent anti-doping agency \u2013 and for frozen samples to be retested with the latest technologies. \u201cI\u2019d love it if they went back and retested every sample,\u201d she says. \u201cIf you are a drugs cheat you should never think you can rest on your laurels because the statute of limitations of 10 years has passed. There are cheats out there who are probably counting down to when they can\u2019t be punished and thinking: \u2018Right, 10 years has gone, that\u2019s it, I can enjoy the rest of my life.\u2019 I want them to always worry they could get found out.\u201d Pavey even wonders whether the statute of limitations on retesting samples could go back further: after all, in 2013 the French authorities revealed how many of the samples from the 1998 Tour de France contained the blood-doping agent EPO. Admittedly Pavey has a vested interest, because she believes she was denied a podium place in the 2002 and 2006 European Championships. \u201cAs a clean athlete you do start to wonder how many medals you should have been awarded, and how many medals you have missed out on,\u201d she admits. \u201cIt has ruined people\u2019s careers.\u201d The evidence appears damning. In 2002, Pavey was fifth behind the Russians Yelena Zadorozhnaya, who failed a drugs test last year, and Olga Yegorova, who was given a two-year ban in 2008 for manipulating drug samples. Meanwhile in 2006 Pavey was even closer to a medal, after finishing fourth behind the Russian Liliya Shobukhova \u2013 who was banned last year for biological passport irregularities \u2013 and the Turkish athlete Elvan Abeylegesse, who was suspended earlier this year by her own federation after her samples from 2007 were retested and discovered to contain a banned substance. There are few jobs where being fourth best in the world can make you feel so worthless. Yet without confessions or retested samples, Pavey will not get those medals back. There was, though, a blasting ray of light this summer when it came to another race that Pavey had missed out on \u2013 the 2007 world championships in Osaka \u2013 when Turkish authorities revealed that Abeylegesse, who won silver in the race, had been suspended. But while Pavey is still awaiting official confirmation that she is being bumped up to bronze, she says the moment will \u201cdefinitely be bittersweet\u201d if it arrives. \u201cI will be pleased to get the medal that was rightfully mine but I will never get that moment on the podium back,\u201d she says. \u201cI was totally gutted after that race because I gave it everything yet left feeling I had let my friends and family down.\u201d One bright side is that the most significant anti-doping development of recent years \u2013 the athlete\u2019s biological passport \u2013 helped Pavey to remain competitive even after she had turned 40 and to finally win European Championships gold in 2014. It is a title she hopes to retain in Amsterdam next year but her big goal for 2016 is to create history by becoming the first British women\u2019s athlete to compete in five Olympic Games. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a tough ask but I am ready for the challenge,\u201d she says. \u201cIt is a huge honour to represent your country and I\u00a0would love another go.\u201d Her target is to compete in the women\u2019s 10,000m final in Rio on 12 August \u2013 when she will be 42 and 326 days \u2013 making her the second\u2011oldest British athlete to compete in an Olympics, behind Joyce Smith, who was 46 when she ran the marathon in Los Angeles in 1984. Given Pavey\u2019s recent form you wouldn\u2019t back against her. Last month at the Great South Run Pavey set an over-40s world record for 10 miles in 52min 44sec, beating the previous mark by more than a minute. That performance, the fastest in her career over 10 miles, was even more respectable given she deliberately eased back this year. \u201cWhen you get older you use the experience and the knowledge you have gained over the years,\u201d she says. \u201cYou have a much better understanding of what works for you and what doesn\u2019t. I wish I knew at 25 what I know now.\u201d   Related: Russia facing IAAF suspension by Friday over damning doping report    After the Great South Run Pavey took a week off and had \u201ca bit of a let\u2011up\u201d with a few glasses of merlot and bars of chocolate. Now, though, the serious work begins as Pavey goes back to training 100 miles a week to crank her body back into shape for the British 10,000m trials next May. And, she says, there is a new training partner on some of her runs: her six-year-old son, Jacob, who rides with her on his bike. \u201cSometimes we all go to the forest and my little girl Emily is on the back of my husband\u2019s bike and my little boy is on his bike and we\u2019ll do eight or nine miles together,\u201d she says. It sounds like he has the Pavey genes? \u201cHe\u2019s a good little runner but he\u2019s too young,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m not a pushy parent. I just want him to enjoy what he is doing. We\u2019ll go down the track and some days he\u2019ll run a bit and some days he won\u2019t. It\u2019s up to him. \u201cBut he\u2019s good on his bike \u2013 sometimes too good. We went to Cornwall in the summer and because it was on tarmac and slightly downhill he went for it and disappeared out of sight. At the end I was shouting his name and some other people had to go and rescue him. It was very safe because it was an enclosed trail with no road but it wasn\u2019t what I was planning.\u201d Pavey\u2019s first race in 2016 will be one of the Cancer UK Winter Run Series over 10km in either London, Manchester or Liverpool, as she looks to build up to the UK trials. The barrier to Rio is high and Pavey is not complacent: to ensure automatic qualification she will have to finish first in the trials and reach the 10,000m Olympic qualifying standard of 32min 15sec. She is determined to do everything in her powers to succeed. And, in the meantime, she promises to keep fighting the good fight against doping. \u201cThe sport is having some very dark days,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I am still really passionate about it and I know it has a bright future if it is cleaned up.\u201d", "sentences": ["It is a title she hopes to retain in Amsterdam next year but her big goal for 2016 is to create history by becoming the first British women\u2019s athlete to compete in five Olympic Games."], "title": "Jo Pavey: \u2018As a clean athlete you wonder how many medals you missed out on\u2019", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2015/nov/11/jo-pavey-athlete-medals", "tags": ["Athletics", "Russia doping scandal", "Wada", "Drugs in sport", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-11-11T16:27:43Z", "article": "   John Alker.

When Ulay unexpectedly took a seat, she began to cry and reached across to hold his hands; the video of the encounter has been viewed by millions on YouTube.  The memory of that tender moment has now been banished, however, after Ulay launched a lawsuit, to be heard in Amsterdam later this month, in which he claims Abramovi\u0107 has violated a contract they signed in 1999 covering works they had created together.  Ulay claims that Abramovi\u0107 has asked galleries to list her as the sole author of their joint works, contrary to the terms of the contract, has failed to provide him with accurate statements of sales, and has paid him only four times in the course of 16 years.  \u201cShe is not just a former business partner,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cThe whole oeuvre has made history. It\u2019s now in school books. But she has deliberately misinterpreted things, or left my name out.\u201d But Abramovic\u2019s lawyer said the artist \u201ctotally disagrees\u201d with her former partner\u2019s allegations. \u201cMy client doesn\u2019t want to comment on them, they are libellous. My client considers that this lawsuit is abusive and aimed to damage her reputation in public, which is proven by his allegations to you. My client is very confident in her position in front of the court. She will defend her rights and reputation by all legal means.\u201d When the couple separated in 1988, they decided to mark the end of their relationship with a piece called The Lovers, in which they each walked 2,500km from either end of the Great Wall of China, before embracing and parting for the last time. Ulay says he later sold his physical archive to Abramovi\u0107, who agreed to maintain it and supervise the production of saleable materials from it, in the form of videos, photographs and performances. All profits were to be divided as follows: 50% to the gallery, 30% to Abramovi\u0107 and 20% to Ulay. But his lawsuit claims that she has interpreted the contract to give him a much smaller share of royalties. In addition, Ulay alleges that Abramovi\u0107 prevented him from including images of their joint works in his 2014 book, Whispers: Ulay on Ulay \u2013 resulting in multiple redactions that were replaced in its pages with pale pink squares \u2013 and objected to the establishment of the Ulay Foundation, an organisation intended to manage his posthumous estate.

The lucky spectators who made it in to the sell-out show \u2013 500 hopefuls remain outside \u2013 try to work out what it all means.   Frank Uwe Laysiepen, who has worked for more than 50 years as Ulay, is one  of just a handful of performance artists featured in art history textbooks. The only one better known is Marina Abramovi\u0107: Ulay\u2019s partner in life and art from 1976 until 1988. Since their break-up, Abramovi\u0107 has become famous worldwide, thanks to a 2010 retrospective at MoMA in New York, a major HBO documentary, celebrity friends including Jay Z and Lady Gaga and a line of Adidas commercials. Ulay, however, is hardly a household name.   Related: Marina Abramovi\u0107 sued by former lover and collaborator Ulay    The art they made together was passionate, pioneering and powerful; their extraordinary relationship lives on in indelible images, such as the pair holding a bow and arrow in tension, the arrow\u2019s tip pointed at Abramovi\u0107\u2019s heart. This month, it faces its greatest crisis: in the law courts, where Ulay claims that Abramovi\u0107 has been writing him out of his own history. In his lawsuit he alleges that she has withheld money from him for 16 years, and failed to give him proper credit for their joint legacy. Those numbers in A Skeleton in the Closet? They refer to the collaborative works which, he says, Abramovi\u0107 has censored. She vigorously contests the claims, and says she is confident she will win the case. Together, Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay made scores of artworks. They include Incision (1978), in which a naked Ulay runs toward a clothed Abramovi\u0107, only to be pulled back by an elastic rope and, in the same year, AAA-AAA in which the pair scream at one another. Their relationship is symbolised in 1977\u2019s Relation in Time, in which they performed bound together by their braided hair while facing away from one another \u2013 for 17 hours. More recently, Ulay reappeared in Abramovi\u0107\u2019s performance of The Artist is Present at MoMA, where visitors queued (for hour upon hour) to sit silently opposite her and simply share eye contact. One day, Ulay showed up as a surprise. Both grew teary as they sat staring at one another and the moment was captured on film. It went viral, and has now been seen by millions on YouTube. The background music and explanatory text make it seem like the reunion of long-lost lovers. But the truth is rather less romantic.         The artists\u2019 reunion at MoMA, New York    Now 72, Ulay splits his time between Amsterdam and Ljubljana, Slovenia. We meet in his spacious flat, overlooking the Dragon Bridge. He first came to Ljubljana for a show of his work and met his now-wife, a renowned Slovenian graphic designer. Their apartment is full of art and found objects: antique apothecary jars, handwritten notes in a number of languages, an ornately carved south Asian screen. But Ulay is rarely in one place for long: invited to perform at Art Basel, teaching on the Greek island of Hydra, filming in Paris.  In 2013, he was the subject of a documentary film, Project Cancer, which followed him for a year after he was diagnosed with lymphoma. After extensive chemotherapy, he beat the cancer and is now in fine form. He mocks what nearly killed him with a Marlboro Red for ever curling smoke around his fingers. Warm and soft-spoken with a haggard handsomeness, he seems to have more stories than could fit in one biography. He was born in Germany, but is synonymous with Amsterdam\u2019s art scene, where he lived for decades and still keeps an apartment. His art career began with his role as a photographer for Polaroid, travelling Europe and the US, taking photographs with their colossal 20x24 and 40x80 inch cameras. The majority of his work remains photographic, but he made his name with his (frequently cross-dressing) performances.     A Polaroid self-portrait by Ulay. Photograph: The Ulay Foundation    The most famous relationship in performance art ended dramatically 18 years ago, after a piece in which Ulay and Abramovi\u0107 set out from opposite ends of the Great Wall of China \u2013 then met in the middle to say farewell. Ulay says that from 1988-99, he and she did not speak. With the encouragement of Abramovi\u0107\u2019s gallerist Sean Kelly, a contract was drawn up to manage their joint oeuvre and Ulay sold his physical archive \u2013 including negatives and transparencies \u2013 to Abramovi\u0107. According to the contract, it could be used to produce saleable work at Abramovi\u0107\u2019s discretion with 20% of the profit going to Ulay. She agreed to tell him about any reproductions or sales of their work.  Since then, Ulay claims she has violated that contract. He says he has received surprisingly little money \u2013 much less, he reckons, than half of what he should have received. Each of their works sell regularly for five or six-figure sums, yet he has received a total of \u20ac31,000. \u201cThere is a lot of money going through her accounts \u2013 and of course they have a very good accountant.\u201d He says he only learned of a major Adidas commercial that used their joint work while it was being filmed. Ulay claims she has paid him only four times. He explains what he hopes to achieve through litigation: \u201cThe points I\u2019m asking of her are: every three months, a statement on sales and my royalties. And I\u2019m asking for absolute proper mentioning of my name.\u201d  What concerns Ulay more, though, is his sense that Abramovi\u0107 is trying to write him out of art history. He claims their contract stipulates that their works must be joint credited, but that Abramovi\u0107 has been claiming sole authorship. \u201cShe has deliberately misinterpreted things, or left my name out,\u201d he says.      Ulay performs A Skeleton in the Closet at the Stedelijk Museum, Amsterdam. Photograph: Maarten Hartman/Hollandse Hoogte/Corbis    Ulay also claims that The Artist is Present \u201cborrows from\u201d one of their joint works, the epic 90-day performance series Nightsea Crossing, which they performed between 1981 and 1987. \u201cAt MoMA, she just cut the table in half and invited visitors to sit opposite her instead of me.\u201d He says his own initial indifference to the issue of authorship has contributed to the problem. \u201cBecause I don\u2019t want to always struggle with her.\u201d Their relationship remained cordial and might have continued so, he says, had Abramovi\u0107 not interfered with the publication of his 2014 book, Whispers: Ulay on Ulay. The book \u2013 which included images from their joint works \u2013 was begun when Ulay was undergoing chemotherapy. Abramovi\u0107 originally agreed to give an interview \u2013 \u201cShe was extremely kind,\u201d recalls its author, Maria Rus Bojan \u2013 but later claimed through her lawyer that she had not given permission to use either the interview or some pictures.   The publisher decided to exclude about 28 images, printing a pink square in place of each. It is the page numbers of these missing images that Ulay scribbles on the wall in A Skeleton In The Closet. \u201cI was hurt, very much hurt.\u201d he says. \u201cIt is unthinkable, so unjust, so not right. When I was working with her, she was great. But then, you know, the direction she went to, to become a star, is something I do not envy. It\u2019s far away from my intentions, wishes, desires ... it went to her head.\u201d  Curator Tevz Logar, who organised Ulay\u2019s first show in Slovenia, points out that, until recently, Ulay had showed no interest in maintaining a position in the contemporary art world. Now he is represented by the MOT International gallery, and will have a solo exhibition in London next year. \u201cThat meant that he started to enter Marina\u2019s symbolic space, space that until now she ruled over. \u201cEvery single person in the art world knows that the Relation Works [their most famous collaborative series] worked because of the balance between them, and of their equal and joint efforts,\u201d says Logar. \u201cThat is how it entered the history of art and performance.\u201d  When approached to comment on the case, Abramovi\u0107\u2019s lawyer replied: \u201cMrs Abramovi\u0107 totally disagree[s] with Ulay\u2019s allegations. My client doesn\u2019t want to comment on them, they are libellous. My client considers that this lawsuit is abusive and aimed to damage her reputation in public, which is proven by his allegations to you. My client is very confident in her position in front of the court. She will defend her rights and reputation by all legal means.\u201d As for Ulay, he is defending his reputation by more subtle means. A tiny note in the acknowledgments pages of his book Whispers reveals the reason for the pink squares \u2013 and the missing images. \u201cI think it must have pissed her off,\u201d he says.

Progressive thinktank the Australia Institute has sought to illustrate just how big those emissions will be. It says the average annual emissions from burning the coal from Carmichael \u2013 79m tonnes of CO2 \u2013 is more than the annual emissions from Sri Lanka, more than Bangladesh with its population of 160 million, about the same as those from Malaysia and Austria and only slightly less than the annual emissions from Vietnam. Compared to annual emissions from cities, it says Carmichael\u2019s emissions will be three times the average annual emissions from New Delhi, double those from Tokyo, six times those of Amsterdam and 20% more than New York City. \u201cAs the international community prepares for the Paris talks, the world\u2019s climate change abatement efforts rely on leaving the bulk of coal resources in the ground,\u201d the institute says.   Related: Australia: The new coal frontier    Under international negotiations, emissions are calculated in the country where they occur, not the country where the fuel is sourced, but the conservation movement is arguing against the development of major new coalmines on the grounds that they are incompatible with the globally recognised threshold of limiting warming to two degrees. The previous successful court challenge, which forced Hunt to re-examine his approval for Adani, was on technical grounds, because he had failed to consider its impact on two species. Hunt reapproved the mine. The new challenge is a test case for the minister\u2019s obligations to consider the climate change impacts on the Great Barrier Reef from burning the mine\u2019s coal.  Hunt insists the project has been approved in accordance with the law, and that 36 strict conditions have been imposed, including on groundwater monitoring, protecting local fauna and funding research for conservation in the Galilee Basin. The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act requires the minister to consider the principles of ecological sustainable development when assessing projects of national environmental significance, but it is not clear whether this could include the consideration of the climate change impact on the reef of the emissions from the coal when exported and burned.  There have been previous decisions in the federal court where decision-makers were required to take into account these so-called \u201cscope three\u201d emissions. After the original legal action, the former Abbott government tried to rush through laws preventing such challenges, arguing they were \u201clawfare\u201d and tantamount to economic \u201csabotage.\u201d That bill was deferred after Malcolm Turnbull became prime minister, but the new challenge has prompted Queensland Liberal National party senator Matthew Canavan to call for it to be brought forward.

Or dominant Qualification play-offs for the European Championship are a relatively new curiosity, born of the vast increase in Uefa membership after the fall of the Iron Curtain. (And a desire to give floundering countries from large advertising territories a second chance should they make a mess of qualification, but let\u2019s not muddy the waters.) It\u2019s a 1990s phenomenon, in short, so this week\u2019s romp through the ages should be shorter and even sweeter than usual! So having said all that, let\u2019s start our story by going way off piste, all the way back to the qualifiers for the very first competition, which in 1960 was called the European Nations Cup. The qualifying process was a straight knockout tournament, and the first match of (forgive the modern nomenclature) the round of 16 was played in September 1958 at the Central Lenin Stadium in Moscow between the USSR and Hungary. The Soviets won that game 3-1, Spartak Moscow striker Anatoli Ilyin scoring the first-ever European Championship goal. What does this have to do with play-offs? Well, not very much, except that 17 countries had entered these qualifiers. Which meant there had to be a preliminary play-off to whittle things down to a mathematically acceptable 16. By definition, this play-off \u2013 between the Republic of Ireland and Czechoslovakia \u2013 should have been staged before any other ball had been kicked. But it was held over until April 1959. The Irish won the first leg 2-0. Liam Tuohy scored the opener, and as a result of perhaps understandable assumptions, is often erroneously credited as the man who started the Euro goalscoring party. But Ilyin beat him to it by seven months. Swings and roundabouts, though. Ireland are also, for the same reason, often incorrectly fingered as the first-ever country to get knocked out of the Euros, having subsequently been spanked 4-0 by the Czechs in the return leg in Bratislava. But in fact, Greece were the first to go, battered 8-2 on aggregate by France, five months before Ireland\u2019s involvement. On to 1964, and one of the big upsets in European Championship qualification history, as tiny Luxembourg knocked out an emerging Holland, then gave Denmark a real fright in what were effectively the quarter finals. (Up to and including 1976, the actual final tournament only featured four teams, from the semis on.) Louis Pilot of Belgian champions Standard Liege, considered by many to be Luxembourg\u2019s greatest-ever player, gave the minnows a first-minute lead in the first leg in Luxembourg City. The match finished 3-3, Danish striker Ole Madsen helping himself to a hat-trick. Madsen grabbed two more in the return in Copenhagen, which looked to have put the Danes through, but Ady Schmidt\u2019s goal with six minutes to go made it 2-2. Away goals didn\u2019t matter back then, so a play-off was necessary. Held in neutral Amsterdam, one goal was enough, and of course Madsen scored it. Luxembourg\u2019s dream was kaput. Fast forward to 1996, and the first planned play-off for the first expanded finals. Euro 96 would be the first finals tournament to boast 16 teams \u2013 Euros 80 through 92 all featured eight \u2013 so Uefa designed a qualification system of eight groups from which 15 teams would qualify to join the holders at the main event. All eight winners went through, with the six best second-placed teams following. The two worst runners-up \u2013 the Netherlands and play-off veterans Republic of Ireland \u2013 would face each other at Anfield for the crucial last place.     Patrick Kluivert beats Phil Babb and lifts it over Alan Kelly as Holland book their place at Euro 96. Photograph: Colorsport/Rex Shutterstock    The Dutch won easily. Patrick Kluivert, who had just won the Champions League for Ajax as an 18-year-old, scored twice. He also headed against the bar, while Dennis Bergkamp hit a post. The Irish fans \u2013 who earlier in the campaign had witnessed their hapless heroes draw 0-0 with Liechtenstein \u2013 knew the jig was up for iconic manager Jack Charlton, and spent the second half singing poignant paeans of thanks to the big man. The game had been played in the middle of December, and after the match Charlton, cracking wise in the bittersweet fashion, said he was planning to have \u201ca good Christmas, and hang around until the new year. Then I will see what the feelings of everyone concerned are. Then I will see what I will do. Merry Christmas. Can I storm out now?\u201d All good fun, although there were no more jokes a week later. Charlton had his hand forced by the FAI, who scheduled a press conference, presumably to announce his resignation, before anything had been formally agreed. \u201cThe FAI were aware, as everybody else ought to be, of my intention to take a holiday in Spain to think things over before making a decision,\u201d Charlton blasted. He did resign, but only after a 90-minute meeting with five FAI officials during which each suit was asked: \u201cDo you want me to go?\u201d Each replied: \u201cYes.\u201d A shabby end to a glorious era. Ireland were involved again in the Euro 2000 qualification play-offs, which now consisted of four matches contested by eight of the nine group runners-up. (The best of the second-rankers, Portugal, swanned straight through and kept going, all the way to the semis.) Ireland were knocked out on away goals by Turkey, and the second leg in Bursa climaxed in a degenerate donnybrook, with 37-year-old striker Tony Cascarino responding to a Turkish kick with a marvellous right hook, only to then be crumped in the face by a fan. His manager Mick McCarthy delivered some deadpan diplomacy with a pithy understatement: \u201cOverall we have been treated well, but I don\u2019t expect my players to be attacked.\u201d The meeting of England and Scotland grabbed most of the headlines round this way. Paul Scholes scored twice at Hampden in the first leg for Kevin Keegan\u2019s side. Having done the hard work, England should have waltzed through the return at Wembley, but Don Hutchison headed home Neil McCann\u2019s cross in the first-half, and there would have been extra time had David Seaman not spectacularly saved Christian Dailly\u2019s late diving header. One in a long list of Scottish heartbreakers. The list stretches quite a long way, in both chronological directions. Elsewhere, Denmark battered Israel 8-0 on aggregate, but the stand-out moment came courtesy of Slovenia and Milenko Acimovic \u2013 later of Spurs \u2013 against Ukraine.            As winners go, this one isn\u2019t half bad. Goals from the halfway line are usually common-or-garden belts down the middle of the pitch. This one was a curler that drifted into the bottom-left corner, just beyond the keeper\u2019s extended fingers. Superb. David Beckham, eat your heart out. Things looked good for Scotland and Wales after the first legs of the Euro 2004 play-offs. The Welsh had come away from Russia with a goalless draw, while James McFadden had given Scotland a precious 1-0 victory over the Netherlands at Hampden. Ah, but. Vadim Evseev scored the only goal for the Russians in the return at Cardiff\u2019s Millennium Stadium, while Scotland found themselves three down at half-time in Amsterdam, and eventually lost 6-0, Ruud van Nistelrooy claiming a hat-trick. Wales lodged a complaint with Uefa after it was discovered Egor Titov had failed a drug test after the first leg, but as he had been an unused substitute in that match, it fell on deaf ears. A long wait went on. No play-offs for 2008, the teams that year all neat in a row. So on to 2012, and what a damp squib that was: the four seeded teams, Croatia, Portugal, Czech Republic and Republic of Ireland, all swanning through to the finals without any trouble.

The brownish-grey patch in the right corner of the central part of the image is a flat area with some agriculture, criss-crossed by canals. Mexico International airport is also visible, and further along the dark green rectangle is the massive reservoir of Lake Nabor Carrillo.  Mexico City sits in the Valley of Mexico, surrounded by mountains and volcanoes, with elevations reaching beyond 5,000 metres. The city rests mainly on the heavily saturated clay of what used to be Lake Texcoco. This soft base is collapsing through the over-extraction of groundwater, and the city has sunk as much as nine metres in some areas since the beginning of the 20th century. Clouds are scattered throughout the image, under which lie various national parks and some of the still-active volcanoes, such as Popocat\u00e9petl.

They smolder under the surface for long periods, often for months. Usually, firefighters can only put them out with the help of downpours during the rainy season. And they release far more smoke and air pollution than most other types of fires. Peat fires start to burn in Indonesia every year because farmers engage in \u201cslash and burn agriculture,\u201d a technique that involves frequent burning of rainforest to clear the way for crops or grazing animals. In Indonesia, the intent is often to make room for new plantings of oil palm and acacia pulp. \u201cMost burning starts on idle, already-cleared peatlands and escapes underground into an endless source of fuel,\u201d explained David Gaveau of the Center for International Forestry Research.

On 19 October, Nasa launched a new website where it will post images of the full, sunlit side of Earth as observed by Epic, the Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera. The instrument flies on the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite.  Once a day, the Epic team at Nasa will post roughly a dozen new colour images of Earth that were acquired 12 to 36 hours earlier. The image above was captured at 04:17:11 Universal Time (Greenwich Mean Time) on 21 October, 2015.  The effective resolution of the Epic camera is somewhere between 10 and 15km (six to nine miles) per pixel, according to Adam Szabo, DSCOVR project scientist at NASA\u2019s Goddard Space Flight Center. Since Earth is extremely bright compared to the darkness of space, the exposure time for images is as little as 20 to 100 milliseconds. The much fainter stars in the background are not visible because of this short exposure time.

The point marks the location where the vertical boundary between the Northern Territory and Queensland meets the northernmost boundary of South Australia. The nearest town is Birdsville, 177km (110 miles) to the east. The borders do not trace the contour of any natural feature \u2013 rather, they follow lines of latitude and longitude \u2013 but natural features are by no means absent.

Below the ocean\u2019s surface, the deeper pool of warm water has reduced the usual upwelling of deep water nutrients to the surface of the Eastern Pacific. This is evident from a decline in sea surface chlorophyll, the green pigment that indicates the presence of phytoplankton. With less phytoplankton available, fish that feed upon plankton, as well the bigger fish that feed on them, have a greatly reduced food supply. Although this El Ni\u00f1o has not yet reached its peak, in past events of this magnitude, the decline in fish stocks led to many marine animals \u2013 including Galapagos penguins, marine iguanas, sea lions and seals \u2013 experiencing famine and dramatic population declines.

Its concentric multiple-ring structure \u2013 resulting from the shock waves on impact \u2013 resembles the ripples when a pebble is dropped in water. The 70 km-diameter inner ring is its most prominent feature and easily observed from space. The annular Manicouagan reservoir lake stretches more than 550km from the source of its longest headstream. The varying tones of the same colour represent a difference in the land\u2019s condition.

A piedmont glacier is where ice spills from a steep valley on to a relatively flat plain, where it spreads out unconstrained like pancake batter.  The main source of Malaspina\u2019s ice comes from Seward glacier, located at the top-center of this image. The Agassiz and Libbey glaciers are visible on the left side, and the Hayden and Marvine glaciers are on the right. The brown lines on the ice are moraines \u2013 areas where soil, rock, and other debris have been scraped up by the glacier and deposited at its sides. Glaciers that flow at a steady speed tend to have moraines that are relatively straight. But what causes the dizzying pattern of curves, zigzags, and loops of Malaspina\u2019s moraines? Glaciers in this area of Alaska periodically \u201csurge\u201d, meaning they lurch forward quickly for one to several years. As a result, the moraines at the edges and between glaciers can become folded, compressed, and sheared to form the characteristic loops seen on Malaspina.

Though adults aged 21 or over can legally possess up to an ounce of retail marijuana, strict regulations make it difficult to consume without breaking the law. As with the open container laws covering alcohol, marijuana cannot be smoked in public. While some cigar shops enjoy immunity from the Colorado Clean Indoor Air Act, which prevents smoking in public establishments, those rules do not extend to pot shops. Ganga-preneurs are forbidden from opening \u201cbud bars\u201d and smoking in dispensaries is likewise illegal. National parks adhere to federal law, which makes cannabis camping tricky, too. Breaking marijuana laws can result in thousands of dollars in fines and jail time. In short, Denver is hardly an all-American Amsterdam. This poses problems for hash-hungry travellers without a friend\u2019s couch to crash on. Enter Joel and Lisa Schneider, owners of the Mary Jane Group, which is leading the way in \u201cthe canna-lifestyle hospitality sector\u201d. They run The Adagio Bud + Breakfast in downtown Denver. Unlike a hotel with a public lobby, a privately owned bed and breakfast can allow customers to legally consume marijuana products on their private premises. The Adagio opened in 2014, effectively cornering the market.     Adagio Bud + Breakfast    Entering the Adagio feels almost disappointingly normal. Complete with crown moulding, chandeliers and a grand piano, the gorgeous Victorian home (built in 1892) is hardly a drug den. In fact, apart from the enshrined Jerry Garcia memorabilia and blown-glass bong roughly the size of an adult blue whale, you might never know its secret. No one\u2019s breaking bad in here. Upper-echelon customers travel from all over the world to spend $179-$399 a night on the handsome rooms. Guests enjoy decidedly decadent Wake + Bake breakfasts: eggs and coffee, or peanut butter and banana-stuffed French toast with candied bacon. And at 4.20pm each day, there are happy-hour munchies. Smoking is not allowed in the rooms, so everyone smokes in the common area. This creates an unusual bond between guests, like a glorified adult youth hostel. Rather than feeling forced together for an awkward breakfast, guests sit for hours, waxing poetic together \u2013 an immaculate house party. It also allows for the owners to keep an eye on folks. \u201cIt feels like mom\u2019s house \u2026 except you can get high on the couch,\u201d noted one glassy-eyed businessman. Due to complicated laws, the Adagio cannot sell marijuana, so guests bring their own. There\u2019s a station of bongs, pipes and other paraphernalia complete with an empty plate for people to share their bud \u2013 it\u2019s rarely empty. Because it\u2019s illegal to travel out of state with marijuana, guests often leave their leftovers upon departure.      Lounging around \u2026 \u2018Smoking is not allowed in the rooms, so everyone smokes in the common area.\u2019    The Adagio looks pretty squeaky clean behind the scenes, too. Though you might imagine the owners to be pungent trustafarians in rumpled clothes, the Schneiders are anything but. Joel is a former corporate lawyer, and Lisa finalised property transactions. \u201cWe\u2019re the goody two-shoes of the industry,\u201d says Lisa, who personally doesn\u2019t touch marijuana. They\u2019re here for the so-called \u201cGreen Rush\u201d, the expected tourist boom created by the new pot laws. The Mary Jane Group has two more locations: a small, Grateful Dead-themed location in Silverthorne, and an 11-room lodge in Colorado Springs that functions more like a hotel. Due to county regulations Silverthorne can offer a bud bar, and both locations have a smoking common area. Schneider is hunting for more Colorado properties, and considering going into partnership with a casino in Washington state. He envisions a network of resorts and \u201ccanna-camps\u201d: playgrounds for adults to explore their affected senses. There will be painting classes; cannabis golf tournaments; a spa where THC enhances massage and takes the edge off your bikini wax. \u201cI want to be the Walt Disney of cannabis,\u201d he states proudly.     And so to bed \u2026 one of the Adagio\u2019s bedrooms    The Dopiest Place on Earth? A noble dream, some might say. But it\u2019s a rocky road to the top of that mountain \u2013 the Schneiders can\u2019t even get a bank loan. National banks won\u2019t touch cannabis-affiliated companies, and advertising proves difficult, as platforms such as Google and Facebook refuse their business. They\u2019ve even had a visit from an undercover cop, which resulted in a small fine. \u201cPot is legal here, but not everyone likes that, and they\u2019re going to make it as difficult as possible,\u201d says Lisa. The Colorado Tourism Office has no interest in self-identifying as \u201cThe Green State\u201d, despite the projected $1bn the marijuana market will generate in Colorado next year. Nevertheless, this is a, erm, budding industry, with new businesses popping up like, well, weeds. Denver-based My 420 Tours offers four-hour dispensary and grow tours, with smoke-friendly limousines and buses from $129pp, and a three-day \u201ccannabis vacation\u201d with stays in Denver hotels that allow marijuana vaping in the rooms, from $1,295. Colorado Green Tours offers marijuana-friendly ski packages. Companies assume existing business models, add pot, and voila! The Airbnb-inspired TravelTHC offers holiday rentals where guests can smoke in strangers\u2019 houses and retire to a marijuana-infused chocolate on their pillow. \u201cThis is just the beginning,\u201d says Joel Schneider. He\u2019s right \u2013 with allies like the Mary Jane Group and petitions for the legalisation of bud bars being passed around like joints at a Snoop Dogg concert, stoners have hope that one day, in this great nation, they can smoke the weed they legally bought. \u2022 This article was amended on 2 December 2015 to update the description of painting classes to be offered.", "sentences": ["In short, Denver is hardly an all-American Amsterdam."], "title": "Mile-high city just got higher: Denver\u2019s first cannabis-friendly B&B", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/nov/12/denver-colorado-cannabis-adagio-bud-breakfast-weed", "tags": ["Denver holidays", "Bed and breakfasts", "Colorado holidays", "City breaks", "United States holidays", "North and Central America holidays", "Travel", "Colorado", "Cannabis"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-11-13T13:00:00Z", "article": "A few years ago, the notion that voters in the United States would opt to legalize recreational marijuana seemed wholly absurd. That was for Amsterdam, not America. But in November 2012, citizens in Colorado and Washington defied conventional wisdom and overwhelmingly voted to end their prohibitions on cannabis. Other states followed suit in 2014 and even more look poised to do so next year. Now, organizers in Colorado are hoping the state can be a trailblazer again by convincing voters to pass another policy many experts consider a pipe dream: free statewide healthcare. Colorado\u2019s secretary of state, Wayne Williams, announced this week that ColoradoCare, a citizen initiative to implement a single-payer healthcare system in the state, had submitted enough valid signatures to qualify for the November 2016 ballot. The group turned in 158,831 signatures, far surpassing the 98,492 required. The initiative is tentatively titled Amendment 69.   Related: A single-payer system, like Medicare, is the cure for America's ailing healthcare | Bernie Sanders    \u201cColoradans will have a chance to replace government and multinational corporate control of our health and our health care money with user-friendly, bureaucracy-lite, fiscally responsible financing,\u201d ColoradoCareYES, the advocacy group behind the initiative, triumphantly declared in an email after Williams\u2019s announcement. If passed, ColoradoCare would create a single-payer system to provide health coverage for all residents of Colorado. It would be the first state to opt out of the Affordable Care Act and replace it with universal coverage. Under the proposal, any time a Coloradan is billed for a healthcare service, they would simply forward that claim to ColoradoCare, which would foot the bill. Some services may require a small co-payment, but deductibles would be done away with altogether. If that sounds similar to Medicare, that\u2019s because it is. Like Medicare, all Coloradans would be required to pay into ColoradoCare, and thus be entitled to its benefits. However, just as senior citizens are free to buy supplemental health insurance or skip Medicare altogether if they choose, residents of Colorado would be free to do the same with ColoradoCare. One prominent supporter of the plan is Senator Bernie Sanders. \u201cColorado could lead the nation in moving toward a system to ensure better healthcare for more people at less cost,\u201d the Democratic presidential candidate told the Colorado Independent. \u201cIn the richest nation on earth, we should make healthcare a right for all citizens. No one should go bankrupt or skip getting the care they need because they cannot afford it.\u201d ColoradoCare would be paid for through a mix of federal Obamacare and Medicaid funding, as well as a 10% payroll tax increase. One-third of this \u201cHealth Care Premium Tax\u201d would be assessed on individuals, with employers footing the other two-thirds. Opponents have already blasted the plan as a $25bn income tax hike. Advancing Colorado, a conservative group that Colorado Democrats claim has ties to the Koch Brothers, blasted the initiative in a press release: \u201cColoradoCare will triple our taxes, lead to rationing of health care and will make Colorado a less attractive state for Millennials, businesses and families.  \u201cColoradans do not want to see their taxes triple and all the progress with health care reform thrown in the trash for a single-payer health care system. We can get more people covered, more affordably and more realistically with market-driven reforms that ensure choice and options.\u201d TR Reid, the author of ColoradoCare, batted away these claims. \u201cThe average family is currently spending $400 to $500 per month on health costs,\u201d or as much as 8% of the average monthly household income. \u201cColoradoCare would cost that family just $196 month,\u201d he said, a flat 3.3% of their income that would be paid in taxes. In other words, taxes would indeed go up, but ColoradoCareYES argues the average Coloradan\u2019s healthcare expenses would go down even further and that everyone making $225,000 or less would pay less in the aggregate under ColoradoCare. Those making above that threshold would pay more.  In addition, ColoradoCare would actually cover everyone in the state, including the estimated 400,000 Coloradans who still lack health insurance under Obamacare. Unlike Obamacare, which denies benefits to undocumented immigrants, ColoradoCare would not deny care based on legal status. \u201cOur view is that if someone is living in our state and sending kids to our schools and has a contagious disease, we should treat them like everyone else,\u201d said Reid, who is the author of the New York Times bestseller, The Healing of America: A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper and Fairer Health Care. Section 1332 of Obamacare allows states to opt out of the health reform law so long as the proposed replacement would provide coverage that doesn\u2019t cost more and was at least as comprehensive. Single-payer is one idea that would satisfy these requirements, but no state has implemented such a system yet. Lawmakers in Vermont had considered converting to single-payer, but the proposal was ultimately scrapped last December. According to an economic analysis commissioned by ColoradoCareYES, in 2019, Coloradans will pay $31.2bn in healthcare expenses for everything from premiums to deductibles and beyond. If ColoradoCare passes and takes effect in 2019, that overall cost of healthcare would be reduced to $26.7bn. Reid said he expects those savings to increase over time because a single-payer system wouldn\u2019t have the incentive to increase fees that for-profit health insurers do. As the name implies, ColoradoCare would only cover Coloradans. A patient would have to show Colorado residency in order to get their care covered by the system. If an Ohioan breaks his leg on an Aspen ski vacation, he would have to use his Ohio-based insurance plan to pay for treatment at a Colorado hospital. State senator Irene Aguilar, a practicing physician and proponent of the measure, explained why the group is putting the measure to a citizens\u2019 vote rather than the normal legislative procedure. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried to pass ColoradoCare through the legislature, but with the money in politics these days, there\u2019s just no chance,\u201d she said in a video. \u201cFortunately in Colorado, we don\u2019t have to wait for the legislature to get things done.\u201d Inaction in the legislature is what prompted proponents of marijuana legalization to take the matter to a citizens\u2019 vote. And with success in Colorado and elsewhere, that legalization push is spreading across the country.

I was worried about what you read in the papers \u2013 always focusing on the problems, insecurity and violence. I was also overwhelmed with the traffic and the amount of people.

Speaking to the press at the time, Emwazi\u2019s friends said they were told they were on a terror watch list and were held in inhumane and illegal conditions. Fed up with his treatment, Emwazi sought to make a life in Kuwait, working as a salesman for an IT company. His boss told the Guardian he had been \u201cthe best employee we ever had\u201d. When he returned to Britain in May 2010 Emwazi was stopped by counterterrorism officials. He was later prevented from returning to Kuwait. By this time it appeared that he was becoming desperate. \u201cI had a job waiting for me and marriage to get started,\u201d he wrote in a June 2010 email to Asim Qureshi, research director at Cage, which campaigns on behalf of communities affected by the war on terror. \u201cI feel like a prisoner, only not in a cage, in London.\u201d Cage has repeatedly said that the security services\u2019 role in radicalising Emwazi should not be discounted. The rights group has apologised for a press conference in which it described the young man it knew as \u201cbeautiful\u201d. While those who knew him describe him as \u201cmild-mannered and polite\u201d, Emwazi had friends on the fringes of terror. In his twenties had been a member of a loose-knit group of young Muslims from the north Kensington area of London who attended the same mosques and played five-a-side football together. Some of the group were being investigated by MI5 because of their links with the men who attempted to carry out a wave of bombings on London\u2019s underground network on 21 July 2005. One associate told the Guardian that Emwazi was a reader of corporate books and had recommended a hefty 750-page tome International Business: Competing in the Global Marketplace by Charles Hill, a US academic, as a must read. With chapters on Egypt\u2019s failed state and India\u2019s software success, it appeared to signal to other radicals that they take seriously the success of corporations in dominating the globe. Despite being on the watchlist of the security services, Emwazi made it to Syria, a place he had discussed going since 2012. Twelve months later Emwazi was guarding western captives at a prison in Idlib, Syria \u2013 earning his place among Isis\u2019s \u201cBeatles\u201d prison jailers, named for being British. It was from there that he began to acquire his murderous status and global infamy. By this year it emerged Emwazi topped a British \u201ckill list\u201d of targets for death by missile.   On Thursday the UK made good on its promise, killing Emwazi in a joint UK/US drone strike in Raqqa, capital of the so-called caliphate. At 11.50pm on Thursday evening, a trio of US MQ-9 reaper drones ploughed into a car carrying Emwazi, killing him and his three companions. Body parts were scattered at the scene of death, a grisly end to a man reviled for his gruesome acts of terror. Ironically, his death took place beside a usually busy traffic intersection known as the clock roundabout, where Isis carries out public killings. The United States had been tracking him closely since Wednesday and sources say deadly force was deployed as Emwazi was seen leaving a building and getting into a car. Raqqa is Being Slaughtered Silently, a Syrian activist group, citing a source in the de facto Syrian capital, said Isis militants then ringed that vehicle and two others who had been struck to prevent anyone from getting closer. The US army defended its actions, saying Emwazi \u201cwas a human animal, and killing him is probably making the world a little bit better place\u201d. For David Cameron, while the language was more restrained, the sentiment was shared. The British military has killed an estimated 12 British citizens in Pakistan, Somalia and Syria. Yet none of the previous targets had the propaganda value of \u201cJihadi John\u201d, the 27-year-old taunting face of Isis who spoke in a distinctive London accent. While a carefully choreographed media strategy was put in place around the announcement, the killing of a British citizen was justified on the grounds of \u201cself-defence\u201d, an argument that has evolved after two UK jihadis were killed by an RAF drone strike in August. Yet those who knew Emwazi claim he would have \u201cwelcomed death\u201d as part of life in Isis, a group that celebrated martyrdom and a place in heaven. An associate who knew him from London before he travelled to Syria told the Guardian that \u201cEmwazi knew and indeed prayed for an end like this - this is what he\u2019s been waiting for. He has witnessed the \u2018martyrdom\u2019 of many of his dearest friends and couldn\u2019t wait to join in their ranks.  \u201cHe achieved his twin aims of terrorising those whom he deemed enemies, those who had, in his words, declared war on [Isis] whilst having earned God\u2019s pleasure and company. This is how he will have seen it.\u201d On social media, once filled by a cacophony of jihadi howls, there was surprisingly little comment about the killing of Emwazi by the Isis \u201cfan club\u201d. Few emerged to comment on his death although those who did were characteristically defiant. Maghrebi, a Moroccan engineer who tweets in support of Islamic State, tweeted to say: \u201cPentagon boasts about the killing of \u201cJihadi John\u201d. Killing 1 fighter out of 100 000, what does it represent? Nothing.\u201d Academics who have in the past mined the tweets of Isis supporters and used platforms like Facebook to hold conversations with foreign fighters say since the summer the web \u201chas been dead\u201d. Amarnath Amarasingam, who is co-directing a study on Western fighters in Syria and Iraq based at the University of Waterloo, told the Guardian that \u201cthe rumour is that Isis have shut down the internet along the Syria and Iraqi border. After Junaid Hussain [British born Isis hacker] was killed, the chatter was that the drones were using something in Twitter to track fighter locations\u201d. \u201cWhat we have heard is that most of the fighters and their families have moved to Mosul [in Iraq]. As far as Emwazi is concerned, when we asked fighters in Islamic State about him [after he was unmasked as Jihadi John] most of them were surprised and confused. They said he was just a jailer and not a leadership guy.\u201d", "sentences": ["Emwazi then flew to Amsterdam, where he said he was questioned by MI5 and accused of trying to reach Somalia to join the Islamist terror group al-Shabab."], "title": "Mohammed Emwazi: the 'tall, quiet kid' who became a monster", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/nov/13/the-tall-quiet-kid-who-became-a-monster", "tags": ["Mohammed Emwazi", "Islamic State", "World news", "US military", "US news", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-11-14T08:30:13Z", "article": " For all those cyclists who leave their bike at the station only to spend the rest of the day worrying it will be stolen or vandalised, there may be hope in the form of a German-designed tower.  \u201cWhen you get to a train station these days, you see 150 metres of bikes. We need much more compact solutions,\u201d says Nick Child, managing director of Cardok, which will distribute the Radhaus tower in Britain. (Radhaus is a pun on the German word Rad, which means bicycle, and Rathaus, which means city hall.) \u201cWe need much more compact solutions.\u201d The Radhaus bike tower is 10.5 metres high but occupies a relatively small surface area of 55 square metres. Able to hold up to 120 bikes, it features individual parking boxes accessible by a chip card. The tower, which can be accessed by 12 cyclists at the same time, has three storeys and is a modular design that can be assembled within 2-3 weeks.     Cycle Hoop\u2019s Bike Hangar. Photograph: Cycle Hoop    Cardok is not only in discussions with railway companies, it\u2019s also targeting housing developments and office blocks (\u201cthink how popular it would be in Canary Wharf\u201d, Child says). The plan is to charge cyclists \u00a32-\u00a33 a day to use the facility, with discounts for season ticket holders. The first Radhaus tower has been installed outside the ICE train station in the German city of Erfurt. Businesses across the world are creating equally innovative solutions for cyclists in cities. London design firm Cycle Hoop has worked with several dozen local councils to convert existing street furniture into bike parking. It also makes the Bike Port, which allows 10 bikes to park in one car-parking space, and the Bike Hangar, a mini-bike garage that resembles a gigantic breadbox. It is lockable, fits six bikes and can be placed in a car-parking space.  In the Swedish city of Malm\u00f6 three new underground Bike &amp; Ride facilities have been built, one at the central railway station as well as two at smaller stations. Run by the city, they have space for more than 4,500 bikes and provide 24-hour-accessible storage, air pumps, lockers, restrooms and screens showing train departure and arrival times. They also have bike shops operated by a local company as well as waiting lounges. CCTV and security guards monitor the facilities.      Japan\u2019s hi-tech bike parking solution   Tokyo\u2019s cyclists can park their wheels in an even more hi-tech way, using the underground, automated EcoCycle garage, designed by engineering company Giken. All they have to do is deliver their bikes to a lift and swipe a chip card. The lift and its connected rails automatically deliver the bike to an empty space then fetch it when the user swipes their card again. Users pay around $21 (\u00a314)per month for the service. However, it is cities rather than private companies that are taking the lead in creating parking. That means primarily functional rather than flashy solutions. According to Gunjan Parik, head of the transportation initiative at the C40 Cities Climate Leadership Group, an alliance of large cities: \u201cMany cities are rightly focused on getting the basics right and delivering volume.\u201d  For cyclists, the biggest issue is safety. \u201cCyclists need to be able to lock their bike on to something in order to decrease the risk of theft, and the most basic solutions are often the most impactful,\u201d says Esben Alslund-Lanth\u00e9n, an analyst at the Copenhagen-based sustainability thinktank Sustainia. \u201cThe solutions are scalable to most urban contexts and have proved successful because there are low cost and catering to the needs of cyclists.\u201d The Dutch city of Nijmegen has built a guarded, indoor 4,000-bike facility. Like the Malm\u00f6 facilities, it\u2019s free of charge to users, who can see on displays whether any spaces are available before riding into the garage. The same detectors help the facility\u2019s managers locate abandoned bikes, allowing them to free up space by removing them.     An artist\u2019s rendition of a planned bike park in Rotterdam Photograph: City of Rotterdam    Amsterdam is about to build parking for 21,500 bikes around its train station, including a parking facility underneath a city lake as well as floating parking islands, while a subterranean parking facility surrounded by a park and with footbridge access to public transport will be inaugurated in Rotterdam later this year. Part of the reason why bike-parking innovators are more often cities than businesses is that nobody is sure about the business model. Will cyclists, who are used to free parking, be willing to pay to park their bikes? And will enough of them pay, making cities more willing to try innovative concepts and thus making private companies\u2019 innovation worthwhile?  Child is optimistic, predicting that the Radhaus will break even after five to 10 years.  \u201cA key driver is the actual cost of bikes, cyclists don\u2019t mind spending over a \u00a31,000 on a Brompton or \u00a32,000 plus on a decent carbon fibre framed road bike when its used as a significant part of their daily transport mode, but they won\u2019t if its going to get damaged, stolen or stripped for parts.\u201d The parks could also be used to store cyclist\u2019s clothes and bags, says Child. \u201cWe\u2019re even talking to delivery companies that want to deliver goods such as groceries to the parked bikes,\u201d he adds.

Particularly sturdy, institutional carpets; \u201cthe ugly kind that last forever\u201d. But in his latest film, Democracy, the 49-year-old Swiss film-maker has spent five years treading the carpets of Brussels. He\u2019s been following a process with an uncertain ending, in an aesthetic he finds displeasing, to direct a wholly original film about the machinations of European law-making.  Democracy, opening this week in Germany, is a determinedly European film. It is also a subtle, human, optimistic, sensual portrayal of something that for most people couldn\u2019t be further from those descriptors: data-protection reform.  Bernet\u2019s stylish, monochrome sequences cut through the convoluted layers of Brussels bureaucracy, as well as what he describes as the stomach-churning ugliness of its carpets and halls, to find a story of collegiality and hope. At its heart are two idealistic Germans, Green MEP Jan Philipp Albrecht, and his right-hand advisor, tech geek Ralf Bendrath. In a captivating 100 minutes, we see Albrecht struggle against all odds to manoeuvre the unwieldy tanker that is the European Parliament through two years of negotiations, an armada of lobbyists, endless shadow meetings and 4,000 amendments towards a consensus data reform proposal in early 2014. Kind, diligent and well spoken, Albrecht is an effective tousled frontman for modern politics. But so too, perhaps surprisingly, is another of the film\u2019s heroes: long-serving EU commissioner, now parliamentarian, Viviane Reding. In Bernet\u2019s sympathetic portrayal, Reding is multilingual, magnetic, relentlessly committed to the public good, and effuses warmth, support and sincerity.     Democracy \u2013 trailer   Both Albrecht and Reding grow over the course of the film, which was shot intensively over 30 months. They are rounded out by a cast of intriguing characters who trail tantalising hints of their lives beyond Brussels, as well as their motivations for joining the debate. Joe McNamee, executive director of European Digital Rights, excels as a dystopian Cassandra. \u201cPeople will realise how important this process is, in two, three or five years. But then, the process will have passed,\u201d he says, eyes blazing. He\u2019s complemented by the passionate, persuasive activist Katarzyna Szymielewicz and, on the business side of the equation, experienced Linklaters partner Tanguy Van Overstraeten and enterprising business lawyer Paolo Balboni. Conspicuous in their absence are the major lobbyists. Facebook lobbyist Erica Mann appears briefly, but despite persistent efforts, Bernet was unsuccessful in bringing Google, Facebook, Apple, Amazon and the other data giants into the discussion; though they were constantly present and omnipresent, \u201ceverywhere, all the time\u201d. As Bernet explains, \u201cthese companies have a strong policy not to be mentioned in the context of data protection or privacy \u2013 they are all denying to be part of it\u201d. The only lobbyist who appears in the film is John Boswell, of SAS, the data prophet who also opens the trailer. \u201cHe comes from a family company, not listed in the stock exchange. They have nothing to fear from the public opinion. That\u2019s interesting,\u201d says Bernet.  The real change of pace in the film hits at 80 minutes, with the Snowden revelations. Few venues were more primed for the whistleblower than the meeting rooms of Brussels. We feel the resonance and heartbeats as the negotiators receive a cameo from former Guardian editor, Alan Rusbridger: \u201cAnybody who uses digital equipment is put under some form of surveillance. It seems to me that that cannot happen without consent, it cannot happen without the consent of populations. So, my message to the lawmakers is: please protect us.\u201d     Activist Katarzyna Szymielewicz: \u201cSurveillance is about managing populations; managing people\u201d. Photograph: Marcus Winterbauer/Indi Film    The conviviality of the parliamentarians is palpable, \u201csitting together continuously, week per week per week\u201d. By the film\u2019s end, it is a joy to see hugs and true satisfaction across the faces of MEPs that started the film at a distance, from the slick-haired, braces-clad Dimitrios Droutsas to the concerned-for-business Sarah Ludford, and from the magnanimous Se\u00e1n Kelly to the unlikely ally Axel Voss. While Bernet was lucky to find an ending in the notoriously drawn-out and ongoing reform process, it is a bittersweet one. A December finish is promised for current trilogue negotiations between the European Commission, Parliament and Council, which are expected to water down the consensus we see in the film. Meanwhile, unresolved tensions simmer at the heart of data protection law, which asks too much where it shouldn\u2019t, and too little where it should. And, in parallel, state surveillance rides on, virtually unchecked. \u201cIt seems we don\u2019t need time to eliminate the rights, but we need a lot of time to augment the rights,\u201d Reding says, in a pointed challenge to governments. \u201cWhere is the equilibrium?\u201d Bernet is sensitive to this too. \u201cAt the moment what we have is a kind of Faustrecht, or law of the fist, in cyberspace. The strongest takes it all,\u201d says Bernet. \u201cA friend of mine told me, we are only in the Middle Ages of digitalisation. The Renaissance has yet to come. But I do think that Brussels is key to defining the rules of the future.\u201d  Bernet first had the idea to make a film about how a law comes to life a decade ago, while working on a film about interpreters, The Whisperers. \u201cBut it was clear that to do it, you needed a really tough debate. It has to be a law that affects everybody; that promises some heat, ideologically, economically, politically. The privacy debate is clearly a debate at the heart of democracy. Not only in the sense that individuals must be free to make their own decisions, to exercise free will, to not have their autonomy limited by algorithm. But also, in terms of protecting minorities and individuals. This is why we need fundamental rights. We must know where surveillance starts and ends.\u201d  \u201cAs a Swiss, at first I was sceptical of Brussels,\u201d says Bernet. Now he\u2019s an admirer. He sees the complex layers of interests and processes as a strength. \u201cComplexity is what interests me as a filmmaker. Making complex areas of life and institutions accessible. In Brussels, complexity is a peace concept. It is really avant-garde \u2013 and national media can\u2019t, and don\u2019t, cover the dynamism. We live in a generation of governments all over Europe that don\u2019t really participate in the creation of the union. This is a selfish way of doing things.\u201d \u201cFrom the beginning, the plan with this film was to use an aesthetic that is completely different from what we are used to when we see reports about Brussels. It always has the same facades; people arrive in limousines, you see the flags, the yellow stars. Apart from the opening scene, I have forbidden my team to film flags. This is to make clear to the audience that this is something different \u2013 this is not a report, this is not news, this is really offering you an experience from a different quality.\u201d In offering this experience, Bernet\u2019s film is a triumph. It rewards contemplative viewing and is a visual delight, with a lovely play between the inner and outside worlds of the EU institutions, in a style reminiscent of Terrence Malick. Hopefully, too, it draws a wider audience to the critical importance of data protection and the conflicts that surround it. As for Bernet, he\u2019s enthusiastic about next projects. One centres on the famous Israeli musician, Daniel Barenboim. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly about politics \u2013 war and music,\u201d he says. And he\u2019s started digging into the global network behind the World Economic Forum, which he\u2019ll be filming over the next two years. \u201cThat\u2019s more a film about post-democracy, a network of the global economic elite.\u201d Realising that many more conference rooms and halls lie ahead, he laughs. \u201cThe WEF will be really a carpet film, too.\u201d  Democracy is now screening in German cinemas (DE-version).

Related: Paris terror attacks: Islamic State says France is 'top target' for actions in Syria    One word kept coming back \u2013 among politicians, newspaper front pages and confused passersby: war. When, ashen-faced and his voice shaking, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande appeared on television after France\u2019s worst attack since the second world war, the president told the nation that the simultaneous gun attacks and suicide bombings that had killed at least 127 people were \u201can act of war\u201d by Islamic State.           President Hollande calls Paris attacks an \u2018act of war\u2019     The rightwing opposition leader and former president, Nicolas Sarkozy, said war had been declared on France and that France\u2019s own war should be \u201ctotal\u201d. A national state of emergency has been declared, the first time such a measure has been put in place since 1961, when army generals attempted a coup during the Algerian war. There was no curfew, but Parisians were urged to stay inside.  At first, the capital was eerily quiet but people with shopping caddies gradually began to amble slowly along streets neighbouring the area where victims had run screaming from the Bataclan concert hall only hours before.  Those out to shop or walk their dogs were resolute that life must go on, but one question lingered: was it over? It was unclear whether or not any gunmen or accomplices were still at large. When two French gunmen attacked the Paris offices of the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo in January, France endured three days of terror as an accomplice killed a policewoman and led a bloody hostage-taking at a kosher supermarket while others went on the run in Picardy and took hostages at a printers. France now appears to have been hit by an even more elaborate plot, beyond anything of its kind seen on its soil before. Despite 10 months of high tension, narrowly foiled attacks and high alert since January \u2013 including an attempted shooting on a high-speed train from Paris to Amsterdam \u2013 Friday\u2019s attack was shockingly different. It appeared to be the first time suicide bombers had struck in France, and it was the first large-scale attack so minutely coordinated: several attacks within minutes of each other, first a major sports event and then dotted around the heart of everyday Paris on a Friday night.      A watch lays on the ground outside the Bataclan concert hall. Photograph: Christophe Ena/AP    Among the symbolism was the fact that the Bataclan attack was so near to the Charlie Hebdo shooting, so close that many residents had heard both attacks. \u201cI heard the Charlie Hebdo shooting from my bathroom window. I didn\u2019t think I\u2019d hear another one. Then I heard the Bataclan police assault as they went in to raid the siege,\u201d said a PhD student who lived nearby.  \u201cI just keep thinking this is Friday the 13th,\u201d said a video shop owner whose premises was many streets away from the Bataclan, but who had still seen the first bloodied escapees from the massacre running down the street. They shouted at him: \u201cClose! Close your shop!\u201d The French national psyche had been struggling to come to terms with January\u2019s attacks, the grief and the implications for a divided society under new security and surveillance laws. Now the mood of shock and fear is even heavier. After the Charlie Hebdo attacks, the high emotion poured into huge street rallies across across the country attended by international leaders, but this time the state of emergency has prevented any such events from taking place.  \u201cIt is a bizarre feeling of shock and surprise,\u201d said Pascal Bourgeois, 40, an engineer who was out early to buy the local paper Le Parisien, whose front page read: \u201cThis time it\u2019s war.\u201d He had been watching France play Germany at football on television when he heard the explosions outside the Stade de France live on air. At the same time, sirens began blaring near his home, not far from the other central Paris shootings. \u201cI was just saying to a friend., we can\u2019t stop living, we can\u2019t not go outside, we have to carry on.\u201d            French police raid Bataclan concert hall    On Friday morning, before the attackers struck, an annual study had found that fear of terrorism was the second biggest concern after unemployment among French people. It was the first time that fear had scored so high. In some parts of Paris, around Jewish schools and synagogues aand traditional tourist spots like the Notre Dame cathedral, Parisians have got used to soldiers patrolling the streets with machine guns. After the January attacks, Hollande launched Operation Sentinelle to keep 10,000 soldiers on the country\u2019s streets at perceived danger spots. There has also been a rise in the number of those volunteering to serve in the army.  Politically and socially, France had been facing growing tension and now finds itself grieving, battered and under extreme pressure. Even before the Charlie Hebdo attacks, the country was more socially fragmented, more pessimistic than ever, and struggling economically. There was an increasingly negative view of Islam and a rise in the number of far-right voters and sympathisers, and of Islamophobic and antisemitic attacks.    Related: Parisians had got used to the 'new normal', but this is an attack on a terrifying scale    France is less than a month away from important regional elections, which will set the tone for the presidential race in 2017. Hollande is currently the least popular president in modern French history and his governing Socialist party is weak and had been expected to be trounced. Until Friday night\u2019s attacks, the main concern of many political parties was the onward march of the far-right Front National, which was campaigning on insecurity, the terrorist threat and what the MP Marion Mar\u00e9chal Le Pen has called \u201cradical Islam\u201d that had \u201ctaken over\u201d high-rise housing estates. Marine Le Pen, the Front National leader, had been using the regional elections as a springboard for her presidential campaign. Most parties immediately suspended their campaigns after the attacks, but the far-right MP Gibert Collard tweeted: \u201cPoor, poor abandoned France.\u201d Focus will now fall on insecurity, intelligence failings and France\u2019s apparent inability to prevent attacks. The Socialist party had long been under pressure on these issues. France has been on high-alert, and there was a sense that an attack was almost inevitable at some point. Marc Tr\u00e9vedic, a former anti-terrorist judge, had warned this autumn that France was \u201cthe principal target of an army of terrorists with unlimited means\u201d. Hollande convened special defence meetings at the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, at which France\u2019s new role in the conflict against Isis was one of the key questions. As three days of national mourning begin, a 76-year-old worker in the hotel business who was walking his dog near the Bataclan said: \u201cFrance is very bad at stopping these type of attacks.

The attack was financed and coordinated by Rachid Ramda, an Algerian with links to the Armed Islamic Group, a fundamentalist group that targeted France for its support of the regime in Algiers. 11 September 2001, US: On 11 September 2001, al-Qaida terrorists hijacked four passenger jets on the east coast of the US and deliberately flew two of them into the twin towers of the World Trade Center in Manhattan and another hit the Pentagon in Virginia.

These acts killed almost 3,000 people.  11 March 2004, Spain: A series of bombs exploded in a coordinated attack on four commuter trains in the Spanish capital, Madrid, which killed 192 people and wounded more than 1,800. An Islamist group with links to al-Qaida was blamed for the attack. Twenty-one people, mostly Moroccans, were convicted of involvement in the attack, which was the deadliest in Europe since Pan Am Flight 103 blew up over Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988.  2 November 2004, the Netherlands: Dutch filmmaker Theo Van Gogh, a strong critic of fundamentalist Islam, was shot, stabbed and slashed across the throat while cycling through Amsterdam. Dutch-Moroccan Muslim Mohammed Bouyeri was later sentenced to life imprisonment for the film-maker\u2019s murder, which a Dutch court ruled was a terrorist attack. 7 July 2005, UK: Four suicide bombers with explosives in rucksacks attacked tube trains and a bus in central London, killing 52 rush-hour commuters and injuring hundreds more. It was the worst single terrorist atrocity on British soil. The killers were later identified as British al-Qaida sympathisers Shehzad Tanweer, Hasib Hussain, Mohammed Sidique Khan and Jermaine Lindsay. March 2012, France: Mohamed Merah, who espoused radical Islam and said he had links to al-Qaida, killed three Jewish schoolchildren, a rabbi and three French paratroopers in a series of point-blank shootings in and around the southern town of Toulouse. Merah was shot dead after a standoff with police. 22 May 2013, UK: British-born Muslim converts Michael Adebolajo and Michael Adebowale murdered British soldier Lee Rigby in an al-Qaida-inspired terrorist attack outside Woolwich army barracks in south London. The pair ran over Rigby before they stabbed him and tried to hack off his head with a meat cleaver. They both claimed that they were \u201csoldiers of Allah\u201d and motivated by the plight of Muslims abroad to carry out the killing. 24 May 2014, Belgium: A gunman murdered four people in an attack at the Jewish Museum of Belgium in the centre of Brussels. Mehdi Nemmouche, a French national who had spent a year fighting with Islamists in Syria, was arrested and charged with the killings. The victims were two Israeli tourists, a French female volunteer and a Belgian employee of the museum. 22 October 2014, Canada: Michael Zehaf-Bibeau, a petty criminal, shot and fatally wounded a soldier at the National War Memorial in Ottawa. The gunman, who had recently applied for a passport and apparently claimed he wanted to travel to Libya, then stormed into Canada\u2019s parliament where he was shot dead. 15 December 2014, Australia: Police shot dead gunman Man Haron Monis, an Iranian-born immigrant who claimed to be a supporter of Islamic State, following a 17-hour siege at a Sydney cafe. Two hostages \u2013 a 34-year-old man and a 38-year-old woman \u2013 were also killed in the ensuing police raid. 7 January 2015, France: Masked gunmen shot dead 12 people at the Paris office of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. Four of the magazine\u2019s cartoonists, including its editor, were among those killed, as well as two police officers. Brothers Said and Ch\u00e9rif Kouachi, who had attended militant training camps in Yemen, were shot dead in a standoff with the gendarmerie near Charles de Gaulle airport.  9 January 2015, France: Gunman Amedy Coulibaly killed four people, including a policewoman, in a kosher supermarket in Paris and took others hostage. In a video released after his death, Coulibaly pledged allegiance to Islamic State and said he had coordinated his attack with the Kouachi brothers. 14 February 2015, Denmark: Omar el-Hussein killed two people and wounded five others in two attacks at a cultural centre and synagogue in Copenhagen. The gunman, a radicalised petty criminal, was killed by police in an exchange of fire after the worst attack on Danish soil for decades. 14 November 2015, Paris: A wave of coordinated gun attacks and suicide bombings killed at least 127 people and seriously wounded almost 100 at a series of venues across Paris. Eight assailants have been killed, seven of them in suicide bombings, a French prosecutor has said., but police are still hunting accomplices. The French president, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande, has blamed Islamic State for the massacre and a state of emergency has been declared across France.

In the first nine months of this year the number of people in the UK who reported that they had been defrauded on the website was 687, or at least two a day, double that of the whole of 2014, according to Action Fraud. This was more than five times higher than two years ago. Last week the company, which now lists properties in more than 190 countries, opened its doors to more than 5,000 of its property hosts at its annual conference in Paris, where the chief executive, Brian Chesky, described Airbnb in his keynote speech as \u201cmisunderstood\u201d.  Scams on the website take many forms, according to Action Fraud, the national fraud and internet crime reporting centre. These range from fake listings to \u201cphishing\u201d emails attempting to gain access to users\u2019 personal details. However, the most common involve fraudsters advertising properties for rent on Airbnb without the owner\u2019s knowledge, then convincing site users to transfer money straight into their bank accounts. Jane Jones, 43, lost nearly \u00a35,000 after booking a villa for 10 people for a two-week summer stay in Mallorca via the website. \u201cWe followed the advice on the site and contacted the \u2018host\u2019 by telephone and email on numerous occasions,\u201d she said. \u201cWe asked about the area, dates and price and were reassured as much as we could be that the property was genuine.\u201d She only began to worry when the \u201chost\u201d asked her to pay the \u00a34,552 cost upfront. \u201cBut we were advised by Airbnb to go ahead and pay in full, which gave us immense confidence that we were doing the right thing,\u201d she said. Jones received an invoice via email, which carried the Airbnb logo, saying she would receive confirmation of the booking within 48 hours and unwittingly paid the bill directly to the fraudsters. \u201cWe didn\u2019t get any confirmation, and found out from Airbnb a few days later there was no record of our payment. Citizens Advice tried to help us chase a refund after Airbnb washed its hands of the situation, but we got nowhere.\u201d Ian Bailey, 65, is another victim. He booked a \u00a3600, four-night stay in Bayswater, west London, on Airbnb for a friend and her two daughters. \u201cThey turned up at the apartment to find there was nobody there,\u201d he said. \u201cI went on to Airbnb as a new customer and had no idea about the safety issues involved. I found a place and contacted the host, who confirmed availability and told me to wait to hear from Airbnb. \u201cI wasn\u2019t suspicious when I got an email from Airbnb with the official logo advising me that the booking was confirmed and how to pay. \u201cAs much as being scammed, I\u2019m annoyed Airbnb didn\u2019t want to know. Since then it\u2019s been confirmed that the account I transferred money to has been emptied, so I couldn\u2019t reclaim anything.\u201d Jessica Adams, 27,also a first-time user, lost \u00a3670 when she booked two nights in Amsterdam in August. \u201cI logged into the Airbnb app and went straight to the search page, with no warning instructions on how to use the site.

At present the site is particularly vulnerable to abuse by fraudsters.\u201d Airbnb said the number of people falling victim to scams was small compared with the huge numbers using the site.

We musn\u2019t be afraid, we must all stand together to find a Churchill spirit. We\u2019re at the start of something. We mustn\u2019t give in. They won\u2019t win.\u201d   Related: Paris attacks: identities of victims from more than a dozen countries emerge    Pelloux, who wrote a column on the medical world for Charlie Hebdo, was one of the first at the scene of the massacre at the satirical weekly. He gave his colleagues emergency treatment as many of his friends lay dead, after two French gunmen opened fire with Kalashnikovs, killing 12 people.  Ten months later, on Friday night, Pelloux was in a Paris A&amp;E department treating some of those seriously injured in the latest series of coordinated attacks that left at least 129 people dead and hundreds injured.           Paris attacks: how events unfolded     \u201cIt\u2019s a war. We\u2019re at war,\u201d Pelloux said after working through the night on Friday. \u201cWe were treating war wounds made by war weapons, with bullets that go in very fast, that break and burn and send a very strong shockwave so it creates extremely serious injuries.  \u201cThe team tried to save a lot of people but there were terrible wounds. Most were aimed to kill, at the head, thorax, abdomen. Others were defensive wounds where people had put their hands up to their face. We tried to save a woman who had nine bullets in her body but she died upon her arrival at hospital.\u201d At the time of Friday\u2019s attacks, Pelloux had been promoting his new book, published the day before, in which he attempts to draw a line under the Charlie Hebdo attacks, commemorate his colleagues and bid farewell to a magazine he left amicably this autumn. He said he could no longer bear his colleagues\u2019 absence and that it was time for new talent to pick up the baton.   Related: Paris attacks:  Weapons linked to Islamic State assault found in getaway car \u2013 live updates    \u201cAs soon as I heard of Friday night\u2019s attacks, I rushed straight to A&amp;E,\u201d he said. \u201cThat morning, the emergency services in Paris had actually done a training exercise for a major terrorist attack. We were well prepared. But the type of the attack is significant. It is a methodical gunning down of everyone, a little like a video game.  Some of the attackers appeared to have been very young, he added. \u201cThe question that now has to be asked is why did these people who are so young take up arms and fight? \u201cThe fact that there was an attack at place where the French president was and then that gunmen mowed down people in the street is incredible. We\u2019ve moved into another phase. We\u2019re really in a war where they will stop at nothing.\u201d At the moment of the attack on Charlie Hebdo\u2019s weekly news meeting, Pelloux had been at another engagement in the building next door. A colleague who survived called him from beneath a table, and he rushed to the scene. \u201cIt was bizarre. As a doctor, the idea of having to save someone you love, give them emergency treatment, that\u2019s something you\u2019re really scared of. It\u2019s very complicated, difficult.\u201d   Related: Police question Paris attacker's family as investigation widens    He said he had intended his book to be a memorial to the people who died in the Charlie Hebdo attack because he felt that, as with Friday\u2019s massacre, it was important not to lose the sense of who each of the victims were who died.  \u201cWhen people talk of an attack like Friday\u2019s they\u2019ll say 129 dead. Behind that figure are 129 people, 129 families crying for their children, their friends, that means something. That is atrocious.

Molenbeek is the source of the highest concentration in Europe of jihadi foreign fighters going to fight in Syria and Iraq and returning battle-hardened and determined to take their fight to the capitals of Europe. It came as little surprise to locals therefore that a number of those alleged to be involved in Friday\u2019s Paris attack lived in the area.  It is a borough both down-at-heel, with large communities of Moroccan and Turkish origin, and thoroughly middle-class, with handsome bourgeois villas and green spaces. \u201cMolenbeek has always been a transit community,\u201d said Ahmed El Khannouss, the borough\u2019s deputy mayor. \u201cI know everyone thinks it\u2019s a base for radicals and terrorists, but a lot of that is stigmatisation.\u201d He pointed to the bustling Sunday morning market as evidence of the district\u2019s multicultural liveliness. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely dangerous to link these radicals with the local population.\u201d Molenbeek, nonetheless, occupies a unique place in European jihadism. Almost invariably when an Islamist atrocity takes place on the continent, attention turns to the district on the north-western fringes of Brussels\u2019 city centre. From the post 9/11 assassination in Afghanistan of Ahmad Shah Massoud, the anti-Taliban leader and the 2004 Madrid train bombings, to last year\u2019s killings at Brussels\u2019 Jewish museum and this summer\u2019s foiled shooting spree on a high-speed Amsterdam-Paris train, investigators\u2019 lines of inquiry lead to Molenbeek. \u201cAlmost every time there\u2019s a link with Molenbeek,\u201d the Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, said on Sunday. \u201cWe\u2019ve tried prevention. Now we\u2019ll have to get repressive. It\u2019s been a form of laisser faire and laxity. Now we\u2019re paying the bill.\u201d Seven people were arrested over the weekend in raids that including the deployment of bomb disposal units and army demining teams, according to the Belgian justice ministry. At least one of the cars used in the Paris attacks had Belgian plates, and a parking ticket found in the vehicle proved the driver had been in Molenbeek. The driver, a French national, was arrested in Molenbeek after returning to Belgium from Paris on Saturday, along with two other people. They were using a different vehicle from that seen at the site of the Bataclan concert hall massacre. Belgian prosecutors said another Belgian vehicle was involved, both of them rented last week. Belgian investigators were alarmed to learn that the French driver, allegedly based in Molenbeek, had a brother fighting with Islamic State in Syria, according to local media reports. The two streets where the weekend raids took place are anything but ghettoes or banlieues, home to restless and hostile throngs of Muslim youths. Both are neat and tidy lower middle-class concentrations of owner-occupied houses and decent apartments with their fair share of green spaces and handsome villas. There are at least 22 mosques in Molenbeek, but Khannouss admits that the hardline Salafist circles and recruiting sergeants for holy war have clandestine prayer sites and meeting points, usually in the front rooms of houses and apartments. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the networks,\u201d he said.  His boss, the Molenbeek mayor Fran\u00e7oise Schepmans, said that the seven people arrested seemed to suggest a network based in Brussels connected with the Paris attacks. As the investigations intensify \u2013 French detectives were in Brussels on Sunday \u2013 the Molenbeek connections seem to thicken, although several of those said to be involved in various jihadi plots and foreign fighter networks appear to be non-Belgian nationals using the borough as a base. \u201cI need to examine why this borough remains a problem,\u201d Belguim\u2019s interior minister, Jan Jambon, said. \u201cBut one thing\u2019s for sure. We just can\u2019t accept this situation any longer.\u201d The sense of alarm was made worse by information that at least one of the dead Paris assailants was a Brussels resident. US intelligence officials in Washington, citing information from the French authorities, told the LA Timesthey suspected the Paris plot was hatched in Brussels. For the time being, much of the evidence linking Molenbeek to Paris remains sketchy and circumstantial, but the district\u2019s foreign fighters\u2019 syndrome is more substantive and telling. The Belgian authorities have previously claimed that as many as 800 Belgians were fighting as jihadi in the Middle East, a figure viewed by experts as improbably high for a country of 11 million, including more than 600,000 Muslims. Belgium\u2019s police chief, Catherine De Bolle, told Flemish television on Sunday that 130 foreign fighters had returned to the country from Syria. There were 474 Belgians linked to the war in Syria, 200 of them still there, she said. According to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation, Belgium supplies around 40 foreign fighters for every million inhabitants, a figure twice that of France, four times that of Britain and by far the highest concentration in Europe. The Flemish researcher and expert on Belgian jihadism, Pieter Van Ostaeyen, said that in October there were about 190 Belgian fighters in Syria, mainly with Isis, including 47 women, and that another 120 had come back from the war. \u201cThis number means that of Belgium\u2019s Muslim population of about 640,000, there is roughly one per 1,260 involved in jihad in Syria and Iraq. At this point, Belgium is, per capita, by far the European nation contributing the most to the foreign element in the Syrian war.\u201d Of the 190 in Syria, 101 were from Brussels, he calculated. Molenbeek would have supplied a significant number of them. A trial of three men said to be major recruiters of young people for the Syrian conflict opened last week. The biggest jihadism trial to date in Belgium, that of people involved in the Sharia4Belgium organisation, which ended in February, laid bare an effective and sophisticated recruiting programme highly active in Molenbeek. Van Ostaeyen has highlighted an Isis internet warning to France dating back to February in which the two young jihadis conveying the message are identified as Belgians. \u201cThis is a message to France and Belgium, to those who speak French,\u201d they announced in the video. \u201cWe will come and cut off your heads. Car bombs from Paris to Brussels are no problem.\u201d Jambon, a rightwinger from the nationalist NVA Flemish party, pledged at the weekend to clean up Molenbeek and blamed the failures on bureaucracy and the complexities of Belgium\u2019s overlapping decentralised structures. \u201cWe don\u2019t have things under control in Molenbeek,\u201d he said.", "sentences": ["From the post 9/11 assassination in Afghanistan of Ahmad Shah Massoud, the anti-Taliban leader and the 2004 Madrid train bombings, to last year\u2019s killings at Brussels\u2019 Jewish museum and this summer\u2019s foiled shooting spree on a high-speed Amsterdam-Paris train, investigators\u2019 lines of inquiry lead to Molenbeek."], "title": "Molenbeek: the Brussels borough becoming known as Europe's jihadi central", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/15/molenbeek-the-brussels-borough-in-the-spotlight-after-paris-attacks", "tags": ["Paris attacks", "Belgium", "Europe", "France", "Paris", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-11-16T07:00:03Z", "article": "Glasgow\u2019s historic centre has been ringed for decades by motorways which carve through the city. But now they could be slowly reclaimed for residents, with plans to span one with an urban park and decorate a second with a \u201cworld class\u201d skate park. Plans are now underway to roof over the gulley for the M8 which slices past the Mitchell library and Garnethill, and only a short distance to the south create an urban sports and skate park between the legs of the new M74 extension.  The M8 proposal, one of 80 projects being studied for a wholesale rejuvenation of the Sauchiehall and Garnethill area, would see a section of the motorway covered in a tunnel with a public garden built on top - a move that a draft document by Glasgow city council said would reduce traffic noise and improve air quality. If constructed, the new garden park would radically transform the appearance of an area of the city currently dominated by the M8 and its sliproads.  Opened in 1972, the section of motorway, which connects the city with Edinburgh, was originally intended to be part of a ring road system linking districts of the city for traffic. But the project was never completed, and today the area is widely seen as an eyesore. The proposals also call for the redesign of Sauchiehall Street, one of Glasgow\u2019s main shopping and nightlife hubs, as a tree-lined avenue with enlarged pavements and dedicated cycle lanes.      Glasgow planners propose increasing pavement space and trees along the city\u2019s famous Sauchiehall Street, as they green the city centre. Photograph: Glasgow city council    Other suggested improvements in the area include road closures, a new pedestrian and cycle bridge at Charing Cross and the the creation of a new green space in front of the grade-A listed Mitchell library. Glasgow council leader Frank McAveety said the plans, if enacted, would see the city create one of the world\u2019s most contemporary urban centres.  This radical plan outlines an exciting new vision for the Sauchiehall and Garnethill district and a taste of what the city centre could look like in the future, setting the benchmark for modern, vibrant cities across Europe. These proposals will lead to improved public spaces and a better connected centre of Glasgow, fully able to capitalise on its unique assets and diversity.  The plans would be subject to a public consultation, he added. The draft document outlining the regeneration proposals cites cities such as New York, Amsterdam, Copenhagen and San Francisco as influences. And while the suggestion of creating a new park above a motorway is ambitious, there are similar projects in cities around the world. In New York, the community-led High Line project has transformed an elevated stretch of disused freight railway into a park and arts venue. The German city of Hamburg is in the process of enclosing a 3.5km (2.17 mile) stretch of autobahn in a tunnel with parkland and housing to be built on top.  And in London, a proposed development would see a new bridge built across the Thames to play host to a wooded garden - althought the project has been widely criticised, with Labour mayoral candidate Sadiq Khan pledging to scrap it if elected in 2016. Motorway skatepark While the council\u2019s plans focus on the area of central Glasgow around the M8, another project seeks to reclaim an area of land under another of the city\u2019s motorways. Local group Glasgow Urban Sports (GUS) plans to transform vacant space under the M74 on the city\u2019s south side to create a facility for skateboarding, free-running and BMX, with a public park at Port Eglinton.      Glasgow Urban Sports wants to create a new skatepark, free running and BMX site under the canopy of the M74 flyover south of the Clyde.    Neil Davidson, a skateboarder and photographer who co-founded the GUS group, said the proposed \u201csports sculpture park\u201d would meet the demand for a world-class skate park in the city.   At the moment you have one skate park at Kelvingrove in the west end, but that\u2019s quite a small park, and it\u2019s massively oversubscribed. If you look at what Perth, Edinburgh, Aberdeen or Dundee have, Glasgow is lagging behind. They have really high-quality, big outdoor public skate parks. Kelvingrove isn\u2019t really of the same size or quality. Urban sports like rollerblading and skateboarding can fall between the cracks, because sometimes people don\u2019t see them as sports. But we\u2019ve had good conversations with Glasgow city council and I think that they see the need for this facility.  He added that the space would be ideally suited for use as a skate park.   The construction of the M74 meant that there was a lot of bulldozed, derelict space. But for our purposes the motorway flyover provides a canopy that protects against the elements. People will be able to use this facility 365 days per year, pretty much regardless of the weather. The rough budget for the project is between \u00a31m and \u00a32m, which does sound like a lot. But once you build a skate park, your maintenance budget is basically zero.

Related: Paris terror attacks: Abdelhamid Abaaoud 'identified as alleged mastermind' \u2013 live    As details emerged of an elaborate international terror operation run from Syria and carried out by a sleeper cell based in Belgium, officials told French media that Abaaoud, seen as one of Islamic State\u2019s most active operatives, was \u201cinvestigators\u2019 best bet\u201d as the main organiser of the attacks, which killed 129 people on Friday. Abaaoud has spent time in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek, a hotbed of Islamic extremism and home to several members of the militant cell that carried out Friday\u2019s attacks on the Stade de France, the Bataclan concert hall and a string of crowded bars and restaurants. He is suspected of involvement in a narrowly averted attack on a Thalys high-speed Amsterdam-Brussels train in August. He is also said to have carried out several armed robberies with one of the men alleged to have been involved in the attacks, the worst in France since the second world war. A French jihadi arrested last summer after returning from Syria reportedly told police that Abaaoud had instructed him to attack a concert hall.  The development came as the French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said police had searched 168 addresses in dawn raids across France, taking 23 people into custody and placing 104 more under house arrest. \u201cIt\u2019s just a start, these operations are going to continue,\u201d Cazeneuve said. \u201cThe response of the Republic will be huge and total. He who targets the Republic will find the Republic will catch him, will be implacable.\u201d    Related: Suspected Paris attacks mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud \u2013 what we know    Prosecutors said five of the seven suicide bombers who died on Friday had now been identified. Four were French, and the fifth possibly Syrian. One of three attackers who blew themselves up at the Bataclan, where 89 people died, was identified on Monday as Samy Amimour, 28, from the Paris suburb of Drancy, who was the subject of an international arrest warrant. Another, who detonated his explosive vest outside the Stade de France stadium, was carrying a Syrian passport in the name of Ahmad Almohammad, aged 25, from Idlib. His fingerprints matched those of someone who transited the Greek island of Leros in October, prosecutors said, claiming asylum in Serbia four days later. Omar Isma\u00efl Mostefai, 29, from Chartres, south-west of Paris, was the first killer to be officially identified, from a severed finger found inside the Bataclan. Sources close to the investigation named two other French assailants as Bilal Hadfi and Brahim Abdeslam.  French media said all the attackers so far identified were known to have spent time in Syria. The latest official figures estimate that 520 French nationals are currently in the Syrian and Iraqi war zones, including 116 women. About 137 have died there, some 250 have returned home, and around 700 are suspected of having plans to join Islamic State.  As a shocked nation returned to work after the attacks, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande joined a crowd of students from the Sorbonne university in Paris at midday for a sombre minute of silence observed by thousands at similar gatherings around the country.  Much of the country came to halt, metro trains in Paris stopped, and large crowds gathered in central Paris, including at the Place de la R\u00e9publique close to where several of the shootings took place. Schoolchildren and office workers paused to stand at their desks, while MPs sang the national anthem La Marseillaise. Paris hospitals reported that they had treated 415 people who were injured or traumatised by the assaults, Europe\u2019s deadliest since the 2004 Madrid train bombings. More than 40 remained in a critical condition.           A minute\u2019s silence is observed across Paris and the rest of the world.    Hollande, who called the attacks \u201can act of war\u201d that must be countered \u201cmercilessly\u201d, is due to make a historic address at Versailles to the combined houses of the French parliament later on Monday. The raids were mostly described as \u201cpreventative\u201d anti-terroroperations under the nationwide state of emergency declared in France since the attacks. In Lyon, police seized a \u201cwar arsenal\u201d of weapons including a rocket launcher, pistols and a Kalashnikov. Further raids took place in Toulouse, Grenoble, Jeumont \u2013 near the border with Belgium \u2013 Strasbourg, Marseille and the Lille suburb of Roubaix, as well as in the north-east Paris suburb of Bobigny \u2013 the only operation \u201cdirectly linked\u201d to Friday\u2019s attacks, police said.  The prime minister, Manuel Valls, said there was a real risk of more terror attacks to come. \u201cWe know that operations were being prepared, and are still being prepared, not only against France but other European countries too,\u201d Valls said. \u201cFrance will live with the threat of new attacks for a long time to come.\u201d The raids followed France\u2019s biggest airstrike on Syria to date on Sunday night, targeting Isis\u2019s de facto capital, Raqqa, after the group\u2019s claim of responsibility for the Paris carnage in retaliation for earlier French attacks on its forces in Syria and Iraq. Islamic State warned in a video on Monday that any country that struck at its forces would suffer the same fate as France, promising specifically to target Washington. Twelve French warplanes including 10 fighter jets were launched from the United Arab Emirates and Jordan and 20 bombs dropped on a command centre, a recruitment centre for jihadis, a munitions depot, and a training camp for fighters, the defence ministry said. Activists in Raqqa said the strikes did appear to have killed any civilians. Cazeneuve said the strikes were a direct retaliation for the Paris attacks, which he said were organised from within Syria aided by a cell in Belgium. \u201cWe are facing a new reality, one of acts of war organised by barbarians from inside Syria,\u201d Cazeneuve said.   Related: Paris attack suspects: what do we know about them?    Amid mounting claims of intelligence failings in France and Belgium, a senior Turkish official said authorities had twice flagged Mostefai to their French counterparts, but were only asked for information about him after the Paris attacks. Mostefai was first named as a possible \u201cterror suspect\u201d in October 2014, the official said. It emerged on Sunday that Iraqi intelligence, too, had warned French intelligence agencies the day before the Paris onslaught of imminent \u201cbombings or assassinations or hostage-taking in the coming days\u201d.  French security officials said such warnings were frequent, but Iraqi intelligence operatives said they had warned France of specific details, including that the attackers were trained for this operation and had been sent from Raqqa to France, where they were to meet a sleeper cell to help carry out the plan.     The French police wanted notice for Salah Abdeslam. Photograph: DSK/AFP/Getty Images    The investigation into the Paris attacks quickly led to Belgium after police discovered that two cars used by the militants had been rented in the Brussels area. A massive manhunt is continuing for Salah Abdeslam, a 26-year-old Frenchman based in the Belgian capital.  Abdeslam, who rented a Volkswagen Polo parked outside the Bataclan where 89 people died, was pulled up alongside two other men for a routine check near the French-Belgian border hours after the attacks. But the men were released because none of their names were on wanted list. Salah\u2019s brother Brahim Abdeslam, 31, blew himself up outside the concert hall. A third Abdeslam brother, Mohamed, was one of five suspects arrested in Molenbeek over the weekend who have now been released without charge.  Two others detained in raids have been changed with being part of a terror group and links to a terror attack, the Belgian federal prosecutor\u2019s office said.           Paris attacks: how events unfolded     The revelation that one of the attackers may have entered Europe with refugees through Greece triggered renewed arguments within the EU on how to handle the hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrant, with Polish and Slovak officials demanding an end to a plan to relocate asylum seekers across the bloc. France urged its European partners to move swiftly to improve intelligence sharing, fight arms trafficking and terror financing, and strengthen border security as a result of the attacks. \u201cClearly, decisions must be taken,\u201d the secretary of state for European affairs, Harlem D\u00e9sir, said ahead of talks with European Union foreign ministers. \u201cFrance was attacked, but all of Europe was hit.

Page one had a dedication to al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden. It was the first jihad manual ever found in Europe. The GIA was only one of many terrorist organisations to put down roots in Belgium. Over the past few decades the country has turned out to be a platform for Action Directe, the Red Army Faction, Eta, the IRA and several other terrorist groups. The importance of Belgium for global terrorism became even clearer on 9 September 2001. Two days before the attacks on the Twin Towers, in northern Afghanistan, commander Ahmed Shah Massoud \u2013 the last man standing against the Taliban \u2013 was killed by two terrorists who had entered Afghanistan with Belgian passports. Other recent terrorist events can be traced back to the Belgian capital. Mehdi Nemmouche, who in May 2014 killed four people in the Jewish Museum in Brussels, had been staying in the suburb of Molenbeek. Early in 2015 in the Belgian town of Verviers the Belgian police dismantled a terrorist group with links to Molenbeek. Ayoub el-Khazzani, who in August 2015 was planning to attack the Thalys train service from Amsterdam to Paris, got on the train in Brussels after staying in Molenbeek.     Abdelhamid Abaaoud \u2013 reportedly one of Islamic State\u2019s most active operators and suspected of being behind Friday\u2019s attacks in Paris \u2013 is from the Molenbeek suburb of Brussels. Photograph: Reuters    The reasons why Belgium is attractive to terrorists are diverse. First there is its strategic location between France, Germany and the UK. In two hours one can cross Belgium by car, and because Belgium is part of the Schengen area its outside borders are open, making it extremely easy for terrorists to enter and leave the country quickly. Second, the anonymity of Belgium\u2019s capital appears to offer an ideal hiding place, with some sympathisers for the terrorist struggle \u2013 individuals, not communities \u2013 willing to give a helping hand to plotters. The fact that the name of Molenbeek turns up so often is obviously worrying. Molenbeek \u2013 one of Brussels\u2019 19 districts\u2013 has a population of about 100,000, with around 30% of foreign nationality and more than 40% with foreign roots. Unemployment is higher than 25%, with youth unemployment even higher. Young inhabitants, often with Muslim backgrounds, do not get the same chances in the labour or housing market, and testify how in their everyday lives they are confronted with racism. They have the perfect profile to be prone to radicalisation. If the Belgian state had put more effort into integrating migrant communities, the potential for radicalisation would be significantly smaller today. Third, the Islamic experience in Belgium has characteristics that differ from other European countries. There is a lack of local imams; most of the imams have been imported from abroad or educated there. Belgian security services point to an important religious influence from Wahhabi Islam, \u201csponsored\u201d by Saudi Arabia through the Grand Mosque in Brussels.    The disregard of the Belgian political world for intelligence have allowed terrorist groups to proliferate    Fourth, Brussels has the reputation for being a place where you can easily buy illegal firearms. The fact that the city has no fewer than six different police zones makes the fight against illegal arms trafficking and other forms of organised crime cumbersome and inefficient. Last, Belgium has a relatively small security apparatus. Although Brussels is the diplomatic capital of the world, Belgian state security only has some 600 employees (the exact figure is classified information). Its military counterpart, Adiv, has a similar number. That makes just over a thousand intelligence officers to secure a country that hosts not only Nato and the EU institutions but also the World Customs Organisation, the European Economic Area, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (Swift), the European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation (Eurocontrol), another 2,500 international agencies, 2,000 international companies and 150 international law firms. One does not need to be 007 to understand that the security challenge is huge \u2013 not only taking into account terrorism but also espionage and cybercrime. The disregard of the Belgian political world for intelligence and the lack of an intelligence culture have allowed terrorist groups to proliferate.   Related: I was held hostage by Isis. They fear our unity more than our airstrikes | Nicolas H\u00e9nin    More than 250 Belgians have left the country to fight alongside jihadis in Syria and Iraq; about 75 have died in combat and 125 have returned. According to the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence, Belgium has the highest rate of foreign fighters per capita of all Europe. Belgium\u2019s anti-terrorism organisation Ocad has a \u201cconsolidated list\u201d of more than 800 people who are on the radar of the Belgian intelligence services in relation to foreign terrorist fighters. Yesterday, two well-informed sources within the Belgian security services independently confirmed to me that two of the Abdeslam brothers currently being investigated in relation to the Paris attacks and Bilal Hadfi, the suicide bomber at the Stade de France, were on that list. The question is why this information could not prevent the attacks in Paris.

But the organisers of what is the final attraction at the London museum\u2019s Thames-side base before it moves to bigger premises in west London, stress that the exhibition, called Cycle Revolution, is about the bicycle in all its forms.

The gang was kitted out with bogus paramedic uniforms and might even have used fake patients to make their cover more authentic, Birmingham crown court was told. Two Dutchmen, Leonardus Bijlsma and Dennis Vogelaar, were allegedly part of a lucrative criminal conspiracy to bring huge hauls of drugs into the country under the noses of British police, it is claimed. The jury was told the smuggling operation may have seen up to \u00a3420m in \u201ctop-quality\u201d class-A drugs reach the UK, via the Channel\u2019s ferry ports. When the high-purity drug packets were cut down to individual street-value wraps, the total cash value could increase four-fold, reaching a staggering amount, said prosecutor Robert Davies. He added: \u201cThe prosecution suggest this was a top-level, audacious, and \u2013 up to the point of interception and the arrests \u2013 a successful and lucrative criminal conspiracy.\u201d Davies said the conspiracy was uncovered when officers of the National Crime Agency (NCA) swooped on one of the ambulances after tracking it to Smethwick in the West Midlands on 16 June. When police arrived they arrested Bijlsma, described in court by Davies as the \u201crighthand man\u201d in the organisation and the \u201cambulance\u201d driver Vogelaar. The men were equipped with bogus paramedic uniforms and a letter purporting to be from a Dutch patient being taken to a London hospital for treatment. Investigations revealed that the ambulance was \u201crammed\u201d to the roof with more than \u00a338m of cocaine and heroin. Inside the back of the ambulance, concealed behind metal-riveted panels in six \u201chides\u201d, were neatly stacked, colour-coded packets of class-A drugs including cocaine with a street value of more than \u00a330m and heroin worth \u00a38m. Officers also found 60,000 ecstasy tablets. When the NCA officers swooped in Smethwick, two other men \u2013 Olof Schoon, 38, and Richard Engelsbel, 51 \u2013 were also detained, jurors heard. Davies explained that they did not appear in the dock alongside Bijlsma and Vogelaar, both from Amsterdam because they had already admitted conspiracy to import class-A drugs. Schoon, who was a director of the Dutch-based Schoon Ambulance Company, was described by prosecutors as \u201cthe central player\u201d. Davies, opening the case for the crown, said the ambulance tracked to Smethwick contained \u201can absolutely enormous amount of class-A drugs\u201d. He added: \u201cIn truth, the ambulance was rammed with drugs.\u201d The prosecutor told the jury that further study of company records revealed that the fake ambulance journeys had been \u201cgoing on over weeks and months\u201d. In the Netherlands, investigators discovered \u201ca fleet of ambulances\u201d being run by Schoon\u2019s company, ostensibly transferring patients to and from the UK. But Davies described the firm and its operations as nothing more than \u201ca veneer\u201d for the smuggling operation. \u201cFour [ambulances] had hiding places of a similar type,\u201d he added. \u201cBetween the vehicles, at least 45 trips can be shown to have been made in 14 months, with the final trip in June.\u201d Bijlsma, 55, and Vogelaar, 28, are charged with conspiracy to smuggle. They deny the offence. In police interviews, they told officers they had no knowledge of the drug-smuggling operation with Bijlsma stating he had travelled abroad to look at a car. Vogelaar said that he had believed his driving job to be genuine. However, the prosecutor told jurors they would be studying \u201chighly incriminating\u201d evidence implicating both men, including a rivet gun found with Bijlsma\u2019s DNA on it, which it is claimed was used to fasten the false panels inside the ambulance. The prosecution likened Vogelaar, who was shown on CCTV played in court wearing a paramedic\u2019s uniform, to the 70\u2019s cartoon character Mr Benn, whose adventures always began with him visiting a fancy-dress shop and choosing a uniform or outfit. \u201cThe organised crime group running this operation would not have risked an innocent stooge aboard one of its ambulances,\u201d added Davies.

We wanted to take photos of the London skyline from the top and had failed to ascend previously, deterred by clever camera placement and an on-top security patrol. On this night, however, construction had been briefly halted by a terrible incident where a helicopter crashed into the construction crane while attempting to land amid thick early-morning fog. The aftermath of the crash created a window of opportunity that we were exploiting. Sneaking around the perimeter and into the building was as straightforward as we had hoped, and we sprang up the 50-storey stairwell. On the roof, we quickly deployed tripods and started shooting photos \u2013 but then someone made an offhand comment that there seemed to be a lot of sirens in Vauxhall that night. Seemingly all at once, those sirens went silent. Peering over the edge of the building, I spied eight police cars, a riot van and a lot of commotion at the front gate of the site. We were busted.      \u2018Assuming that space becomes unsafe at night is a self-fulfilling prophecy.\u2019 Photograph: Bradley L Garrett    We enjoy trespassing but we take wasting police time seriously. We ran back down the stairs and emerged with hands up, quickly explaining that we were photographers. The officer in charge seemed more amused than bemused and asked to see the photos. After briefly clicking through them on the viewfinder and complimenting a few, he told the security guards that we would delete our photos and go home, no harm done.    The wilful violation of curfews, such as in Tahrir Square in 2011, can be a powerful political statement    However, a rotund colleague of his in a flack jacket was in a less forgiving mood. He snarled at us, \u201cWhat\u2019s wrong with you lot, out here causing trouble, there\u2019s a bar right there you can go to.\u201d He pointed across the street where a girl in a white dress was hitting her boyfriend with a handbag whilst he vomited on the pavement. I was nonplussed.  Throughout history, the night has been, in the words of geographer Tim Edensor, time for \u201ctransgression, fantasy and experimentation\u201d, when the public comes out to play. However rights to the night have long been contested. Public rights to cities have been curtailed at night in three ways: by closing cities entirely after a certain time (through curfews), by closing public places after a particular time (as with UK public parks), or by prohibiting certain activities after a certain time (as in lockout laws). In my last Guardian Cities piece, I considered Public Space Protection Orders (PSPOs) being rolled out across England and Wales that criminalise normally non-criminal behaviour within a predefined spatial area. Here I shift from the spatial to the temporal, to think about how rights to public space change after the sun sets. After the eruption of violence following the death of Freddie Gray in police custody in 2015, the city of Baltimore enacted a blanket curfew that prohibited all citizens from going outdoors unless travelling to or from work. This curfew, and another that applied only to youths, was lifted earlier this year, partially due to pressure from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), who stated that \u201ccurfews \u2026 wreak havoc with one of our most fundamental constitutional rights \u2013 the right to freedom of movement.\u201d Further, the ACLU argued that curfews \u201ccriminalise normal and otherwise lawful behaviour\u201d.      In 2015, the city of Baltimore enacted a blanket curfew that prohibited all citizens from going outdoors unless travelling to or from work in the aftermath of Freddie Gray\u2019s death. Photograph: Kenneth K Lam/Zuma Press/Corbis    Those that read the PSPOs piece will appreciate the overlaps. Curfews, by closing access to space, prevent us from staking a political claim in the public realm after dark. The wilful violation of curfews, such as in Tahrir Square in 2011, when protesters ignored a curfew imposed by Hosni Mubarak, can be a powerful political statement. As A Roger Ekirch writes in his 2005 book At Day\u2019s Close: Night in Times Past, as early as 1068, William the Conqueror set a curfew (from the French couvre-feu or cover fire) at 8pm, which was widely adopted across medieval Europe. Though this was ostensibly imposed to prevent fires from catching while people slept, those who will have read William I \u2013 1066 by Eleanor Farjeon in school will recall that it was more likely about preventing candlelit late-night public plotting. People found not in their homes after the curfew were subject to incarceration, with particular ire levelled at those found outdoors in public squares and on roads.     Curfews wreak havoc with one of our most fundamental constitutional rights \u2013 the right to freedom of movement  American Civil Liberties Union     Current law describes a curfew as \u201ca regulation that forbids people (or certain classes of them) from being outdoors between certain hours\u201d. Curfews, like ABSOs and PSPOs, are often directed at particular groups to prohibit them from being in public places after a particular time. In the United States, where the first Curfew law was passed in Nebraska in 1880, youth are circumscribed with particular vigilance. As of 2009, at least 500 US cities had curfews prohibiting anyone under 18 from being on the streets at night. Around 100 cities also have daytime curfews to keep children off the streets during school hours, making the hours when youths actually have a right to be in public space extremely narrow.  During the second world war, all people of Japanese ancestry in the United States, regardless of resident status, were forced to stay home between the hours of 8pm and 6am. In 1942, a 32-year-old student named Gordon Hirabayashi walked the streets of Seattle after curfew until he was arrested. He then brought a constitutional challenge to the law. His challenge was rejected, but in 1986 a federal court in Seattle overturned Hirabayashi\u2019s conviction as a form of public apology. As urbanist Rowland Atkinson writes, \u201cplaces at different times may change in their role for accommodating different social groups \u2013 for example, a city square may serve as a place for lunching office workers while providing a place for skateboarders or potential muggers as the day progresses.\u201d  Assuming that space becomes unsafe at night, however, is a self-fulfilling prophecy. If the night is a place where we think only violence happens, then people go into the night expecting that and make it manifest. However, if night-time is when people of diverse backgrounds and motivations gather, the night becomes safer, a space monitored by the \u201ceyes upon the street\u201d in the words of Jane Jacobs. Jacobs wrote in The Death and Life of Great American Cities that in order for a street to be a safe place, \u201cthere must be eyes upon the street, eyes belonging to those we might call the natural proprietors of the street.\u201d     Amsterdam ... a famously 24-hour city where we can locate \u2018freedom from both labour and social scrutiny\u2019. Photograph: Glen Allison/Getty Images    Consider Amsterdam, a famously 24-hour city, where at any time of the night people can be found in Dam Square and Vondlepark playing games, drinking, smoking pot, taking photos and meandering in the spirit of the French fl\u00e2neur. For many people, the night is not a time when the city becomes unsafe but rather, as Ekirch writes, where we can locate \u201cfreedom from both labour and social scrutiny\u201d.    The government recently legalised public sex in Vondelpark, as long as people 'take their garbage with them afterwards'    For a few years, I lived in the Manor House warehouses in north London. Often, late at night, I would find myself stranded by public transport at Finsbury Park Station and walk through the park to get home only to find that the gates on the north side were locked. Inevitably, next to the locked gate, the wooden fence panels would have been kicked out by a frustrated walker. This \u201cantisocial\u201d behaviour was triggered not by the bad character of the nocturnal wanderer but by the locking of the gate. Despite the park closing at dusk, it was constantly full of chancers: rough sleepers, cruisers, drug addicts and urban explorers opening manholes, all trying to avoid detection by lurking in the shadows. On more than one occasion, I saw park security chasing groups of kids to the fence line where they all jumped into the street whooping and hollering. If the park were open at night, these chase scenes would not need unfold.   Britain has a long history of closing access to public space at night, including most Royal Parks. In contrast, in Amsterdam\u2019s Vondelpark, the government recently legalised public sex in the park, as long as people \u201ctake their garbage with them afterwards and never have intercourse near the playground.\u201d Also, \u201cthe sex must be limited to the evening hours and night\u201d, as a council spokesperson apologetically explained. Freedom from social scrutiny indeed.  Perhaps it is due to the lack of vibrant night-time social spaces outdoors that the English are quick to defend the pub as a place for nocturnal debate and debauchery. When we think about the public realm, we often cleave a clear line at the door to private business \u2013 yet the role of the pub as a \u201cpublic house\u201d has long been as a place where communities come together to trade, mingle, play games, make deals, let loose, argue and, of course, get intoxicated. In the words of sociologist Richard Sennett, \u201cthe public realm can be simply defined as a place where strangers meet.\u201d      Sydney\u2019s lockout laws are designed to curb violence in the Kings Cross area by forcing premises to prohibit entry after 1:30am. Photograph: Bradley L Garrett    A significant body of scholarship about the value of the \u201cnight-time economy\u201d of pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, strip clubs, brothels, bouncers, baristas and bands, has emerged in the past 20 years. However, these spaces are also under attack through the passing of laws that prohibit certain activities after a certain time, even behind the closed doors of private enterprise. By way of example, I was recently in Sydney, Australia, where I was invited to a rolling street party protest over Sydney\u2019s \u201clockout laws\u201d. These lockout laws, like PSPOs, are geographically demarcated and are meant to curb violence in the Kings Cross area, Sydney\u2019s traditional red-light district, by forcing premises to prohibit entry to venues after 1:30am.    Only totalitarian cities can be frictionless \u2013 and under those cities, far more violent discontent simmers    The lockout laws were brought into force February 2014 in reaction to two 18-year-olds being killed by \u201cking hits\u201d (sucker punches) in night-time brawls. At first blush, it appears to have succeeded in decreasing violence. A New South Wales (NSW) Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research report suggests that assaults in Kings Cross have decreased by 26% in the CBD since 2014. However, it is not clear whether that success is because there is less violence or simply because the streets are empty. Research statistics suggest that the latter may be the case \u2013 since the lockout laws came into effect, foot traffic in the area has dropped by 84%, profits at cordoned bars have decreased 40%, and over 40 venues have closed. Additionally, a hotspot map released in April 2015 by the Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research makes clear that at least some of the violence has simply migrated to other areas, such as the Star Casino in Pyrmont, where assaults have doubled over the same time period. Not that the executives from the Star Casino are complaining; they have made over $100 million in extra profit in the 2013/14 financial year from the flood of woozy late-night revellers fleeing the lockout zone.  The protest, prompted by Reclaim the Streets, was described as \u201ca celebration of what our public life could be\u201d. It was a hot afternoon as the 1,000-person procession trundled from Sydney\u2019s Hyde Park to Kings Cross, temporarily pedestrianising the streets in between. Multiple ambulatory sound systems, one rolling atop two shopping trolleys lashed with cable ties, pounded bass through a canyon of skyscrapers. The procession was sluggish; sweaty dancers clogged the tarmac, more than one sound system wheel snapped, audio cords were accidentally ripped out, patch-ups took place on the move. From above, people yelled encouragement from high-rise apartments, often waving bottles of booze. On the pavement, corner shops cashed in as protesters stopped for supplies along the route. The police seemed relatively relaxed about the whole affair, one even eating a fast-melting popsicle and scrolling through his phone feed as we rattled past.      Private property ... with no public access after dark. Photograph: Bradley L Garrett    Whether or not this protest will influence any decisions made by the council remains to be seen; however, the protesters did manage to create public space for a day where strangers met. The protest, to be fair, was a mess, but then attempts to make cities safer also sedates urban space, clearing it of the some of the messiness that makes urban life alluring precisely because it encourages us to negotiate space. Where there is exchange, where strangers meet and where ideas are debated, conflicts will arise. The notion that conflict between strangers in cities can be legislated away through curfews, closures and lockouts is naive at best and undemocratic at worst \u2013 only totalitarian cities can be frictionless and under those cities, far more violent discontent simmers. In the words of Will Wiles, \u201cthe city needs places of solace, calm, order and beauty \u2013 even prettiness. But prettiness and concealment are anaesthetic. The urban mind needs its regular confrontations with tangle, too, a bracing shock that places the world in perspective and informs us, without either warmth or rancour \u2026\u201d    Related: PSPOs: the new control orders threatening our public spaces    Part of the allure of cities is their messiness. While it is desirable to have parts of our cities be efficient, convenient and secure, many of us also move to or stay in cities to get gritty, to participate in (rather than spectate on) planning and development, to have our senses overloaded, to work through our frustrations and to escape. These things often happen in the night. The neoliberal tendency to curb routine public freedoms in the name of security after dusk is flawed; it is a simple exchange of one kind of violence for another. A more empathetic response to urban violence might be to consider giving people additional venues to air their grievances and debate appropriate remedies, which would undoubtedly result in the proposal of more nuanced solutions. Or, following the Amsterdam model, open the space up even further so that the night becomes a place of diverse coordination. Like prohibition in 1920s America, the most likely outcome of oppressive night laws is simply that violence moves horizontally into other spaces or underground \u2013 sometimes literally \u2013 into less surveilled zones. David Leyonhjelm, a Liberal Democrat senator in NSW, referred to the Sydney lockout laws as a \u201ccollective punishment\u201d based on a few isolated, if horrific, anecdotes; a case of \u201cusing an axe when a scalpel would do\u201d. Before we begin cutting into the city, surgically or otherwise, we must disavow ourselves of the notion that cities will ever be frictionless, because frictionless cities would be dead cities. This is precisely what the dance party protesters tried to make clear through their unapologetically messy \u201ccelebration of what our public life could be\u201d. Perhaps if we take the lead from the Netherlands, and begin making more diverse use of public space at night rather than continuing to govern it in the spirit of the suspicions of William the Conqueror, we can both expand our rights to the city at night, and make our night-time cities safer by making night space participatory rather than exclusionary.

Research conducted by Habitat for Humanity, a non-profit NGO dedicated to promoting affordable housing around the world, found that the 2008 housing crisis triggered by the global financial crash is by no means over in Europe.  Experts warn that continuing problems, such as exploding costs and the numbers of young adults forced to live at home, are likely to have a major economic and social impact across the region. According to the report, released on Thursday:  More than 10% of Europeans shoulder housing costs \u2013 including rent and heating \u2013 in excess of half their household\u2019s income. In central and eastern Europe, households spend between 30 and 50% of their income solely on winter heating, and rising household costs are contributing to poverty levels and raising the likelihood of people losing their homes. The numbers of young adults aged between 18 and 34 who are living with their parents is now at an all-time high. The situation is worst in Slovenia, where 74% still live at home, in Italy it\u2019s 66% and in Portugal it\u2019s 55%. Construction of new homes has plummeted by between 70 and 90% in recent years, and the amount of social housing does not even cover 10% of people\u2019s needs.  The study\u2019s authors also stress the rise of a \u2018housing poverty\u2019 reality, which has been created by the growing gap between poverty and affluence in economically vibrant urban centres, and that forces skilled and highly trained professionals to move outside of cities because they they have been priced out of them.   Housing cost overburden rate   It says European policymakers urgently need to find ways to develop and provide housing for everyone. It recommends innovative funding and lending options, better use of modern building technologies that would help reduce energy costs and make buildings more resilient, as well as new housing policies that would help encourage social integration. \u201cEurope needs to look at better ways of developing and providing housing that helps people, regardless of class or income, to have a decent place to live,\u201d according to Greg Foster, the Europe, Middle East and Africa manager of Habitat for Humanity.  \u201cAnd the trends and threats to Europe\u2019s middle- and low-income neighbourhoods need to be analysed and solutions developed, to ensure the region\u2019s cities remain liveable for everyone\u201d. The NGO is calling on European policymakers to prioritise the provision of affordable, sustainable and liveable housing for all. The report\u2019s publication is timed to coincide with the European Housing Forum, which is meeting for the third time in the Berlin this week. It will bring together housing experts from around the world who will discuss whether at a time of growing economic pressures, which has made housing in particular, extremely costly for many, Europeans can still afford to live in Europe. The conference is expected to focus on the impact the refugee crisis will also have on Europe\u2019s housing challenges. In Germany alone homes will have to be found for one million refugees in the next few months, at a time when social housing construction \u2013 even without the newcomers \u2013 is at a dismally inadequate level almost everywhere. The refugees\u2019 integration into the housing market will be one of the most crucial challenges of coming years, the authors insist.     Habitat for Humanity wants policymakers to prioritise affordable, sustainable and liveable housing for all. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    The authors say households are suffering from a housing cost overburden throughout Europe, with costs such as rent, heating and maintenance eating up to 40% of disposable household income in low-income groups \u2013 that is those whose income is below 60% of the average national income \u2013 and showing no signs of letting up. The impact is felt both in cities and rural areas and increases the poorer a family is. While access to affordable housing is becoming increasingly difficult across the continent \u2013 it is seen to be worst in Paris, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Luxembourg, London and Brussels. Comparing the purchasing power in eight European capitals, the study shows that London fares worst when it comes to price to income ratios. Across the EU, 17% of people are living in overcrowded conditions. The highest rate is in Romania, where it is 52%. The authors said the high number of young adults living at home had led to much of the overcrowding. At the same time, there are plenty of slow economic regions in Europe that have huge vacancy rates \u2013 largely driven by the financial meltdown, such as Portugal, Greece, Spain and many parts of eastern Europe. The report also highlights the problem of spatial segregation. In parts of Europe, ethnic enclaves and ghettos have formed to house the Roma and Sinti communities \u2013 mainly southern and eastern Europe \u2013 and migrant communities. They say that of any group, Roma and Sinti face by far the worst overall housing conditions in Europe. Much of the blame for Europe\u2019s housing problems can be put down to the fact that housing across Europe, including the former communist countries, has increasingly been seen as consumer goods.

Photograph: Alamy    \u201cHousing becomes less affordable as market demand becomes heavily influenced by investment motives, which is illustrated by the evolution of house prices compared with GDP growth in most European countries,\u201d according to report authors J\u00f3zsef Heged\u00fcs and Vera Horvath. They highlight the dangerous extremes in the UK housing market that have had a hugely distorting effect on housing affordability, concluding: \u201cIndividual households have suffered greatly as a result of this imbalance,\u201d not least because \u201ctheir ability to adapt to intense market changes is limited\u201d. The impact of housing privatisation across Europe \u2013 including the selling off of much social housing \u2013 has generated a large number of what the report recognises as \u201cpoor owners\u201d \u2013 people who own their homes, but cannot afford to look after their properties. The report warns that the deteriorating state of much privatised housing \u201cwill become a heavy public liability\u201d for much of Europe in the coming years. While acknowledging that private ownership had its positive aspects, such as keeping housing costs low and stable and giving people a sense of empowerment, Wolfgang Amman, one of the report\u2019s authors, said it had been a mistake to think that responsibility for housing provision for the poor could be renounced. \u201cLeaving unwilling owners in collapsing structures is no political option ... housing for those in need will always be a public service obligation,\u201d he said. Drawing on lessons learnt from the Balkan crisis of the early 90s, the report also stresses the important role housing plays in enabling people to stay in regions that have been ravaged by war and thus in helping prevent mass migration.  It recommends giving priority to rebuilding housing in war-torn regions \u201cas an effective way to prevent people from migrating\u201d. It said housing is \u201ca shock absorber in times of peace, but even more so in times of post-conflict\u201d.     Rent, heating and maintenance accounts for up to 40% of disposable household finance for low-income groups. Photograph: Graham Turner for the Guardian    In recommendations that will resonate in many parts of Europe, the report said that the large decreases in construction was also having a massive impact on Europe\u2019s housing pressures. In looking for ways to increase housing affordability, the Housing Forum will study schemes like that in Georgias capital Tbilisi, which offers financing schemes to specific target groups such as young families and key workers, which have helped to dampen market prices and keep housing affordable. In Kharkiv, Ukraine, another project seeks to offer small but affordable units by keeping planning costs and construction materials as low as possible.  And in Berlin, a policy to be introduced on 1 January will ensure that many low-income residents of housing projects will see their rent cut so that it takes up less than a third of their income. Policymakers will be urged to see whether such projects can be copied elsewhere.", "sentences": ["While access to affordable housing is becoming increasingly difficult across the continent \u2013 it is seen to be worst in Paris, Helsinki, Amsterdam, Luxembourg, London and Brussels."], "title": "Damning report exposes Europe's escalating housing crisis", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/nov/19/damning-report-exposes-europes-escalating-housing-crisis", "tags": ["Europe", "World news", "Communities", "Society", "Real estate", "Construction industry", "Business", "Housing"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-11-19T15:20:26Z", "article": "A march expected to attract 200,000 people onto the streets of Paris ahead of crunch UN climate change talks was forbidden by the French government on Wednesday in light of last Friday\u2019s terror attacks.

Leaders have expressed hope for progress at Paris after the majority of countries around the world submitted voluntary pledges and measures to reduce their own emissions ahead of this year\u2019s talks, as opposed to the UN imposing top-down targets. But many others have signalled that the fate of the talks will rest on the relationship between developed and developing countries, which have been promised a $100bn-a-year package by 2020 to support them to make the transition to a clean economy.

Any sense of relief that the 27-year-old jihadi was no longer at large was tempered by anger that he had not been found earlier, at least before last Friday\u2019s devastating attacks in Paris, of which he is believed to have been the ringleader.  Abaaoud\u2019s ability to move between Europe and Syria has made him the embodiment of Europe\u2019s greatest weaknesses and worst fears, suggesting that the border controls around the Schengen free movement zone are no more than a paper wall against an ever-growing terrorist threat.               In the wake of his death, the urgent manhunt by European intelligence agencies has become a postmortem exercise aimed at retracing Abaaoud\u2019s steps in the hope of discovering what went wrong, and what lessons there are to learn.  Abaaoud disappeared from his Brussels home in late 2013 or early 2014, long after becoming estranged from his middle-class Belgian-Moroccan family. He had been sent to a well-regarded Catholic school in 1999, when he was 12, but dropped out after a year to live on the streets of the district of Molenbeek, where he was drawn to increasingly violent crime.  It is there that he met another Molenbeek youth, Salah Abdeslam \u2013 one of the Paris attackers, now on the run \u2013 with whom he served a jail term in 2011 after a violent robbery. It is not clear whether he was radicalised in jail, or before.  When Abaaoud decided to leave for Syria, he appears to have gone through Germany. The federal police said on Thursday that they had questioned him at Cologne-Bonn airport on 20 January 2014 before he boarded a flight to Istanbul. His record of petty crime and suspected radicalisation had led the Belgians to put him on a watchlist, but according to Der Spiegel the instructions were for his appearance to be flagged, not for him to be detained. A police spokesman said: \u201cThere were no indications that would have led us to stop him travelling or arrest him.\u201d His arrival in Syria is likely to have been overseen by Abu-Muhammad al-Shimali, Islamic State\u2019s border chief responsible for easing the journey of foreign volunteers through the Turkish border town Gaziantep to the Isis-controlled Syrian border town of Jarabulus. The US Department of State on Thursday offered a reward of $5m for information on Shimali\u2019s location.  Once in Syria, Abaaoud rose rapidly through the ranks of Isis, becoming head of a unit devoted to sending other European jihadis back to their home countries to carry out terrorist attacks. He styled himself as Abu Umar al-Baljiki (Umar the Belgian) and cultivated an air of unflinching ruthlessness by having himself filmed in March 2014 smiling and driving a pick-up truck dragging mutilated corpses in the dust behind him.     Anti-terrorist police raid apartment in St-Denis. Photograph: Rex Shutterstock    Mehdi Nemmouche, a French jihadi who killed visitors to the Jewish Museum in Brussels in May 2014, seems to have been in his unit.   It is believed Abaaoud returned to Europe in late 2014, in the company of two other jihadis with whom he was planning attacks in Belgium. It is not known how they managed to travel, but he told the Isis propaganda magazine, Dabiq, that it was not straightforward.   \u201cWe faced a number of trials during the journey,\u201d he said. \u201cWe spent months trying to find a way into Europe, and by Allah\u2019s strength, we succeeded in finally making our way to Belgium. We were then able to obtain weapons and set up a safe house while we planned to carry out operations against the Crusaders.\u201d  There are two main theories of how Abaaoud returned to Europe. One is that came on a forged passport, like one of the attackers who blew himself up in the Stade de France \u2013 who was fingerprinted in Greece and seems to have been carrying false travel documents under the name of a Syrian soldier who had been killed in battle.  The other possibility is that he was using the passport of a living European Isis volunteer. Would-be jihadis have to surrender their passports to Isis on arrival in Syria, giving the group a wide choice of documents to choose from for its foreign operations. Security experts say Abaaoud may have used one whose owner most resembled him.    Related: Abdelhamid Abaaoud, suspected Paris attacks ringleader, was killed in raid     Abaaoud and the two jihadis were planning to attack a Belgian police station disguised as police officers, but the scheme was foiled at the last moment and his two accomplices were killed in a shootout with security forces at their safe house at Verviers. Abaaoud is believed to have been in Greece at the time directing the operation from an Athens safe house on a mobile phone. In the aftermath of the raid on the Verviers house, an Isis cell member was arrested in Greece, but Abaaoud was gone. He boasted how he was able to dodge the combined efforts of the world\u2019s intelligence agencies to return to Syria. Once there, he is believed to have given marching orders to an Algerian student, Sid Ahmed Ghlam, who is suspected of having planned attacks against churches in Villejuif in France and of killing a dance instructor.  In July this year, Abaaoud was sentenced to 20 years in prison in absentia by the Belgian court, for his role as a principal recruiter of European jihadis for Isis, in particular for the recruitment of his own 13-year-old brother, Younes, who is infamous for being the youngest known Isis fighter. He is also thought to have been a mentor to Ayoub al-Khazzani, a Moroccan-born jihadi whose attempt to kill passengers on a high-speed train from Amsterdam to Paris in August was thwarted when his gun jammed and he was tackled by off-duty American soldiers.  His name surfaced in August in Paris, where a French jihadi known as Reda H told France\u2019s senior counter-terrorism prosecutor Marc Trevidic, that he had been at a six-day training course at an Isis base near Raqqa. According to Lib\u00e9ration, Abaaoud gave him \u20ac2,000 (\u00a31,400), passwords to enter encrypted online forums, and some clear instructions: \u201cHit a concert hall to cause the maximum number of casualties.\u201d   Related: Paris attacks: police examine remains of 'cowgirl' turned suicide bomber    Le Parisien quotes a young French Isis recruit who said they had been questioned by France\u2019s interior security service DGSI. It is not clear if this is the same person who talked to Trevidic. He said that Abaaoud worked in Isis\u2019s internal security unit, known as EMNI, which has the task of sending European jihadis back to their homelands to carry out terrorist attacks. The unit is run by two Tunisians, he said.  Abaaoud is said to have told the young Frenchman that he had managed to find 25kg of explosives in Belgium, but that it was too difficult for him to return to his home country himself. He was in charge of selecting candidates, who could be paid as much as \u20ac50,000 for carrying out attacks, but it was the two unnamed Tunisians who had the final decision on who would be sent. Clearly, however, Abaaoud was sent back in person to oversee the assault on Paris. And once again, his trip back appears to have left almost no trace, other than a report from a non-European intelligence agency that he had used his mobile phone in Greece over the summer. But there his trail evaporated, only to materialise again when it was far too late, under the rubble in St-Denis, leaving behind him an infinite number of what-ifs and fears of who might follow in his footsteps.

In the affluent west, we are drowning in sugar and fat and yet we dream of more. In most of Europe and the US, there are now around 3,600 calories consumed for every person per day \u2013 more than a\u00a0third more than we need. But our collective relationship with food remains that of a hungry Dickensian orphan: the laden table is still at the\u00a0heart of our concept of generosity \u2013 and even of love. We still yearn to visit Willy Wonka\u2019s factory. It is as if we haven\u2019t noticed that we are already living in a chocolatey cornucopia \u2013 the dream is now real, and it\u2019s more like a nightmare. \u201cHuman history,\u201d writes Louise Fresco, a plant scientist from Amsterdam, \u201ccan be seen as a way of defeating scarcity and converting it into plenty.\u201d Our ancestors grabbed food and gorged when it was available, in the knowledge that hunger was round the corner. The basic premise of politics is a need to manage disputes over scarce resources. For much of\u00a0human evolution, daily life was shaped\u00a0by chronic food shortages, compounded by the difficulty of\u00a0preserving out-of-season produce. To have a constant supply of food was the stuff of fantasy. Now, however, as\u00a0Fresco writes, we have \u201cparadise on\u00a0every street corner\u201d in the form of supermarkets that may offer 60 types of bread and 30 types of pasta sauce. Our eating habits haven\u2019t quite caught up with these new circumstances. Fear of\u00a0scarcity is \u201chard to shake\u201d, as Fresco astutely observes. \u201cAlthough 85% of people now consume more or\u00a0less sufficient calories, I would estimate that a\u00a0quarter of them did not have a hunger-free childhood, and far more are children or grandchildren of\u00a0those who did suffer from hunger.\u201d Our\u00a0behaviour around food is influenced by the hungry years: many people still feel compelled to leave a clean plate, regardless of the size of the plate. Fresco\u2019s weighty and often maddening book is about the many types of confusion that result from this state of\u00a0abundance (though it does also consider the continuing hunger in the developing world). The title is meant to\u00a0capture the paradox. From one angle, Fresco views burgers as a symbol of how lucky we are. In the modern western food supply, meat is no longer a\u00a0rare luxury but something we can buy cheaply any day of the week; the\u00a0hamburger\u2019s bun, Fresco notes, is\u00a0\u201cwrapping, plate and napkin in one\u201d. To eat a hamburger, she adds rather portentously, is to participate in \u201cthe image of American modernity\u201d: in this sense, fast food is paradise. It certainly seemed that way when I\u00a0went to the Moscow branch of\u00a0McDonald\u2019s in the mid-1990s and watched as consumers who had grown up with bread queues and half-empty shops paid devout homage to Big Macs and fries. Yet at the same time, Fresco sees hamburgers \u2013 \u201cthe ultimate metaphor of modern temptation\u201d \u2013 as a symbol of\u00a0what\u2019s gone wrong. Rich in the junk\u2011food trinity of salt, sugar and fat, they characterise a global food system that has made an estimated 2.3\u00a0billion people overweight or obese. Hamburgers also highlight our casual attitude to eating animals, with the average European now consuming meat most days of the week, and Americans consuming it more than once a day. Given the damage to the environment from mass livestock production, hamburgers, Fresco suggests, are like the apple that will get\u00a0us thrown out of Eden. One of the chapters is a critique of organic food, which she sees as a muddled middle-class ideology \u2013 a futile attempt to rebuild paradise. In this current abundance, the organic movement speaks to our yearning for the small, the local and the personal. Fresco\u2013 who is a member of the Council of Advisers for the World Food Prize \u2013 argues that those who buy into it are opting to use farmland less efficiently, contributing to lower yields. She denies the benefits of organic farming in an account that \u2013 as so often in this book \u2013 feels too dogmatic. She does not explore the ways in which it might deliver efficiencies through reducing waste and eliminating the costly environmental side-effects of conventional farming.     Hundreds of Muscovites queue at the first McDonald\u2019s restaurant in the Soviet Union on its opening day in January 1990. Photograph: AP    Another source of misunderstanding, according to Fresco, is bread, something that she gave a much viewed TED talk on in 2009. In it, Fresco held up two loaves, one an artisanal wholemeal loaf and one a mass-produced loaf of white sliced \u201cWonderbread\u201d. When she asked the educated California audience which they preferred, 99%\u00a0said they preferred the handmade loaf. She took them to\u00a0task\u00a0for their preference (even\u00a0though she\u00a0shares it). Sliced\u00a0white, asserts Fresco, is\u00a0not\u00a0\u201cthe unhealthy\u00a0calorie bomb some diet gurus take it for (and\u00a0anyhow, it\u00a0is\u00a0fortified with vitamins and minerals)\u201d. In her opinion, those who are not aware of the technological importance of white bread as\u00a0food for the\u00a0masses \u201cought to pipe down a little\u201d. But this is to ignore that\u00a0what is good for eliminating mass hunger may not be good for\u00a0individuals, whose taste for sliced white tends to form part of an unbalanced diet. This is\u00a0typical of\u00a0Fresco\u2019s mode of thought. She often\u00a0berates consumers for being confused and lacking in knowledge, yet her book frequently adds to the\u00a0confusion. We are taken on long, rambling excursions on the role of paradise in western art and the extent to which it resembles the idealised countryside of Tuscany and Umbria (\u201cI, like so many people, love visiting Umbria with its alternating valleys and thick forests\u201d). She makes false blanket assertions such as telling us that in centuries past, spices were used to disguise rotting meat, something that food historians have refuted for decades (spices were expensive and would not have been wasted on spoiled produce). Fresco also presents judgmental opinions as gospel, telling us that overweight girls do not make friends with thin girls, \u201cin whose company they feel ill at ease\u201d. It is frustrating, because Hamburgers in Paradise grapples with vital questions about the mess we find ourselves in with food. As someone who has travelled the world looking at\u00a0different agricultural systems, Fresco is well placed to give a panoramic sketch of the global food supply and to\u00a0analyse where it might be headed in\u00a0the future.\u00a0Now that the downsides of abundance are becoming clear, what would a real food paradise look like? Fresco insists it is absolutely possible that \u2013 with the\u00a0help of science \u2013 \u201cwe will be able to\u00a0feed present and future generations in ways that are sustainable \u00a0and healthy as well as balanced and equitable\u201d. She\u00a0wishes for an agriculture of bounty without obesity and\u00a0without the destruction of the landscape \u2013 a more balanced version of\u00a0paradise. It sounds good, in theory. But to get there will take some hard choices that Fresco does not seem prepared to make. \u2022 Consider the Fork: A History of How We Cook and Eat by Bee Wilson is published by\u00a0Penguin.

The previously illuminated sign is still there, now unlit: Nous Productions Pr\u00e9sente Eagles of Death Metal. Across the road: the vast blanket of candles, flowers and personalised tributes. They form a lineage, somehow, from Washington Square on 11 September 2001, then Place de la R\u00e9publique up the road on the night of 7 January this year, now this. Acts of intimacy and frail hope in a vortex out there, of mad politics and distant wars come vengefully home to claim those who had simply gone about their lives. In New York, they had been mid-ranking traders; in January cartoonists and journalists; now it was the turn of young folk out for a drink or pizza \u2013 and rock fans. The hour struck, 9.17pm, and leaden silence fell, broken only by the babble of TV reporters beside their mobile trucks. Flags affixed to the fence: Sardinia, Lebanon, Puerto Rico, Brazil. Teddy bears, a guitar with le Bataclan est toujours vivant \u2013 the Bataclan lives forever. A paperback of Hemingway\u2019s A Moveable Feast, translated as Paris est une f\u00eate \u2013 Paris is a party. A Paris Saint-Germain banner with an epic poem written on it and special joint plaque made by the supporters\u2019 clubs in France of Liverpool and Everton. And a black vinyl LP, chipped and cracked, with a white flower in the middle \u2013 and attached, the darkly bitter words: Rock Kills You. The story had been told incrementally over the week: by people such as theatre assistant Jean-Pierre Bouyxou recalling the reloading of magazines and shooting those who pleaded, urging his wife: \u201cPlay dead and above all keep down. We can survive this.\u201d The bloodletting had names: two gunmen who came here to execute these \u201chundreds of idolatrous sinners\u201d attending a \u201cfestival of perversion\u201d, as Isis repulsively brands young fans of rock\u2019n\u2019roll. One was called Omar Ismail Mostefai, the other Samy Amimour. The story of these two men illustrates with cruel clarity the choices that France faced last week \u2013 and faces into its future \u2013 between two of the republic\u2019s cherished traditions. One is the principle, and figure, of libert\u00e9, first and foremost in the secular trinity proclaimed by the revolution. Personified as Marianne, she was ubiquitous last week: one cartoon in a magazine of that name adapted Delacroix\u2019s great painting of her leading the people to show liberty clad in blood-drenched robes leading hi-vis-jacketed paramedics and survivors wrapped in thermal blankets over ground strewn with bodies. The other is the tradition of the strong state ostensibly representative of the people, an evocation of the name of one of the republic\u2019s first institutions, established in 1791, the Comit\u00e9 de s\u00fbret\u00e9 g\u00e9n\u00e9rale \u2013 committee for general security. A few hours before the carnage of Friday the 13th, a general called Jean-Louis Desvignes, president of the Association of Reservists, Arcsi, posted a document on an internet forum debating \u201cdigital freedom\u201d. It was headed by the words: \u201cLibert\u00e9, fraternit\u00e9, surveillance\u201d. A bitterly prescient joke, for it is in the interests of these other notions of security and surveillance that dark clouds now gather over libert\u00e9, herself apparently willing to draw curtains over the very freedoms she eschews. \u201cThe questions of the past,\u201d the post read, \u201care always with us in the present. How do we find a balance between liberty and security?\u201d Two days and 129 lost lives later, a headline in the newspaper L\u2019Opinion talked about a new \u201cMaginot Line of internal security\u201d \u2013 invoking another line through the heart of France: between liberty versus security.     A soldier enforces France\u2019s national security alert system in front of the Eiffel Tower. Photograph: Joel Saget/AFP/Getty Images    The polls became progressively unequivocal. An initial test of the water by iT\u00e9l\u00e9 showed a majority in favour of \u201cmeasures to restrict liberty of individuals to preserve the liberty of all\u201d, but respondents were less inclined to declare that: \u201cI am ready to see my liberty reduced if this benefits the general interest.\u201d Two days later, a poll by Ifop and Le Figaro showed 84% ready to accept \u201ccontrols and a certain limitation of liberty in order to guarantee better security\u201d. (Another poll, by CSA, put the figure lower, at 63%.) According to Ifop, even voters for the far-left Front de Gauche were 65% in favour; for Socialist voters it was 87% and there were inevitably overwhelming majorities for the centre-right and National Front. Ifop\u2019s director, J\u00e9r\u00f4me Fourquet, surmised that \u201cthe French do not only adhere to the rhetoric of \u2018war\u2019 \u2013 [prime minister] Manuel Valls talked about \u2018war\u2019 last January \u2013 but also to decisions that entail a restriction of public liberty\u201d. The centrepiece of the entrenchment of state power is a proposed change to the constitution, establishing recourse to a \u201ccivil state of emergency\u201d in addition to powers adopted in 1955 during the Algerian war of independence, in order \u2013 says Fran\u00e7ois Hollande \u2013 to confront \u201cwar of another type\u201d, as presented by jihadi terrorism. There is little opposition, apart from a caution in an editorial by Le Monde, that \u201cto make the state of emergency a permanent arm of executive power could lead to a jeopardy of fundamental liberties. This places security at the first level of the rights of man. Security is an expectation, but not at any price.\u201d Proposals for the stripping of nationality from French-born dual nationals engaged in jihad would be controversial under any other circumstances, and Florian Borg, president of the Union of Lawyers, was almost a lone public voice protesting that this might \u201caccentuate the stigmatisation of certain French [citizens]; moreover, the stripping of nationality can also be counterproductive\u201d. The police will be reinforced by 5,000 officers, other services by a further 5,000 and cuts to the armed forces are frozen until 2019. The military can shed its so-called peau de chagrin, skin of resentment, as soldiers take their place across Paris suburbs that had already come to feel like a casbah under siege, and in the lives of the inner city, now with broad public consent. A further facet of last week\u2019s measures was to continue the state of emergency for three months, so that posters all over Paris calling for a \u201cmarch for climate\u201d to greet the environmental summit opening on 30 November cry into the ether; regional elections will take place without campaign rallies. There was one lone and loud voice against another pillar of the presidential and national reaction, to intensify bombing Isis. This was the man who was to the fore at the genesis of all this, when the Bush and Blair administrations prepared to invade Iraq during the autumn of 2002: the then French foreign minister Dominique de Villepin. A year ago, De Villepin, now retired from electoral politics, went on television to argue that \u201cthe war against terrorism cannot be won. The failure is already apparent. They are opportunists, a hidden hand.\u201d He warned France against \u201cfollowing the United States in ideological messianism\u201d and of \u201chatred against hatred, war against war\u201d, urging \u201ca political vision, political strategies\u201d. Last week, De Villepin said: \u201cI don\u2019t take it back. I don\u2019t want to play the terrorists\u2019 game. To make us think we are at war is a trap. They\u2019re not an army of state, they\u2019re groups of fanatics.\u201d By bombing them, \u201cwe legitimise their claim to be at war. Indeed, they want to destroy us \u2026 they want to divide us and push us into civil war. But because a band of murderers and fanatics declare war, we shouldn\u2019t fall into the trap of outbidding them\u201d. There is no serious consideration of a government of national unity in pursuit of Hollande\u2019s strategy, but his stance puts the rightwing opposition on the back foot, with little room for manoeuvre but to support him \u2013 and advance more stringent measures. This has begun, cutting to the core of the question: how did the killers mount such an operation undetected, and how to prevent another? This is a discourse that invokes a little-discussed kernel of France\u2019s efforts to trace its assailants: the so-called S Files. S Files are kept on individuals monitored for potential threat to security, kept by the Direction G\u00e9n\u00e9rale de la S\u00e9curit\u00e9 Int\u00e9rieure \u2013 descendant of the committee of 1791. They have counter-espionage origins in the cold war, and include militants of the far left and right, and soccer hooligans. But the DGSI is now reported to hold at least 5,000 such files, three-quarters of which relate to Islamist extremism. To qualify, individuals need not have committed any crime, but must belong to an organisation deemed a \u201cmenace to the public peace\u201d, such as an extremist mosque. You cannot be arrested for having an S File \u2013 it is \u201can alert\u201d. S Files overlap with other lists, including those in a special investigative folder established after the attack on a gas facility in Is\u00e8re last June, dedicated to \u201cthe assembled spectre of radicalised persons\u201d. Names are sub-categorised according to threat and type: S14 defines those known to be in, or returned from, Syria or Iraq.     Police commandos pose with a bullet-ridden riot shield that was used during the assault at the Bataclan threatre. Photograph: Kenzo Tribouillard/AFP/Getty Images    Omar Ismail Mostefai opened fire on the rock fans as a name on the S Files, registered in 2010 as an ultra-orthodox activist based in Chartres. On arrival there, he made contact with an imam and after two years vanished, only to reappear in autumn 2013, entering Turkey with two men \u2013 among them Samy Amimour, the other killer at Bataclan. Amimour was also known to DGSI, qualifying for an S File in 2012 after an aborted attempt to fight in Yemen, and placed under \u201cjudicial control\u201d, obliging him to report to police \u2013 a control he slipped by travelling to Syria, thereby proceeding to an international arrest warrant. Others with S Files include Mohamed Merah, who killed seven people, including Jews and soldiers, in Toulouse and Montauban in 2012; Mehdi Nemmouche, who attacked the Jewish museum in Brussels last year; Ch\u00e9rif and Sa\u00efd Kouachi, the Charlie Hebdo killers; Amedy Coulibaly, one of the killers in a Paris kosher market on 9 January; Sid Ahmed Ghlam, implicated in a murderous attack on a church in April; Yassin Salhi, arrested for the gas plant attack in Is\u00e8re; and Ayoub El-Khazzani, who recently tried to murder passengers aboard a train from Amsterdam to Paris. All on the S Files. The fact is \u2013 whether state services and civil libertarians like it nor not \u2013 the S File system has identified many of those involved in mass murder. The question is: what to do about it? Marc Tr\u00e9vidic, a former anti-terrorist examining judge for Paris, has for some time been warning of those on the S Files. In September, he told Paris Match that Isis has \u201cthe ambitions and the means to hit us much harder [than last January], organising bigger actions than we\u2019ve seen so far\u201d. Now Tr\u00e9vidic \u2013 speaking from Lille where he has moved due to limits on terms of service \u2013 says: \u201cThe services knew such an action was imminent. But how can we know where the act of terrorism will happen? All those on the lists represent a potential menace, but what can we say about those who aren\u2019t listed, who are no doubt numerous? We\u2019ve managed to give a face, in our procedures, to people who\u2019ve made journeys to Syria. There are some who\u2019ve made the journey down there without figuring on our lists. But certain individuals have managed, despite the surveillance. The sheer number of people listed is itself a problem.\u201d As last week progressed, one proposal came from the wings to centre stage. It had been suggested in September by Arno Klarsfeld, son of the Nazi-hunter Serge Klarsfeld. He proposed on a website called Causeur  that those identified on the S Files be put into \u201cadministrative detention\u201d. \u201cDo we have to wait for the next catastrophe, or can we try to prevent it?\u201d asked Klarsfeld, citing passages in the European convention \u201cin time of war\u201d, and prime minister Valls\u2019 invocation of \u201cwar\u201d before Friday the 13th. Ten days ago, the idea of some Guant\u00e1namo Bay arrangement in the heart of Europe would have been considered preposterous, and Klarsfeld\u2019s proposal vanished. But last week, Laurent Wauquiez, number three in Nicolas Sarkozy\u2019s opposition Republicans, resurrected the idea. \u201cBehind the attacks,\u201d he said, \u201cthere are always people already identified by the authorities in the S Files, known to our services for their radicalisation but not arrested on the pretext that French law does not permit it. I propose precisely that we change our laws so as to permit us to act before these things happen, and place them in internment centres where they cannot harm us. I think it\u2019s a sensible proposition which the French people will understand.\u201d The S list is not supposed to be limited to the services of one country, but shared across the Schengen zone. Tr\u00e9vidic talks about \u201cthe porosity of the Franco-Belgian border\u201d so far as cells operating in both countries are concerned \u2013 the axis between Paris and Brussels that has driven the wave of attacks since Charlie Hebdo. The Brussels suburb of Molenbeek used to be known as Little Manchester, such was its prowess as a manufacturing hub \u2013 no longer. Yet it is here, back in his home town, that investigations focus again after the killing of Belgian Abdelhamid Abaaoud in Saint-Denis on Wednesday; here that his alleged co-conspirators may still be hiding, where the Paris plot was hatched. The foggy air is thick with distrust, a state of siege \u2013 and insinuations from France that the Belgian authorities failed to communicate all they knew. In Brussels last week, an official with the prosecutor\u2019s office told the Observer he feared that \u201csome of the information gathered for the equivalent of the S Files in Belgium was not shared with the French authorities\u201d. A Belgian file, detailed in Saturday\u2019s Le Monde, traces Abaaoud\u2019s movements until last February, lists his pseudonyms, recounts minor brushes with the law and a period of detention in 2012. He heads for Turkey in January 2014, back in Belgium by the time of the Charlie Hebdo massacre, interviewed by the jihadi magazine Dabiq. It remains unclear how much of this detail was shared with France. Arnaud Danjean, a former security official with the French defence ministry and European parliament, says that \u201cthere are Belgian files that have not been transmitted. There are problems of coordination.\u201d But early on Saturday the calculations and machinations of the week dissolved, somehow, into the ritual and personal solemnities of the moonlit night. At Place de la R\u00e9publique, thousands had converged spontaneously on 5 January and their posters are still there: Je Suis Charlie, on the column atop which the statue of Marianne holds her torch aloft. Yesterday, there were hundreds only, and even their gathering was now illegal, but they hoisted the very same banner as that 11 months ago: M\u00eame Pas Peur, not even afraid. But it had been a different week \u2013 no rallies, more fear than rage; stunned, lachrymose, frightened and frightening at every level and turn. And back at the Bataclan, perhaps the most poignant and cogent offering of all \u2013 hung by its laces, a black boot, into which was stuck a bunch of red and yellow roses, and painted on it in silver: Rock in Peace.

Related: Paris attacks: three suspects including alleged 'scout' arrested in Turkey \u2013\u00a0live    The Belgian prime minister, Charles Michel, said the decision to raise his country\u2019s terror threat was taken \u201cbased on quite precise information about the risk of an attack like the one that happened in Paris\u201d and a fear that \u201cseveral individuals with arms and explosives could launch an attack \u2026 perhaps even in several places\u201d. Belgian officials said police had discovered a cache of weapons and ammunition in a building in the small Brussels borough of Molenbeek during searches on Friday night. Several members of the Isis cell of gunmen and suicide bombers who attacked the Stade de France, the Bataclan and a string of cafes and restaurants on 13 November \u2013 at least one of whom is still on the run \u2013 lived in Molenbeek, an area with a longstanding reputation as a hotbed of extremism. The highest number of foreign fighters from an EU country \u2013 in per capita terms \u2013 comes from Belgium and Molenbeek is where they are concentrated.            Salah Abdeslam\u2019s brother urges him to surrender to police    The interior minister, Jan Jambon, a Flemish nationalist, said that of 130 foreign fighters who were known to have returned home from Syria, 85 were living in Molenbeek just west of the city centre. He demanded that the local authorities conducted a \u201cdoor-by-door\u201d vetting of who was living in every house and flat in the borough. The presumed ringleader of the Paris attacks, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, a 28-year-old Belgian national of Moroccan origin, was thought to have been in Syria but died in a ferocious seven-hour gunfight with police at a rundown apartment in St-Denis, north of Paris, on Wednesday. Another suspected member of the unit, Salah Abdelslam, a 26-year-old Frenchman living in Brussels, is the subject of an international manhunt. His brother, Brahim, who blew himself up in the attacks, spent time in a Belgian prison with Abaaoud, while a third Molenbeek resident, Bilal Hadfi, was also among the Paris suicide bombers. Belgian special forces arrested four people in the capital\u2019s Place du Grand Sablonon Saturday afternoon, while the Brussels Metro system is expected to be shut down until Sunday afternoon at the earliest. Shops were closed, some shopping malls were shuttered, professional football was cancelled, concerts were called off and music venues, museums, and galleries shut their doors for the weekend. While local supermarkets were as busy as ever and open-air markets operated normally, there was an edginess in the city centre shopping area, with security personnel posted at the entrance to shops, checking bags and rucksacks on entry. By the afternoon, around half of city centre shops had closed. Armed personnel carriers and armoured vehicles restricted movement in the old city centre. Municipal facilities across the city, such as sports and arts centres, libraries, and swimming pools, were all ordered to close. The Sunday morning market at the Gare du Midi, the Eurostar terminal \u2013 one of the biggest outdoor markets in Europe \u2013 was called off. The US embassy advised Americans in Brussels \u2013 home to Nato headquarters \u2013 to cancel any plans they had for the weekend and to stay at home. \u201cIf you must go out, avoid large crowds. US citizens are urged to avoid public places,\u201d the embassy said. \u201cIf you were planning to attend an event, we strongly urge you to reconsider. Exercise caution in public transportation systems, sporting events, residential areas, business offices, hotels, clubs, restaurants, places of worship, schools, public areas, shopping malls and other tourist destinations.\u201d The Foreign Office delivered similar advice for the high numbers of Britons in Brussels. The security alert came after Belgian authorities charged a third man with terrorist offences in connection with the Paris attacks. Earlier this week, two Belgian nationals of Moroccan origin, Hamza Attou and Mohammed Amri, were charged after admitting to driving Abdeslam back to Belgium on the night of the attacks. Confirmation that Abaaoud \u2013 who openly boasted in Isis propaganda of his ability to move at will between Syria and Europe \u2013 had managed to make his way to the French capital unnoticed, despite being the subject of an international arrest warrant, forced EU ministers to rush through tougher controls at the borders of the passport-free Schengen zone. The French interior minister, Bernard Cazeneuve, said the new measures, which require obligatory, systematic and coordinated checks on all travellers entering the 26-nation zone, would be introduced immediately, with the European commission expected to formalise the new rules by the end of the year. The change means EU citizens, who were previously subjected only to minimum controls when entering the Schengen area, will have their details thoroughly checked against national and international crime and terrorism databases.     Malian policemen and security officials take up positions in a side street to the Radisson hotel where extremists took hostages. Photograph: UPI /Landov/Barcroft Media    As police forces across Europe widened their search for the extremists\u2019 accomplices, Ahmet Dahmani, a 26-year-old Belgian national of Moroccan origin was detained at a luxury hotel in Antalya, Turkey, on suspicion of having scouted out the target sites for the Paris attacks. Two other men, both Syrian nationals, were also arrested, a government official said. They are suspected of being Isis recruits sent to accompany the alleged scout over the border to Syria. The official said that Dahmani had arrived from Amsterdam on 14 November, the day after the Paris attacks, but had not been intercepted earlier because Turkey had received no warning about him. At the UN, the security council unanimously called on all able states to join the fight against Isis in Syria and Iraq, and redouble their efforts to prevent any further attacks by the militant group. The 15 members of the council adopted a French-drafted resolution on Friday calling on UN members to take \u201call necessary measures\u201d against a group it described as \u201ca global and unprecedented threat to international peace and security\u201d. Countries were urged to step up sanctions and improve efforts to cut off the flow of foreign fighters to Iraq and Syria. Russian warplanes again struck jihadi targets in Syria overnight, firing cruise missiles from warships in the Caspian Sea into Isis-controlled territory in what Moscow called an \u201caerial campaign of retribution\u201d for the deaths of all 224 passengers in a Russian plane over Sinai this month.

My, what a nice place you have, Herr D\u00fcring. Yes, Carrie you\u2019re just like me \u2013 you\u2019re not earthbound either. Interesting point, hmm \u2026 hang on, this looks interesting. And so, we discover the secret that the Russians have been trying to stop Carrie from finding (it is the Russians, isn\u2019t it? This season is getting even more confusing than normal). It\u2019s a note from one of her old assets trying to get hold of her.  She makes a few calls; an old pal eventually gets back in touch. It\u2019s Touchstone, who has been wanting to alert Oriole (AKA Carrie) to the fact that an Iraqi lawyer they thought had died in a bombing at the Ministry of Justice is very much still alive.  Some backup is required, and with Quinn awol and Saul busy being grilled by Dar, Carrie decides to turn to the next best thing: Laura the rogue journo, who brings another one of Berlin\u2019s Most Wanted into the D\u00fcring household. Carrie meet Gabehcuod; Douchebag meet Eirrac \u2026  Luckily, Gabehcuod really is a super hacker. \u201cWhat\u2019s the Wi-Fi password?\u201d he bluffs everyone just to being polite (yeah, yeah, like he hasn\u2019t cracked it in seconds). Anyhow, he\u2019s able to track down the missing Iraqi lawyer\u2019s wife, who is now living in Amsterdam. She\u2019s not even using a fake name. Too easy. \u2018That\u2019s a lot of house for a hairdresser\u2019 Carrie borrows one of Otto\u2019s expensive cars from his handy fleet and drives off to Amsterdam, where we get more of the classic Mathison approach to international espionage. She hooks up with another old contact, who is happily studying for an MBA at night while driving a cab by day.  They stake out the house, wait for first the lawyer\u2019s wife and then the lawyer to leave the house. He\u2019s got to walk the dog. That\u2019s not spy code. Carrie busts in, smashing a glass pane in the door with her gun. She finds a safe (locked) and a laptop (unlocked) before some goons storm in, spot the broken glass and deduce that there\u2019s someone else there already.  Nimble as ever, Carrie jumps out of a window, ditches her wig and jumps back into her friend\u2019s cab. Unfortunately, he\u2019s met the grisly fate of any minor Homeland character who mentioned something about being happy. Carrie drives back to Berlin alone, placing a call to the one person she can totally trust to fill her in: Allison. \u2018My bosses actually believe you will be director one day\u2019 Are we any nearer this week to knowing what Allison\u2019s motives are? When she\u2019s alone with her Russian handler/lover Ivan Krupin, he seems to suggest that she thrives on the thrill of the lie: \u201cThat\u2019s where you live, the double game.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s only one person Saul would go so far out on a limb for,\u201d she tells him. \u201cI saw a photo, not a body.\u201d She\u2019s worried, and smart enough to twig that Saul must be up to something. Back in the CIA office, Dar doesn\u2019t seem to believe her story about finding a USB stick \u201cleft in her drawer\u201d with a copy of the missing documents on it. But Allison presses on. Maybe it\u2019s because Dar is so wrapped up in his decades-long battle of wills, but it doesn\u2019t take much to convince him that she should be allowed to interrogate Saul away from the cameras in the CIA offices and back in the softly-softly location of his hotel room (he likes his \u201ccreature comforts\u201d, after all).  \u201cJust because I\u2019m sleeping with him doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019d perjure myself to protect him,\u201d Allison reasons, a logic that seems to have just enough truth in it for Dar.      \u2018I\u2019m loyal, most of the time anyway.\u2019 Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson and Miranda Otto as Allison Carr. Photograph: Stephan Rabold/SHOWTIME    \u2018Rachmaninov!\u2019 Allison\u2019s plan seems to be working. \u201cI\u2019m loyal, most of the time anyway,\u201d she smiles, again covering a lie with the truth (or is it the truth with a lie?) as she charms Saul. Saul pulls the old \u201cturn up the classical music and leave the taps running\u201d trick to make sure no one can hear him confessing everything to Allison: Carrie\u2019s alive and he has been waiting for her to get in touch.  \u2018I feel sick\u2019  Allison\u2019s panic attack is an interesting moment, though. She uses it as an excuse to buy herself a moment alone from Saul to text Krupin; it really feels as if she\u2019s bluffing \u2013 the spy equivalent of having a headache in bed. But then, as she crumples on the floor, we see that it\u2019s also real. The taps keep running; she may be a liar, but she\u2019s still freaking out. \u2018Like dogs in the desert\u2019 Meanwhile, Quinn seems to have got over his suicidal tendencies (not to mention recovered from being stabbed), and has kicked back into CIA mode when the opportunity to get close to a money man in the jihadi chain of command presents itself. Dar, for one, is pleased. But would the gang really take in this \u201cmercenary\u201d who has appeared out of nowhere to get them into Syria, listen to his advice about the passports and pay his fee? Quinn and his accidental discovery of a Berlin jihadi cell is one of the odder avenues Homeland has taken us down. On a more serious note, I can\u2019t be the only Homeland viewer relieved this week to see the storyline veering away from a plot involving an European bombing.  \u2018I\u2019ve never defected before\u2019 Saul grumpily calls for his \u201claundry\u201d, which turns out to be code for \u201cI\u2019m a CIA director, get me out of here!\u201d His old friend Etai stages a kidnapping, saving Saul from a long trip to Langley. State of play So, where are we? Carrie is driving back through Europe to hang out with Allison, Saul has defected to the Israelis, Quinn is heading off to the Syrian border and Douchebag knows Otto\u2019s password: two words: \u201cPope Francis\u201d. Wait a minute \u2013 what if Otto is like the rest of us and uses the same password for everything? Otto: there\u2019s a security breach! Maybe Carrie will still have a job with the D\u00fcring Foundation after all.  Next week\u2019s episode is titled All About Allison: Carrie needs Allison\u2019s help. Quinn\u2019s plans change (again). Notes and queries  \u201cOriole had flown the coop.\u201d Carrie sounds quite down about having left the CIA. \u201cNow they\u2019re going to die like dogs in the desert.\u201d Quinn is quite the poet when he wants to be. \u201cWe won\u2019t be renewing her contract. Of course, don\u2019t let that influence your personal relationship with her. That\u2019s your business.\u201d Is Otto really going to fire Carrie or is there something else going on here? That line he feeds Carrie about Jonas being \u201cearthbound\u201d \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re either born with wings or not\u201d \u2013 felt almost as if he was suggesting that Jonas wasn\u2019t enough for her. (Here, drive one of my many expensive cars \u2026) \u201cAll too stupid and theatrical for words.\u201d Hang on, is Dar reviewing the show or complaining about Saul here? Carrie is a black coffee drinker. \u201cHe\u2019s being completely uncooperative.\u201d Dar sounds genuinely surprised that Saul isn\u2019t just spilling the beans on command. \u201cWithout it you\u2019d be a beached fish, dying of too much oxygen.\u201d Ivan the charmer.  Nice call-back from Carrie to the Mathison family\u2019s cabin in the woods (AKA the Brody shag-pad). \u201cI don\u2019t care how brilliant she is, she\u2019s not a fucking magician.\u201d Ivan doesn\u2019t believe the Oriole hype. \u201cFuck off!\u201d You really get the impression that Mandy Patinkin and F Murray Abraham have a lot of fun in their scenes together as Saul and Dar.

Now a leading Dutch art historian says he knows. The answer, according to Frans Grijzenhout, professor of art history at Amsterdam University, came from trawling through detailed contemporaneous records kept by the city in the southern Netherlands. These allowed him to pinpoint the only houses of the time that could match Vermeer\u2019s famous scene, even though very little of them remains. So significant is the apparent discovery about one of only two surviving outdoor scenes by Vermeer, better known for his intimate portraits of domestic life, that it is the basis for an exhibition at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which owns the painting. The exhibition will, fittingly, transfer to Delft\u2019s Museum Prinsenhof next year. \u201cThe answer to the question as to the location of Vermeer\u2019s The Little Street is of great significance, both for the way that we look at this one painting by Vermeer and for our image of Vermeer as an artist,\u201d said Pieter Roelofs, curator of 17th-century paintings at the Rijksmuseum. While various theories had been suggested for the location of the painting over the years, Grijzenhout was the first researcher to consult an arcane document from 1667, about a decade after the work was painted. Officially known as De legger van het diepen der wateren binnen de stad Delft, or the ledger of the dredging of the canals in the town of Delft, it recorded how much tax various house owners had to pay for dredging their local canal and maintaining the quay. As part of this, it detailed the width of each house and their associated passageways, accurate to within 15cm. Grijzenhout\u2019s research found that on the north side of Vlamingstraat, a narrow canal in eastern Delft, sat two houses of about 6.3 metres wide, with a pair of adjacent passageways about 1.2 metres wide. Correlating this with other archive materials about gardens and the position of houses, Grijzenhout concluded that nowhere else in Delft at the time matched the painting. The original houses are long gone, although one passageway remains. In their place sit numbers 40 and 42 Vlamingstraat, built in the late 19th century. The research found that in Vermeer\u2019s picture, the house on the right belonged to the painter\u2019s widowed aunt, Ariaentgen Claes van der Minne, who provided for her five children by selling tripe.

From mid-2013 to mid-2014, corporate buying of existing properties exceeded $600bn (\u00a3395bn) in the top 100 recipient cities, and $1trillion a year later \u2013 and this figure includes only major acquisitions (eg. a minimum of $5m in the case of New York City). I want to examine the details of this large corporate investment surge, and why it matters. Cities are the spaces where those without power get to make a history and a culture, thereby making their powerlessness complex. If the current large-scale buying continues, we will lose this type of making that has given our cities their cosmopolitanism. Indeed, at the current scale of acquisitions, we are seeing a systemic transformation in the pattern of land ownership in cities: one that alters the historic meaning of the city. Such a transformation has deep and significant implications for equity, democracy and rights. A city is a complex but incomplete system: in this mix lies the capacity of cities across histories and geographies to outlive far more powerful, but fully formalised, systems \u2013 from large corporations to national governments. London, Beijing, Cairo, New York, Johannesburg and Bangkok \u2013 to name but a few \u2013 have all outlived multiple types of rulers and of businesses.     Independent shops in Peckham, south London. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    In this mix of complexity and incompleteness lies the possibility for those without power to assert \u201cwe are here\u201d and \u201cthis is also our city\u201d. Or, as the legendary statement by the fighting poor in Latin American cities puts it, \u201cEstamos presentes\u201d: we are present, we are not asking for money, we are just letting you know that this is also our city. It is in cities to a large extent where the powerless have left their imprint \u2013 cultural, economic, social: mostly in their own neighbourhoods, but eventually these can spread to a vaster urban zone as \u201cethnic\u201d food, music, therapies and more.    If the current buying continues, we will lose the type of making that has given our cities their cosmopolitanism    All of this cannot happen in a business park, regardless of its density \u2013 they are privately controlled spaces where low-wage workers can work, but not \u201cmake\u201d. Nor can this happen in the world\u2019s increasingly militarised plantations and mines. It is only in cities where that possibility of gaining complexity in one\u2019s powerlessness can happen \u2013 because nothing can fully control such a diversity of people and engagements. Those with power to some extent do not want to be bothered by the poor, so the model is often to abandon them to their own devices. In some cities (for example, in the US and Brazil) there is extreme violence by police. Yet this can often become a public issue, which is perhaps a first step in the longer trajectories of gaining at least some rights. It is in cities where so many of the struggles for vindications have taken place, and have, in the long run, partly succeeded. But it is this possibility \u2013 the capacity to make a history, a culture and so much more \u2013 that is today threatened by the surge in large-scale corporate re-development of cities.      Chinese property investments in London. Illustration: Knight Frank    A new phase It is easy to explain the post-2008 urban investment surge as \u201cmore of the same\u201d. After all, the late 1980s also saw rapid growth of national and foreign buying of office buildings and hotels, especially in New York and London. In The Global City, I wrote about the large share of buildings in the City of London that were foreign-owned at the height of that phase.Financial firms from countries as diverse as Japan and the Netherlands found they needed a strong foothold in London\u2019s City to access continental European capital and markets.  But an examination of the current trends shows some significant differences and points to a whole new phase in the character and logics of foreign and national corporate acquisitions. (I do not see much of a difference in terms of the urban impact between national and foreign investment. The key fact here is that both are corporate and large scale.) Four features stand out: \u2022 The sharp scale-up in the buying of buildings, even in cities that have long been the object of such investments, notably NY and London. For instance, the Chinese have most recently emerged as major buyers in cities such as London and New York. Today there are about 100 cities worldwide that have become significant destinations for such acquisitions \u2013 foreign corporate buying of properties from 2013 to 2014 grew by 248% in Amsterdam/Randstadt, 180% in Madrid and 475% in Nanjing. In contrast, the growth rate was relatively lower for the major cities in each region: 68.5% for New York, 37.6% for London, and 160.8% for Beijing. \u2022 The extent of new construction. The rapid-growth period of the 1980s and 90s was often about acquiring buildings \u2013 notably high-end Harrods in London, and Sachs Fifth Avenue and the Rockefeller Center in New York. In the post-2008 period, much buying of buildings is to destroy them and replace them with far taller, far more corporate and luxurious types of buildings \u2013 basically, luxury offices and luxury apartments. \u2022 The spread of mega-projects with vast footprints that inevitably kill much urban tissue: little streets and squares, density of street-level shops and modest offices, and so on. These megaprojects raise the density of the city, but they actually de-urbanise it \u2013 and thereby bring to the fore the fact, easily overlooked in much commentary about cities, that density is not enough to have a city. \u2022 The foreclosing on modest properties owned by modest-income households. This has reached catastrophic levels in the US, with Federal Reserve data showing that more than 14 million households have lost their homes from 2006 to 2014. One outcome is a significant amount of empty or under-occupied urban land, at least some of which is likely to be \u201cre-developed\u201d.     The proposed Atlantic Yards luxury residential towers in Brooklyn. Photograph: AP    A further striking feature of this period is the acquisition of whole blocks of underutilised or dead industrial land for site development. Here, the prices paid by buyers can get very high. One example is the acquisition of Atlantic Yards, a vast stretch of land in New York City by one of the largest Chinese building companies for $5bn. Currently, this land is occupied by a mixture of modest factories and industrial services, modest neighbourhoods, and artists\u2019 studios and venues that have been pushed out of lower Manhattan by large-scale developments of high-rise apartment buildings.    Privatisation in the 90s has resulted in a reduction of public buildings and an escalation in large, corporate ownership    This very urban mix of occupants will be thrown out and replaced by 14 formidable luxury residential towers \u2013 a sharp growth of density that actually has the effect of de-urbanising that space. It will be a sort of de facto \u201cgated\u201d space with lots of people; not the dense mix of uses and types of people we think of as \u201curban\u201d. This type of development is taking off in many cities \u2013 mostly with virtual walls, but sometimes also with real ones. I would argue that with this type of development, the virtual and the actual walls have similar impacts on de-urbanising pieces of a city. The scale and the character of these investments are captured in the vast amounts spent on buying urban properties and land. Those global, corporate investments of $600bn from mid-2013 to mid-2014, and over 1tn from mid-2014 to mid 2015, were just to acquire existing buildings. The figure excludes site development, another major trend.  This proliferating urban gigantism has been strengthened and enabled by the privatisations and deregulations that took off in the 1990s across much of the world, and have continued since then with only a few interruptions. The overall effect has been a reduction in public buildings, and an escalation in large, corporate private ownership. The result is a thinning in the texture and scale of spaces previously accessible to the public. Where before there was a government office building handling the regulations and oversight of this or that public economic sector, or addressing the complaints from the local neighbourhood, now there might be a corporate headquarters, a luxury apartment building or a guarded mall.

Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    De-urbanisation Global geographies of extraction have long been key to the western world\u2019s economic development. And now these have moved on to urban land, going well beyond the traditional association with plantations and mines, even as these have been extended and made more brutally efficient.    A large city is a frontier zone where actors from different worlds can have an encounter with no rules of engagement    The corporatising of access and control over urban land has extended not only to high-end urban sites, but also to the land beneath the homes of modest households and government offices. We are witnessing an unusually large scale of corporate buying of whole pieces of cities in the last few years. The mechanisms for these extractions are often far more complex than the outcomes, which can be quite elementary in their brutality.  One key transformation is a shift from mostly small private to large corporate modes of ownership, and from public to private. This is a process that takes place in bits and pieces, some big and some small, and to some extent these practices have long been part of the urban land market and urban development. But today\u2019s scale-up takes it all to a whole new dimension, one that alters the historic meaning of the city. This is particularly so because what was small and/or public is becoming large and private. The trend is to move from small properties embedded in city areas that are crisscrossed by streets and small public squares, to projects that erase much of this public tissue of streets and squares via mega-projects with large, sometimes huge, footprints. This privatises and de-urbanises city space no matter the added density.     There are moments in the routines of a city when we all become urban subjects ... Rush hour at King\u2019s Cross station. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    Large cities have long been complex and incomplete. This has enabled the incorporation of diverse people, logics, politics. A large, mixed city is a frontier zone where actors from different worlds can have an encounter for which there are no established rules of engagement, and where the powerless and the powerful can actually meet. This also makes cities spaces of innovations, small and large. And this includes innovations by those without power: even if they do not necessarily become powerful in the process, they produce components of a city, thus leaving a legacy that adds to its cosmopolitanism \u2013 something that few other places enable.  Such a mix of complexity and incompleteness ensures a capacity to shape an urban subject and an urban subjectivity. It can partly override the religious subject, the ethnic subject, the racialised subject and, in certain settings, also the differences of class. There are moments in the routines of a city when we all become urban subjects \u2013 rush hour is one such mix of time and space. But today, rather than a space for including people from many diverse backgrounds and cultures, our global cities are expelling people and diversity. Their new owners, often part-time inhabitants, are very international \u2013 but that does not mean they represent many diverse cultures and traditions. Instead, they represent the new global culture of the successful \u2013 and they are astoundingly homogeneous, no matter how diverse their countries of birth and languages. This is not the urban subject that our large, mixed cities have historically produced. This is, above all, a global \u201ccorporate\u201d subject.   Related: The privatisation of cities' public spaces is escalating. It is time to take a stand    Much of urban change is inevitably predicated on expelling what used to be. Since their beginnings, whether 3,000 years old or 100, cities have kept reinventing themselves, which means there are always winners and losers. Urban histories are replete with accounts of those who were once poor and quasi-outsiders, or modest middle classes, that gained ground \u2013 because cities have long accommodated extraordinary variety.  But today\u2019s large-scale corporate buying of urban space in its diverse instantiations introduces a de-urbanising dynamic. It is not adding to mixity and diversity. Instead it implants a whole new formation in our cities \u2013 in the shape of a tedious multiplication of high-rise luxury buildings.  One way of putting it is that this new set of implants contains within it a logic all of its own \u2013 one which cannot be tamed into becoming part of the logics of the traditional city. It keeps its full autonomy and, one might say, gives us all its back. And that does not look pretty.

The day before the results of his Comprehensive Spending Review, I doubt he is giving too much thought to cycling but if he did he would see the real opportunity it offers to boost the economy and lighten the load on the public purse. I am a cyclist but I am also a motorist. My family runs two cars and I drive about 25,000 miles every year. I\u2019m not a fanatical advocate, I\u2019m a realist who champions the cause of the bicycle because I believe in evidence. In fact the issue here is not about cyclists or cycling at all: it is about transport, health, pollution and the economy. The government\u2019s own figures show that physical inactivity costs Britain \u00a347bn a year \u2013 nearly \u00a31bn a week \u2013 and has been described by NHS England CEO Simon Stevens as a \u201cslow motion car crash\u201d for the service. Air pollution in our cities was responsible for more than 29,000 deaths in the UK last year. Businesses lose \u00a31.5bn to congestion in the capital. The poorest in our society don\u2019t have access to cars and many struggle to afford public transport. Cycling alone cannot solve all of these problems, but it can make a significant contribution in a way that offers outstanding value for money.  Just a few hundred miles from our shores, in cities like Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Utrecht, it\u2019s already been done. In my role as policy adviser with British Cycling, I took the cycling minister Robert Goodwill MP to Copenhagen where we joined the two-wheeled commuters on their morning journeys around the Danish capital. He was \u201cblown away\u201d by what he saw; a cleaner, healthier, happier city that was easier to navigate than anything back home. On that trip, he promised to \u201credouble efforts\u201d to ensure we get a \u201ccycling revolution\u201d. The Infrastructure Act, already law, requires a cycling and walking investment strategy and officials in the Department for Transport are working on that vision now. It could deliver national design standards and predictable, long-term funding, essential to make our roads safer and enable more people to choose cycling. I\u2019ve met these officials and believe they are doing their best to make it happen but without proper funding the strategy will just be another piece of paper.  The investment needed is modest \u2013 starting at \u00a310 per person per year, that\u2019s 0.3% of total infrastructure spend annually under the coalition government. It\u2019s 0.5% of the annual NHS budget, or around 1% of the annual cost of inactivity, and 0.1% of what we paid to bail out the banks. In short, it is a relatively tiny amount to make our towns and cities cleaner and less polluted with a healthier, happier and more prosperous population. Whether it happens, comes down to the chancellor. And he has everything he needs. The prime minister is committed to a \u2018cycling revolution\u2019 and supports our call for \u00a310 per person, backed up by manifesto commitments. He has a parliamentary majority, not that he needs it because there is clear cross-party support. The legislation to underpin long term investment has already been passed. He has seen evidence in other European capitals that prove investment works. And he has the full-throated support of businesses that know an active, healthy workforce is good for their bottom line.  Above all, the public wants it. Over 91% see physical activity as the best way to stay healthy and over 60% see cycling as the natural choice for short journeys but they are put off by concerns about safety. Segregated space for cycling would make it possible for people to make healthier choices for themselves and their families.  Having presented the evidence and tried to persuade politicians to make these decisions over the last few years, I\u2019m convinced that the only reason it hasn\u2019t happened already is because nobody in government \u2018owns\u2019 cycling \u2013 even the cycling minister has these responsibilities bolted onto the bottom of a wider portfolio that includes delivering HS2. I haven\u2019t spoken to a single person who didn\u2019t want their children to be able to ride to school - which 50% of kids in the Netherlands do - or live in a place with less traffic and pollution. And it can all happen for a modest amount of money - from funds that already exist. The chancellor can fix this and the spending review is his opportunity. We know where the prime minister and parliament stand, we know what business and the public wants. If the chancellor delivers there will still be work to do, but after years of empty gestures and unfulfilled commitments, at least we\u2019ll know where he stands.", "sentences": ["Just a few hundred miles from our shores, in cities like Amsterdam, Copenhagen and Utrecht, it\u2019s already been done."], "title": "The UK's cycling revolution won't take off without funding | Chris Boardman", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/bike-blog/2015/nov/24/the-uks-cycling-revolution-wont-take-off-without-proper-funding", "tags": ["Cycling", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-11-25T09:47:44Z", "article": "A French MP and an academic are set to defy an attempt by the Anne Frank Fonds to keep control of the copyright on Anne Frank\u2019s diary by publishing online texts of the world famous second world war account from one of the Holocaust\u2019s most recognisable victims. Anne Frank wrote her red-and-white checked diary between 12 June 1942 and 1 August 1944, charting the time she spent in hiding in an Amsterdam warehouse until three days before her family was betrayed. She died in Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, age 15, in 1945.           Watch an excerpt from the Anne Frank Fonds\u2019 digital edition of her diary    Copyright across much of Europe expires 70 years after an author\u2019s death, but the Anne Frank Fonds, the Swiss foundation established by her father Otto Frank in 1963, informed French publishers in October that the diaries would not be entering the public domain on 1 January 2016 because Otto, who died in 1980, had done so much work on the most widely published version that he had \u201cearned his own copyright\u201d. Isabelle Attard, a French MP who is preparing to publish the Dutch text online on 1 January, warns that this argument dilutes the impact of the diaries. She is prepared to go to court to defend her publication. \u201cMany revisionists, people who want to deny the extermination camps existed, have tried to attack the diary for years. Saying now the book wasn\u2019t written by Anne alone is weakening the weight it has had for decades, as a testimony to the horrors of this war,\u201d said a spokesperson for Attard. \u201cShe lost her grandparents in Nazi camps, she had uncles who were hidden like Anne Frank was \u2013 for her it is a very touchy subject, and she wanted to react and not to let the Anne Frank Fonds use its interpretation of the law.\u201d     Otto Frank in July 1941 with his daughter Anne, right, and friends attending a wedding in Amsterdam. Photograph: AP    The spokesperson added: \u201cOn 1 January, Mein Kampf will enter the public domain, and [Attard] feels the symbolism of this, Mein Kampf entering the public domain, and a counterpart, Anne Frank\u2019s diary, this very important work about the horrors of the second world war, not entering at the same time, was inacceptable for her.\u201d Olivier Ertzscheid, a lecturer at the University of Nantes, is also preparing to publish the text of the original Dutch edition of the diaries on 1 January. \u201cAll the arguments of the Anne Frank Fonds are false and legally inaccurate. Otto Frank cannot be considered a \u2018co-author\u2019 of the text,\u201d said Ertzscheid.  Earlier this year, Ertzscheid illegally published a French translation of the diaries, and was asked to take it down by its French publisher. He said his illegal publication had accomplished what he set out to do: to move the debate \u201cinto the public arena\u201d. He is now also hoping to produce a new, free French translation of the text for publication in January. At the Anne Frank Fonds, Yves Kugelmann, a member of the board of trustees, said the foundation wasn\u2019t attempting to extend copyright. \u201cAFF is merely applying to existing laws under which the diary remains protected after 2015, and has decided to inform people about it. We have made clear that in certain territories the copyright is protected for a longer time, because this is our duty.\u201d He said: \u201cOtto Frank is not the co author of the original diaries. We as a foundation have been fighting for 40 years against Holocaust deniers who have said the book is a falsification. We proved that it was not - the diary is authentic.\u201d But he added: \u201cAfter the war, Otto Frank merged, or compiled, the two versions of the Diary that Anne Frank left, that were both incomplete and that partly overlapped, into one reader friendly version. He typed over Anne Frank\u2019s manuscripts and with scissors and glue subsequently, literally, \u2018cut and pasted\u2019 them into the version that was published in English from the early fifties. The book he created earns his own copyright. For the purposes of copyright, he is to be viewed as an \u2018author\u2019 of that version. Please note, again, that this does not imply that he \u2018co-wrote\u2019 anything.\u201d   Related: Anne Frank: 10 beautiful quotes from The Diary of a Young Girl    On its website, the foundation says that Otto, along with Mirjam Pressler, who published a later adaptation in 1991, \u201cin effect created readable books from Anne Frank\u2019s original writings\u201d, and so \u201cAnne Frank\u2019s original writings, as well as the original in-print versions will remain protected for many decades\u201d. With regard to Attard and Ertzscheid\u2019s planned publications, Kugelmann said that \u201cif someone takes a risk to infringe copyright, that is their risk\u201d.  \u201cSometimes we act, sometimes we don\u2019t.

We grant rights all the time, for theatre, books, performances, films. Anyone can put a request in.\u201d At the Anne Frank Trust in the UK, chief executive Robert Posner said: \u201cWhat\u2019s most important to us, as an educational charity which works with the diary, is that it is seen as Anne Frank\u2019s own work \u2013 her writing, her work, her thoughts.

From the start he recognised the importance of the studio, which, for him, was a place set apart, purified by solitary work and remote from mundane distractions. An early photograph of him at work, taken in around 1905 in the attic of 10 Rembrandtplein, Amsterdam, is\u00a0purposively staged to convey dedication. Everything is tellingly positioned: the easel angled so as to display its painting; the artist, seated, with palette and brush in hand, as if ready to spring into action. By this date\u00a0Mondrian had begun to turn his back on Amsterdam and The Hague school; his use of simplified forms and\u00a0brighter colours signalled his allegiance to the avant garde, and in\u00a0January 1912\u00a0he moved to Paris to learn \u00a0about cubism. So keen was he\u00a0to\u00a0assimilate new ideas that he popped up regularly at gallery openings, acquiring the nickname \u201cPiet-zie-je-me\u00a0niet\u201d (Piet-can\u2019t-you-see-me). He\u00a0also found a studio near the Gare Montparnasse, at\u00a026 Rue du D\u00e9part, which, in time, became his most famous workplace. This new book, a compilation of\u00a0texts and images, explores the connection between Mondrian\u2019s experiments with colour and space and\u00a0his use of his studios as laboratories for these experiments. The\u00a0studios become statements of his artistic and philosophical ideas. The project builds upon Frans Postma\u2019s reconstruction of the Rue du D\u00e9part studio, as it was in 1926, and expands on the investigations previously encountered through the 2014 Tate Liverpool exhibition, Mondrian and His Studios. In the summer of 1914 Mondrian made what he thought was a temporary return to the Netherlands. His father was ill and he needed to oversee an exhibition of his work. Trapped there by the onset of war, he assumed, like many others, that the conflict would not last long, and for a considerable period he went on paying rent on his Parisian studio. But another five years passed before he could return. This unexpected confinement, spent mostly in an artists\u2019 colony in Laren, proved to be extremely productive. Without this period, it is argued, he would never have become the world-renowned artist he is today. In Laren his studios were mostly wooden huts. One was so damp that his colours could not dry properly. But he resumed his interest in theosophy. He had first joined Amsterdam\u2019s Theosophical Society in\u00a01909. Now he pursued this interest through the local Gooische Lodge. He\u00a0met the artists Theo van Doesburg and Bart van\u00a0der Leck, and his own artistic philosophy evolved further. Soon, lofty theosophical ideas meshed with the modernist style associated with the De\u00a0Stijl movement. One objective of the lodge was to \u201cform the nucleus of a\u00a0Universal Brotherhood of Humanity, without distinction of race, creed, sex, caste or\u00a0colour\u201d, while Mondrian and Van Doesburg wanted to arrive at neoplasticism, an abstract universal language of art that would transcend barriers of class, education or nationality. Sadly, when Mondrian delivered a\u00a0lecture to the lodge on \u201cNeoplasticism in Painting\u201d it met with\u00a0complete incomprehension. Back in Paris in 1919, he found a workplace in the Rue de Coulmiers. But in 1921 his former studio in the Rue du D\u00e9part became available again and he moved back in. Believing that the aesthetic associated with neoplasticism, with its use of primary colours and straight lines, would lead to an all-encompassing unity within the arts and architecture, he wanted his studio to form a quiet haven, a harmonious whole. The positioning of\u00a0furniture was, in his eyes, as important as its colour and shape. He\u00a0cleverly used a large plain black cupboard with a white easel next to it\u00a0to form a partition. This created the illusion that the space was rectangular when it was in fact polygonal. The contents of the room were stripped down to basic needs. Its\u00a0ornamentation was mostly confined to painted squares and rectangles of primary colours hung on the walls, echoing the\u00a0coloured shapes in his now purely abstract paintings. The floor was black but the light, bouncing off the white ceiling, made the room seem light and airy. \u201cParis is good for me,\u201d Mondrian wrote in 1922, \u201cand my studio pleases me.\u201d Elsewhere he referred to it as his \u201csmall sanctuary\u201d. Again he brought in a photographer, and publicised the studio through a magazine. From then on he received an\u00a0array of international visitors and it became a modernist mecca. Although a\u00a0very private man, he was not a recluse, and loved to go to dance halls. He had briefly been engaged, and when he moved from Laren to Paris a female friend had wanted to accompany him, but he forbade it. He formed no lasting relationship except with his art. And it was for the safety of his art that he eventually agreed to subsequent moves: first to London in 1938, after he\u00a0learned that some of his work had been shown in Hitler\u2019s degenerate art exhibition; and then, after the blitz began in London, to America, his pictures travelling there ahead of him. He was 68 when he arrived in Manhattan in September 1940. He spent his first three years living and working in a small narrow room. In September 1943 he moved to 15 East 59th Street and gained more space \u2013 a separate kitchen, bathroom and bedroom, in addition to the studio room. Again he created an environment closely related to his work, decorating the walls, as he had done before, with coloured boards and making much of the furniture himself out of wooden crates. He claimed that this final studio was the most agreeable and stimulating environment he had ever lived in. He only enjoyed it for five months, as he died of untreated pneumonia on 1 February 1944. \u2022 To order Piet Mondrian: The Studios for \u00a323.96 (RRP \u00a329.95) go to bookshop.theguardian.com or call 0330 333 6846.

In the summer, tour parties weave through the Dutch town\u2019s cobbled streets ticking off Vermeer landmarks. But until last week only the most devoted would have made a trip to the handsome townhouse at No 42 Vlamingstraat, noting that the artist\u2019s aunt, Ariaentgen Claes van der Minne, once lived in the same spot and made her living selling tripe. All that, however, has now changed. After two years of painstaking detective work, a Dutch art historian has identified the spot as the location of Vermeer\u2019s Little Street, resolving a century-old mystery. \u201cThe whole street\u2019s been talking about it,\u201d said Lenie Gerbrands, whose house stands beside the spot where Vermeer sat four centuries ago, painting his aunt\u2019s house across the water. \u201cIt\u2019s a good piece of news to have in these difficult times. It\u2019ll give the area a lift.\u201d Historians have been trying to identify the Little Street ever since Amsterdam\u2019s Rijksmuseum acquired the painting, formally known as View of Houses in Delft, in 1921. Frans Grijzenhout, professor of art history at Amsterdam University, spent many months combing through land registers and legal documents to pinpoint the location.     A reconstruction of Vermeer\u2019s scene, at the location of the Little Street, as identified by a Dutch art historian. Photograph: Olivier Middendorp    His quest began when he came across a tax ledger dating from 1667 that gave exact measurements of the canals and houses in the town. The information was used to calculate how much households should pay towards the upkeep of the waterways. Grijzenhout realised it could be the key to identifying several well-known Delft street scenes. In the 17th century Vlamingstraat was the heart of a poor neighbourhood, named after the Flemish migrants who lived there. Vermeer knew it well, having grown up in poverty nearby. His aunt and his sister both lived by the canal.  But almost nothing is left of the scene that Vermeer painted in 1658 or thereabouts. His aunt\u2019s house at No 42, with its crow-stepped gables and the passageway known as De Penspoort (Tripe Gate), was torn down in around 1870. The house to its left has also been demolished and replaced. All that remains from Vermeer\u2019s time is the canal itself, just out of view in the painting, and the doorway leading to Tripe Gate. Historians could tell from the light in the painting that the facade of No 42 faced south-east, while the distance between painter and subject indicated it was a canal street rather than an alleyway. The distinctive double doorway between the houses was another significant pointer. Finally, the style of the house in Vermeer\u2019s painting predated a devastating fire that raged through Delft in 1536, destroying much of the street.     Vermeer\u2019s Little Street. Photograph: Frans Pegt/Rijksmuseum    \u201cWe think of Delft as an old town, but most of the buildings date from the 18th or 19th century,\u201d said Grijzenhout. \u201cWhen I first stood opposite the house two years ago I couldn\u2019t see any of the features in the painting. But the dimensions of the house at No 42, the height and width, combined with the two doorways, matched the details in the book. I knew this had to be the place.\u201d The clincher came when he found a map in Delft\u2019s Prinsenhof museum made after the 1536 fire, which showed that No 42 Vlamingstraat was one of the few buildings in the area to have survived.

Photograph: Olivier Middendorp    The historian first visited the house back in February, but kept his true purpose a secret. \u201cI wanted to be absolutely sure before I told the owners,\u201d Grijzenhout said. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t want to burden them with the knowledge. They were very friendly and helpful, but people find it difficult to keep these things secret.\u201d Grijzenhout kept up the pretence for several months. \u201cHe told us he was researching 19th-century buildings in the area,\u201d said Myra Hillebrink, who lives in the house with her husband, Gijs, and their four children. \u201cThen he came back in September with a copy of the painting and said: \u2018Do you recognise this? This is where it was painted.\u2019\u201d Hillebrink, 46, has already had a taste of her home\u2019s new fame, having seen tourists and journalists tramp through the street in the days after the news broke. \u201cI have to say we were taken aback by the response,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s very special to have this connection and the children are very excited about it, but I\u2019m wondering when the hype will die down.\u201d Grijzenhout\u2019s biggest source of doubt was the fact that the house had a family connection with Vermeer. \u201cPeople thought it was naive or stupid to suppose it was the house just because his aunt lived there,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seemed too good to be true. But it turns out it was correct. Vermeer was probably inspired by the memories he had of growing up in the area. The people in the painting aren\u2019t models or members of his family; they\u2019re not portraits. It\u2019s just a typical street scene.\u201d Delft\u2019s tourism officials are already discussing how to market the latest addition to the Vermeer canon. Tourist maps are being redrawn: until now most gave the probable location as Nieuwe Langendijk, a filled-in canal street running parallel to Vlamingstraat.  \u201cIt\u2019s an opportunity for the whole town,\u201d said Marjan den Boer of Marketing Delft. \u201cDelft has three big selling points: the porcelain, William of Orange and Johannes Vermeer. The Japanese especially go in for Vermeer, I\u2019m not quite sure why, but we get visitors from all over the world.

Related: The European commission consults all stakeholders on TTIP, not just business | Letters    The US has banned fossil fuel exports for 40 years but the policy was relaxed towards Mexico in August. Previous leaks of TTIP documents have revealed the EU is pressing for a guarantee in the trade deal that the US will allow free export of oil and gas to Europe, alarming environmentalists who fear imports would impact on the EU\u2019s climate change plans. It would cost $100bn to build the infrastructure necessary to export the US fossil fuels, according to industry estimates, also released in the freedom of information trawl.  Campaigners said the documents and emails obtained by the Guardian showed an extraordinary and shocking relationship between the EU and industry over the fossil fuel push. \u201cThis is an extraordinary glimpse into the full degree of collusion between the European commission and multinational corporations seeking to use TTIP to increase US exports of fossil fuels,\u201d said John Hilary, the director of War on Want. \u201cThe commission is allowing the oil majors to write the proposed energy chapter of TTIP in their favour.\u201d The Green MEP Ska Keller, who stood against Jean-Claude Juncker in last year\u2019s presidential elections, said she was astonished by the degree of complicity between Brussels and fossil fuel companies. \u201cThe documents reveal a shocking closeness between business interest groups and the commission,\u201d she said. \u201cI am now wondering who actually writes the EU\u2019s draft texts. It seems to be big corporations who only have profits on their mind. The commission needs to stop being the executive arm of the business lobby.\u201d At a meeting in September 2013, EU trade officials gave a briefing on the state of TTIP talks to two trade groups and 11 oil and gas companies \u2013 including Shell, BP and ExxonMobil. \u201cWe asked Europia [the European oil refiners\u2019 association] for further support for the raw materials and energy chapter and for further concrete input, whereby we made a reference to the text for the UA [EU-Ukraine free trade agreement], also explaining this was a compromise text and not our preferred outcome,\u201d the officials\u2019 minutes say. Europia replied that it would try to \u201cprovide further suggestions\u201d. The organisation, which has since been renamed Fuels Europe, was unable to locate any officials who attended the meeting, or documents that arose from it, when contacted by the Guardian. But John Cooper, the group\u2019s director, said that its \u201ctwo wishes\u201d were for full access to crude oil, and a more developed gas market allowing price equalisation between the EU and US.  \u201cIn order to navigate this difficult space, the EU needs to be very well informed and the expertise is substantially in the industry,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is an understanding and an alignment over the broad objectives, so it makes a great deal of sense to support the EU institutions.\u201d  Brussels officials deny that Europia was asked to provide wording for the TTIP text, and say they also ask civil society groups for support. \u201cTo enrich our negotiating position, we take input from experts in the real world,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cWe try to understand what are the trade barriers that they face, and what opportunities they could have in new markets.\u201d Minutes of a meeting with Cefic, a chemicals trade association whose members include BP, Chevron and ExxonMobil, indicate that the costs of enabling US exports of shale gas, liquefied natural gas and crude oil could be punishing. \u201cThe company [sic] projects $100bn investments in the US [to enable US exports of oil and gas to the EU], of which 40% to be deployed in the next five years,\u201d one email report of a meeting with the group says. \u201cSuch investment requires legal certainty on the trade side.\u201d One million 10MW windfarms, with a combined generating capacity of around 1 Terrawatt could be provided for the same money, the European Renewable Energy Foundation estimates. The pace and breadth of the EU\u2019s meetings with the fossil fuel sector intensified in 2014, as transatlantic negotiations progressed. An internal note about one meeting in April 2014, said that BusinessEurope, an employers\u2019 confederation seen as hostile to climate action, was interested in \u201cthe process and substance\u201d of the talks. \u201cBE also interested in potential interlocutors in Washington, DC (at State [Department], DoE [Department of Energy]),\u201d the note reads. \u201cWe will follow-up by providing some useful contact points in Washington.\u201d A commission spokesman said that the contacts were provided as a \u201ccommon courtesy\u201d.  But BusinessEurope has opposed clean energy targets and carbon market reform, stoking tensions with greener companies, environmental groups and the UK business group, the CBI. The trawl of documents was heavily redacted in line with a Juncker commission trend, particularly where TTIP requests are concerned.  A covering letter from EU officials said that redactions in one report of a meeting between the US oil giant ExxonMobil and the EU\u2019s trade commissioner \u201creveal possible strategies that the Commission may adopt in the ongoing negotiations with the United States on TTIP\u201d.  If the public saw them, \u201cthe commission\u2019s tactical options would be exposed,\u201d the letter says. The commission denies sharing any confidential information with ExxonMobil, and says the lengthy redactions were necessary to protect internal commentary.

In other Adele news, six days since the release of 25 and sales continue to pile up. In the US, sales passed the 3m mark, Nielsen Music \u2013 the US charts compiler \u2013 announced on Thursday. That makes it the biggest first-week seller by more than half a million, leaving *NSYNC\u2019s previous record of 2.42m way behind. In the UK, according to figures revealed by the Official Charts Company, the singer has now passed the week-one sales record held by Oasis. UK sales of her third album stood at 737,000 as of Thursday morning, shifting more units than Oasis with Be Here Now in 1997, which sold 696,000. This comparison is not entirely fair, however: the Britpop band\u2019s album was released on a Thursday, so only had three days of sales registering towards its first chart week, compared to Adele\u2019s six.  Based on these figures, though, Adele\u2019s album is already way ahead compared to her previous releases. Her last album, 2011\u2019s 21, sold 208,000 copies in its first week, and passed 500,000 sales in its fourth week on sale. Her 2008 debut, 19, sold 73,000 copies in its first week on release in February. It hit the 500,000 sales mark after 53 weeks on sale. Whether the slow-burning success of her former records will apply to this current album is yet to be seen, however.  Meanwhile, across the pond, the singer\u2019s third album has already shifted 2.3m copies.

Ronny Deila will not even have the Champions League\u2019s poor relation to fall back on as evidence of alleged progress as this season meanders on. And that is precisely what it will do in Glasgow\u2019s East End as Celtic retain the Scottish top flight without credible opposition. Ajax deserved their success, as belatedly as it arrived. For Celtic, it was all too familiar. Cerny\u2019s winner compounded a situation that was already irretrievable for Deila because of Fenerbahce\u2019s win in Molde. With two points from five matches, Celtic deserve nothing other than elimination. Deila continually cited \u201csmall details\u201d during post-match media duties for failings against continental opposition. \u201cWe are going to be ready next year,\u201d he insisted. The problem is, this all sounds rather predictable. Very little of what Deila preaches is backed up by substance. Deila, after all, entered this match with a record showing only two wins from 12 Europa League games as Celtic\u2019s manager. There remains a question over whether the Norwegian should next summer be handed a third opportunity to guide the club towards the Champions League. After two dismal efforts, so there should be.   Related: Celtic captain Scott Brown set to miss three months with knee injury    Such conversation could wait. Celtic hosted Ajax minus the midfield experience of Stefan Johansen, Kris Commons, Nir Bitton and Scott Brown, the captain. For all that may have triggered trepidation among the home support, Ajax\u2019s shortcomings, as exposed by Celtic in Amsterdam, could not be ignored. Yet it took Celtic only three minutes to seize initiative. Callum McGregor, a beneficiary of Deila\u2019s enforced shuffling, collected the ball after neat midfield play involving Stuart Armstrong, Tom Rogic and Gary Mackay-Steven. McGregor stepped forward and curled a sublime, right-footed shot past Jasper Cillessen from 20 yards. An errant flag denied Ajax a swift equaliser. Amin Younes was wrongly adjudged to be offside before playing the ball to Viktor Fischer, who lashed the ball beyond Craig Gordon anyway. There was to be a route back into proceedings for the visitors though. Sloppy Celtic midfield play conceded the ball cheaply, which culminated in a chance for Fischer. While he fluffed that, Fischer looped a subsequent header goalwards; as Celtic failed to clear their lines, Arkadiusz Milik prodded home. The equaliser prompted a concerted spell of Ajax possession yet Gordon was untroubled. On the rare occasions before the interval in which Celtic did attack, they carried a menace of their own. Leigh Griffiths, for example, should have done better with a 42nd-minute chance. Wastefulness and selfishness were the story of Griffiths\u2019s night. When second-half football broke out, Ajax played it but were guilty of being over-elaborate. The Dutch team also displayed a fondness for attacking via Celtic\u2019s right side, which offered both a nod to Mikael Lustig\u2019s perceived vulnerability and a respect to the hosts\u2019 teenage left-back, Kieran Tierney. Nevertheless, Celtic retained a threat. One of their substitutes almost triggered a breakthrough. Scott Allan\u2019s first act was to play a wonderful through pass to Griffiths, who had time and space to beat Cillessen. Instead, the striker snatched at his key moment.

By scanning the brains of people who regularly smoked skunk-like cannabis, researchers at King\u2019s College London observed subtle differences in the white matter that connects the left and right hemispheres and carries signals from one side of the brain to the other. People who did not use cannabis, or who used low-potency cannabis, did not show these differences. While the scientists are unable to say what these changes might mean for the individual cannabis user, the study does suggest it leads to a \u201cless efficient\u201d transfer of information in the brain (talk about stating the obvious, that\u2019s why people smoke it \u2026 etc, etc).   Related: The burning conservative case for legalising cannabis | Avinash Tharoor    It is helpful to have studies that are looking at the effects of cannabis potency on brain structure, even when, anecdotally at least, we know that skunk can be harmful. It has been at least a decade since the market became flooded with stronger strains created by selective breeding. Many of us know someone who has smoked themselves stupid and are more than likely picturing said stoner mate now (if you\u2019re wearing the same pair of trackies you\u2019ve had on since Tuesday, and are desultorily picking at an old bowl of breakfast Bombay mix as you prepare to skin up, then that person is probably you). Every cannabis user in Britain is aware of how difficult it is to obtain decent quality grass or hash these days and how different an evening can be depending upon what you are able to pick up \u2013 be it a nice, mellow high or the feeling of being whacked around the head with a pillowcase full of spanners. Equally, every cannabis user knows how quickly a switch can be flicked to go from crying with laughter to standing in the bathroom having a panic attack, or lying in the dark counting the beat, beat, beat of your heart, terrified it will stop. \u201cWhen it came to my mental health, no drug has given me more concern than weed,\u201d a friend who has tried pretty much everything once told me. For many young people heavy skunk use begins during the teenage and university years, while their brains are still developing. I know people who were heavy cannabis smokers during this time in their lives who are fine, functional members of society; I know others who have been plagued by paranoia and anxiety attacks. A former boss of mine could not go into supermarkets alone. Another old friend, who I bumped into on the street, has become practically non-verbal. I have seen how difficult it can be to have a relationship with someone who is stoned all the time and can barely continue a line of conversation. I\u2019m also aware how on any given day weed can provide a blessed respite in a stressful or painful time, but the next can latch on to any mental health problems you may be experiencing and make your fear, anxiety or sadness so much worse.   Related: Why are drugs illegal? You asked Google \u2013 here\u2019s the answer | David Nutt    I\u2019m not talking about spacey, Cheech and Chong, Camberwell carrot, baby boomer bud here \u2013 that\u2019s only 2-4 % THC. Potent cannabis contains more like 10-14%, so it\u2019s no wonder it messes some people up. I\u2019m wary of discussing the negative effects of skunk, because so often headlines about \u201csuper skunk\u201d are used as scare tactics to support the case against legalisation. It\u2019s stupid, because skunk\u2019s wide availability is largely down to the current legislation and the consequent difficulty in obtaining milder strains. I recently went to Amsterdam with my father, who has MS, and he was overjoyed to be able to smoke hash that he hadn\u2019t seen in Britain since the 1970s. More than 2 million people in Britain smoked cannabis last year, and last month private analysis by the Treasury found that legalising cannabis would raise taxes worth hundreds of millions of pounds. The savings to the criminal justice system would be enormous. Anyone who has come into contact with people who either use cannabis as pain relief or grow it for people who do knows the argument for legalisation is not just persuasive but a matter of social duty to those whose quality of life can be unbearable as a result of chronic illness. In addition, it\u2019s embarrassing that we are actually behind the US on a progressive issue. Which is why it\u2019s important that we acknowledge the potential dangers of certain strains of cannabis too. As Charlie Graham-Dixon wrote in a Vice magazine article discussing his teenage stoner habits: \u201cGetting high can be a lot of fun, but let\u2019s not pretend that smoking a load of skunk doesn\u2019t fuck you up.\u201d So often the polarised nature of this debate means that any suggestion that cannabis can be bad for you is met with kneejerk dismissal. Admitting that it can be is an important step towards adding nuance to a discussion that affects the health and wellbeing of those involved. Alcohol and tobacco are worse, yes, but neither is marijuana a miracle drug.", "sentences": ["I recently went to Amsterdam with my father, who has MS, and he was overjoyed to be able to smoke hash that he hadn\u2019t seen in Britain since the 1970s."], "title": "Until cannabis is legalised, users will risk brain damage | Rhiannon Lucy Cosslett", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/nov/27/cannabis-legalised-brain-damage-skunk", "tags": ["Cannabis", "Drugs", "Society", "Drugs", "UK news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-11-28T12:00:10Z", "article": "What is modernity and when did it begin? The answer depends a lot on the nationality and specialism of the historian you ask. Italians favour the achievements of Renaissance art and humanism, as early as the 14th century; northern Europeans opt for the period when cities such as Amsterdam, Paris and London rose to economic and cultural prominence, from the early 16th through to the 18th centuries; some historians of Germany would go as late as 1900. Philosophers are likely to zero in on Descartes in the mid-17th century; economists hold out for the industrial revolution in the late 18th century; political historians push for the American and French revolutions. Beyond Europe, many more periods and places jostle for attention. Everyone has a dog in this fight. David Wootton\u2019s answer is unequivocal: modernity began with the scientific revolution in Europe, bookended by the dates 1572 (when the Danish astronomer Tycho Brahe identified a new star in the heavens) and 1704 (when Isaac Newton published Opticks). This was \u201cthe most important transformation in human history\u201d since the Neolithic era. Later events such as the industrial revolution were\u00a0no more than the extended consequences of the biggest revolution of them all. Wootton is equally clear about whether the scientific revolution was a\u00a0matter for celebration (as most Enlightenment thinkers saw it) or regret (as some Romantics felt): it was, in his view, a very good thing indeed. Compressed into a few sentences, the major theses of this book sound unsurprising. The scientific revolution was not just the motor of modern history, it was the model of modernity. Rational, calculating, advancing at breakneck speed, respecting no authority: science after Newton seemed to embody the power and ever expanding possibilities of a society fixated on the future rather than the past. This is the narrative upon which university professorships and whole departments of the history of science were established after the second world war, and the narrative that a whole generation of historians of\u00a0science were weaned on. Yet Wootton believes that historians of what he calls the \u201cpost-Kuhn generation\u201d (after the American historian Thomas Kuhn\u2019s influential Structure of Scientific Revolutions, which recast the history of science in the mould of evolution rather than progress) \u2013 that is, roughly those who came of age in the 1980s and 90s \u2013 have broken with the faith and denied the scientific revolution\u2019s significance as \u201cthe big bang\u201d moment of modernity, querying each one of those three words. While they maintain that the understanding of nature was transformed in early modern Europe, recent research on many fronts \u2013 anatomy, astronomy, natural history, chemistry, mechanics, physics, medicine, civil and military engineering \u2013 has cast doubt on whether these changes constituted a \u201cbig bang\u201d. Wootton\u2019s aim is to offer a new interpretation of what he contends still deserves to be called the scientific revolution. This makes for a big book, with some historiographical chapters (and appendices) that are unlikely to be of interest to readers who are not historians of science over the age of 50. At its core, however, are remarkable essays on the vocabulary of the age of\u00a0discovery, including terms such as facts, experiments, laws, hypotheses, theories, evidence and judgment. Drawing on a dazzling array of texts, Wootton traces a dawning consciousness that natural knowledge need not be certain to be reliable; that pell-mell experience can be systematised and sharpened by observation and experiment; and that empirical inquiry is of necessity collective. The great strength of this approach is also its weakness: it is all about texts. If there was one thing the 17th-century proponents of the new philosophy were adamant about, it was that their ways of thinking were about things as well as words. Wootton mentions in passing that improvements in, for example, glass-blowing were a precondition for early experiments on air pressure, and he is alert to how double-entry bookkeeping may have provided a template for other sorts of mathematical abstraction. Yet he underplays how practices such as keeping a commonplace book and achieving high temperatures in a furnace were creatively adapted to new purposes. These connections provide the strongest evidence both for the continuity of new knowledge with old, and for its exuberant originality in hybridising scholarly and practical skills. Anyone who argues for a sharp and momentous historical discontinuity must come up with causes. Why then? Why there? Wootton\u2019s candidates are plausible enough and chime with older explanations: the role of the printing press in circulating ideas, discoveries and news more widely and quickly; the consequent expansion of a community that could criticise, compete and cooperate in inquiry; the crafting of new methods to probe hidden causes and test hypotheses. But this can\u2019t be the whole story. The printing press, like the internet, spread at least as much misinformation as information; medieval scholars constituted a competitive, critical and cooperative international community; and if, by around 1730, educated Europeans had\u00a0put aside their belief in witches, it\u00a0wasn\u2019t because science had decided the question. Wootton is committed to making the scientific revolution both discontinuous with all that came before and continuous with all that followed. This leads him to make some odd claims: for example, that the empirical inquiries of Aristotle into organic life\u00a0or\u00a0the physico-mathematical achievements of Archimedes were of qualitatively different sort from those of early modern and modern naturalists, despite the countervailing testimony of the likes of Galileo and Georges Cuvier, who recognised kindred spirits across the centuries. Still more curious is Wootton\u2019s insistence that the tracks for modern science were laid down in the 17th century and that it has simply been chugging along ever since. The extravagant fertility of science suggests otherwise. Since 1704 it has produced not only new discoveries and theories, but also new ways of knowing. Today\u2019s computer simulations, for example, are as novel a transformation of scientific experience as experiments were in the 17th century. Science was not invented once, but over and over again: the model not only of progress, but work in progress. \u2022 Lorraine Daston is director of the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin.

The question is that question, the one that female conductors are always asked, namely: \u201cWhy aren\u2019t there more of you?\u201d  Today it is announced that Zhang is the BBC National Orchestra of Wales\u2019s new principal guest conductor, a role which will make her one of the UK\u2019s most prominent female conductors \u2013 she\u2019s the first woman to have a titled conducting role with a BBC orchestra \u2013 and which means she\u2019s going to be asked about the representation of her gender in the echelons in the conducting profession a great deal.    \u201cThe more we ask these questions, the more people will get used to the idea of women conducting, and this will speed up the process of getting more women into the profession. We need to bring up the number of female of conductors. There are not enough girls doing it well as professionals. Once there are more, then we can judge how good they are,\u201d she says.    When girls see other women doing this job, they will feel that they can do it too.    Xian Zhang is already a hugely successful and acclaimed conductor. She has a long relationship with the New York Philharmonic, regularly works with Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and the London Symphony Orchestra, has recently been leading La Boh\u00e8me at English National Opera, and will join BBCNOW from September 2016. Unlike in the west, where the vast majority of conducting mentors in conservatoires and colleges are men, in China, Zhang had two female conducting teachers, and didn\u2019t think about the gender issue. It was only when she moved to Europe and America that she saw there was even a problem. \u201cI looked around and realised: \u2018Oh, maybe I\u2019m the only girl here.\u2019 It never occurred to me before. But when girls see other women doing this job, they will feel that they can do it too.\u201d  Born in Dandong, China, Zhang made her professional debut conducting The Marriage of Figaro at the Central Opera House in Beijing aged 20. She trained at Beijing\u2019s Central Conservatory, and moved to the US in 1998. She was appointed the New York Philharmonic\u2019s assistant conductor in 2002, subsequently becoming their associate conductor and the first holder of the Arturo Toscanini chair. As she begins her Welsh role, she will be shuttling across the Atlantic \u2013 another new appointment, as music director of New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, starts the same season. Since 2009 she\u2019s been music director of Milan\u2019s Giuseppe Verdi Symphony Orchestra in Milan. There, she says she had to convince audiences as well as musicians, but believes they have formed a relationship with her because she is a mother. \u201cI became close to them, and I felt strong support, because they respect mothers very much, and they love children\u201d.      \u2018Most other orchestras are passive. The BBCNOW musicians want to be really involved.\u2019Xian Zhang. Photograph: B Ealovega/PR    During Zhang\u2019s three-year appointment in Cardiff, she will conduct the BBC orchestra in annual concerts at BBC Hoddinott Hall, St David\u2019s Hall and Brangwyn Hall, with repertoire featuring Tchaikovsky, Shostakovich, Rimsky-Korsakov and Berlioz in her first season. BBCNOW will also perform at the Proms under Zhang\u2019s baton during her tenure and embark on an \u201con the road\u201d tour around Wales.  She is full of admiration for the technical prowess of the Welsh orchestra: working on Saint-Sa\u00ebns\u2019s Organ Symphony with them, she says \u201cthe opening of the first movement is very hard to get it right, to get it clean, but they had it from the first reading \u2013 wow!\u201d And she praises the way the musicians rehearse: \u201cThey are willing to ask your thoughts as a conductor on sound, on interpretation; they are actually curious to find out why you are doing things they way you are. That\u2019s really special, because most other orchestras are more passive, and will just sit there. These musicians want to be really involved.\u201d Zhang is also looking forward to planning more adventurous programmes with the NOW players than she is able to with her orchestra in Milan: exploring contemporary Chinese music such as Qigang Chen\u2019s, whose work she brought to the Proms with the BBCNOW last summer, and to working with young Welsh composers, as well as performing the big romantic Russian and French repertoire in which she has built up a stellar reputation.  She is having a honeymoon not just with the orchestra, but with Welsh audiences too. \u201cThe people are so down to earth, and so warm. They are very open-minded. I feel very comfortable in Welsh culture.\u201d The country is lucky to have her energy, insight, and open-hearted enthusiasm on the podium, as well as her perspicacity as a cultural leader.", "sentences": ["She has a long relationship with the New York Philharmonic, regularly works with Concertgebouw in Amsterdam and the London Symphony Orchestra, has recently been leading La Boh\u00e8me at English National Opera, and will join BBCNOW from September 2016."], "title": "Xian Zhang makes conducting history as first woman to have titled role at a BBC orchestra", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/dec/01/xian-zhang-bbc-first-woman-principal-guest-conductor-now-national-orchestra-of-wales-interview", "tags": ["Classical music", "BBC National Orchestra of Wales", "BBC", "Gender", "Culture", "Wales", "Media", "Music", "Cardiff", "UK news", "Women", "Life and style"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-12-04T12:00:20Z", "article": "After the Renaissance and before the dictators lies a long stretch of European history untouched by the national curriculum. The Victoria and Albert Museum\u2019s market research revealed that most people know little about the period, its personalities or even its events, with the exception of the French Revolution. Yet the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries were hardly uneventful in Europe. The continent withstood dizzying bloodshed, Reformation and Counter-Reformation, wars of religion, inquisitions, witch-craze, plague and famine, the rise and fall of dynasties, the materialisation of nation states, an explosion of global trade, colonialism, scientific revolution, the Enlightenment, the emergence of manufacturing powers, the establishment of the fashion cycle and the flowering of consumer societies. And Europe was no monolithic entity. It stretched from Ireland to the Urals, from Iceland to the Azores, from Scotland to the Ottoman lands.    My pleasure is not to think about the gold in my coffers but to spend it  Madame de  Pomp\u00adadour     The V&amp;A\u2019s newly redesigned Europe 1600-1815 galleries aim to capture a flavour of that diversity and change in more than a thousand high-design objects. By the time visitors leave the museum, the lead curator Lesley Miller promises, they \u201cwill have encountered the likenesses of Madame de Montespan, Madame de Pompadour, Marie Antoinette, Peter the Great and Jean-Paul Marat, the work of artists and designers working in Dresden, Lisbon, Paris, Rome and St Petersburg, the major styles of the era, and the major conflicts that reconfigured Europe.\u201d The intellectual blueprint is shaped by three aims. First, to showcase the rise of France as international leader in luxury goods. Second, to uncover the roots of a recognisably modern lifestyle, from seasonal fashion and the comparative democratisation of luxury to ideals of domestic comfort and intimacy, the structure of meals and new rituals such as taking tea, coffee and chocolate. And third, to lay bare the extent to which Europe was entwined with the rest of the world, systematically exploiting resources from colonised continents, as well as designs from distant empires. The overarching narrative is the decline of Italy as the leading producer of luxury and the rise and reign of France as European superpower and fashion leader. French supremacy in exquisite manufactures in the 17th and 18th century is undisputed, so the gallery\u2019s argument holds water; it is serendipitous that the great bulk of the V&amp;A\u2019s European collection is French. The museum\u2019s holdings reflect a major donation from the Victorian collector John Jones (who made his money as a tailor in the Crimean war), as well as historic acquisition priorities. French furniture was especially revered by 19th- and early 20th-century connoisseurs.     \u2018La Nature\u2019  by Louis-Simon Boizot, 1794    Visitors can also wander off the narrative path and linger in immersive galleries, a cabinet of curiosities, a Venetian masquerade experience, a restful wooden structure evoking the Enlightenment, or listen to extracts from Casanova\u2019s memoirs or Charles Perrault\u2019s Cinderella. Starting with a blank slate, one might map the cultural and design history of Europe with more Spanish, Portuguese, Belgian, Dutch, Swedish, Russian, Ottoman and British goods, and include Asian imports, scientific instruments and natural curiosities as well as luxury goods. However, the raison d\u2019etre of the V&amp;A\u2019s primary galleries is to showcase the holdings, not loans, and the museum is not in the business of replicating what can be seen elsewhere \u2013 across the road at the Science Museum and Natural History Museum, or in other V&amp;A displays such as the British or South Asian galleries. Art historians might quibble with the use of stylistic terms that were not in use at the time, such as baroque, rococo and neoclassical, but they are vital building blocks for the uninitiated. The design of the galleries aims to orient the visitor, so our promenade opens in a sumptuous purple hall with Catholic Italy and the baroque, then on to Bourbon blue for French pre-eminence, lighter apple green for the playful rococo and cooler grey for the classical revival. Leadership in fashion and dominion over territory do not inevitably march hand in hand. Though Counter-Reformation Rome might have led taste in 1600, it was Spain, France and the Islamic Ottoman empire that battled for European domination. Spain was the first global superpower, but through the 17th century its European territories were shorn by the Dutch revolt (1568-1648) and the thirty years\u2019 war (1618-48), its once invincible armies defeated by Dutch and Swedish military techniques, and its coffers depleted by the dwindling returns of South American mines. Seville lost out to the bustling ports and merchant marines of the north. Amsterdam displaced Antwerp as Europe\u2019s global entrepot. Britannia seized control of the waves from the Dutch in the 18th century, but one dominant military, economic and cultural power emerged in the 17th century: France.     Oil painting of Marie Antoinette by Fran\u00e7ois Hubert Drouais (1773)    From the early 1660s, Louis XIV mobilised France\u2019s enormous reserves of wealth and people \u2013 with 12 million people, France was by far the most populous state in Europe; England had only 5 million \u2013 behind a large and ultra-efficient army and a programme of territorial aggrandisement inspired by a self-confident and aggressive Roman Catholicism. Absolute monarchy as epitomised by the Sun King was seen as the most modern form of government, and a model across the continent. As Frederick the Great of Prussia later observed of European royalty, \u201cThere is not one of them, down to the youngest son ... who does not preen himself on some resemblance to Louis XIV: he builds his Versailles; he has his mistresses; he maintains his standing armies.\u201d The Hapsburgs built Sch\u00f6nbrunn Palace, Frederick his Sanssouci, and Catherine the Great her summer palace, Tsarskoe Selo. Louis\u2019s grandeur was built on a mercantilist economic policy and a deliberate campaign to establish competitive industries. \u201cTrading companies are the armies of the king,\u201d bragged his chief minister, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, \u201cand the manufactures of France are his reserves.\u201d State initiatives, the release of big cloth merchants from guild regulations and several hundred Manufactures Royales established Paris as the metropolis of European luxury production. With its immense capacity for courtiers, Versailles was a great showcase for French interior decoration, fine art, landscape, design, dress, deportment and manners that set the benchmark for other European courts and rich elites. \u201cToday we want everything to be French. French clothes, French dishes, French furniture,\u201d wrote the German lawyer and philosopher Christian Thomasius in 1683. The reign of the Sun King was the apogee of \u201cthe French century\u201d, but by the turn of 18th century the sun was in the descendant. The French military machine was worn down in a series of wars by the combined finances of Amsterdam and London, the superiority of British and Dutch fleets, and the harrying armies of the Protestant German princes. Meanwhile, the growing manufacturing capacity and commercial reach of Les Rosbifs was beginning to tell.    Paris was deplored as the headquarters of paint, powder and silks, but it set trends across Europe    Yet the artistic supremacy established by Louis XIV endured. \u201cFrench glass attained a splendour and beauty which have never been surpassed elsewhere,\u201d celebrated Voltaire, \u201c\u2026 the carpets of Turkey and Persia were excelled at Savonnerie. The tapestries of Flanders yielded to those of Les Gobelins.\u201d Paris remained the undisputed epicentre of European fashion. And fashion is not trivial. \u201cFashion is to France what the gold mines of Peru are to Spain,\u201d was the opinion of the austere Colbert. Despite being almost constantly at war with France throughout the 18th century, the British still sighed after the exquisite sophistications of the enemy. Paris may have been deplored as the headquarters of affectation, effeminacy and vanity \u2013 \u201cor paint, patches, powder, silks, diamonds and flirting airs\u201d, as the manufacturer Matthew Boulton espied in the Tuilleries in 1763 \u2013 but the French luxury trades still set trends for all the other European nations, Protestant, Catholic and Orthodox alike. Conspicuous consumption and conspicuous taste remained signifiers of nobility across the continent. \u201cMy pleasure is not to contemplate the gold in my coffers but to spend it,\u201d trilled royal mistress Madame de Pompadour in 1748. A particularly lavish example of conspicuous luxury is the Meissen porcelain table fountain belonging to Count Br\u00fchl, appointed prime minister of Saxony in 1746. It ran with rose water, stunning the British ambassador: \u201cI thought it was the most wonderful thing I ever beheld. I fancy\u2019d myself either in a garden or at the opera.\u201d     A fireplace made in the Russian Imperial Arms Factory, Tula, c1805    Nevertheless, France is not Europe. Indigenous design traditions further afield are signalled by splendid objects in the galleries. One of the most magnificent is actually made of base metal \u2013 a shimmering fireplace created in Tula in Russia from Swedish steel. The continued artistic reach of the Catholic church, especially in its global guise spread by the Jesuits, is reflected in an ivory carving of Christ as the Good Shepherd from Goa. Protestant Europe is rather submerged beneath the glitter, though a modestly beautiful linen cabinet hums with the pride of Dutch housewifery, and Scandinavian and German wood carvings bespeak vernacular craft traditions. European expropriation of the world\u2019s resources is implicit in the materials from which luxury objects were crafted \u2013 tropical tulipwood and mahogany, Mexican silver, as well as ivory, mother of pearl and tortoiseshell from Africa and Asia. The Atlantic slave trade is highlighted here and there. The role played by African children as \u201chuman luxuries\u201d is patent in dynastic portraits, while a supremely smug S\u00e8vres porcelain ornament from 1794 commemorates the anti-slavery campaigns: \u201cLa Nature\u201d as a European woman with six breasts suckles two babies, one European, the other African. Masculine swagger is to the fore throughout, flourishing rank, enjoying the technical innovations of warfare and weaponry, but also in superb personal adornment. Women appear as housewives, mistresses, queens and pieces of property, as retailers, consumers and, to a lesser extent, craftswomen, though I spotted one prestige object by a female maker \u2013 a Dutch still life of a spray of flowers by Rachel Ruysch, flower painting being one of the few, unthreatening genres in which female painters were mildly encouraged. Ultimately art and design still followed money and power. One breathless master craftsman panted to Napoleon Bonaparte in 1804: \u201cAlready en route, artists are only awaiting an order from their sovereign to march and serve him as an escort on the road to glory, and transmit his glory to the coming centuries.\u201d The gallery ends when French imperial ambitions met their Waterloo. \u2022 Amanda Vickery is professor of early modern history at Queen Mary University of London.

Flights cancelled just hours before take-off, leaving passengers stranded abroad. Promised compensation and other expense claims first ignored, and then fought at every stage - in the hope you\u2019ll give up and go away. If you had to guess which low-cost airline this describes, most readers would likely guess it begins with an R. But it is easyJet that is filling the postbag to consumer champions at both the Guardian and Observer, with readers alleging wrongfully denied compensation and appalling customer service. Two months ago AirHelp, which provides online legal help for those claiming compensation for delays, said its data showed easyJet had the worst record of any airline for paying out what is legally due. Specialist lawyers describe how the company repeatedly puts in place legal obstacles to claims it says are perfectly legitimate. Since two major test cases went against the airlines earlier this year most carriers have been paying up without dispute \u2013 but not easyJet. Two weeks ago it announced a pre-tax profit of \u00a3686m \u2013 up 18% on the previous year, leaving passengers further incensed, and bemused that an airline that carried 68 million customers could have such an approach. Many of the problems appear to stem from the way it chose to react to a serious fire in May at Rome\u2019s Fiumicino airport. This reduced the number of flights allowed in and out but, despite knowing days in advance, easyJet chose \u2013 two months into the disruption \u2013 to cancel flights a matter hours before they were due to leave. It is the biggest airline in the UK, flying more people to and from Europe than even Ryanair, and most journeys go smoothly. But at issue is the way it responds when things go wrong. This is a flavour of what readers have been saying: \u2022 Gary Walton\u2019s five-day golfing break in Spain was wrecked when he and a friend were \u201cbumped off\u201d their flight. They had checked in online a week earlier, and had their boarding passes and seats allocated, but when they tried to check in their luggage at Luton \u2013 over two hours before take-off \u2013 they were told the flight had been overbooked. The pair were offered a direct flight departing three days later, or a flight to Paris that morning with a connecting flight to M\u00e1laga the following evening. Forced to abandon their trip, easyJet paid statutory compensation, but they lost the cost of the hotel, hire car and transfer. \u201cI thought I was buying a flight, not a lottery ticket,\u201d says Walton.     Complaints to easyJet often fail to get off the ground. Photograph: ATM/Barcroft Media    \u2022 Mags Hobson missed a funeral after a minor technical problem grounded her flight from Gibraltar back to London in July 2014. She and a friend endured a 27-hour delay that involved a long bus ride to M\u00e1laga, then a second botched attempt to get on a plane in the middle of the night. She accepted that problems occur, but what she hadn\u2019t counted on was her subsequent 14-month battle to get the \u20ac400 compensation which she was due. Her friend gave up trying and has never received a penny. \u2022 Katie Chang was due to fly from Rome to Gatwick in July with a friend on an 11am flight, but at 6pm the night before she was sent a text informing her it had been cancelled. Along with hundreds of other passengers, easyJet told her that she did not qualify for compensation because it was due to \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d \u2013 the get-out clause that allows airlines not to pay up. When the Guardian rang the airport to ask about the fire it emerged that airlines chose which flights to cancel with at least five days\u2019 notice.   Related: EasyJet refuses flight cancellation compensation    \u2022 Chris Laker of Crawley arrived at Amsterdam airport to find his flight cancelled without warning. He was told that the next possible one was in two days and that he had been booked into a hotel. However, the hotel had no record of the reservation and he was forced to spend the night in the airport. The same thing happened the following evening. After 24 hours in the airport he found and paid for a hotel himself. \u201cIt cost \u00a384 and easyJet refused to reimburse me.\u201d Others readers report being promised by airline staff that easyJet would cover hotel accommodation and other expenses following a delay or re-routing only to find that when they claimed, it was denied, again under the \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d rule. Kevin Clarke, from flight delay compensation specialist lawyers Bott &amp; Co, says his firm receives more claims against easyJet for \u201cdenied boarding\u201d than for any other airline. \u201cIt tends to raise the most individual arguments of any airline. It fights the majority of cases and raises complicated legal argument after complicated legal argument \u2013 making it hard for those with little or no knowledge of the law to claim, even when they have a perfectly valid case.\u201d He says in the past it would send successful claimants a cheque in euros rather than sterling, meaning that those with a sterling account would face bank charges. A judge eventually ordered the airline to stop doing it. \u201cWe have the weight of the law behind us, but it\u2019s not so easy for a person who is told by the airline that they are entitled to nothing, or who is ignored completely.\u201d We showed easyJet a sample dossier of 10 complaints from readers. A spokeswoman told Money that it \u201cfully complies with the EU\u2019s compensation rules\u201d and claimed \u201cit was the only airline to obtain a \u2018very good\u2019 rating by a CAA examination into compliance\u201d. It added: \u201cWe aim to provide all of our customers with the highest possible levels of customer service \u2026 easyJet\u2019s customer charter includes the promise to be \u2018open and honest and putting ourselves in our customers\u2019 shoes\u2019. \u201cWe have improved the claims process and customers will get an answer in three working days and payment within a further 21. By spring next year we aim to have reduced this to seven.\u201d She defended the decision to overbook \u201csome\u201d flights and maintained that, following the Rome fire, the authorities had given it less than 48 hours notice to cancel flights \u201con some occasions\u201d, which was why compensation claims had been correctly turned down. \u201cWe understand this can be frustrating \u2026 but we will always pay compensation if it is due.\u201d", "sentences": ["Related: EasyJet refuses flight cancellation compensation    \u2022 Chris Laker of Crawley arrived at Amsterdam airport to find his flight cancelled without warning."], "title": "EasyJet - the airline that\u2019s difficult to deal with", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2015/dec/05/easyjet-complaints-compensation-claims-denied", "tags": ["easyJet", "Money", "Airline industry", "Consumer rights", "Consumer affairs"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-12-06T07:00:12Z", "article": "David Galbraith, a partner at venture investment firm Anthemis, has a statistic he likes to quote. \u201cThe combined value of the top three internet companies in the Americas \u2013 so, basically, in America \u2013 is around $0.75tn (\u00a30.5tn). In Asia, it\u2019s around $0.5tn. In Africa, it\u2019s $50bn. And in Europe, it\u2019s just $25bn.\u201d When I first heard the figure from him, on the hottest day of the year at a conference in the City of London, I was shocked. Galbraith, who helped create both net standard RSS and listings site Yelp in the early 2000s, is not known for exaggeration. When I press him a few months later, he admits with a shrug that it\u2019s slightly artificial. The figure for Africa includes Naspers, the South African conglomerate which owns 35% of China\u2019s massive net firm Tencent, for instance. And the figures only take into account \u201cpure play\u201d internet firms, so that Apple doesn\u2019t count (because it makes watches, phones and computers) but Google and Facebook do. \u201cReally, it\u2019s engineered to make a point,\u201d he says. And the point is worth making: when you look at the top of the tech market, the very top, Europe is lagging a long way behind. The continent has plenty of perfectly decent technology startups: in May this year, technology investment bank GP Bullhound counted 40 founded since 2000 with a valuation of over $1bn, 17 of which come from Britain. But the combined market value of all those companies together was just $120bn \u2013 less than half that of Facebook\u2019s $273bn market cap alone. The problem Galbraith is highlighting isn\u2019t one of financial returns, though: it\u2019s an issue of power. \u201cIf you look at Europe now, we\u2019re in the equivalent stage of being in, let\u2019s say, 1920, with no car companies. No Citr\u00f6en, no BMW, no Rolls Royce, no Fiat, nothing. \u201cThis is as big a deal as the industrial revolution. You\u2019re moving from the agrarian to the industrial to the digital age, and you\u2019re seeing the digitisation of everything. Industries which weren\u2019t considered to be digital are being transformed by some of the methodologies and the processes of the digital age. Take Tesla \u2013 we think of Tesla as being a \u2018startup\u2019, but it\u2019s the same size as Audi.\u201d Both companies are valued at around $30bn.  For all that the technological revolution is often framed as a ground-up burst of innovation from a thousand startups, actual power is concentrated in just a few hands. Facebook is one of those with such power. The social network is so large that a tweak in its newsfeed algorithm in October 2013 single-handedly led to the proliferation of \u201ccuriosity gap\u201d headlines (\u201cAn Auto Executive Talks Up Gas. The Guy Next To Him Who Builds Space Rockets Puts Him In His Place\u201d).  Apple is another. Its influence over software development is such that a small change in the rules about what can be allowed on its app store is enough to create a whole new class of apps, launching mobile adblockers to the top of the charts overnight. A third, Google, can kill a profitable business by tweaking its search results: just ask the founders of Metafilter, who lost 40% of their visitors overnight in mid-November 2012. The heady mixture of near-infinite scalability, a market that lacks geographic borders, and strong network effects means that once a company becomes a de facto platform, it\u2019s hard to control and even harder to dislodge. \u201cWe could be creating companies that are bigger than Standard Oil,\u201d Galbraith says. \u201cWe don\u2019t know yet, but it\u2019s possible. And these giant platform companies create ecosystems around them.\u201d It\u2019s these mega-platforms, the three above all from the US, which Europe is lacking. And the absence of any such behemoths has a serious impact on the ability of the continent to influence its own destiny. The valley on top of the world Take Google. The ubiquitous search engine is currently in the midst of multiple uncomfortable squabbles with European regulators.  It\u2019s being investigated on antitrust grounds by the EU\u2019s competition commission, to see if it unfairly promotes its own shopping search service and whether it artificially limits the rights of handset manufacturers to make their own \u201cforked\u201d versions of its Android operating system.     Silicon Valley dominates the world\u2019s technology sector, but its origins lie in a unexpected confluence between hippies, academics and the military. Photograph: Alamy Stock Photo    At the same time, it\u2019s dealing with the fallout of the ECJ\u2019s ruling that Europeans have a \u201cright to be forgotten\u201d and can request the removal of \u201cinadequate, irrelevant or no longer relevant\u201d information from search results. That right has been applied on a country-by-country basis, but in July this year, France tried to push it further, requiring the company to remove offending entries on all its domains. Google said \u201cnon\u201d. \u201cAs a matter of principle, we respectfully disagree with the idea that a national data protection authority can assert global authority to control the content that people can access around the world,\u201d said a spokesperson.  \u201cWe believe that no single country should have the authority to control what content someone in a second country can access,\u201d added the company\u2019s global privacy counsel, Peter Fleischer. Except, of course, if that country is the US. Google\u2019s global index is policed using US copyright law, and receives a thousand times as many requests under those laws as it does under the right to be forgotten \u2013 and grants more than 95% of them, compared to the 41% it has granted for privacy requests. The world\u2019s biggest search engine is based in the US, and that gives the US the power to dictate copyright law to the world. At the other end of the spectrum is China. The state has managed to build its own web firms at a scale that rivals that of Google and Facebook. For all the West hears about firms such as \u201cChina\u2019s Google\u201d, Baidu, and \u201cChina\u2019s WhatsApp\u201d, WeChat\u201d, the comparisons underplay the dominance of those groups domestically. But it is tricky to pinpoint lessons for Europe from Baidu, Tencent and Sina. The firms achieved astronomical success in a short period of time, but did so in a pocket of the internet walled off from the wider world. The Great Firewall has been terrible for Chinese netizens seeking an uncensored internet, but very good for a few domestic entrepreneurs freed from international competition. \u201cEurope\u2019s sort of semi-open market has created the scenario where it doesn\u2019t have any of its own platforms,\u201d Galbraith concludes with a sigh. And where the EU tried to create its own platforms directly, \u201cit was spectacularly bad. It tried to create its own version of Google, called Quaero. It was laughably bad.\u201d Created with a \u20ac99m grant at the request of the French government, Quaero was eventually put to bed in December 2013. Two years into its creation, engineer Nick Tredennick wrote in IEEE Spectrum magazine that: \u201cGoing head-to-head with Google with a project involving well-funded, energetic entrepreneurs would be foolish. Attempting the same with a multigovernment collaboration is beyond description.\u201d Europe: new land of opportunity? Not everyone agrees with Galbraith\u2019s fear. Ophelia Brown, a principal at Index Ventures, argues that: \u201cEurope has produced many unicorns [billion-dollar companies]. Not Facebooks, to be sure, but I think it\u2019s glib to say that Europe can\u2019t produce another Facebook.\u201d    Europe has evolved. An ecosystem is in place to support the growth of such a company as Facebook  Ophelia Brown, Index Ventures     Facebook, she points out, didn\u2019t come from Silicon Valley: it was born in Harvard University, to a founder who was as much an outsider as European entrepreneurs may feel today. And in the decade since the social network was formed, Europe too has evolved. \u201cThere\u2019s no reason why the same can\u2019t happen at UCL, Imperial, Oxford, Cambridge. The crucial point is how Europe has evolved from when Zuckerberg was coding Facebook. Today, there is very much an ecosystem in place to support the growth of such a company.\u201d Brown argues that Europe even has an advantage for young startups over San Francisco. \u201cIt\u2019s actually easier to start building a company today because of low-cost easy access to engineers, especially if you take London, Berlin, Stockholm, versus fighting for engineers in the valley when you\u2019re a no-name startup.\u201d     The IFA consumer electronics fair in Berlin, September 2013, showcases the best of European mobile technology to a crowd of journalists and industry insiders. Photograph: Fabrizio Bensch/Reuters    In the valley, \u201ccost is prohibitively expensive, people don\u2019t have any allegiance, people are leaving after a year, stock options don\u2019t mean anything to anyone\u201d. Brown says the valley is seeing the disadvantages of being a mature ecosystem. \u201cYes, Europe is some way behind, but we\u2019ve always been some way behind. That doesn\u2019t mean to say that we can\u2019t ever catch up.\u201d Tom Valentine, the co-founder and chief operating officer of London-based travel company Secret Escapes, says a company that can say \u201cwe grew up in Europe\u201d has a strong selling point. Being forced to rapidly support multiple languages, currencies and locations makes the first few years of growth tricky, but puts the company in a position of advantage compared to American startups for going worldwide. It\u2019s a story that Barry Smith, flight search-engine SkyScanner\u2019s co-founder, backs up. At a time when the firm was already supporting a number of European languages, and had built tools letting it add a new one for just \u00a31,500: \u201cOur main competitor in America had only one language. They had 220 employees covering the US, and just four for \u2018Europe\u2019, as though it were one giant country.\u201d Brexit could be a disaster for UK tech The other major advantage Europe has, which comes up time and again, is its relative openness to immigration. \u201cIf you want to get great engineers from India or other parts of the world it\u2019s quite difficult to get the appropriate US visas,\u201d says Brown. \u201cIt\u2019s slightly easier in the UK, with some of the tier two visas that you can get, but it\u2019s still a challenge for both countries.\u201d     Tech City\u2019s \u2018Silicon roundabout\u2019 in London\u2019s east end is the heart of Britain\u2019s startup scene. But measured by market cap, that scene is still small. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images    It\u2019s a sentiment echoed by Toby Coppel of Mosaic Ventures. In the past, he says, \u201cworld-class founders\u201d would have to go to the US to get the funding they needed, and stay there once their company hit success. But the next generation of founders \u201cdon\u2019t have to go to the US\u201d \u2013 and, given the difficulty of obtaining a visa, \u201cprobably can\u2019t\u201d. But if it is an advantage, it\u2019s one which Europe \u2013 and Britain in particular \u2013 is only tenuously clinging to. Alarmed by the sharp rise in anti-immigration rhetoric, a number of British startups have begun to speak out. In October they penned an open letter to the government warning that \u201cchanges to immigration policy will make it more difficult to attract and recruit the talent high-growth companies need to compete and succeed in a global marketplace\u201d.  A few days later, at an exclusive dinner arranged by London-based fintech firm Transferwise, a peer-to-peer foreign exchange service, where founders from companies including fashion retailer Farfetch and peer-to-peer lender Funding Circle grilled representatives from Number 10 and the government\u2019s Tech City over immigration. \u201cFor us, definitely the biggest constriction to growth is hiring people,\u201d said Taavet Hinrikus, Transferwise\u2019s co-founder (he was also the first employee of Skype). And there are times when Britain\u2019s pool of talent simply won\u2019t do. Nilan Peiris, Transferwise\u2019s vice president of growth, says that product managers in particular are almost impossible to hire domestically. The role, which involves taking charge of a particular feature internally, \u201cis like being an entrepreneur inside the company,\u201d he explains. As a result, the company likes people with experience of running their own company \u2013 and there just aren\u2019t enough of those in Britain. But when they hire from overseas, they face wild amounts of pressure. One new product manager, poached from eBay in April, had to spend her first two months of work in the company\u2019s Estonian office while Transferwise fought for her UK visa. And Secret Escape\u2019s Valentine described overbearing inspections from the Home Office, being forced to answer questions which make sense for an employer of migrant farmhands, but are a category error for a highly skilled tech company. \u201cThey were asking how I was certain all my employees had come to work that day. I said I didn\u2019t even understand the question,\u201d he said with a laugh. The mood soured further when talk turned to the forthcoming referendum on Europe. Hinrikus was blunt: \u201cIt\u2019s a freaking catastrophe.\u201d If the out lobby won, \u201cit would make sense for us to relocate to Europe \u2026 we\u2019d move to Berlin\u201d. Britain\u2019s tech sector could be snuffed just as it\u2019s getting started. Europe as a whole might soldier on, but the damage would be enormous. Could the Valley\u2019s success have been a blip?  Silicon Valley might be facing some downsides to its success, but there are of course upsides as well. The phenomenon of \u201cclustering\u201d, where multiple businesses in the same sector huddle together for mutual benefit, is very real, and Silicon Valley is the largest tech cluster in the world. It isn\u2019t even clear that the process by which that came to be is replicable. The birth of the valley was one part fortuitous circumstances (the proximity of major research universities to military establishments provided expertise and funding), one part culture (an attitude of openness and cooperation between the new tech firms let them get the jump on their more closed-up east-coast competitors) and one part major world events (the US was the only major developed nation that hadn\u2019t seen its industrial base obliterated in the second world war).     Workers at Netscape work and play around a replica of the Golden Gate Bridge made from soft drink cans in 1999. Photograph: Ed Kashi/Corbis    The circumstances that led to Silicon Valley may never be repeated. But that isn\u2019t the whole story as to why Europe doesn\u2019t have its own Google. \u201cThe short answer is that one or two companies sold on the way up,\u201d says Coppel. \u201cSkype could have been the next great messaging platform, but sold in 2005 [to eBay, for $3.1bn].\u201d He reels off other names: Booking.com, the Dutch travel site that is now owned by America\u2019s Priceline; Zendesk, which was formed in Denmark and moved to San Francisco in 2008; and Evernote, which Russian Stepan Pachikov founded in 2002. \u201cNow you don\u2019t have to do what they did.\u201d Brown agrees. \u201cThe fact is, there is a lot of money for European startups now that can fund their growth to take them well beyond $2bn, $3bn: that wasn\u2019t true for Skype. I don\u2019t think pension funds and sovereign wealth funds were looking at investing in startups 10 years ago, but now they are.\u201d Now, she says, \u201cthere is less of a drive for selling out early for European entrepreneurs, because they see what\u2019s possible\u201d.    The $250 billion dollar question: even if these startups reach full potential, is it enough for Europe to hold its own?    Part of the issue is simply that a significant part of a mature startup ecosystem requires former founders to provide guidance and funding to the next generation. While Europe\u2019s first wave of potential unicorns grew up, there simply weren\u2019t enough of those former founders to help out, Brown argues. But even if European startups are now free to grow to their full potential, that only solves half of the equation. The other question \u2013 the $250 billion dollar one \u2013 is whether the full potential of any of those startups takes them to the scale Europe needs to hold its own. Where the smart money is Some might. Spotify, for instance, has the potential to grow to become to music what Facebook is to social networking.  But the company faces serious challenges from established US competitors such as Apple and Google, as well as an entrenched industry which is fighting tooth and nail to protect its turf.

Photograph: Thomas Karlsson / DN / Scanpix/Press Association Images    For Galbraith, there are only two industries left where the potential is high enough to matter, and where the big players don\u2019t already have an insurmountable advantage: financial technology and the \u201cinternet of things\u201d. The former, he argues, is a natural fit for a London-based startup looking to rule the world; the latter, for a Berlin-based company seeking to extend Germany\u2019s formidable lead in manufacturing machine tools into the digital age. \u201cAt the moment, Germany makes the tools that China uses to make the tools to make other things. But they need to own the software too. Maybe internet of things is not the right term but\u2026 smart hardware, as everything will be.\u201d For his part, Galbraith\u2019s going for the former. At Anthemis, he\u2019s set up a small incubator named Anthemis Foundry, where he and business partner Greg Dowling will be \u201cdesigning companies\u201d. The incubator is based in London, Europe\u2019s financial capital, and is focusing on fintech. \u201cMoney is a language. It\u2019s a truly global one where London sits at its centre in a truly globalised environment in a way that the US doesn\u2019t. There are no massive financial institutions on the west coast of America other than [bond investor] Pimco.\u201d    Germany makes the tools that China uses to make the tools to make other things. But they need to own the software too  David Galbraith     Of course, others have got the jump on Anthemis Foundry, and if Europe is to become the fintech capital of the world, the company that leads the charge may already have been founded. Transferwise hit a $1bn valuation in early 2015, for instance, while Adyen, an Amsterdam-based payments firm with clients including Spotify and Netflix, is worth $2.3bn at recent valuations. Whether or not London has a natural advantage in fintech, or the US\u2019s backwards banking infrastructure lends Europe the edge it needs, it will still be a challenge to match the biggest companies in the US. \u201cBut,\u201d argues Galbraith, \u201cit seems like, if this is a bigger issue than, let\u2019s say, a Greek default, then it probably would be worth throwing \u20ac300bn at it to create an Apollo programme for a European platform.\u201d That\u2019s not to say the EU should just build the platform directly (the memories Quaero should prove the folly of that idea), but that the continent as a whole should accept the fact that it\u2019s worth making some very, very expensive changes to boost the industry.  \u201cLook at France,\u201d Galbraith says. In France, if you buy a painting, and sell it for a profit, there\u2019s no capital gains tax paid on the profit, because the French government wants to use the tax system to encourage ownership of art. But, he points out, if you buy, say, a domain name and sell it for a profit a decade later, capital gains tax is still due. The cultural differences between Europe and the rest of the world may ultimately be why no Google, Apple or Facebook has come from the lands that gave us the telescope, the steam engine and the printing press. \u201cThis is a sickness in Europe,\u201d Galbraith says: \u201cThe past is valued more than the future.\u201d There\u2019s also the question of motivation. Could it be that European founders were simply less driven, and more eager to sell out, than their US counterparts? \u201cNot at all,\u201d says Brown. \u201cI would turn down an investment in any company which said its aim was simply to sell out.\u201d Skyscanner\u2019s Smith is more sanguine. \u201cWe have an education problem: ambition is not taught in school.\u201d And for those come to ambition themselves, he worries that they focus on getting rich first, and building a great business second \u2013 the startup equivalent of wanting to be famous, rather than wanting to be a musician. Jos\u00e9 Neves, the founder of Farfetch, has a different theory: a cynical European press fails to boost startups at the right time. \u201cWhen we raised money at a $1bn valuation, we were on the front page of the Financial Times \u2013 but the headline was \u2018is there a tech bubble?\u2019\u201d Neves is also the only European founder I meet to explicitly state the fear many have privately: \u201cA business like Facebook, Instagram or Pinterest could never be built in Europe. Those are businesses that were burning through cash without a dollar in revenue,\u201d and no European funder would have backed such a risky prospect. Around the table at TransferWise\u2019s dinner, Neves\u2019 assertion is quickly countered. Eileen Burbidge, the chair of Tech City, pointed out that WhatsApp had just 55 employees at the time of its acquisition for $19bn by Facebook, while Instagram a few years earlier had been acquired for $1bn with just 18 employees; neither company was burning enough cash, she says, to frighten off even conservative European venture capitalists. So if it\u2019s not culture, and it\u2019s not funding, it\u2019s not infrastructure, it\u2019s not (yet) immigration controls and it\u2019s not (yet) fear of Brexit, then will there ever be a European Google? At my most pessimistic, I worry that the answer is no: America\u2019s lead is too entrenched to be overturned short of the sort of catastrophic continent-wide wars that led to the last rebalancing of worldwide technological leadership. But one thing that\u2019s clear is that this is not a problem that Europe is ignoring in favour of easy gains elsewhere. A phenomenal amount of money, time and energy is being thrown at the issue. That doesn\u2019t guarantee success, but it feels closer than it ever has before.

Borders are fixed, man-made, squabbled about and jealously fought over. The frontier is an exciting, demanding \u2013 and frequently lawless \u2013 place to be. Borders are policed, often tense; if they become too porous then they\u2019re not doing the job for which they were intended. Occasionally, though, the border is the frontier. That\u2019s the situation now with regard to fiction and nonfiction. For many years this was a peaceful, uncontested and pretty deserted space. On one side sat the Samuel Johnson prize, on the other the Booker. On one side of the fence, to put it metonymically, we had Antony Beevor\u2019s Stalingrad. On the other, Arundhati Roy\u2019s The God of Small Things. Basically, you went to nonfiction for the content, the subject. You read Beevor\u2019s book because you were interested in the second world war, the eastern front. Interest in India or Kerala, however, was no more a precondition for reading Roy\u2019s novel than a fondness for underage girls was a necessary starting point for enjoying Lolita. In a realm where style was often functional, nonfiction books were \u2013 are \u2013 praised for being \u201cwell written\u201d, as though that were an inessential extra, like some optional finish on a reliable car. Whether the subject matter was alluring or off-putting, fiction was the arena where style was more obviously expected, sometimes conspicuously displayed and occasionally rewarded. And so, for a sizeable chunk of my reading life, novels provided pretty much all the nutrition and flavour I needed. They were fun, they taught me about psychology, behaviour and ethics. And then, gradually, increasing numbers of them failed to deliver \u2013 or delivered only decreasing amounts of what I went to them for. Nonfiction began taking up more of the slack and, as it did, so the drift away from fiction accelerated. Great novels still held me in their thrall, but a masterpiece such as Shirley Hazzard\u2019s The Transit of Venus made the pleasures of Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin seem fairly redundant. Meanwhile, my attention was fully employed by shoebox-sized nonfiction classics such as Richard Rhodes\u2019s The Making of the Atomic Bomb, Robert Caro\u2019s life of Robert Moses, The Power Broker, or Taylor Branch\u2019s trilogy about \u201cAmerica in the King Years\u201d: Parting the Waters, Pillar of Fire, At Canaan\u2019s Edge. I learned so much from books like these \u2013 while I was reading them. The downside was that I retained so little. Which was an incentive to read more.    I look forward to the day I join that gruffly contented portion of the male population that reads only military history    While it\u2019s important not to convert prejudices into manifesto pledges, my experience is in keeping with actuarial norms: middle-aged now, I look forward to the days when I join that gruffly contented portion of the male population that reads only military history. More broadly, my changing tastes were shaped by a general cultural shift occasioned by the internet, the increased number of sports channels and the abundance of made-for-TV drama. Not, as is sometimes claimed, because they\u2019re making us more stupid, rendering us incapable of concentrating on late-period Henry James (which I\u2019d never been capable of concentrating on anyway), but because our hunger for distraction and diversion is now thoroughly sated by all the football, porn and viral videos out there.     David Hare: \u2018The two most depressing words in the English language are \u201cliterary fiction\u201d\u2019 Photograph: Eamonn McCabe for the Guardian    As a consequence, the one thing I don\u2019t go to fiction for, these days, is entertainment. Obviously, I still want to have a good time. I share Jonathan Franzen\u2019s reaction to the joyless slog represented (for him) by William Gaddis\u2019s JR but I don\u2019t want the kind of good time that ends up feeling like a waste of time. Chaired by Stella Rimington, the Booker year of 2011 was in some ways the belated last gasp of quality fiction as entertainment \u2013 or \u201creadability\u201d, as she called it. It was belated because David Hare had provided the epitaph a year earlier when he wrote that \u201cthe two most depressing words in the English language are \u2018literary fiction\u2019\u201d (which sometimes feels like the aspirational, if commercially challenged, cousin of genre fiction). Within the sprawl of nonfiction there is as much genre- and convention-dependency as in fiction. Nicholson Baker has argued persuasively that a recipe for successful nonfiction is an argument or thesis that can be summed up by reviewers and debated by the public without the tedious obligation of reading the whole book. In exceptional cases the title alone is enough. Malcolm Gladwell is the unquestioned master in this regard. Blink. Ah, got it. Some nonfiction books give the impression of being the dutiful fulfilment of contracts agreed on the basis of skilfully managed proposals. The finished books are like heavily expanded versions of those proposals \u2013 which then get boiled back down again with the sale of serial rights. Baker\u2019s study of John Updike, U and I, on the other hand, is irreducible in that there is no thesis or argument and very little story. The only way to experience the book is to read it. Which is exactly what one would say of any worthwhile piece of fiction.    The appeal of Touching the Void is dependent absolutely on Joe Simpson being roped to the rock face of what happened    Don\u2019t let me be misunderstood. The novel is not dead or dying. But at any given time, particular cultural forms come into their own. (No sane person would claim that, in the 1990s, advances were made in the composition of string quartets to rival those being made in electronic music.) Sometimes, advances are made at the expense of already established forms; other times, the established forms are themselves challenged and reinvigorated by the resulting blowback. At this moment, it\u2019s the shifting sands between fiction and nonfiction that compel attention. The difference between fiction and nonfiction is quite reasonably assumed to depend on whether stuff is invented or factually reliable. Now, in some kinds of writing \u2013 history, reportage and some species of memoir or true adventure \u2013 there is zero room for manoeuvre. Everything must be rigorously fact-checked. The appeal of a book such as Touching the Void is dependent absolutely on Joe Simpson being roped to the rock face of what happened. In military history, as Beevor commands, no liberties may be taken. As the author of many nonfiction books which are full of invention, I second this wholeheartedly.     Walker Evans: Sharecropper\u2019s Family, Hale County, Alabama 1936. Evans insited on calling his work \u2018documentary style\u2019. Photograph: Library of Congress/Walker Evans    The manipulations and inventions manufactured by Werner Herzog in the higher service of what he calls \u201cecstatic truth\u201d leave the defences of documentary at large dangerously lowered. In my defence I would argue that the contrivances in my nonfiction are so factually trivial that their inclusion takes no skin off even the most inquisitorial nose. The Missing of the Somme begins with mention of a visit to the Natural History Museum with my grandfather \u2013 who never set foot in a museum in his life. Yoga for People Who Can\u2019t Be Bothered to Do It was categorised as nonfiction because that\u2019s what the publishers deemed most likely to succeed \u2013 ie, least likely to sink without trace. One of these \u201ctravel essays\u201d \u2013 as the book was packaged in America \u2013 involved a psychedelic misadventure in Amsterdam, climaxing with a peculiar occurrence in a cafe toilet. Most of the story \u2013 which had originally appeared in an anthology of fiction \u2013 is a faithful transcript of stuff that really happened, but that incident was pinched from an anecdote someone told me about a portable toilet at Glastonbury. All that matters is that the reader can\u2019t see the joins, that there is no textural change between reliable fabric and fabrication. In other words, the issue is one not of accuracy but aesthetics. That is why the photographer Walker Evans turned noun into adjective by insisting on the designation \u201cdocumentary style\u201d for his work. Exporting this across to literature, style itself can become a form of invention. As the did-it-really-happen? issue gives way to questions of style and form, so we are brought back to the expectations engendered by certain forms: how we expect to read certain books, how we expect them to behave. The dizziness occasioned by WG Sebald lay in the way that we really didn\u2019t know quite what we were reading. To adapt a line of Clint Eastwood\u2019s from Coogan\u2019s Bluff, we didn\u2019t know what was happening \u2013 even as it was happening to us. That mesmeric uncertainty has diminished slightly since the Sebald software has, as it were, been made available for free download by numerous acolytes, but a similar categorical refusal informs Ben Lerner\u2019s 10.04, \u201ca work,\u201d as his narrator puts it, \u201cthat, like a poem, is neither fiction nor nonfiction, but a flickering between them\u201d. The flicker is sustained on an epic scale \u2013 in a thoroughly domestic sort of way \u2013 by Karl Ove Knausgaard\u2019s six-volume My Struggle series. A side-effect or aftershock of Knausgaard\u2019s seismic shakeup was to make us realise how thoroughly bored we had become by plot. Rachel Cusk addressed and exploited this in her wonderfully plotless novel Outline, which was shortlisted for last year\u2019s Goldsmiths prize.     Karl Ove Knausgaard sustains the \u2018flicker\u2019 between fiction and nonfiction \u2018on an epic scale\u2019. Photograph: Katherine Anne Rose for the Observer    Seeking to reward innovation and experimentation, this prize is a good and timely thing \u2013 but it\u2019s unfortunate that it\u2019s limited to fiction. While last year\u2019s Samuel Johnson prize went to Helen Macdonald for her beautifully novel H Is for Hawk, much so-called experimental fiction comes in the tried-and-tested form of the sub-species of historical novel known as modernist. Had they been LPs rather than books, several contenders for last year\u2019s Goldsmiths prize could have joined Will Self\u2019s Shark in that oxymoronic section of Ray\u2019s Jazz Shop: \u201csecondhand avant garde\u201d. Twenty-four years ago, I was surprised to see But Beautiful \u2013 a neither-one-thing-nor-the-other book about jazz \u2013 in the bestsellers section of Books Etc on London\u2019s Charing Cross Road. \u201cIs that true?\u201d I asked the manager. \u201cNo, no,\u201d he replied consolingly. \u201cWe just didn\u2019t know where else to put it.\u201d Nowadays, there\u2019s an increasing need for a section devoted to books that previously lacked a suitable home, or that could have been scattered between four or five different ones, none of which quite fit.    It needs stressing that, as is often the case, a \u201cnew\u201d situation turns out to have a long and distinguished prehistory    The danger, as genre-defying or creative nonfiction becomes a genre in its own right \u2013 with mix-and-match poised to become a matter of rote \u2013 is that no man\u2019s land could become predictably congested. It also needs stressing that, as is often the case, a \u201cnew\u201d situation turns out to have a long and distinguished prehistory. Where to stock Rebecca West\u2019s Black Lamb and Grey Falcon (1941)? History? Travel (within the subsection of the Balkans or Yugoslavia)? Or perhaps, as she suggested, in a category devoted to works \u201cin a form insane from any ordinary artistic or commercial point of view\u201d. Maggie Nelson must have been very happy when proof copies of her latest book, The Argonauts, advertised it as a work of \u201cautotheory\u201d \u2013 happy because Roland Barthes had been saving a place for her in this hip new category. And so, as our proposed new section expands to make room for the diverse likes of Elizabeth Hardwick\u2019s Sleepless Nights, Bruce Chatwin\u2019s The Songlines, Simon Schama\u2019s Dead Certainties, Roberto Calasso\u2019s The Marriage of Cadmus and Harmony or Ivan Vladislavic\u2019s Portrait With Keys, the most viable label might well turn out to be an old one: \u201cliterature\u201d.     In Cold Blood: on the set of the film version of Capote\u2019s nonfiction novel, which changed the literary landscape. Photograph: Images/REX Shutterstock    The nonfiction novels of Norman Mailer (The Executioner\u2019s Song) or Truman Capote (In Cold Blood) changed the literary landscape, but the scope for further innovation was quickly noticed by the young Annie Dillard. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the nonfiction novel,\u201d she confided to her journal; \u201cit\u2019s time for the novelised book of nonfiction.\u201d The book she was working on, Pilgrim at Tinker Creek, is a classic instance of the nonfiction work of art. Having won a Pulitzer prize for nonfiction in 1975, it went on to become the source of some controversy when it was revealed that the famous opening paragraph \u2013 in which the author awakens in bed to find herself covered in paw prints of blood, after her cat, a fighting tom, has returned from his nocturnal adventures \u2013 was a fiction. It\u2019s not that she\u2019d made this story up; she\u2019d adapted it, with permission, from something written by a postgrad student. This was a shower in a teacup compared with the various storms that have swirled around Ryszard Kapuscinski. It\u2019s a problem partly of his own making, since he repeatedly insisted that he was a reporter, that he had to \u201cexperience everything for [him]self\u201d, that he didn\u2019t have the freedoms of the imaginative writer, that while he \u201ccould embellish\u201d the details of his stories, he decided against doing so on the grounds that it \u201cwould not be true\u201d. Gradually it emerged that this was part of the rhetoric of fiction, that he could not possibly have seen first-hand some of the things he claimed to have witnessed. For some readers this was a thoroughly disillusioning experience; for others it seemed that his exuberance and imaginative abundance were not always compatible with the obligations and diligence of the reporter. He remains a great writer \u2013 just not the kind of great writer he was supposed to be. (The potential for confusion was there from the outset; when Jonathan Miller was turning Kapuscinski\u2019s book about Haile Selassie and Ethiopia, The Emperor, into an opera, the author reminded him that it was really a book about Poland.) Kapuscinski did not simply borrow the techniques and freedom of the novel; books such as The Soccer War or Another Day of Life generated the moulds from which they were formed \u2013 moulds which then dissolved, Mission Impossible-style, at the moment of the books\u2019 completion. The essential thing \u2013 and this was something I discovered when writing But Beautiful as a series of improvisations \u2013 is to arrive at a form singularly appropriate to a particular subject, and to that subject alone.     John Berger, whose stories of French peasant life combine documentary, poetry, fiction and historical analysis. Photograph: Getty Images    That book was dedicated to John Berger. Habitually identified as a \u201cMarxist\u201d, \u201cart critic\u201d or \u201cpolymath\u201d, Berger has an extraordinary capacity for formal innovation which is easily overlooked. The documentary studies \u2013 of a country doctor in A Fortunate Man (1967), of migrant labour in A Seventh Man (1975) \u2013 he made with photographer Jean Mohr are unsurpassed in their marriage of image and text. The shift from the overt modernist complexities of the Booker prize-winning G to the stories of French peasant life was perceived, in some quarters, as a retreat to more traditional forms. Nothing \u2013 to use a phrase that may not be appropriate in this context \u2013 could be further from the truth. In its combination of poetry, fiction, documentary essays and historical analysis, Pig Earth (1979) was, even by Berger\u2019s standards, his most formally innovative book \u2013 until he surpassed it with the next one, And Our Faces, My Heart, Brief As Photos.

His new book, White Sands, will be published by Canongate in June Aminatta Forna: \u2018Fiction allows me to reach for a deeper, less literal kind of truth\u2019     Aminatta Forna: \u2018Break the contract and readers no longer know who to trust.\u2019 Photograph: Linda Nylind for the Guardian    Each time a writer begins a book they make a contract with the reader. If the book is a work of fiction the contract is pretty vague, essentially saying: \u201cCommit your time and patience to me and I will tell you a story.\u201d There may be a sub-clause about entertaining the reader, or some such. In the contract for my novels I promise to try to show my readers a way of seeing the world in a way I hope they have not seen before. A contract for a work of nonfiction is a more precise affair. The writer says, I am telling you, and to the best of my ability, what I believe to be true. This is a contract that should not be broken lightly and why I have disagreed with writers of memoir (in particular) who happily alter facts to suit their narrative purposes. Break the contract and readers no longer know who to trust. I write both fiction and nonfiction \u2013 to me they serve different purposes. On my noticeboard I have pinned the lines: \u201cNonfiction reveals the lies, but only metaphor can reveal the truth.\u201d I don\u2019t know who said it, I\u2019m afraid. My first full-length work was a memoir of war, the rise of a dictatorship and my own family\u2019s consequent fate. In the 12 years since its publication I have continued to explore the themes of civil war, though almost exclusively in fiction. Fiction allows me to reach for a deeper, less literal kind of truth. However, when a writer comes to a story, whether fiction or nonfiction, they employ many of the same techniques, of narrative, plot, pace, mood and dialogue. This is one reason I think the distinction between fiction and nonfiction prizes is, well, a fiction. Writers such as Joan Didion, Mary Karr, Roger Deakin, and more recently Helen Macdonald, William Fiennes and Robert Macfarlane, are master craftsmen. These writers have broken the boundaries of nonfiction to reach for the kind of truth that fiction writers covet. A few years back I judged an award for fiction in which the brief covered a writer\u2019s entire output, but in a single genre. It made no sense. Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez\u2019s News of a Kidnapping is a furtherance of the line of questioning that began with Chronicle of a Death Foretold. Aleksandar Hemon\u2019s essays are extensions of his novels and short stories, or vice versa. Marilynne Robinson\u2019s essays are part of the same inquiry into the meaning of religion as Gilead or Home. There should be a prize quite simply for belles-lettres, as the French call it, for \u201cfine writing\u201d in any form.

The tagline \u201cbased on a true story\u201d now seems vital when marketing movies. \u201cFaction-creep\u201d has increased both in television and the cinema. And more novels than ever before are set in the past. This is largely because the essence of human drama is moral dilemma, an element that our nonjudgmental society today rather lacks. A blend of historical fact and fiction has been used in various forms since narrative began with sagas and epic poems. But today\u2019s hybrid of faction has a different genesis, and is influenced by different motives. There is a more market-driven attempt to satisfy the modern desire in a fast-moving world to learn and be entertained at the same time. In any case, we seem to be experiencing a need for authenticity, even in works of fiction. I have always loved novels set in the past. I began as a boy with Hornblower and Conan Doyle\u2019s Brigadier Gerard stories because they offered excitement as well as escape into that \u201cother country\u201d. And more recently I have been gripped by Hilary Mantel\u2019s trilogy about Thomas Cromwell. But however impressive her research and writing, I am left feeling deeply uneasy. Which parts were pure invention, which speculation and which were based on reliable sources? Mantel writes: \u201cFor a novelist, this absence of intimate material is both a problem and an opportunity\u2026 Unlike the historian, the novelist doesn\u2019t operate through hindsight. She lives inside the consciousness of her characters for whom the future is blank.\u201d (In fact the historian should do both \u2013 first explain the world as it appeared to protagonists at the time, and then analyse with hindsight.) The problem arises precisely when the novelist imposes their consciousness on a real historical figure. Helen Dunmore (see below) said that novelists stray into \u201cdangerous territory\u201d when they fictionalise real people. She said that she was \u201cvery wary\u201d of putting words into the mouths of characters from history. Restorers of paintings and pottery follow a code of conduct in their work to distinguish the genuine and original material from what they are adding later. Should writers do the same? Should not the reader be told what is fact and what is invented? But if novelists do not want to make this distinction (say by the use of italics or bold to distinguish the true from the false) then why not change the names slightly, as in a roman \u00e0 clef, to emphasise that their version is at least one step away from reality? The novelist Linda Grant argued that this also gives the writer much greater freedom of invention. Keeping real names shackles the imaginative writer perhaps more than they realise. In Tolstoy\u2019s War and Peace, the most convincing and interesting characters are those he made up, not the historical figures. The most memorable characters of world fiction have always come from a great writer\u2019s imagination.

For a time I even stuck to a pedantic sequence of fiction followed by fact as if it were an unwritten commandment passed down to autodidacts like me. There was also a certain amount of piety involved. Reading should be about learning. Pleasure should be a secondary consideration. I still recall the very first nonfiction book I ever read: The Blue Nile by Alan Moorehead. Since then I\u2019ve loved many histories, memoirs, biographies and travel books. However, when choosing the next book to read (and what a wonderful moment that is) I\u2019m still drawn more towards novels than the worthy tomes that I know will be more instructive. I\u2019ve known a few people who never read fiction but nobody yet who\u2019s never read anything but. Even the most devoted film fan must appreciate the occasional documentary. For the nonfiction obsessive I\u2019d place True Grit by Charles Portis in their Christmas stocking in an attempt to convert them. As for my own favourite nonfiction book, it would have to be An Immaculate Mistake, an exquisite memoir of childhood by Paul Bailey. I often tell book festival audiences that I want to write fiction myself, to which the cynics in the audience suggest I write the next manifesto.

There is nothing more likely to stunt your creativity than to think of walls between genres. I understand that booksellers, and even readers, need to know if a book is a crime novel or literary or commercial or romantic but for a writer, thinking in those terms is limiting. Also, at the risk of sounding like a pretentious sixth-former, the divide between fiction and nonfiction is inherently false according to the multiverse theory, in that all fiction is true in one universe or other, so when you write a novel you are writing reality that belongs to somewhere else. But there is another reason the divide is false, or at least why it creates false ideas. And that is because things categorised as nonfiction can be inauthentic while fiction can contain more truth. The aim of any writer, even a fantasy writer, is the pursuit of truth. I have written nonfiction and fiction. I wrote a science fiction novel that was very autobiographical about my experience of depression, and then I wrote a nonfiction book about depression. They were both about the same truth, but from different angles, and I wouldn\u2019t have been able to write the nonfiction without the fiction first. We need both genres, sometimes at the same time, because the moment we trust too much in one fixed idea of reality is the moment we lose it. But as a reader, I must admit I read more nonfiction than fiction at the moment, because there is so much good stuff around and because I am writing fiction and my mind likes the counterbalance.

It creates empathy, changes fixed opinions and contributes to reform\u2019     Helen Dunmore: \u2018Certain novels transform the reader\u2019s internal landscape.\u2019 Photograph: Murdo Macleod for the Guardian    It might seem logical that nonfiction, with its rigorous foundation in fact, would be a more persuasive instrument of social change than fiction; but I believe this is not the case. When Harriet Beecher Stowe published Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin in 1852 it became an immediate bestseller in the US and Britain and helped to shatter white people\u2019s complacency about slavery. There are important criticisms of Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin but, like Mark Twain\u2019s Huckleberry Finn, the novel demolishes slavery\u2019s belief system, denying that the enslaved are a different order of beings and may justifiably be exploited. More recently, Toni Morrison\u2019s Beloved exposes the cost of slavery with searing brilliance, while Chinua Achebe dramatises the crude irruption of western missionaries and colonists into highly complex, sophisticated Igbo culture. Such novels not only add to a reader\u2019s knowledge: they transform that reader\u2019s internal landscape. We are feeling creatures, and often it is only our refusal or inability to empathise that allows us to pursue our cruelties. Fiction gets under the guard. It creates empathy, changes fixed opinions and morality, and contributes to reform of law and social practice. When Victorians read Dickens or Elizabeth Gaskell they came to love the characters of Mary Barton, Ruth, Oliver Twist or Little Nell, and through them to know with full imaginative force the cost of industrialisation, the brutality of the workhouse, or the desperation of a \u201cfallen\u201d woman. The sweatshop is still with us and so are slavery, the denial of rights to women and the sufferings of those swept aside.

Nicholas Shakespeare, for example, is a much-admired novelist, but he has also written an excellent biography of Bruce Chatwin. Before concentrating on thrillers, Robert Harris wrote several works of nonfiction, including Selling Hitler, a brilliant account of the \u201cHitler diaries\u201d story. And so on. As a writer, I specialise in biography, which seems to suit my interests and aptitudes. Being nosy, I enjoy investigating the lives of others, like a detective, or perhaps a spy. I relish reading other people\u2019s letters and diaries, and poring over their manuscripts. That these others are real people is an essential part of the process. I can imagine a biography of a fictional character, but it would not be the kind of biography that I should want to write. Though I write nonfiction, this does not mean that I do not read fiction: on the contrary, I consume more novels than any other type of book. My last biography was of the novelist John le Carr\u00e9; if I had not gained so much pleasure from reading his work, I doubt if I would have enjoyed writing his life. I notice that dedicated readers of fiction tend towards new books. I am probably unusual, in that I am as likely to read a novel written 100 years ago as one of those shortlisted for this year\u2019s Booker. I am only slightly embarrassed to admit that the novel I am reading at the moment is by Marcel Proust. In any case I feel that those readers who restrict themselves to fiction may be denying themselves pleasure as well as instruction. I would argue that biography can be as enriching and as entertaining as fiction. To those who doubt the truth of this, I recommend anything by Michael Holroyd or Richard Holmes, or Selina Hastings. At its best, biography teaches us about life itself, just as fiction does. \u201cI esteem biography, as giving us what comes near to ourselves, what we can turn to use,\u201d Johnson told Boswell during their tour of the Hebrides.

Every piece of writing puts forth some logical argument and some theory of cause and effect for the simple reason that words, especially prose words, are sequential. The author and the reader both know that if the author doesn\u2019t provide the logic, the reader will. But the logic of events and people as they exist in the world isn\u2019t self-evident, and narrators of fiction and narrators of nonfiction have different ways of putting together their logical systems. Nonfiction, history, is about what is known to be, or generally accepted to be, accurate. Facts are like archeological finds \u2013 they must strike us as tangible and real, therefore likely, plausible, attested, but also new and revelatory. The promise of nonfiction is that it is accurate, and therefore, like an archeological site, incomplete \u2013 here are the stone walls, here is part of a mosaic, here are two goblets. My theory concerns what these objects might mean, how they might be connected to an earthquake for which there is evidence, but I cannot go too far toward completeness or the reader, who might otherwise enjoy my narrative, will cease to be willing to suspend disbelief in its accuracy. It is certain that after I die, more tangible evidence will surface, some plates, some clay tablets, a skull with a spike pounded into the cranium, and so theories will change, and I will be praised for having stuck to the facts as they were then understood. But the history of literature shows that listeners and readers want to know not only what happened, but also how it looked, sounded, smelled, felt, and also what it meant then and what it means now. They want to know but also to experience, and therefore they seek completeness, and so they willingly suspend disbelief in fiction (The Odyssey, the Book of Genesis, Waverley, Flashman). What they get from these sources is not only pleasure, but emotional education, the exercise of the imagination, an enlargement of the inner life. A writer of fiction also has a theory, a theory about what happened, and also about whether the past and the present are similar, whether people change or remain the same. As with the archaeologist, my theory, if I am a fiction writer, will be found wanting after I die, but pleasure in my stories may linger (War and Peace) or surge (The Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner). Chances are that in order to construct my narrative, I did plenty of research, but just as with historians, I know that as yet undiscovered sources will turn up. The test for my theory will not be whether my narrative is factually accurate. It will be whether my idea of human nature retains immediacy. As a reader, I love both history and historical novels. What I get from Geoffrey Parker\u2019s Global Crisis is insight into what did go wrong for humans of the 17th century and what could go wrong very soon in our world. What I get from Eleanor Catton\u2019s The Luminaries is a tight, suspenseful formal puzzle combined with the feeling that I know how men in New Zealand in the 1860s are experiencing their world. Both are fascinating and valuable. Why should I forgo either? Golden Age, the final volume in Jane Smiley\u2019s Hundred Years trilogy, is published by Mantle, \u00a318.99.

I can only answer subjectively and autobiographically. From the start, reading modern history at Oxford in the early 1970s, I knew somehow that I was in the second-class carriage. Those doing English were more interesting, more glamorous, altogether more \u201cit\u201d. Years later, Martin Amis gave some comfort by retrospectively wishing he\u2019d done it the other way round, but deep down, after four decades of writing history books, I continue to feel a sense of inferiority to those who practise out-and-out literature. Why is fiction (leaving aside poetry and drama) superior? Not just because it reflects an intrinsically more creative process, but because at its best it is capable of getting inside the heads of people with a richness, complexity and profundity that no other genre (written or otherwise) can. I\u2019ve read plenty of history and biography in my time, but never come across anyone who has meant quite as much to me as Pierre or Prince Andrei, Levin or Anna. Of course, Tolstoy is on a pedestal \u2013 assuredly the greatest novelist. Dickens falls short, unable or unwilling to drill down into those heads; Flaubert is too contemptuous of his characters; Joyce takes that fateful wrong turn after Dubliners. But plenty of others do do it \u2013 Austen, Eliot, Fontane, Forster, Proust, Grossman, even in my time Pym and Powell \u2013 and, not to avoid the unavoidable cliche, enrich immeasurably our awareness of being human, even teach us how to live. But there is something to be said, by me anyway, on the other side. Those might be my desert island authors \u2013 no question \u2013 yet it has been nonfiction that has at least as decisively shaped my view of the world, certainly once I was a young adult. George Orwell\u2019s The Lion and the Unicorn gave me a compelling sense of 20th-century Britain; CLR James\u2019s Beyond a Boundary, the greatest ever cricket book, enlarged the possibilities of history; the devastating memoirs of Nadezhda Mandelstam, widow of the poet Osip, belatedly made me realise that liberty ultimately trumps equality; EP Thompson\u2019s The Poverty of Theory, his brutal but painstaking attack on the French philosopher Louis Althusser, taught me the virtues of empiricism. Now in my mid-60s, I am as happy (like many men my age) to turn to a biography or autobiography \u2013 at the moment Adam Mars-Jones\u2019s Kid Gloves \u2013 as I try to understand the epoch I have passed through. Even so, when the chips are down, nothing quite beats the right novel. Three years ago, I happened to be re-reading Anthony Trollope\u2019s The Warden when I was diagnosed with cancer. During the anxious days and especially nights that followed, it did the job \u2013 and I was, and remain, grateful. Modernity Britain by David Kynaston is published by Bloomsbury, \u00a314.99.

As nonfiction previewer for the Bookseller, and the author of five nonfiction books of my own, I am often moved to question why fiction dominates our conversations about books. The numbers certainly don\u2019t support fiction\u2019s pre-eminence. Novels are not what the majority of people buy, nor are they where most money is made. According to BookScan, in a printed book market worth \u00a31.24bn between January and October this year, almost 40% of sales came from general (ie, non-academic) nonfiction, compared with 27% from adult fiction. And sales of hardback nonfiction are booming too: up 8.3% on 2014. The problem is that the very term \u201cnonfiction\u201d is supremely unhelpful; a big, baggy anti-moniker that conceals a multitude of possibilities. It masks the fact that nonfiction can do anything fiction can do; and often does it better. Tell an exuberant, unruly true story of ordinary, conflicted people like Alexandra Fuller\u2019s Leaving Before the Rains Come. Evoke faraway worlds which barely seem of the 21st century, like Colin Thubron\u2019s To a Mountain in Tibet. Help us feel the thick presence of a time when our ancestors lived and breathed, as Yuval Noah Harari does in Sapiens. The best nonfiction trumps fiction by combining the allure of a true story with the recounting of realities we are better off for knowing. By comparison, fiction is only made-up stuff. Caroline Sanderson\u2019s Someone Like Adele is published by Omnibus, \u00a312.95 Kerry Hudson: \u2018Yes, this is \u201cmade up\u201d but this is also the most truthful thing I have to give you\u2019     Kerry Hudson: \u2018I still need an absolute truth.\u2019 Photograph: Richard Saker for the Observer    As a teen I left small town libraries all over the UK with novels stacked up to my chest and under my chin. I\u2019d go home, lie in bed with the books scattered around me and luxuriate in the possibility of disappearing into different worlds, spending time with characters who mostly behaved as I wanted and expected them to and even if they didn\u2019t, the pages could be closed, the book abandoned. Beyond that bed was the council estate, caravan or B&amp;B we were living in, usually in a rough area with all the grim certainties of life on the margins. Fiction was my fantasy island and I avoided nonfiction \u2013 reality was something I had plenty of, thank you very much. But reality bites and holds on tight and, as a writer, though it felt natural I would write fiction I still need an absolute truth, something \u2018real\u2019 to begin from. I will stretch and twist that reality, filter it through various fictional smoke and mirrors, expand and compress its meaning but at the centre of each book there is that grain of \u201cthis really happened\u201d. Everything is built around that and I hope my readers feel that honesty. Yes, this is \u201cmade up\u201d but this is also the most truthful thing I have to give you. I finally discovered nonfiction when I was in my 20s and far from the life I\u2019d had. I read [the slave memoir] The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, Primo Levi\u2019s If This Is a Man and Janice Galloway\u2019s This Is Not About Me and realised it was time to leave my island and start exploring new worlds. I finally understood at the heart of most narratives, fiction or fact, there is human complexity and us readers trying to understand our own stories through the telling of others\u2019. And then I wrote my own. Kerry\u2019s Hudson\u2019s latest novel, Thirst, is published by Vintage, \u00a38.99.

This definition, at once cosmic and domestic, is beautifully exemplified in Piet Mondrian: The Studios (Thames &amp; Hudson), edited by Cees W de Jong. In Amsterdam, Paris, London and New York, Mondrian lived inside modular, rectangular spaces like those on the canvases he painted \u2013 cells for a theosophical monk, who believed that a studio should be \u201ca small sanctuary\u201d. He preferred the Paris M\u00e9tro to Notre Dame, and objected to the garden behind his studio in Hampstead because it contained too many distracting, ungeometrical trees: the world, remade by him, was a paradise for aesthetes with OCD. Gormley himself is what he calls a \u201cpost-studio artist\u201d, whose ambitions extend beyond such clean, well-lit places. In Antony Gormley on Sculpture (Thames &amp; Hudson), he conducts a tour of the work he has installed on Austrian mountains and in the Australian desert, in the Hermitage museum, St Petersburg, and on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square. His commentaries on his own creations tend to float off into metaphysics; he is best when poetically extolling the work of others \u2013 Jacob Epstein\u2019s sea-washed pebbles, Joseph Beuys\u2019s fuzzy, absorbent figures made of felt, and Richard Serra\u2019s palaeolithic-looking steel plates. Although Hayden Herrera\u2019s biography of the Japanese-American sculptor Isamu Noguchi is titled Listening to Stone (Thames &amp; Hudson), the materials Noguchi listened to were not only marble, granite and basalt. He also used paper, rubber, wood and \u2013 to the disgust of a snobbish dealer \u2013 aluminium. Sometimes his forms were uterine and earthy, but his hollow statuettes also illustrated the levity and emptiness of Zen. Herrera is brilliant on the work, and acute about the man \u2013 his schizophrenic cultural heritage, his nubile muses and his bossy clients, one of whom, an American socialite, insisted after having cosmetic surgery that he rechisel the nose on his marble portrait bust of her to bring it up to date. Noguchi sculpted water in a series of monumental fountains; the medium of the video artist Bill Viola is light, and \u2013 for instance in the tableaux of martyrdom he installed at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral \u2013 he reimagines religious miracles for an unbelieving age. The text in John Hanhardt\u2019s Bill Viola (Thames &amp; Hudson) is clouded by electronic jargon and quotes from fashionable savants, but the images are glorious.

Photograph: Sarah Lee for the Guardian    Mystics such as Viola seek to transform the world; artists with a political agenda try to change it, and generally fail. In Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo in Detroit (Yale), Mark Rosenthal describes one such quixotic campaign, when in 1932 the Mexican muralist Rivera was hired to design a \u201cSistine Chapel of industrialism\u201d for the garden court of a new museum. Rivera thought he could \u201cpromote a communist message in a capitalist land\u201d, although police had recently fired tear gas at striking labourers from the local automobile factory. Rivera\u2019s wife, Frida Kahlo, practised subversion in her own way by declaring Americans to be ugly and stupid, or by innocently asking the viciously antisemitic Henry Ford if he happened to be Jewish. The citadel may not have crumbled when Rivera painted on its walls, but his grandiose frescoes have survived, while post-industrial Detroit decays around them. In Derek Boshier: Rethink/Re-entry (Thames &amp; Hudson), Paul Gorman introduces another ingrate immigrant who, like Rivera, questions American sanctities. Boshier attended the Royal College of Art with David Hockney and they remain friends, although their visions have diverged. Hockney moved to California as a passionate pilgrim, liberated by its paganism. Boshier\u2019s images of Texas cowboys and transsexual LA prostitutes are more sourly satirical, yet he understands, as Rivera didn\u2019t, the futility of his own protests, which diverts the anger in his work into witty frustration.

Waterfield\u2019s engaging, anecdotal book about the public galleries of Victorian Britain emphasises their mission to enlighten and uplift a weary, dispirited populace. The worthies who founded these institutions were impelled by a gospel of civic altruism, which Waterfield defends against dreary contemporary assaults on museums as agents of social control and colonial oppression or \u201cmausolea for the vanities of the wealthy\u201d. It\u2019s a noble story and \u2013 now that museums pass themselves off as retail outlets while historic houses left to the nation are \u201creduced\u201d, as Waterfield remarks with a sniff, \u201cto functioning as wedding venues\u201d \u2013 its retelling has a sharply cautionary intent.

But with its sleek new railway station now in place, the city is poised to become a crucial transport link between the economic centres of Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. The culmination of nearly two decades of work and \u20ac37.5m of funding, Arnhem Central station is a soaring modernist structure made of undulating glass, exposed concrete and steel. By 2020, as many as 110,000 passengers a day may pass through its airy halls. Though not the largest in Europe \u2013 more than 140,000 pass through London\u2019s King\u2019s Cross station on an average weekday \u2013 the station stands out for the visual and technical innovations in its design. It elevates its immediate surroundings, giving the area a much-needed focal point through which everyone passes.     The station is near the banks of the river Nederrijn. Photograph: Siebe Swart    \u201cPeople asked, \u2018Why did it take so long?\u2019 The answer is it was a big, difficult puzzle,\u201d says Ben van Berkel, founder and principal architect of Amsterdam-based UNStudio, which designed the station. Over the course of extensive urban studies, the original station plan morphed into a far more ambitious transportation hub containing two bus stations, offices, and parking for roughly 1,000 cars and 4,500 bicycles.      Ceilings and walkways seem to melt effortlessly into each other. Photograph: Frank Hanswijk    In the process, the team employed shipbuilding techniques and the expertise of engineering firm Arup to keep the sinuous roof aloft with few visible supports. The result is a vast, open space filled with natural light where the floor, ceiling and walkways seem to melt effortlessly into each other. \u201cWe wanted to get back to this notion of celebrating travelling,\u201d says van Berkel. \u201cAnd because all the parties involved were so excited about it, we didn\u2019t have to compromise on the design.\u201d The arrival of the station invites travellers, who might previously have bypassed the city, to stop for a day and take in the picturesque cafe-lined streets of Arnhem, Gelderland\u2019s capital on the lower Rhine. Military history buffs will want to pause by the John Frost Bridge, the site of the crucial second world war battle depicted in the film A Bridge Too Far, while families should head for the nearby Hoge Veluwe national park, a sprawling nature preserve and the site of the impressive Kr\u00f6ller-M\u00fcller Museum (open Tue-Sun 10am-5pm, combination park and museum ticket \u20ac17.60), with one of the largest sculpture gardens on the continent and works by Van Gogh, Picasso and Monet.  The city also boasts a respectable modern art showcase, Museum Arnhem (open Tue-Sun 11am-5pm, \u20ac10), as well as the century-old Netherlands Open Air Museum (opening hours vary, \u20ac12-\u20ac16), with interactive exhibits on Dutch history and culture.     The sinuous roof is kept aloft with few visible supports. Photograph: Hufton+Crow 020    That the area\u2019s profile will rise from the influx of international visitors is all but inevitable. For the residents of Arnhem though, the project\u2019s value manifests on a much smaller, more personal scale. \u201cPeople came to me and said that they are proud to show it to their friends and family,\u201d van Berkel says. \u201cThat it\u2019s nice to pick up people here and to say goodbye to them.\u201d", "sentences": ["Photograph: Siebe Swart    \u201cPeople asked, \u2018Why did it take so long?\u2019 The answer is it was a big, difficult puzzle,\u201d says Ben van Berkel, founder and principal architect of Amsterdam-based UNStudio, which designed the station."], "title": "Arnhem\u2019s stunning new railway station raises city's profile", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2015/dec/07/arnhem-netherlands-new-railway-station", "tags": ["Netherlands holidays", "Europe holidays", "Travel", "Rail travel", "Rail transport", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-12-07T14:51:45Z", "article": "The Flemish culture minister, Sven Gatz, has defended his decision to blacken his face for a costume after he was criticised as racist.

The small provincial museum\u2019s director, Ad Geerdink, said it was going public in a last-ditch effort to recover the 24 works, which were snatched along with 70 pieces of antique silverware in a burglary in January 2005.  \u201cWe have done all we can, but we\u2019ve reached a dead end,\u201d Geerdink said on the museum\u2019s website. \u201cThe artworks risk disappearing from view once more, and we are sounding the alarm.\u201d He also told De Telegraaf: \u201cThe clock is ticking. It is at one minute to midnight. Perhaps even one minute past midnight.\u201d Geerdink said the haul \u2013 which includes works by the Dutch masters Jan van Goyen, Hendrick Bogaert, Floris van Schooten and Jacob Waben \u2013 formed the core of the museum\u2019s collection of 17th- and 18th-century art.

Photograph: Olaf Kraak/AFP/Getty    The museum said it learned the paintings had surfaced in Ukraine in July, when two members of the Organisation of Ukrainian Nationalists \u2013 one of more than 50 militias opposing Russian incursions in eastern Ukraine \u2013 approached the Dutch embassy in Kiev.  The men claimed to possess the missing Westfries paintings, and offered a photograph of one \u2013 pictured alongside a copy of a recent Ukrainian newspaper \u2013 as proof. The militia would consider their return under certain conditions and in exchange for \u20ac50m (\u00a336m), the men said. Having exhausted diplomatic channels through the Dutch foreign ministry and enlisted the help of Interpol, also to no avail, the museum despatched an independent stolen art expert to Ukraine to negotiate directly on its behalf. \u201cThe militiamen disappeared quite quickly, after a couple of meetings,\u201d the expert, Arthur Brand, told a press conference on Monday.

It rises to two uneven peaks in staggered pixels, like something from the game Sim City abandoned midway through construction. This is the Timmerhuis \u2013 the latest gift to the Netherlands\u2019 second city by its most celebrated architectural practice, OMA, headed up by Rem Koolhaas. Two years ago he completed Holland\u2019s biggest ever building here, momentously named The Rotterdam \u2013 another enormous stack of blocks which looms on the riverfront (with most of its luxury flats still unsold). The Rotterdam may be the biggest, but the Timmerhuis is of greater significance \u2013 for the direction that both Koolhaas and the entire city are heading in. Tucked behind the city hall and the old central post office, it stands on the site of the 15th-century Stadstimmerhuis, once home to the city carpenter and storehouse of building materials for major public works. Flattened by bombs in the second world war, like most of the city, it was rebuilt as the central planning office and became the very place where Rotterdam\u2019s ambitious post-war vision was laid out \u2013 a seminal plan that would inspire similar modernist urban plans around the world. It seems only fitting, then, that the pixelated glacier which now rises from the site is the perfect reflection of Rotterdam\u2019s current predicament \u2013 a place of bold ambitions, vain hopes and spectacular failures.     \u2018Vertical village\u2019 \u2026 the apartments feel like being in a treehouse of glass and steel. Photograph: Ossip\u00a0van Duivenbode/OMA    The \u20ac100m building is a typical public-private partnership. Commissioned by the city, it contains five floors of offices for municipal departments, a base of cafes and shops (soon to be joined by the city museum), and a crown of 84 luxury apartments that help pay for it all. The flats are some of Rotterdam\u2019s more spectacular. Many come with huge patios on the rooftops of their neighbours, and they provide thrilling mid-level views of the city. \u201cIt literally feels like living in a village in the sky,\u201d says Ossip van Duivenbode, a photographer who was among the first to move in. \u201cI\u2019ve met more of my neighbours here in the past few weeks, waving across to their patios, than I ever did in my previous apartment building.\u201d From inside his flat, it feels like being in a glass and steel treehouse, a world of platforms and ledges staggered below, with privacy provided by white ceramic fritting on the glass. It recalls the wild visions of earlier Dutch \u201cstructuralist\u201d architects like Herman Hertzberger and Piet Blom, whose bright yellow Cube House cluster hovers over the road nearby. But Reinier de Graaf, the OMA partner in charge of the project, wants to shake off such references. \u201cI\u2019ve never been a fan of Hertzberger,\u201d he says, standing in the atrium where a 3D grid of steel columns and beams criss-cross over our heads like a gigantic Sol LeWitt sculpture. \u201cI see this as more Eisenman meets Farnsworth House\u201d \u2013 a mash-up of Mies van der Rohe\u2019s seminal modernist villa and the hair-brained illogic of deconstructivist Peter Eisenman. It\u2019s an unexpected marriage that has produced an odd love-child.     \u2018Eisenman meets Farnsworth House\u2019 \u2026 the steel truss structure continues into the building\u2019s atrium. Photograph: Ossip\u00a0van Duivenbode/OMA    The hefty steel structure reappears throughout the building: big exposed columns thrust through the office floors, bolted together in the middle as if cobbled from leftovers like a cut-and-shut car. There are some of OMA\u2019s trademark angled steel struts too, shooting through the meeting rooms, which are decked out with carpets printed with Delftware patterns and clinical rubbery curtains. The interiors mine the office\u2019s back catalogue, with glowing resin cupboards, backlit safety glass and corrugated plastic sheeting (all of which were deployed with more finesse first time around in the Rotterdam Kunsthal in 1992). Elsewhere there\u2019s a rough-and-ready palette of metal floors and exposed ducts, with suspended ceilings crashing into the retained wing of the 1950s building. The guts are revealed here and there, recalling Koolhaas\u2019s installation of an exploded office ceiling at the Venice Biennale last year. How much of this is intentional, and how much an inevitable product of the design-and-build contract (which puts the builder in charge) is unclear. In typical OMA fashion, everything is explained with a knowing wink, crude details justified as making a point. \u201cWe don\u2019t hide the imperfections,\u201d says de Graaf. It might have made sense for their G-Star headquarters in Amsterdam \u2013 a marriage of brands that revel in crudeness \u2013 but here it sometimes jars. It is most painful on the outside of the building, where what was meant to be a misty fog of frameless glass has been translated into a clunky glazing system of inelegant grids.     Sugar cube mountain \u2026 the Timmerhuis rises up in a lopsided stack. Photograph: Ossip\u00a0van Duivenbode/OMA    But the illusion of the whole building was destroyed long before it was built. When the competition was launched by the city in 2008, the plan was for a new beacon of transparent governance, a Stadswinkel (or \u201cCity Shop\u201d) where citizens could come face to face with their civil servants to sort out their council tax or renew their driving license in a thrilling 21st-century agora. OMA\u2019s proposal won because it went to improbable lengths to achieve the city\u2019s aim, by lifting the entire building up in the air and creating a \u201ccloud\u201d of offices to hover over a heroic public forum. The building acts as an enormous bridge thanks to its Vierendeel truss system. \u201cIt enables us to liberate the ground almost in its entirety,\u201d declared Koolhaas. The vast expense of this structure \u2013 which contains half the steel of the Eiffel Tower \u2013 was justified by the promised wonder of a column-free plaza at ground level. The cloud was due to be topped with affordable micro-flats, catering to young urbanites, which would help pay for the public sector outlay below.  The only problem is that public priorities are prone to change. Having demolished most of the existing building and fixed the design, the city got cold feet in 2011 and decided it was too expensive to move the City Shop here. With a private development partner already on board, it was too late to put the brakes on, so it would simply forge ahead and find something to fill the ground floor later. The museum is an awkward fit: the staggered floors of offices, intended to look out on to the public area, will now look into exhibition halls \u2013 or more likely be blocked up.

Photograph: Ossip van Duivenbode/OMA    \u201cWe were left with our hovering cloud, with its entire raison d\u2019etre removed,\u201d says de Graaf, who was furious at the decision. The controversy added to what was already a hotly contested project. A number of embittered rival architects launched legal action against the city when OMA\u2019s scheme was chosen, claiming there was no way their floating citadel could be built within the budget. Their claims were dismissed, but it was a revealing sign of the animosity aimed at the building \u2013 and the city\u2019s resident starchitect. Koolhaas has since taken a back seat, declining to comment on the project. \u201cThe whole thing is an absurdity,\u201d says Wouter Vanstiphout, professor of Design as Politics at TU Delft. \u201cIt reveals the total vulnerability of the city\u2019s model of development, and this desperate moving around of civic functions to try and fill the holes in its own failed public-private partnerships.\u201d He points to the fact that The Rotterdam building also had to be occupied by city departments to avoid it standing vacant, while another long-stalled OMA project, the Forum, toyed with housing the city museum when other tenants dropped out. Planned as a centre for luxury brands, it will now be home to Holland\u2019s biggest Primark. \u201cThe failure is that the city has made itself dependent on the market for its civic activities,\u201d adds Vanstiphout. \u201cIt always expects too much from it \u2013 like the City Shop and the intended affordable housing in the Timmerhuis \u2013 then there is always the same disappointment.\u201d Sadly, what could have been a beacon of civic pride has turned out as a hollow symbol of compromise.", "sentences": ["It might have made sense for their G-Star headquarters in Amsterdam \u2013 a marriage of brands that revel in crudeness \u2013 but here it sometimes jars."], "title": "A floating fortress: Rem Koolhaas's flawed gift to his home city", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2015/dec/08/rotterdam-timmerhuis-rem-koolhaas-flawed-gift-to-his-home-city", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Rem Koolhaas", "Culture", "Netherlands", "Europe", "World news", "Regeneration", "Communities", "Society", "Politics"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-12-09T09:00:51Z", "article": "In late November, reports circulated that Major League Baseball was deep in negotiations to host a regular season series at London\u2019s Olympic Stadium, sparking great excitement in the small but dedicated enclaves of European baseball. But would such a series be viable? And, if so, what would be its purpose? Whispers about a possible London series first appeared in the Daily Telegraph, and were later confirmed by a slew of US outlets, notably Fox Sports. MLB has never ventured to Europe, but industry experts say the league has long viewed the Olympic Stadium as a potential venue to stage games. Now, those discussions appear to have reached a critical phase, with officials viewing 2017 as the earliest feasible date for a series. The Olympic Stadium was built especially for the 2012 Games, but the Premier League\u2019s West Ham will move in next summer as part of a $400m makeover. MLB has measured the venue, and believes its dimension are compatible with baseball, eradicating one of the potential pitfalls. Accordingly, many observers are now looking beyond those initial concerns, into the minutiae and motive of such an audacious project. Just why is baseball so eager to host games in the UK? Commissioner Rob Manfred wants to continue the work of Bud Selig in expanding baseball to new markets. With such a crowded domestic sports landscape, MLB must seek new interest, ideas and customers from overseas, as recent series in Australia and tours to Japan indicate. But many European analysts hope that games on the continent will be tethered to a commitment by MLB to grow the game in untapped locales, with more investment in academies, infrastructure and coaching helping to improve the standard of play. \u201cI do believe there is a sincere interest in developing baseball in non-traditional markets,\u201d says Josh Chetwynd, the author of Baseball In Europe and a man who played and covered the game there. \u201cMLB recently installed a new head of international, who previously worked closely with Manfred. Whether that leads to a more robust coordination in developing baseball abroad, we\u2019ll have to see. The key word about all this is \u2018coordination.\u2019 You can\u2019t have one series and just assume that people will flock to the sport. The NFL did tons of groundwork in the UK and Europe before they started taking regular season games to London.\u201d Indeed, the success of Roger Goodell\u2019s International Series at Wembley Stadium must be a key inspiration for Manfred and MLB. The NFL has staged at least one game in Britain every year since 2007, with multiple dates in each of the past three seasons. Next year, Twickenham will also hold a game, while the prospective new home of Tottenham Hotspur will host at least two contests per year between 2018 and 2027, in a remarkable show of unity.     The Dodgers played the Diamondbacks at Sydney Cricket Ground in March 2014. Photograph: Matt King/Getty Images    Almost 1.2 million people have attended the 14 NFL regular season games at Wembley to date, with an average crowd of 83,061 making it a very attractive and profitable enterprise. NFL\u2019s popularity has soared in Britain, as fan rallies and television broadcasts continue to draw considerable interest, creating huge demand for tickets, which usually sell out within days. Of course, many traditionalists dislike the concept of London games, but from the league\u2019s viewpoint, the project has been an undoubted success. Major League Baseball does a fine job with academies in Europe. But much more can be done to grow the game there \u2013 it lags far behind the NBA and NFL in popularity in Europe. One man particularly keen to see that happen is Liam Carroll, the head coach of Great Britain. \u201cI think an MLB game played here would make my job a little easier, as well as even more enjoyable and rewarding,\u201d says Carroll, who has been involved with the national team as a coach and player since 1996. \u201cParticipation increases will be inevitable. More people will find out that there are opportunities for so many different types to succeed in our sport. The visibility of what already exists would be massively enhanced, which will open up doors to areas including sponsorship. Even if we\u2019re dealing with rumors at this stage, the key for everyone involved now is to make sure that we\u2019re ready for the interest and coverage if indeed it happens.\u201d But whether Europe as a whole is ready to host MLB games is still unclear. For a long time, the Netherlands was typically viewed as the chief embryo of MLB,with a purpose-built ballpark in Hoofddorp, near Amsterdam, having considerable input from league officials. That facility was built to fit MLB specifications, and there were some indications that Selig tried to expedite the process of taking games there during the last months of his reign, but a deal was never completed. Now, his successor seems intrigued by London, likely due to the shared language and general familiarity.     The Yankees\u2019 Didi Gregorius is a star for the Dutch national baseball team. Photograph: Elsa/Getty Images    Britain has a long and often tenuous relationship with baseball, but one steeped in history. \u201cYou had an 1874 tour between the Boston Red Sox and Philadelphia Athletics in the UK,\u201d explains Chetwynd. \u201cThen, in 1888-89, a tour run by one of baseball\u2019s first great magnates, AG Spalding, featured major leaguers and made stops throughout Britain, France and Italy. \u201cIn 1912-13, Charles Comiskey of the Chicago White Sox and John McGraw of the New York Giants led another European tour, while, in terms of more recent efforts, MLB sent minor league representatives of the Red Sox and Mets to play each other at the Oval cricket ground in 1993. \u201cThe takeaway from these efforts have ebbed and flowed for many years. Still, with all the success the NFL is having and the general understanding that, to survive in today\u2019s incredibly competitive landscape, sports must succeed in as many markets as possible, MLB must be, and should be, looking at taking the plunge into holding regular European series more seriously than ever.\u201d So, how will a prospective London series be achieved? The initiative would certainly have major hurdles, such as scheduling to both appease West Ham and give the players time to recover from unusual travel arrangements. However, with long-term planning and complete transparency from all parties, such challenges can be overcome.  Due to baseball\u2019s status as a niche sport in Britain, MLB would be best served sending famous teams to London, with east coast organizations making the most sense0. Therefore, the Yankees and Red Sox would be a tantalizing proposition, and both franchises already have strong ties to Britain. The Yankees maintain a relationship with Manchester City, while Liverpool FC and the Red Sox are owned by the same group. Yankee officials have already stated a desire to explore playing in Britain, so MLB could perhaps use those links to break down some barriers and smooth the entire process. Where there\u2019s a will, there\u2019s usually a way. If Major League Baseball is genuinely devoted to the idea of playing games in London, it has the power and networking possibilities to make it a considerable success, following the NFL model. Britain also has a small but dedicated set of baseball fans, advocates and volunteers, who would love the opportunity to welcome their heroes to the island. Ultimately, in this age of increased globalization, North American sports have never been more popular overseas, and we\u2019ve never had more tools with which to spread them far and wide, reaching into non-traditional territories to change perceptions and enhance lives.

LaBeouf\u2019s a world-famous Hollywood actor turned performance artist, the former star of the Transformers franchise. Turner and R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 are plain old artists, based in London and Helsinki respectively.  LaBeouf, handsome, scruffy and slightly belligerent, is wearing a white sweatshirt and vapes intently. He\u2019s got the three dots you see on an iPhone when someone is texting you tattooed on his hand. \u201cTo use technology to connect with people is fucking magical,\u201d he says. \u201cYou know when you\u2019re texting somebody and those three dots pop up? There\u2019s so much magic happening in your anticipation, in your waiting for that response, and if the three dots go away you feel like, \u2018Argh!\u2019\u201d Turner and R\u00f6nkk\u00f6, it\u2019s safe to say, don\u2019t quite have the same growly charisma as LaBeouf. Indeed, they look as if they\u2019ve won a competition to hang out with him. But the unlikely trio are adamant that they are an artistic collective, each on an equal footing. Turner wags a metaphorical finger at journalists who have failed to understand this. \u201cIf it\u2019s a positive article, it\u2019s a work by the art collective,\u201d he says. \u201cIf it\u2019s negative, it\u2019s by \u2018actor Shia LaBeouf\u2019.\u201d He frowns. \u201cIt\u2019s very peculiar to write about a work without saying who it\u2019s by.\u201d But aren\u2019t they like a band, where people are only interested in the singer? \u201cWell,\u201d says Turner, \u201cyou don\u2019t say, \u2018John Lennon has released his album.\u2019 It\u2019s the Beatles. I\u2019m not comparing us to the Beatles, by the way.\u201d     Suit by Dior, bag by Tesco \u2026 Shia LaBeouf at the \u2018Nymphomaniac: Volume I\u2019 film premiere. Photograph: Picture Perfect/REX    Since the beginning of 2014 \u2013 when LaBeouf heralded his new career by attending the premiere of Nymphomaniac with a paper bag over his head, scrawled with the words \u201cI am not famous any more\u201d \u2013 the three have dreamed up projects (some call them stunts, a term they hate) that have involved LaBeouf interacting directly with the public. For the first, #IAMSORRY, he sat with a bag over his head in an LA gallery while art-lovers, fans and curious passers-by came in to spend time with him one to one. The project became notorious when LaBeouf said a woman had sexually assaulted him in the course of it. Then there was #METAMARATHON, which saw him running 144 laps of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam in purple Spandex, holding a baton with anyone who wanted to run alongside him.   Related: Shia hell? Watching LaBeouf watching LaBeouf    In #ALLMYMOVIES, the latest project, LaBeouf watches all his films in reverse order \u2013 from Man Down to Breakfast With Einstein via Indiana Jones \u2013 at a cinema in New York for three days and nights, surrounded by members of the public, a camera trained on his face throughout. The starting point, says LaBeouf, was \u201csome interview with Johnny Depp on how he never watches his own films and it just felt like false modesty\u201d. As the 60-hour marathon unfolded, it launched a thousand memes. \u201cIt\u2019s a big part of why we do this,\u201d says LaBeouf. \u201cOther people get to be creative with us.\u201d Hence all the hashtags. Such self-mockery may explain why #ALLMYMOVIES was so warmly received, particularly by those who queued for up to 17 hours to share a moment \u2013 and perhaps some popcorn \u2013 with LaBeouf. \u201cIt was really nice to be sitting watching Indiana Jones and feeling all this shame about the movie, and to have somebody come up and nudge me on the shoulder and say, \u2018It wasn\u2019t your fault.\u2019 You leave the theatre and strangers feel like family. I was walking down the street today and someone offered me a bagel. Films don\u2019t do that for you. Films separate you.\u201d Does he think people respected the fact that he\u2019d had the nerve to look at all his films \u2013 and his life \u2013 in the face? \u201cIf you think I\u2019m doing this stuff for respect,\u201d he says, \u201cit\u2019s the strangest strategy ever developed. No, I\u2019m doing this to connect.\u201d     Shia LaBeouf in #METAMARATHON, for which he ran 144 laps of the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam Photograph: Jeroen Jumelet/EPA/Corbis    Liverpool will be the next city to get the chance to connect with the trio. In #TOUCHMYSOUL, they will be stationed in Fact Gallery, taking calls from the public. People will also be able to go along and watch. Perhaps mindful of the fact that rather more people will be interested in calling LaBeouf than the other two, the conversations will be four-way and, like many of their projects, livestreamed.  It\u2019s the first time R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 and Turner have also fronted a project. Previously, LaBeouf has been alone in the hot seat. \u201cI always tell them: what if someone\u2019s going to set my hair on fire, what if someone comes in with a mallet and hits me in the face?\u201d says LaBeouf, though he does add: \u201cThe more we do this, the less fear I have about the public.\u201d Critics have largely dismissed their projects, putting them in the same bracket as, say, David Blaine living in a Perspex box for 44 days. MoMA curator Klaus Biesenbach all but called #IAMSORRY a rip-off of Marina Abromovic\u2019s The Artist Is Present, in which she locked gazes with members of the public across a table at MoMA. It\u2019s a criticism that makes the trio particularly irate. \u201cIt was people sitting facing each other, but there were so many differences it was completely a different piece,\u201d says R\u00f6nkk\u00f6.  LaBeouf adds: \u201cHers was about \u2018the artist is present, I\u2019m a genius\u2019. Ours is about \u2018the artist is absent\u2019 \u2013 it has nothing to do with any notion of genius. Ours was intimate. Hers was a false intimacy. Looking in a mirror by yourself is an intimate experience. But if you have a thousand people staring at you staring at yourself in the mirror, you\u2019re performing.\u201d The trio insist that their work is not aimed at the art world in any case, although Turner does say: \u201cI mean, it\u2019s nice if everyone embraces it. But people who aren\u2019t writers write these amazing 2,000-word articles about their experience on Tumblr, which are just as articulate as the best art writing, and as perceptive.\u201d  Probably not as informed, though? \u201cThat hasn\u2019t anything to do with being able to enjoy art,\u201d says LaBeouf. \u201cI think it\u2019s sad when you have to be art educated to enjoy art. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s very good art.\u201d     Screen time \u2026 Shia LaBeouf yawns through the 60-hour marathon of his own films for #ALLMYMOVIES    \u201cAnd as soon as you say something\u2019s not art,\u201d continues Turner, \u201cyou have become an elitist. Our work is not in any way dumbed down, but it\u2019s not translated into some kind of elitist language. It is what it is.\u201d A waitress comes to check on us as the noises of Friday night revelry rise from the bar. The three stare into their laps intently. LaBeouf met Turner and R\u00f6nkk\u00f6 after he was accused of plagiarising a work by graphic novelist Daniel Clowes for his short film Howard Cantour.com. Googling for some art theory that could get him off the hook, he instead came across Turner\u2019s manifesto for metamodernism, which the English artist describes as \u201ca romantic reaction to our crisis-ridden moment: the idea is to return to some feeling or affect\u201d. Inspired, LaBeouf emailed Turner and the pair met. LaBeouf was filming Fury at the time, not far from where Turner lived. Turner involved R\u00f6nkk\u00f6, a previous collaborator, and the art collective was born. LaBeouf had become dissatisfied with his film career and \u2013 encouraged by Lars von Trier, his director on Nymphomaniac \u2013 started working on a new means of expressing himself. But why pick performance art? \u201cWhy does a goat jump?\u201d says LaBeouf. \u201cThere\u2019s an animalistic urge to express love that I can\u2019t express in film. I felt limited after coming out of Transformers. Or all the stuff I\u2019d done with Steven Spielberg, not to pooh-pooh those films, but you have no creative control.\u201d Performance art gave LaBeouf, who has not given up film, the chance to explore the process of acting. \u201cThe guys I always looked up to \u2013 Daniel Day-Lewis, Sean Penn \u2013 I loved the myths I heard about how their performances were created. And I thought, \u2018Oh man, it would be great if you could see the process, you\u2019d enjoy the performance a bit more.\u2019 That\u2019s why I turned to performance art, because it\u2019s just about the process. It\u2019s all aired out.\u201d  The trio are at Fact Gallery, Liverpool, from 11 to 14 December; 0151-808 0771 GMT,. Follow runs until 21 February.

It\u2019s funny you should ask that. I\u2019m always transporting myself to five years ago and asking myself the same questions. I\u2019d have been really excited! I\u2019ve never had an ill thought about that guy, even when he got in trouble for egging someone\u2019s house. I think we all grew up with way worse kids than that. (2) It\u2019s been a turning point for both our careers in that we both did something new together. All the best songs of all time are collaborative: the Beatles, Michael Jackson with Quincy Jones, Tupac and Dr Dre. I\u2019m trying to think of a decent counter argument. I mean some of my favourite music pieces of all time are by Aphex Twin, and they\u2019re probably just him sitting in his room in his underwear, but in terms of things that impact on culture there\u2019s almost always a team. Do you think Aphex Twin could make a good Justin Bieber record? The real question is: would he? He did that album 26 Mixes For Cash, that had a bunch of more famous songs (3) that he flipped. Although some of them sound as if he didn\u2019t use anything from the song.            When did you last feel victorious? Well. When we won at the AMAs recently. (4) To be quite honest, I\u2019d never paid attention to the AMAs because it\u2019s the biggest names in pop music; I\u2019d never had that sort of attention before. Who\u2019s your big musical tip for 2016? Dej Loaf is really talented, Goldlink is amazing. There\u2019s an artist I just signed called Marshmello, he sounds like nothing else. He\u2019s about to do his first tour and he\u2019s sold out every show; he\u2019s so viral but so organic. He\u2019s just done a great remix of Adele\u2019s Hello. It\u2019s going to be a huge year for Marshmello. (5) I thought we might get through the interview without mentioning Adele, but here we are. How can you not, though? Come on! Props to her. She\u2019s the greatest. Talk about feeling victorious; she must be feeling victorious right now. Does Kanye have good manners? (6) Yeah! He was great with me. He\u2019s a very passionate person, and he expresses it in a certain way. I\u2019ve been in situations where, years ago \u2026 well, to be honest, I stopped doing interviews because of a Guardian interview I once did. It was the one with the headline \u201cThe most hated man in dubstep\u201d. It was the beginning of my career and I was definitely a punching bag for purists, but I just wanted to make music. How\u2019s this Guardian interview going so far? It\u2019s FINE! If you have an opinion and want to say something negative I\u2019m fine with that (7), but back then it was different, when all I wanted to do was make people happy and I was looking at a backlash based on things I never wanted to do.            Are you easily embarrassed? Actually, when I was about eight, I did get pantsed in the schoolyard. I get the \u201cnaked at school\u201d dream a lot. I used to have a dream where I\u2019d be wearing a T-shirt that comes up past my belly button, and I\u2019m walking around school with no pants or underwear, just trying to pull my shirt down enough to cover myself. Does working with Justin mean you\u2019ve been getting lots of collaboration requests from pop acts? There have been a lot; lots will come from people who\u2019ll text me: \u201cHey, I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019re into this but would you be into producing the Meghan Trainor song for the new Snoopy movie?\u201d Things like that. Did you work on that song? No, no I didn\u2019t. That\u2019s a relief, it wasn\u2019t very good. Well, yeah, I wasn\u2019t inspired to go and do it, but I did get to meet Meghan at the AMAs and she was really sweet. I mean I didn\u2019t hear the song, but if kids who watched the movie liked the song, it was good in the sense that it did what it needed to do, right? But isn\u2019t what you\u2019ve done with Justin Bieber a way of showing you can make music kids will like, but that you can also make it as adventurous as it can possibly be? I hear what you\u2019re saying: if you can do both, you do both. But things are created for different purposes and everything sits in its own context. When you were a kid, who was your own Meghan Trainor? Fuckin\u2019 hell, man! When Hanson\u2019s MMMBop came out \u2026 well, I don\u2019t think I\u2019d ever listened to another song that many times. I remember being with my dad in the car, playing it over and over and over again. I loved it. Kids are so much less homophobic now but back then, they\u2019d go: \u201c\u2018YOU\u2019RE GAY!\u201d \u201cYOU\u2019RE GAY FOR LIKING THAT!\u201d I got older and I was like: \u201cI can\u2019t like that, my peers don\u2019t like it.\u201d But a few years ago I got to play a gig in Amsterdam and Hanson played an earlier show. It was fucking SO COOL to see them. If music can make a positive impact on somebody \u2013 even if it\u2019s a child and it was meant just for that \u2013 and if you\u2019re spending a lot of money on making people happy, that\u2019s got to be better than spending money on war. Footnotes 1 In 2010, Sonny released his first EP as Skrillex. It was called My Name Is Skrillex. 2 A fair point, but it\u2019s also reasonable to assume most of us didn\u2019t grow up with someone who urinated in restaurant mop buckets while shouting: \u201cFUCK BILL CLINTON!\u201d 3 Well, songs by Jesus Jones and Saint Etienne. 4 Skrillex, Diplo and Justin Bieber won the best collaboration award for Where Are U Now? 5 This may qualify as a Ghostbusters reboot spoiler \u2013 apologies. 6 Sonny and Kanye worked together in 2012, but the results are yet to emerge. 7 The Justin album needed more whooshy noises.

The government said it was supporting more airport capacity in the south-east by 2030, as recommended by the Airports Commission. However, it delivered a setback to Heathrow\u2019s hopes of building a third runway by neglecting to mention the airport by name in its statement and making clear other viable options \u2013 such as expansion at Gatwick \u2013 were still on the table. Although the delay was widely expected, Cameron immediately faced fury from business groups and accusations from Labour that he had ducked a difficult decision on infrastructure to help the chances of Zac Goldsmith, the Tory London mayoral candidate, who is a fierce opponent of Heathrow expansion. The British Chamber of Commerce said it was \u201cgutless\u201d, while the CBI group for big business called the decision \u201cdeeply disappointing\u201d. Sadiq Khan, the Labour London mayoral candidate, said the Tories were \u201ckicking the decision into the long grass to avoid embarrassing\u201d Goldsmith.   Related: Roll up, roll up for the transport secretary's magical mystery tour    The prime minister had previously indicated there would be a final decision before the end of this year, after the Airports Commission led by Howard Davies recommended a third runway at Heathrow. But more recently, the Commons environmental audit committee produced a parliamentary report saying final approval should not be granted until the airport demonstrated it could meet key environmental conditions on climate change, air quality and noise. It warned that a failure to deal with environmental concerns could lay the scheme open to legal challenge. The new statement from the government, released after a meeting of the airports subcommittee, stressed the need for further environmental work, including testing the Airports Commission\u2019s air quality analysis using the latest predicted concentrations of nitrogen dioxide. Those present at the meeting included Cameron; the chancellor, George Osborne; the transport secretary, Patrick McLoughlin; the environment secretary, Liz Truss; the chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, Oliver Letwin; the communities secretary, Greg Clark; and the chief whip, Mark Harper. A statement from the Department for Transport said the \u201clocation decision\u201d for extra airport capacity would be \u201csubject to further consideration on environmental impacts and the best possible mitigation measures\u201d. It said the government agreed with the Airports Commission that the south-east needed more runway capacity by 2030 and agreed with its shortlist of options, which kept Gatwick open as a viable possibility. McLoughlin said: \u201cThe case for aviation expansion is clear but it\u2019s vitally important we get the decision right so that it will benefit generations to come. We will undertake more work on environmental impacts, including air quality, noise and carbon. \u201cWe must develop the best possible package of measures to mitigate the impacts on local people. We will continue work on all the shortlisted locations, so that the timetable for more capacity set out by Sir Howard is met. \u201cAt the first opportunity I will make a statement to the house to make clear our plans.\u201d Lilian Greenwood, Labour\u2019s shadow transport secretary, was scathing about Cameron having \u201cbroken his clear promise to make a decision before the end of the year\u201d. She said: \u201cTonight\u2019s statement owes more to political calculations than genuine concern for the environment or residents who now face another year of blight and uncertainty. This shambolic announcement is an embarrassment and no-one will be convinced that the government is taking our runway capacity or environmental needs seriously.\u201d The London mayor, Boris Johnson, not a fan of expanding Heathrow, claimed that expansion had been \u201cofficially grounded\u201d despite airport officials putting a \u201csuperhuman effort into bouncing the government into a quick decision in their favour\u201d.  He said: \u201cThe prime minister and his colleagues have refused to allow themselves to be hustled. The wheels are falling off the Heathrow fuselage and I think that, now the government has hit the pause button, they will begin to understand with ever greater clarity that, due to the environmental impacts, the legal obstacles and the cost to the public purse, this bird will never fly.\u201d  Johnson added that the chances of his favoured project \u2013 a new airport in the Thames estuary \u2013 going ahead have been boosted by the delay.  Cameron did not please green groups, either. Oliver Hayes, a campaigner with Friends of the Earth, said: \u201cIt\u2019s absurd that UK government ministers are touting \u2018green Britain\u2019 in Paris while beating the drum for more climate changing pollution through a new runway back home. \u201cWith the majority of flights taken by a small number of frequent flyers, it\u2019s time the government taxed those who are contributing most to the air pollution and carbon problems that aviation exacerbates.\u201d Cameron may have put off the resignation of Goldsmith, which would have led to a difficult byelection, and temporarily avoided the loss of several cabinet ministers who are opposed to Heathrow expansion. But he incurred the ire of other Tory MPs whose constituencies are near Gatwick. Crispin Blunt, the Tory MP who is chair of the Gatwick Coordination Group, called it \u201cdisgraceful vacillation by government over Heathrow\u201d. \u201cThey will richly deserve opprobrium to be poured all over this shocking non-decision,\u201d he said. Among others to respond was Rob Gray, the campaign director of the Back Heathrow group, who condemned Cameron\u2019s \u201cdithering and delaying\u201d. \u201cThe government has created more uncertainty for local residents, more uncertainty for workers in the local area and the potential loss to the UK economy of more than \u00a35bn,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is massive support for Heathrow expansion: from across all political parties, the majority of UK businesses, international airlines, local firms and most importantly, from local residents. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the government to get off the fence, commit to Heathrow expansion and seize this golden opportunity to grow the economies of west London, the Thames valley and the UK as a whole.\u201d John Longworth, the director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said businesses would see it as a \u201cgutless move by a government that promised a clear decision on a new runway by the end of the year\u201d. He said: \u201cBusiness will question whether ministers are delaying critical upgrades to our national infrastructure for legitimate reasons, or to satisfy short-term political interests.\u201d Terry Scuoler, the chief executive of EEF, the manufacturers\u2019 organisation, said: \u201cBy avoiding a tough decision, despite a well evidenced shortlist, the government has again dithered and avoided the issue. Industry is fed up and dismayed by the continued excuses and political dilly dallying.\u201d Meanwhile, Carolyn Fairbairn, the CBI director general, said delaying the decision \u201con an issue of critical importance to the future prosperity of the UK is deeply disappointing\u201d. \u201cWe urgently need to increase our runway capacity to spur trade growth, investment and job creation. Just eight new routes to emerging markets could boost our exports by up to \u00a31bn a year,\u201d she said. \u201cBut by 2025 \u2013 the earliest a new runway would be built \u2013 London\u2019s airports could already be operating at full capacity and the longer we wait the further we fall behind the likes of Amsterdam and Paris. If we don\u2019t have a new runway up and running by 2030 the cost to the UK will be as much as \u00a35.3bn a year in lost trade to the Brics [Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa] alone. Khan said the country \u201ccould not afford more dithering over aviation capacity\u201d. \u201cBusinesses desperately need more airport capacity around London, and the Tories are letting them down. Gatwick stands ready to deliver it sooner, at a lower public expense and without the damaging impact of Heathrow expansion,\u201d he said. \u201cWe already know Heathrow can\u2019t be the solution. The additional damage from air and noise pollution would mean more years of delay, while protracted legal battles are fought.

Now, 50 years after he first began it, the author of Death and the Maiden has finally published All I Ever Have. The acclaimed novelist, playwright and essayist was a cultural adviser to Salvador Allende, until Augusto Pinochet\u2019s 1973 coup. He had been scheduled to work the night of the coup, and only escaped death because he had, unknowingly, swapped his shift with a friend. He went on to live in Paris, Amsterdam, and Washington DC, and has been professor of literature and Latin American studies at Duke University, North Carolina, since 1985. Index on Censorship, which has just published the story in its quarterly magazine, said that Dorfman \u201crevisited the idea\u201d recently, and saw how he could develop it into the story which has just been released, All I Ever Have. The piece stems from the image which visited Dorfman in 1966, of \u201ca man in a military band, playing a defiant, rebellious song on his trumpet\u201d, said the magazine. \u201cPerhaps because I was so full of the music of the day, the positive songs of betrothal, that counter-image visited me that morning,\u201d Dorfman told Index on Censorship. \u201cOnly recently, I understood how to write it. It was not only about the man who plays the trumpet but about what stays behind him, how the singer may die but not the song.\u201d The story opens with the trumpeter preparing to face a firing squad, the song \u201cflooding into his mouth and mind \u2026 yet again in spite of the fear of imminent death, it came to him as soon as he felt his hands being tied behind his back by the young soldier\u201d. Index on Censorship, which has just launched a fund for musicians in exile, said that Dorfman had \u201calways been interested in music as a form of resistance\u201d, with his play Death and the Maiden featuring Schubert\u2019s String Quartet No 14. The author also said that groups would sing Beethoven\u2019s Ode to Joy outside prisons in Santiago, in a protest against Pinochet. \u201cI have been reflecting for a long time on music as a meeting place with those who are our adversaries and even enemies. That music is a territory that we share with many whose views we disagree with,\u201d he told the magazine. \u201cDeath and the Maiden echoes the horror that the commanders of Nazi concentration camps adored Beethoven.\u201d Rachael Jolley, editor of Index on Censorship\u2019s magazine, said: \u201cIndex was the first English-language publisher of Ariel Dorfman\u2019s influential play Death and the Maiden, so we were extremely excited to be offered this beautifully written short story about the struggle between the heartfelt desire for free will and the need for security. It\u2019s a tale that feels incredibly real, and frightening. It draws the reader into the fear of the moment when a trumpeter faces a firing squad for playing music that he wants to play, but others demand that he refrain from. That struggle is something that is incredibly resonant with Index, which has just launched the Music in Exile fund in conjunction with the team behind the new documentary on Malian musicians They Will Have to Kill Us First. It seeks to help musicians who face bans and threats.\u201d", "sentences": ["He went on to live in Paris, Amsterdam, and Washington DC, and has been professor of literature and Latin American studies at Duke University, North Carolina, since 1985."], "title": "Ariel Dorfman publishes short story begun 50 years ago", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2015/dec/15/ariel-dorfman-short-story-all-i-ever-have-published", "tags": ["Short stories", "Books", "Theatre", "Fiction", "Culture", "Human rights"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-12-16T11:13:11Z", "article": "Joseph Harker: \u2018Changing the words can bring a story into line with the original intention\u2019       The Tate\u2019s director, Nicholas Serota, says he would never remove offensive words from the title of an artwork on display in his gallery. His views contrast with those of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which has changed the titles of several of its paintings to take account of modern sensibilities. For example, Young Negro Girl, painted around 1900 by the Dutch artist Simon Maris, has been retitled Young Girl Holding a Fan. Serota says he would only do this if the artist gave permisison to do so \u2013 which means that for historic art he\u2019d do nothing. We should tread with extreme caution before taking such a drastic step as renaming art, and there\u2019s a clear danger of oversensitivity in making any decision. But for Serota to say \u201cnever\u201d is wrong. There are many words and phrases which, while accepted in their day, are clearly insulting and derogatory in the modern context and distort or confuse our understanding of the art itself. For example, when Huckleberry Finn was republished a few years ago its liberal use of the N-word was replaced with the word \u201cslave\u201d. In the white-supremacist era in which the book was written, just 20 years after the abolition of slavery, the N-word was clearly acceptable among its mainly white readership. The story\u2019s underlying liberal message, though, could be lost if the modern reader was distracted by language which, today, is only used by bigots. In fact, if the original story wasn\u2019t meant to be hate-filled, changing the words can actually bring it into line with the original intention rather than distorting it with words now out of context. Stephen Moss: \u2018Wrenching art from its context is a barrier to seeing and thinking\u2019        That\u2019s a very clever argument on Huck Finn \u2013 bringing the book more into line with what Mark Twain intended. But ultimately I don\u2019t buy it. We have no right to change any of the original words written by the author \u2013 unless we present the book as a translation or adaptation. One of the things we should treasure about a book is that it is a time capsule that preserves the way an age thought about itself. Once we start tinkering with it to bring it up to date, we lose much of what makes it unique and valuable in the first place. If we start by censoring Twain, where do we stop? Clearly, The Merchant of Venice is antisemitic. Do we rewrite it or just not stage it? Fagin in Oliver Twist is another antisemitic caricature. Another rewrite. And what on earth do we do with all the antisemitic lines in the poetry of TS Eliot? \u201cThe rats are underneath the piles. / The Jew is underneath the lot. / Money in furs.\u201d Out with the blue pencil. But that way madness lies, because once you\u2019ve started, where do you stop? Everything written before our conformist PC age is fair game. As for works of art, who cares what they\u2019re called? Gallery-goers need to get thicker skins. Gauguin\u2019s entire oeuvre is western colonialist, his depictions of Tahitians exploitative and patronising, but that doesn\u2019t mean we ignore him or write off his work. We judge it in its context. Censorship and wrenching art from its original context are barriers to seeing and thinking.     Paul Gauguin\u2019s Vairaumati te ioa (Her Name is Vairaumati, 1892). Photograph: Georgios Kefalas/EPA    JH: Stephen, you\u2019re missing the point. If art really does seek to stereotype or demonise certain groups or genders then, yes, we do have to think about whether we want to display, publish or broadcast it. If the Merchant of Venice had little artistic value we\u2019d probably have ditched it decades ago \u2013 and even today it\u2019s worth evaluating whether we still consider its antisemitism to be a secondary concern. These are issues of the storyline and the essence of the work. With Huckleberry Finn it\u2019s simply about a particular word, which can easily be replaced without losing the original meaning. This point is made even more clearly if you consider Agatha Christie\u2019s original work 10 Little N\u2014rs (later reprinted as both 10 Little Indians and as And Then There Were None). The book itself is a very good murder mystery \u2013 the title is taken from an old nursery rhyme \u2013 but it loses nothing by having its name changed. It merely makes the novel accessible to modern generations in the way the original version would never be. SM: I\u2019m afraid I\u2019m going to be ultra-purist here, Joseph. I don\u2019t want anything in the original changed on principle, because once you allow something to be doctored I think you open a Pandora\u2019s box. It is what it is: a product of its time. I notice that Ronald Firbank\u2019s Prancing Nigger, published in 1924, is still sold under that title. How come one rule has been applied to Christie and another to Firbank? Oddly, Firbank called the book Sorrow in Sunlight and it was the American publisher who opted for the title that we would now see as offensive. At the heart of my objection to this renaming and revising of the past is the moral superiority we adopt. What gives us the right to edit the past? It\u2019s the same with all those ludicrous apologies \u2013 for slavery or the Highland clearances or the destruction of native Americans. We can\u2019t change the past and there\u2019s no point trying to pass moral judgment; all we can do is try to understand what happened and why. Start editing the past and it becomes less easy to deconstruct. We have to see it for what it was, artistic warts and all. JH: No point in passing moral judgment on the past?? I\u2019ll remember you on the next Holocaust Memorial Day. And in citing Firbank\u2019s book title switch (albeit not in the direction I would advocate) you show that in some circumstances you\u2019re OK with name changes. So why get so hung up on this? In truth, we rarely see anything \u201cwarts and all\u201d. Everything is edited in some way, for the dominant sensibilities of the time \u2013 be they 19th-century Victorian or 21st-century Elizabethan. A name change, with some kind of footnote acknowledging the original, gives us the best of both worlds: we can understand the era in which the artwork was created and bring it to a wider public. Everyone wins. Why let ultra-pedantry get in the way of that?     \u2018Wagner is still effectively banned in Israel because of his antisemitism and Hitler\u2019s adoration of his music.\u2019 Photograph: Edward Gooch/Getty Images    SM: Ah, a \u201cfootnote acknowledging the original\u201d. I feel I have wrung a concession from you. So we have the allegedly offensive words as if they are in very small type. Holocaust Memorial Day is a red herring: that is a necessary evocation of a genocide and a means of educating later generations as to what the Nazis were capable of. Yes, perhaps there is an element of moral judgment, but it is most powerful \u2013 as always - when it doesn\u2019t harangue but merely shows and bears witness. It is a long way from that dignified memorial to changing the names of works of art, or not putting on productions of Wagner (still effectively banned in Israel) because of Wagner\u2019s antisemitism and Hitler\u2019s adoration of his music. You are right that every age rewrites the past, but isn\u2019t that another reason for not renaming? What we find offensive today might not be found offensive tomorrow. Hasn\u2019t the word \u201cqueer\u201d been appropriated by the very group that it was once used against? Let the past be exactly that \u2013 past. Don\u2019t fiddle with it, or wish it wasn\u2019t the way it was. Give people more credit than to suggest that somehow their minds could be poisoned from contact with the words, images and thoughts peddled in the past. That\u2019s what Hitler did, with his suppression and reviling of \u201cdegenerate\u201d art, and Stalin too, with his veneration of mythic representations of happy, smiling peasants. What starts as relabelling and re-editing can end up as the official privileging of certain points of view. Better to leave what is done unchanged and let the public make their own minds up. As you said about The Merchant of Venice, if a work of art has lasting merit, its anachronistic language will be forgiven. Indeed, we might appreciate the writer all the more for being able to produce great art in a society riven with such prejudice.", "sentences": ["His views contrast with those of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, which has changed the titles of several of its paintings to take account of modern sensibilities."], "title": "Should we censor art and books to fit our times? | Joseph Harker and Stephen Moss", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/16/censor-art-books-times-rijksmuseum", "tags": ["Art", "Art and design", "William Shakespeare", "Culture", "Museums", "Censorship"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-12-16T15:39:29Z", "article": "Robin de Raaff\u2019s opera, first performed by the Dutch National Opera in Amsterdam in 2012, is the latest music-theatre work to be based on the life of Marilyn Monroe. It\u2019s easy to understand composers\u2019 fascination with one of the iconic figures from the second half of the 20th century, and the gallery of celebrities with whom her life was enmeshed during the 1950s and early 60s. But bringing that rich tapestry to life on the operatic stage is not straightforward. In Waiting for Miss Monroe, De Raaff and his librettist Janine Brogt concentrate on the last few months of the star\u2019s life in 1962, including her famous appearance at President Kennedy\u2019s birthday party, the problems surrounding her final film, and her lonely death, when she is confronted by memories of her former self, Norma Jean, and rejected by all the men who formerly worshipped her. De Raaff and Brogt are emphatic that what they devised is not a biopic but a fictionalised work that attempts to explore Monroe\u2019s inner world, as revealed in her conversations with a young woman, Eve, who arrives to take photographs of her, which are intercut with the film studio confrontations and the Kennedy party. It all works convincingly enough up to a point. The text is sung in English and some of Raaff\u2019s vocal writing, wide-ranging but fundamentally tonal, curiously echoes passages in the later work of Michael Tippett, The Ice Break especially, though Raaff\u2019s orchestral writing is much more unbuttoned and eclectic. Yet the passages of melodrama, when the characters resort to spoken dialogue, somehow breaks the operatic spell; it\u2019s as if the music is abdicating its expressive responsibilities in a work that otherwise doesn\u2019t flinch from the having the most commonplace exchanges sung. The score is haunted by the ghosts of songs associated with Monroe, especially I Wanna Be Loved By You, though the references are never too explicit. It is an intelligent if not entirely successful attempt on a tempting but, perhaps in the end, a dramatically intractable subject. Recorded from the 2012 stage production, the cast is excellent under conductor Steven Sloane, with Laura Aikin in the central role coping superbly with the huge Lulu-like span of the soprano writing. Dale Duesing as Fox, the studio boss, Maria Kowan as Eve, Tom Randle as Marilyn\u2019s former husband Joe DiMaggio, and John Tessier and Daniel Belcher as the Kennedy brothers are all high quality too.

Airports and airlines are also expecting their traffic to peak, with rail links set to be disrupted later in the holidays.  The AA forecasts the biggest surge in traffic on Friday, with 14 million drivers planning trips of more than 20 miles. According to traffic analysts Inrix, journeys on some motorways will take three times longer than normal at peak times. Shopping traffic is set to peak on Saturday 19 December, which has been branded panic Saturday by retailers. Delays will peak at around 4pm on Friday, as Christmas traffic exacerbates the usual evening traffic. The worst-affected roads will be major motorways, including the M25, M5 and M4, with a 32-mile section of the M25 in both directions from junctions 7 to 16 forecast to see delays of up to 2 hours 20 minutes.

Parcel deliveries from online shopping are up a further 12% this year, according to FedEx.  Meanwhile, rail engineering works will mainly affect the south-east, apart from limited disruption between Stafford and Crewe and around Doncaster on 27-28 December. Network Rail, under some pressure to avoid the chaotic scenes that ensued from overrunning work last Christmas, is planning a similar overall level of work.   Related: Heathrow and Gatwick airport train links to be severed over Christmas    Most major London stations, bar Charing Cross and Paddington, will remain open throughout, lessening the impact on the busiest hubs. However, about half of all services out of Victoria, London Bridge and Liverpool Street will be affected by work on Thameslink and on the major lines through Anglia and to Brighton. Those engineering works will severely affect servcies to Britain\u2019s busiest airports, with the Heathrow Express and Gatwick Express services suspended for periods over the Christmas period. The fast Heathrow train will not run while Paddington is closed from 25-28 December, and the Gatwick Express will stop late on Christmas Eve and resume on 4 January. The line closure will mean trains take 90 minutes from central London to the capital\u2019s second biggest airport. Coach operator National Express is adding more than 20,000 extra seats to its airport routes to compensate.  Ahead of that disruption, easyJet, the biggest airline at Gatwick, said Friday will be its busiest Christmas getaway day ever, with more than 204,000 passengers flying across its European network and a record 115,000 passengers flying to or from its UK airports.

The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has rightly changed the archaic, Orientalist, exoticising, offensive or unthinkingly racist titles of more than 100 artworks including the use of the word \u201cnegro\u201d for Afro-Caribbean subjects and \u201cMohammedan\u201d for Middle Eastern subjects. In the US, a Harvard University emblem featuring the insignia of a slave-owning family is the subject of a student protest. Meanwhile, in the UK, Oriel college, Oxford, is under pressure to remove a statue paying tribute to coloniser Cecil Rhodes, following a student-led protest inspired by similar demonstrations in Cape Town, South Africa. Even though they haven\u2019t yet decided what action to take, Oriel has been admirably direct in naming the problem and saying it \u201cdoes not condone [Rhodes\u2019] racist views or actions\u201d. In that case, why keep a statue aggrandising and lionising the man who held those views? To keep the statue is indeed to condone those actions; the prestigious Rhodes scholarship in his name can easily be renamed and, indeed, I wonder why it\u2019s taking so long. More ambiguously, a Quaker school in suburban Philadelphia has taken Mark Twain\u2019s Huckleberry Finn \u2013 about a young white boy fleeing his abusive father with Jim, an escaped black American slave \u2013 off the syllabus because of its heavy dosage of the N-word, which made students feel uncomfortable. I\u2019m wondering if the students were mainly white and their discomfiture was from having to confront the history (and present) of white racism as embodied in that word, or if it goes deeper than that and the racist stereotyping of Jim as emotionally naive, sentimental and simple was what stuck in their throat, as it does in mine. At times like this, cultural critics who happen to be of colour are approached for our take, as though because of the high melanin levels in our skin we are imbued with some kind of race wisdom that automatically knows the solution to every nuance of white people\u2019s racism or to the long and complex warping effects of history on culture, language and representation. It involves coming face to face with the outright racism, rank arrogance and exploitation of Britain\u2019s colonialism, and the profits that flowed from it and bled into this country\u2019s \u201cgreat\u201d houses, elite universities and\u00a0institutions.     Name changes at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam include the description of a \u2018Negro servant\u2019 in Johannes Mijtens\u2019s portrait of Margaretha van Raaphorst to \u2018young black servant\u2019. Photograph: Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam    Of course, there\u2019s a difference between a reflexive text that quotes racist epithets to demonstrate racism, and one in which those epithets are used liberally, casually and without any self-reflexiveness and awareness, because its creator was a racist, the society they were born into and creating for was racist and nobody minded. I think Mark Twain\u2019s unthinking racial stereotyping, whether or not he meant well, should be acknowledged and discussed in schools, not banned from the table\u00a0outright. What I also know is that racist epithets have the power to wound because racism is alive and well, armed and dangerous and perpetrated by many, from police officers to people on the street to \u201cnice guys\u201d in power in the seemingly progressive worlds of the arts and media, education, politics, economics and law. When readers and gallery visitors, students and citizens notice something \u2013 the wording in a book or title that we don\u2019t want to utter because it is a long-standing and still used insult against us and it feeds into hateful or ignorant stereotypes about us \u2013 institutions should take note, instead of dismissing and ridiculing us. Nicholas Serota, of the Tate, has said that he won\u2019t bother following the Rijksmuseum in addressing racist artwork titles. Well, in an art world elite comprised of gallery directors, critics, curators and star artists that is shocking for its domination by white men, I guess that\u2019s his privilege. Though he has also said they \u201cmay put an explanatory note beside the work saying it had been named in a different period\u201d. Talking about language, titles, plaques and statues to confront the ignorance and prejudices of the past is only the tip of a very toxic iceberg. We have less social mobility than ever before and every single elite profession, from the arts and culture to the media, finance, law and medicine, is dominated by white men. There is a heavy and painful sexual and racial glass ceiling and the white men\u2019s club mentality is stronger than it ever was \u2013 as always in times of economic instability, when cronies with established power close ranks. Lenny Henry has spent much of the past two years campaigning bravely, and at risk to his own career, about the lack of racial and sexual diversity in the UK arts, media and culture, pointing up the wealth of creative talent leaving the UK, from actor Archie Panjabi, playwright Kwame Kwei-Armah and Marianne Jean-Baptiste to Idris Elba and David Oyelowo. Most recently, there was, rightly, uproar at World Book Night coming up with a long list of contemporary books to give away, 100% of them by white authors.     Simon Maris\u2019s painting Young Negro Girl, which the Rijksmuseum has retitled Young Girl Holding a Fan. Photograph: Alamy    It\u2019s time for the arts world to look hard at its own misogyny and racism, starting with language and then going much deeper. More importantly, it\u2019s time for them to start hearing and believing survivors instead of dismissing them. All we\u2019re asking is not to be called niggers or negroes or be misrepresented or have our enslavement recast as gentle servitude or to have our educational institutions decorated with plaques worshipping white racists. We\u2019re angry about a few very entrenched things, like racism, as expressed in language, behaviour and representation. When activists \u201cmake a fuss\u201d about these issues, whether through thinkpieces or riots or political demonstrations, those in power should listen. The fact that there is resistance even to minor demands for evolution shows how entrenched racism is and how comfortable those in power are with it. It is not for white people to decide what is or is not racist and it is not for them to decide what we people of colour are called. I think statues, plaques and awards paying tribute to racist men should be removed, and in their place should be a little notice naming and shaming them, and naming their prejudice. I think original racist titles can be altered and an introductory essay, as so many \u201cclassic\u201d works have, putting that original title and content in context, can be included. None of this is difficult to do or hard to swallow. If the kickback against racism causes a headache for perpetrators, enables, colluders, cronies and those too complacent and privileged to want to deal with it or think about what it\u2019s like to put up with racism, stereotyping and assumptions all day every day, well, tough.", "sentences": ["The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam has rightly changed the archaic, Orientalist, exoticising, offensive or unthinkingly racist titles of more than 100 artworks including the use of the word \u201cnegro\u201d for Afro-Caribbean subjects and \u201cMohammedan\u201d for Middle Eastern subjects.", "Name changes at the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam include the description of a \u2018Negro servant\u2019 in Johannes Mijtens\u2019s portrait of Margaretha van Raaphorst to \u2018young black servant\u2019.", "Photograph: Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam    Of course, there\u2019s a difference between a reflexive text that quotes racist epithets to demonstrate racism, and one in which those epithets are used liberally, casually and without any self-reflexiveness and awareness, because its creator was a racist, the society they were born into and creating for was racist and nobody minded."], "title": "It\u2019s time for the arts world to look hard at its own racism", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/dec/19/time-for-art-world-look-own-racism", "tags": ["Art", "Race issues", "Art and design", "World news"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-12-20T00:05:36Z", "article": "Will Hutton\u2019s otherwise excellent article was let down by the confusing argument on Heathrow. Clearly, London and the south-east are home to 469 global companies not because of Heathrow, since Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt also have well-connected airports. Companies base themselves in the UK because of other matters: English, access to the EU, a benign tax policy etc (\u201cVital Heathrow expansion must not be held up by craven politics\u201d, Comment). Heathrow may be a \u201chub airport\u201d, but that is not its main business, since two-thirds of its 75m passengers per annum start or end their flight in London. Only a third of them transfer flights and do not leave the airport. Otherwise there would be little argument about the impact of extra road access traffic that a third runway would bring. More importantly, by all the usual measures of environmental impact, if Heathrow was a factory it would have been closed years ago. Its noise footprint is large, hence the opposition from local MPs, and the air pollution generated by land side links kills and makes ill a significant number of residents. After the Paris climate change agreement we need to reduce CO2 emissions. Unless aero engines improve efficiency by a quantum, this must mean less flying in the future, which is already being shaped by internet access and other ways to communicate that do not need personal travel.Professor LJS LesleyLiverpool Will\u00a0Hutton\u2019s review of the disgraceful delays in the building of a third runway for London\u00a0excludes one\u00a0critical point: billions of pounds have already been invested at Heathrow and to exploit that investment fully we need a third runway. The decision\u00a0to commit to\u00a0Heathrow was made in the 1970s when a plan to move the operation to Maplin Sands in the Thames Estuary was abandoned on \u201cenvironmental grounds\u201d. To walk away from Heathrow at this late stage would be an act of political vandalism. This decision will define David Cameron\u2019s\u00a0premiership; if he flunks it he will for ever be known\u00a0for his weakness.\u00a0 Richard LevetonFerrysideCarmarthenshire Will Hutton\u2019s acceptance of the Heathrow lobby\u2019s mendacious and self-interested propaganda is absurd. Air travel is split more or less evenly between hubs and point-to-point services; hubs are not the sine qua non. \u201cConnectivity\u201d is no longer dependent on executives hopping from plane to plane \u2013 a lot of it is carried out by electronic means. The Davies Commission did not deal adequately with the health, pollution or climate change issues. Heathrow is not crucial to freight operations. Its principal trade is tourism and trips to see friends and family. The aviation companies want the government to pay for\u00a0improvement to surface transport (rail and road) \u2013 that means our money. Aircraft noise is associated with hypertension. We should put up with all that while aiming at a maximum 1.5C rise? A serious government would invest in less toxic travel modes. It would also reduce the several forms of subsidy commercial aviation enjoys, which would help with the first steps towards the management of demand.Christopher WilliamsLondon W5 Will Hutton\u2019s justification for Heathrow\u2019s expansion couldn\u2019t be clearer. We urgently need a national airport hub for economic growth. Boris Johnson\u2019s estuary airport would be on the wrong side of London, requiring extra transport infrastructure. Further delay in upgrading Heathrow because of objections from the wealthy west London suburbs is holding the national economy back. As for multimillionaire Zac Goldsmith, his threat to cause a by-election by resigning over the issue smacks of blackmail. As a candidate for mayor, Londoners might consider just whose side is he on.Bill NewhamManchester", "sentences": ["Clearly, London and the south-east are home to 469 global companies not because of Heathrow, since Paris, Amsterdam and Frankfurt also have well-connected airports."], "title": "The Big Issue: If Heathrow were a factory it would have closed years ago | the big issue", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2015/dec/20/big-issue-heathrow-third-runway", "tags": ["Transport policy", "Transport", "Politics", "Heathrow", "Travel", "Heathrow airport", "Business", "Environment", "UK news", "Business travel", "Heathrow third runway", "Air transport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-12-20T00:05:37Z", "article": "Sometimes dealing with the past is easy. A few months ago, the college where I am principal (Hertford, Oxford) handed back a precious 16th-century atlas to its rightful owners \u2013 the Humboldt University library in Berlin. A British soldier had been offered it in exchange for a packet of cigarettes in the devastated streets of Berlin in May 1945. His father was an Oxford professor and for most of the last 70 years the Ortelius atlas had been first buried in his room and then locked in the college safe. The 70th anniversary of the end of the war seemed as good a moment as any to return it. But what struck everyone at the small ceremony was how affected the German delegation, including representatives from the embassy and Humboldt University, were by what we were doing. It was a symbol of Germany\u2019s relationship with Britain within a peaceful EU, an act of friendship all the more valuable because it had been freely offered and a recognition that history had moved on. But more often than not history\u2019s legacies are more unforgiving \u2013 a minefield in which yesterday\u2019s and today\u2019s realities seem irreconcilable. Last week, Amsterdam\u2019s Rijksmuseum and another Oxford college, Oriel, found themselves in the middle of controversies.. Dutch painters in the 17th and 18th centuries were fascinated by the new human beings in their midst \u2013 \u201cnegroes\u201d and \u201chottentots\u201d as they were called. And such words were used as titles for the paintings. In 2015 the words are inadmissible, and the Rijksmuseum is gradually retitling its works, losing all \u201cracially charged\u201d connotations. Quite right. Yet there is no escaping another truth. The Rijksmuseum is changing the words of the time \u2013 airbrushing, if you like, a period of Dutch life \u2013 and its attitude to newly colonised peoples \u2013 out of Dutch artistic history. If you are an art historian, it might be an outrage. But if you are a non-white Dutch citizen, you will be as delighted as the Germans receiving their Ortelius atlas that past misfortunes and injustices are being addressed. As long as the original titles are not exorcised and entombed, it is a more than justified move. Harder, though, is what Oriel is encountering. Cecil Rhodes was a student there; not only did he create Rhodes scholarships but gave generously to his college \u2013 and the Rhodes building that fronts on to Oxford\u2019s High Street commemorates their donor with a life-sized statue. Now the Rhodes Must Fall campaign, having succeeded in getting a statue of Rhodes removed from Cape Town University, wants the statue removed in Oxford. Why? Rhodes was the quintessential racist, British supremacist and imperialist, they argue; he should not be celebrated in a 21st-century university. Last week, Oriel conceded the argument, generally receiving congratulations amid the expected brickbats, and said it would launch a six-month consultation. Rhodes and his values, it declared, had no part in 21st-century university life. Oriel is right, but has to tread carefully. Rhodes cannot be expunged from the history of Oxford, Britain and South Africa. What\u2019s more, Rhodes cannot be regarded as a lone wolf, an especially abhorrent racist; the importance of race and breeding as explanations of good character were widespread within western culture in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Keynes, one of my intellectual heroes, was an advocate of eugenics as a young man; Woodrow Wilson, a great progressive American president and founder of the League of Nations, believed non-whites did not have the character to govern. Winston Churchill was as misty-eyed about the destiny of the Anglo-Saxon peoples as Rhodes. Our forebears may have understood the virtues of checked and balanced government, freedom of the press, presumptions of innocence and the rule of law \u2013 but they also held unreconstructed views about women and race. At best they are profoundly flawed objects of veneration; at worst, object lessons in how not to think. The only way through the maze is to understand the historical context \u2013 which requires an open mind, freedom of debate and unobstructed access to facts: a trilogy which campaigners tend to neglect. Walking in India a few years ago, I discussed with some fellow walkers from that country why there was not more of a backlash against Britain, given the cruelty and racism of the raj. (I had been reading William Dalrymple\u2019s extraordinary The Last Mughal, an account of the Indian mutiny, and wanted to apologise.) My fellow walkers told me it was not an issue. That was then, with all its extraordinary cruelties and barbarisms on all sides. Now was now. India was set to be a world superpower by the mid-century \u2013 and it was a strength, they argued, founded on the alchemy of Hindu creative energy and British legacy institutions, notably the rule of law, democracy and the freedom of the press. The Indian economist and philosopher Amartya Sen argues along similar lines. Something analogous can be claimed for South Africa. President Zuma has become reviled for his corruption and arbitrary government, summarily sacking his finance minister Nhlanhla Nene 10 days ago for daring to criticise Zuma\u2019s extravagant patronage of insiders alongside favouring his alleged mistress. What stands between South Africa and wholly unaccountable despotism are the legacy institutions of Empire \u2013 courts, rule of law, free press, freedom of association and expression. Thus tens of thousands of South Africans can protest in the streets with \u201cZuma must fall\u201d placards \u2013 borrowed directly from \u201cRhodes must fall\u201d \u2013 because of the liberal constitutional foundations which the appalling imperial supremacist and diamond racketeer helped lay. South Africa, if it can get the alchemy right, could be a 21st-century great power like India. If that happens, racist Rhodes \u2013 as Mandela, if not his followers, would have acknowledged \u2013 will have played his part in the story as much as corrupt Zuma. A new bargain about the past has to be struck. Atonement must be made when it is necessary even while the complexities and truths of history are acknowledged, and then the substance of the criticism addressed. It was striking that before the underdeveloped countries would accept the Paris climate change deal they needed acknowledgement from the west that they were not to blame for the cumulative amount of carbon in the air. Then they could move on. Rhodes\u2019s statue and the titles of Dutch masters are less the issue than ongoing prejudice. Black and minority ethnic communities are too under-represented at our universities and in leadership roles more generally; our curricula and culture need to be reconstructed. Symbols matter \u2013 but the real targets matter more.", "sentences": ["Last week, Amsterdam\u2019s Rijksmuseum and another Oxford college, Oriel, found themselves in the middle of controversies..

Three hours into the journey, a 25-year-old Moroccan man with Isis connections, Ayoub El-Khazzani, began rampaging through the carriages armed with a pistol, a Kalashnikov, 270 rounds of ammunition and half a litre of petrol, eventually shooting and grievously wounding a Franco-American man, Mark Moogalian, who tried to stop him. What El-Khazzani wasn\u2019t bargaining for was the trio of peppy Americans, who, together with 62-year-old Brit Chris Norman, overcame the attacker, Skarlatos using the butt of El-Khazzani\u2019s own gun to beat him into submission. On the telephone from LA, Skarlatos reveals what he remembers about the attack. \u201cHonestly, it\u2019s really strange. The adrenaline messes with your memory. I do remember certain moments very sharply and very clearly. When I first saw the guy with the AK, that part is burned in my mind. Then I tapped Spencer on the shoulder and said, \u2018Let\u2019s go!\u2019 and from that moment to pretty much when I grabbed the handgun was totally blank. I remember the end of the struggle very clearly and then when he was on the ground and tied up. It was 35 minutes between him beginning the attack and when we got to the station.\u201d   Related: France train attack: Americans overpower gunman on Paris express    Since then, life has altered unrecognisably for Skarlatos. He found himself an overnight celebrity, on the cover of newspapers and magazines worldwide, the recipient of the French L\u00e9gion d\u2019honneur and the US Soldier\u2019s Medal, the highest award for actions not taken in combat. Back home in Oregon, he was asked to join Dancing With the Stars, an American reality show similar to Strictly Come Dancing. Skarlatos and his dance partner, Lindsay Arnold, came third in the show\u2019s 21st season, their high point a heartfelt and patriotic waltz to America the Beautiful. So how did Skarlatos move from have-a-go-heroism to dancing off against the likes of Chaka Khan and the Backstreet Boys\u2019 Nick Carter? \u201cWhen they asked me to do it, it wasn\u2019t even a week after the attack and I was just a bit ignorant about the whole thing,\u201d he says. \u201cThere was so much stuff going on... For me it was like, what else was I going to do? But I just had to make sure that Spencer [Stone] and Anthony [Sadler] were OK with it. They did take a bit of convincing \u2013 they had no idea what Dancing With the Stars was; I didn\u2019t really either.\u201d Skarlatos\u2019s companions on the train have been noticeably less eager to embrace their new-found fame. He remains close to his boyhood friend Stone, who was wounded in the attack and then, shockingly, two months after his return to the US, was stabbed four times outside a Sacramento nightclub, seemingly while trying to protect a young woman. Skarlatos\u2019s voice drops at this point, reflecting on his friend\u2019s misfortune and another attack he was unable to prevent. \u201cWhile I was busy celebrating stopping a terrorist attack, there was a shooting at my college that I would have been at that day, and then a week later Spencer gets stabbed and I wasn\u2019t there to help him either,\u201d he says. \u201cI felt guilty not being at my college that day and, who knows, maybe if I hadn\u2019t been doing Dancing With the Stars, I would have been at that bar with him and maybe I would have been able to do something.\u201d I ask Skarlatos if being so centrally involved in a terrorist attack gives him a different perspective on the atrocities in Paris and California; if he believes that the war on terror will ever be won. \u201cAnybody who is a terrorist we should just kill,\u201d he says. \u201cI would rather it not be put up for debate.\u201d Now Skarlatos is about to embark on a stadium tour as part of Dancing With the Stars live. After that, his plans are a little hazy. \u201cI have some things in development right now but nothing certain,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not quite back to square one, but I\u2019m going to go back to Oregon and if I have other opportunities I\u2019ll probably do them, but I\u2019m trying to scale things down a little bit.\u201d", "sentences": ["In mid-August, Alek Skarlatos, a specialist with the Oregon army national guard, was on a Thalys train travelling from Amsterdam to Paris, part of a European vacation he\u2019d planned with his friends Spencer Stone and Anthony Sadler to celebrate the end of his tour of duty in Afghanistan."], "title": "Alek Skarlatos: \u2018I saw this guy with an AK-47, tapped my friend on the shoulder and said: Let\u2019s go\u2019", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/20/alek-skarlatos-us-soldier-foiled-paris-train-attack", "tags": ["World news", "Islamic State", "2015 in review", "Society"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-12-23T11:00:15Z", "article": "1.

Despite the stars seemingly aligned for USA at the Gold Cup in Atlanta, Klinsmann\u2019s tean fell to Jamaica 2-1 in the semis \u2013 the first US loss on its home soil to a Caribbean squad since 1969, and the first time the Yanks failed to reach a Gold Cup final since 2003.     The US fell to Jamaica in a shock loss in the Gold Cup semi-final. Photograph: Jason Getz/USA Today Sports    Klinsmann had a bad day, as the move to a 4-3-2-1 formation \u2013 switching from his usual 4-4-2 diamond \u2013 left his midfield and defense vulnerable to the pace of the Reggae Boyz. Keeper Brad Guzan had a worse one, as his outlet pass off a corner-kick save in the 36th minute was ruled a handball. Jamaica\u2019s Giles Barnes bent the ensuing free kick into the top corner of the net to double the Boyz\u2019 lead \u2013 one they would never relinquish. Things didn\u2019t get much better for the USA during an uninspired third-place game against Panama. The latter ultimately triumphed on penalties, 3-2, in a contest neither side seemed particularly thrilled about. US fans, even less so. 5. U-23s forced to take the long road to Rio In a year where few things came easy \u2013 or predictably \u2013 on the men\u2019s side, why would the path to the 2016 Rio Olympics be any different? The men\u2019s U-23 team went cruising into the qualifying round the top seed in Group A, outscoring the opposition in three group play matches by a score of 13-2. Then Honduras happened. The US appeared feckless and stunned in a 2-0 setback, a contest notable for an alarming drop in form and shocking display of temperament that saw head coach Andreas Herzog receive a red card. They were able to pull it together in time to record a 2-0 victory over Canada in the third-place game, earning a berth in a home-and-away playoff against Colombia next March for spot in Rio. But which team will show up? 6. Carli Lloyd, Carli Loyd and Carli Lloyd Captain Clutch? Sister Streaky? If the USWNT were elevated to rock stars (and they were), Lloyd was their Jimi Hendrix \u2013 brilliant in the biggest moments and electric on the brightest stages. Of course, the midfielder had shone through several personal Woodstocks already: in 2012, she\u2019d netted two goals in the Olympic gold-medal contest against Japan and had converted four game-winners at the Olympics, including clinchers in the finals at the 2008 and 2012 Games. The grander the stakes, the greater the performance.     Lloyd did the business in the final against Japan. Photograph: Nicholas Kamm/AFP/Getty Images    In the final against Japan, the 33-year-old \u2013 World Cup Golden Boot winner and US Soccer\u2019s female player of the year \u2013 not only recorded a hat-trick in 16 minutes, she recorded a hat-trick with an epic flourish. The third goal came on a 54-yard rainbow that lofted over the reach of a flailing, backpedaling Ayumi Kaihori, the definitive snapshot in one of the standout performances during a World Cup final of either gender. And while segment of purists have debated (and continue to debate) the best ways for Ellis to utilize Lloyd\u2019s skill set, the move during the World Cup to more of an attacking midfield role only served to underscore her status as one of the most clinical finishers in the women\u2019s international game. Ever. 7. Bobby Wood late \u2026 One of the standout finds of a mixed year, a silver lining with a golden touch, the 5ft 10in forward netted four goals with the national team in 2015 \u2013 and almost all of them were huge.     Bobby Wood celebrates his game-winner against Germany with Jordan Morris. Photograph: Maja Hitij/EPA    In a June 5 game in Amsterdam against Holland, the FC Union Berlin striker capped a wild comeback with a goal in the 90th minute \u2013 the third for USA over the final 19 minutes of a 4-3 victory. Against Germany five days later in Cologne, Wood came of the bench and scored the game-winner against the reigning World Cup champions in a 2-1 win. The run continued in domestic play: on October 10, down 2-1 in the aforementioned Confederations Cup qualifier against Mexico, Wood entered in extra time and leveled the match in the 108th minute. For all the criticism leveled against Klinsmann this year, there\u2019s little debate that the Hawaii native blossomed into one of his finest revelations. 8. \u2026 and Jordan Morris early In the 49th minute of an April 15 friendly against Mexico, the Seattle native \u2013 his father, Michael, is chief medical director for the Sounders of Major League Soccer \u2013 netted his first international goal against senior competition, leaving pundits wonder if it won\u2019t be the first of many to come. An All-American at Stanford University, the 21-year-old forward and MAC Hermann Trophy finalist is the first active collegian to receive a senior cap since Ante Razov in 1995, and is already being feted in some circles as the new rising \u201cface\u201d of the future on the men\u2019s roster, another badly-needed feather in Klinsmann\u2019s cap. While staying on the national team\u2019s radar, Morris has also become something of a poster boy for advocates of collegiate soccer system in the United States, a system that has come under some scrutiny by advocates of the youth/club model so prevalent abroad. 9. Johnston steps to the fore Initially cut from the qualifying roster and called up because of injuries, the 23-year-old defender became one of the breakout stars of the Women\u2019s World Cup, collecting two assists, creating hell on set pieces, and helping to anchor one of best back lines on the planet.     Julie Johnston takes one off the toe of Mana Iwabuchi in the World Cup final. Photograph: Anne-Marie Sorvin/USA Today Sports    And yet arguably the most pivotal moment of a pivotal summer came on a rare miscue, against Germany in the semifinal. With the score knotted at 0-0 in the 59th minute, Johnston\u2019s pass back to keeper Hope Solo was intercepted by Alexandra Popp; a panicked Johnston reached out and pulled Popp\u2019s shoulder down, drawing a penalty kick. When Celia Sasic missed to the left, it gave Johnston and her teammates equal parts relief and euphoric lift \u2013 a lift that would eventually carry the Yanks to a 2-0 victory. 10. Klinsmann under fire (reprise) The down side of raising the bar, of course, is that it also increases the height of the fall. If 2014\u2019s flashpoints elevated eyeballs and expectations, 2015 was notable for how many times Klinsmann\u2019s mighty leaps ended with him landing awkwardly on one ankle or the other. The Concacaf Cup. The Gold Cup. The U-23s. A $2.5m contract through 2018 probably keeps him out of danger (for now), but it hasn\u2019t kept him above reproach; In a narrative that rather neatly sums up the state of both US national programs as the year draws to a close, it was Wambach who laid perhaps the most damning of criticism at the the feet of the second-term coach, telling Bill Simmons in December that \u201cOh man, I would definitely fire Jurgen. Sorry, Sunil [Gulati]; sorry, US Soccer.\u201d     J\u00fcrgen Klinsmann: under pressure? Photograph: Matthew Ashton/AMA/Getty Images    She didn\u2019t stop there, either, accusing the German-born coach of not focusing enough attention on youth programs and relying on \u201cforeign guys \u2026 it\u2019s just not something that I believe in.\u201d One of stalwarts phased out in favor of those aforementioned \u201cforeign guys,\u201d Landon Donovan, unsurprisingly jumped on the pile, too, in a Sirius XM interview: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t feel as good about it if we had a team full of players that didn\u2019t really grow up or didn\u2019t really identify as being American \u2026 If it\u2019s win at all costs, that\u2019s fine. But in my opinion, it\u2019s not win at all costs, it\u2019s win in a way that makes us feel proud of it.\u201d All of which means, regardless of what side of the Jurgen fence you happen to sit, Klinsmann begins 2016 needing to win more than a few hearts and minds.

Christmas in Cobham is all well and good but the Hiddinks had other plans. There was a trip to India booked, the intention to maintain a recent family trend of spending the festive season outside Europe, only for a call from a former employer in need to scupper the plans of his wife, Liesbeth Pinas. \u201cAt home they were, what\u2019s the expression \u2026 pissed off,\u201d said the Dutchman. \u201cBut they know me. The second reaction was: \u2018Clearly, you still have that desire and passion to do your job.\u2019 They could see it in my eyes, so they\u2019re going without me.\u201d   Related: Pat Nevin apologises to Chelsea\u2019s Cesc F\u00e0bregas for targeting midfielder    That was said in jest but, regardless, the 69-year-old\u2019s focus is fixed. Hiddink\u2019s second spell as Chelsea\u2019s interim manager begins on Boxing Day against the same opponents he faced in his opening game last time round. Watford, then of the second tier, were swept aside in an FA Cup fifth-round tie at Vicarage Road six years ago as the caretaker watched Ray Wilkins pick the team. On Saturday Watford arrive at Stamford Bridge 10 points and eight places better off than the faded champions. Quique S\u00e1nchez Flores\u2019s side will pose real problems and are anything but ideal rivals to take on first up. A proper test awaits. It is a fixture that already has Hiddink\u2019s juices flowing. He has taken up the reins apparently aware of the issues that so undermined Jos\u00e9 Mourinho\u2019s position but anxious not to linger on them. He would prefer to offer everyone a fresh start as he seeks to instigate a revival. Player confidence can be addressed. Those who have been most underachieving may be reassured by a new man at the helm. Any dissenting voices within the ranks, figures who might not be up for the fight and whose commitment to a short-term appointment could waver, are welcome to make themselves known, but sympathy will be in short supply. \u201cThere must be a great desire to play,\u201d Hiddink said. \u201cIf you don\u2019t have that desire, please knock on my door and we\u2019ll talk. We\u2019ll talk briefly. I am making a strong appeal to them, not begging them, but they have a profound obligation to perform. They are here at a big club. They are well paid. They must have this heart full of desire. If they don\u2019t have that desire, then I will say: \u2018Thank you very much, goodbye.\u2019 I don\u2019t need players who don\u2019t have the desire. Theoretically, I shouldn\u2019t be here, halfway into the season. It means things have not gone as well as had been foreseen at the beginning of the season. So I shouldn\u2019t be here, but I am \u2013 and I\u2019m glad to be. \u201cI\u2019ve spoken fully to the squad and we talked a bit about the past. Why I\u2019m here. The reasons why we are down. But, on the other hand, I told them I want everyone to look in the mirror, not just for two seconds but for longer, and see what they can contribute from now on to raise us up. We cannot ignore what has happened but I told them to look in the mirror and be hypercritical. In the two sessions I\u2019ve overseen so far, I cannot complain about the attitude or ambition. They have to show what they are capable of and wash away the last half year.\u201d The sense of deja vu is obvious. Retreat to February 2009 and Hiddink had sat in the same chair, flanked by the same head of communications, and outlined pretty much the same objectives. Mathematically, it is still possible to claw back the 11 points to the top four and secure Champions League qualification. The FA Cup, the last of his 14 trophies as a manager, offers the visit of Scunthorpe United to Stamford Bridge next month. There is a Champions League knockout tie against Paris Saint-Germain to come in February and, as Hiddink pointed out, \u201cwe didn\u2019t even lose to Barcelona in the semi-finals back in 2009\u201d.   Related: Louis van Gaal walks out of briefing and insists Manchester United job is safe    Indeed, while that tie was surrendered controversially to Andr\u00e9s Iniesta\u2019s away goal, the interim manager lost only one of 22 games in charge. His side dropped only five Premier League points in 13 matches. \u201cBut that was a different group of players,\u201d he said. \u201cThat was the team of Drogba, Lampard, Ballack and Essien, big players at that time. Leaders. Now we also have big players, but it\u2019s difficult to compare. And this league is different. It is very strong, as is proven by clubs who are not usually at the top \u2013 Leicester, Crystal Palace, Watford \u2013 being there, amazingly and refreshingly. That means all the teams can kill each other. It is much more competitive now.\u201d That poses a new challenge, even if there is confidence he can eke out form from the players akin to that which earned last season\u2019s title. Roman Abramovich, he said, had been \u201churting\u201d when he took the decision to sack Mourinho but Chelsea\u2019s predicament on the brink of the relegation zone had been \u201cfrightening\u201d. The priority is to remind the squad of their collective capabilities, the targets all short term as they had been six years ago. Back then, the players had conducted a lavish whip-round before the FA Cup final to buy Hiddink a limited edition Rolex watch worth \u00a3200,000 as a send-off. \u201cI don\u2019t wear a watch but it still has a very prominent place in my house in Amsterdam,\u201d he said. \u201cNow I\u2019d like to earn myself another one for my right wrist.\u201d", "sentences": ["\u201cI don\u2019t wear a watch but it still has a very prominent place in my house in Amsterdam,\u201d he said."], "title": "Guus Hiddink offers Chelsea players clean slate in return for desire", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2015/dec/23/guus-hiddink-chelsea-players", "tags": ["Guus Hiddink", "Chelsea", "Football", "Sport"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-12-24T09:00:15Z", "article": "After a 2014 that saw\u00a0books for kids \u2013 led by\u00a0John Green and David Walliams novels \u2013 ruling the annual sales chart, 2015 was\u00a0the year of the women. Female authors, including Harper Lee and Judith Kerr, took seven of the top 10 places, leaving room only for Guinness World Records and two of the three kings of Christmas, Walliams and Jeff Kinney, with the third, Jamie Oliver, just outside at number 11. The last time this happened was in 2012, and then the distaff dominance was exaggerated by the fact that two of that year\u2019s elite, EL James and Suzanne Collins, had produced trilogies and all three of their Fifty Shades and Hunger Games titles were highly placed. Here, in contrast, the works by women at the\u00a0chart\u2019s summit are one-offs and remarkably varied \u2013 BDSM porn, a\u00a0colouring book, the resuscitation of\u00a0a\u00a0cat who passed away in\u00a02002\u2019s Goodbye, Mog, the return of an Alabama\u00a0attorney and\u00a0his\u00a0daughter who\u00a0last\u00a0appeared 55\u00a0years ago, and the tales of a perma-sozzled unemployed commuter (The Girl on the Train),\u00a0a\u00a0narrator with dementia (Elizabeth Is\u00a0Missing) and a fed-up wife in 17th-century Amsterdam (The Miniaturist). Just as diverse are the authors who produced them, ranging as they do from Kerr and Lee, aged 92 and 89, respectively, to the award-winning debutants Emma Healey and Jessie Burton and Paula Hawkins, writing her first thriller after previously producing romcoms; and from EL James, who was placed 12th (with estimated annual earnings of $12m) in Forbes\u2019s latest rankings of the world\u2019s top-earning authors, even though these figures relate to a pre-Grey year in which she published nothing, to Millie Marotta, queen of colouring-in, who describes herself as a \u201cfreelance illustrator [with a] studio by the sea in a little corner of\u00a0West Wales\u201d, and a year ago was almost unknown. Although male authors staged something of a comeback in the bottom half of the chart, overall, 45 women figured this year (compared with 47 men), a\u00a0significant advance on the 31\u00a0in 2014. Their progress reflects the rise of genres whose leading exponents tend to be female: the psychological thrillers exemplified by The Girl on the Train and\u00a0its model, Gone\u00a0Girl (17); the adult (or\u00a0all-age) colouring book\u00a0phenomenon represented by Marotta and Johanna Basford (15, 16); and the healthy eating trend behind Ella Woodward\u2019s emergence as\u00a0the second most popular cookery writer with Deliciously Ella (18). Conversely, categories of books that can be seen as male were in retreat, notably the Minecraft titles that took up four top 10 slots in 2014 (Minecraft Blockopedia, at number 96, is the only reminder of the videogame manuals\u2019 short-lived glory) and were replaced by\u00a0colouring-in as the fad that saved booksellers\u2019 bacon. Oliver apart, cookery titles by men have vanished from the top 100, as the cult of the swaggering, bantering celebrity chef gives way to Ella-style gushing and sensible diets, and suggestions from TV home cooks, Mary Berry (24) and Nigella Lawson (84), whose subtitle, Feel Good Food, was cannily on-trend.     Feeling good \u2026 Nigella Lawson. Photograph: Jay Brooks/BBC    Also close to extinction is the actor, musician or comedian\u2019s memoir, a genre where men traditionally predominate as they do in showbiz, with heavily promoted autumn offerings from the likes of Brian Blessed, Steve Coogan and Tom Jones nowhere to be found; although this clear-out means that the few, mostly sport-related conventional autobiographies that remain are liable to be more blokeish \u2013 Chris Kyle\u2019s American Sniper (23), Guy Martin\u2019s When\u00a0You Dead, You Dead (35) and Steven Gerrard\u2019s My Story (50). Only Penguin\u2019s droll adult Ladybird books (65, 87), written by Jason\u00a0Hazeley and Joel Morris, were something new\u00a0and successful in 2015 driven by male authors. Pulling together the marked lack of TV spin-off titles (where has the annual Great British Bake Off book gone?) and the feeble performance of\u00a0memoirs by\u00a0telly stars such as Coogan and Sue Perkins \u2013 and noting that only Mog\u2019s Christmas Calamity in the top 10 owes its stonking numbers to big or small-screen exposure \u2013 you might wonder if cinema and television have suddenly lost much of their sales-boosting magic. Only if the same unusual pattern is repeated next year will that begin to look plausible; what can be said is that online celebrity can now match the old-fashioned variety in getting books sold, particularly to younger buyers. Woodward owes her top 20 position to\u00a0YouTube, not a BBC2 or Channel 4 series, Zoe Sugg (20, 34) and Alfie Deyes (39, 58) showed their high rankings last year were no ephemeral fluke, and newly arrived fellow vloggers Dan\u00a0and Phil (70) beat heavy-hitters such as Jo\u00a0Nesb\u00f8, Nick Hornby and Jodi\u00a0Picoult. If you\u2019re puzzled by the almost complete disconnection between the top 100 and the titles that did well in the last month\u2019s books of the year roundups, the reason for it is that the latter are\u00a0mostly new 2015 publications, while the former (with the phenomenal exceptions of Go Set a Watchman and The Girl on the Train, the latter published in January and still in hardback) tend to be paperbacks of books that first appeared last year. That\u2019s true of Healey and Burton\u2019s novels, which did remarkably well to challenge James and Walliams, assisted respectively by\u00a0Costa and Waterstones awards. Last\u00a0year\u2019s highest-placed lit fic, Life\u00a0After Life by Kate Atkinson and The\u00a0Goldfinch by Donna Tartt, only managed 11th and 14th. Other literary or literary-commercial novels that kept publishers happy \u2013 by David Nicholls (14), Victoria Hislop (25), Ian McEwan (51), Sarah Waters (82), Karen Joy Fowler (85) and Anthony Doerr (99) \u2013 were from last year too, apart from Terry Pratchett\u2019s valedictory The\u00a0Shepherd\u2019s Crown (36) and Anne Tyler\u2019s A Spool of Blue Thread (60), the sole 2015 Man Booker prize contender to make the list. Serious non-fiction, another failing field where men are uppermost, receded further, with no history or (adult) popular science titles or full-blown biographies getting past the chart\u2019s 95,000 copies threshold. Still, it\u00a0was not all gloom: Bill Bryson\u2019s travelogue (26) lived up to booksellers\u2019 expectations, while the Guardian\u2019s Owen Jones\u2019s polemic (32) exceeded them, and Helen Macdonald (43) converted her Samuel Johnson-Costa book of the year double of 2014-15 into sales that nudged her just ahead of Alex Ferguson.

But when my girlfriend, Kirsty, and I went on a weekend break to Amsterdam for our birthdays in the summer of 2014, we thought it would be a missed opportunity if we didn\u2019t sample one or two cannabis cafes. It was such a\u00a0great holiday and as soon as we got home we booked another \u2013 this time to the Tunisian island of Djerba. Two weeks later, we left our home in Hyde, Greater Manchester, for the north African coast. One evening we\u00a0got talking to a\u00a0friendly group of young Tunisian men on mopeds outside a bar. We were having a laugh and I persuaded one guy, Basam, to give me a ride on his scooter. Within seconds, we were surrounded by armed police shouting at us in Arabic. We were bundled into a car and driven to a local police station. After three hours, they let Kirsty go. The officer asked me three questions: \u201cDo you smoke hashish? Do you have any hashish?\u00a0Did you smoke hashish in Tunisia?\u201d My honest answer was \u201cno\u201d to all three. Not since Amsterdam. After three days in the police station, a man and woman came from the British embassy to tell me I\u00a0was being charged with consuming cannabis. They told me police had found a small bit of hashish on Basam, which he said I\u2019d given him. A few days later, I finally got to see\u00a0a judge. But he didn\u2019t speak English, so I was told I\u2019d be taken to prison while they found a translator.\u00a0I was driven to Harboub prison, in the middle of the desert. I\u00a0was terrified, but kept telling myself it was just a\u00a0mix-up and surely I could soon go home. They shaved my head and led me to a 40ft x 40ft cell containing 100 men. Every inmate went quiet and stared at me, the only westerner in the room. There were fans, but daily power cuts made them useless in the 40C heat, and my bunk was three feet from the toilet \u2013 a stinking hole in the floor. I made a couple of friends who spoke broken English, which helped\u00a0pass the time. But by December, five months later, I\u00a0still hadn\u2019t seen a judge. There were no phones to call home, though I\u00a0sent Kirsty a letter every week (she received only three). She fought tirelessly for my release, contacting our local MP, harrying the Foreign Office, and sending hundreds of pounds, though only \u00a330 got to me. Embassy staff visited me just three times; they seemed to know less than I did. They did find me a\u00a0local lawyer, but she never showed up. As my desperation grew, an inmate told me I should go on hunger strike to force their hand. So,\u00a0on 22 December, I did. I\u2019d spent some dark days at Harboub, but none worse than Christmas Day. I was delirious, unable to get out of bed. I remember the inmate in the bunk next to me had been sent a roast chicken by his family. After three days without food, the aroma just made me want to vomit. I thought of home and what my family would be doing. After 19 days on hunger strike, the prison doctor sent a letter to the judge saying he had to see me or I would die. I went to court on 20 January. My \u201ctrial\u201d lasted five minutes, all in Arabic. A prisoner told me the gist: they\u2019d done tests and found cannabis in my urine \u2013 from the trip to Amsterdam. He said I\u2019d been sentenced to a year in prison and fined the equivalent of \u00a3450. Strangely, I was elated because I finally knew where I stood.\u00a0On 20 March, I was released as part of a presidential amnesty. Within an hour of my name being called, I was on a plane home. Being met by Kirsty at Heathrow airport was surreal. All I could think of to say was: \u201cDo you think I\u2019ve got a suntan?\u201d She just laughed and gave me a big hug. I had spent eight months in jail. While I\u2019m relieved to be home, I\u2019m angry at the government for not doing more to help me. And on top of everything, I\u2019d lost my job as a rail worker.   Related: Experience: I skied off a cliff    Sometimes at night, I am back in\u00a0that stinking cell.

It was first proposed by Thomas Paine in his 1797 pamphlet, Agrarian Justice, as a system in which at the \u201cage of majority\u201d everyone would receive an equal capital grant, a \u201cbasic income\u201d handed over by the state to each and all, no questions asked, to do with what they wanted. It might be thought that, in these austere times, no idea could be more politically toxic: literally, a policy of the state handing over something for nothing. But in Utrecht, one of the largest cities in the Netherlands, and 19 other Dutch municipalities, a tentative step towards realising the dream of many a marginal and disappointed political theorist is being made. The politicians, well aware of a possible backlash, are rather shy of admitting it. \u201cWe had to delete mention of basic income from all the documents to get the policy signed off by the council,\u201d confided Lisa Westerveld, a Green councillor for the city of Nijmegen, near the Dutch-German border. \u201cWe don\u2019t call it a basic income in Utrecht because people have an idea about it \u2013 that it is just free money and people will sit at home and watch TV,\u201d said Heleen de Boer, a Green councillor in that city, which is half an hour south of Amsterdam. Nevertheless, the municipalities are, in the words of de Boer, taking a \u201csmall step\u201d towards a basic income for all by allowing small groups of benefit claimants to be paid \u00a3660 a month \u2013 and keep any earnings they make from work on top of that. Their monthly pay will not be means-tested. They will instead have the security of that cash every month, and the option to decide whether they want to add to that by finding work. The outcomes will be analysed by eminent economist Loek Groot, a professor at the University of Utrecht. A start date for the scheme has yet to be settled \u2013 and only benefit claimants involved in the pilots will receive the cash \u2013 but there is no doubting the radical intent. The motivation behind the experiment in Utrecht, according to Nienke Horst, a senior policy adviser to the municipality\u2019s Liberal Democrat leadership, is for claimants to avoid the \u201cpoverty trap\u201d \u2013 the fact that if they earn, they will lose benefits, and potentially be worse off. The idea also hopes to target \u201crevolving door clients\u201d \u2013 those who are forced into jobs by the system but repeatedly walk out of them. If given a basic income, the thinking goes, these people might find the time and space to look for long-term employment that suits them. But the logic of basic income, according to people to the left of Horst, leads only one way \u2013 to the cash sum becoming a universal right. It would be unthinkable for those on benefits to be earning and receiving more than their counterparts off benefits. Horst admitted: \u201cSome municipalities are very into the basic income thing.\u201d Indeed leftwing councillors in Utrecht believe this is an opportunity to prove to a sceptical public that people don\u2019t just shirk and watch television if they are given a leg-up. \u201cI think we need to have trust in people,\u201d said de Boer. Caroline Lucas, the Green party\u2019s only MP in the House of Commons, agrees. A basic income \u2013 the Greens call it a \u201ccitizen\u2019s wage\u201d \u2013 has long been party policy. It did not make the cut for their manifesto because they couldn\u2019t find a way to fund it. But developments in the Netherlands, and a parallel pilot in Finland, have bolstered Lucas\u2019s belief that this idea\u2019s time has come. The Royal Society of Arts has been examining the feasibility of the idea, as has campaign group Compass. To those who say it is an unaffordable pipedream, Westerveld points out the huge costs that come with the increasinglytough benefits regimes being set up by western states, including policies that make people do community service to justify their handouts. \u201cIn Nijmegen we get \u00a388m to give to people on welfare,\u201d Westerveld said, \u201cbut it costs \u00a315m a year for the civil servants running the bureaucracy of the current system. We will save money with a \u2018basic income\u2019.\u201d Horst adds: \u201cIf you receive benefits from the government [in Holland] now you have to do something in return. But most municipalities don\u2019t have the people to manage that. We have 10,000 unemployed people in Utrecht, but if they all have to do something in return for welfare we just don\u2019t have the people to see to that. It costs too much.\u201d Lucas says she will seek a parliamentary debate on the policy in the new year, and will ask the government to look into the feasibility of a \u201cbasic income\u201d pilot here. \u201cI think in Britain people have quite a puritanical idea of work,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this is an urgently needed policy. With increased job insecurity, the idea of everyone working nine to five is outdated. People go in and out of work these days.\u201d \u201cPeople are increasingly working in what they call the gig economy. The current system is not fit for purpose.\u201d The idea faces a tough political headwind, of course, not least in the Netherlands. Last Tuesday, Johanna von Schaik-Vijfschaft, 41, could be found updating her CV on one of the computers made available to benefits claimants at the Utrecht council building. A cleaner at a local department store, she had been told by council officials to find more work than the 12 hours she currently does. But she will be under even more pressure in a few years when her 19-year-old son turns 21 and leaves her care. Once she has no dependants, she will lose \u00a3150 of her \u00a3500 monthly benefit payment and come under the remit of the participation laws, legislation recently brought in by the rightwing central government to make benefits claimants work harder for their cash. Von Schaik-Vijfschaft could be ordered to do some community work for the council in return for her benefits, and will face the threat of losing more of her income if her application rate for jobs falls away. And if Von Schaik-Vijfschaft were to dress inappropriately for interviews or, worse still, miss an appointment, she will lose all her benefits for a month. The country\u2019s second city, Rotterdam, has even trialled a \u201cwork first\u201d system, where aspiring benefits claimants must put on an orange jacket and spend two months clearing rubbish before they are handed any payments. \u201cRules, always the rules,\u201d von Schaik-Vijfschaft said. \u201cBut of course I want to work. I want to be busy \u2013 we all do.\u201d If the experiment can prove that, maybe Tom Paine\u2019s idea will have its day yet. HOW IT WORKS \u25a0 A \u201cbasic income\u201d, first proposed by Thomas Paine is an income unconditionally granted to all on an individual basis, without any means test or requirement to work. \u25a0 It is paid irrespective of any income from other sources. \u25a0 It is paid without requiring the performance of any work or the willingness to accept a job. \u25a0 Advocates say it will allow people to genuinely choose what sort of employment they take, and to retrain when they wish. \u25a0 Its proponents also claim that a basic income scheme is one of the most simple benefits models, and will reduce all the bureaucracy surrounding the welfare state, making it less complex and much cheaper to administer.", "sentences": ["\u201cWe don\u2019t call it a basic income in Utrecht because people have an idea about it \u2013 that it is just free money and people will sit at home and watch TV,\u201d said Heleen de Boer, a Green councillor in that city, which is half an hour south of Amsterdam."], "title": "Dutch city plans to pay citizens a \u2018basic income\u2019, and Greens say it could work in the UK", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/dec/26/dutch-city-utrecht-basic-income-uk-greens", "tags": ["Netherlands", "Europe", "World news", "UK news", "Cities"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-12-27T10:38:10Z", "article": "Europe\u2019s refugee crisis is threatening to compound a hidden problem of statelessness, with experts warning that growing numbers of children are part of an emerging \u201cstateless generation\u201d. Gender-biased nationality laws in Syria combined with ineffective legal safeguards in the EU states mean that many children born to Syrian refugees in Europe are at high risk of becoming stateless \u2013 a wretched condition of marginalisation that affects 10 million people worldwide. Under Syrian law, only men can pass citizenship on to their children. The UN estimates that 25% of Syrian refugee households are fatherless.   Related: Six reasons why Syrians are fleeing to Europe in increasing numbers    \u201cA lot of those who are resettled to Europe are women whose husband or partner was killed or lost and are being resettled with their kids or are pregnant at the time, so that is becoming a bigger problem,\u201d said Zahra Albarazi of the Institute on Statelessness and Inclusion, based in the Netherlands. Sanaa* is a 35-year-old single mother who gave birth to her daughter, Siba*, in Berlin last year. \u201cI went to the Syrian embassy and explained my situation but they said they cannot give Siba a passport because the father should be Syrian, and the father and mother married,\u201d Sanaa said.     Sanaa and Siba in Berlin. Photograph: Louise Osborne    Germany, in common with the rest of Europe, does not automatically grant citizenship to children born there. This means Siba does not have citizenship of any country. Under international treaties including the UN convention on the rights of the child, governments are obliged to grant nationality to any child born on their soil who would otherwise be stateless. But few EU countries have adopted this principle into domestic law and those that have consistently fail to implement it. The UNHCR refugee agency estimates that at least 680,000 people in Europe are without citizenship of any country, although experts say the true figure is likely to be far higher because stateless people are hard to count. The statelessness problem is particularly bad in south-east Asia: in Myanmar alone the UN estimates there are more than 810,000 stateless people. But the situation in Europe is about to get much worse as a result of the unprecedented migration.  Up until now, groups such as the Roma and Russian-speaking people from the Baltics have been most affected, although the UN blames statelessness on a \u201cbewildering array of causes\u201d, with people from a wide range of backgrounds finding they are not legally entitled to citizenship of any country. No research has been done into the scale of statelessness among the children of Syrian refugees in Europe, but it is thought that many are likely to be in the same position as Siba.   Related: Stateless in Europe: 'We are no people with no nation'    Statelessness in Europe can pose huge problems. Experts say many parents are unaware that their children are stateless. Often the children realise they do not have legal citizenship only when they reach adulthood and find they cannot legally work, marry, own property, vote or even graduate from school.  A UNHCR report released this month says statelessness can prevent children from \u201cleading productive and fulfilling lives\u201d and takes a \u201cdevastating psychological toll\u201d on them and their families. The report quotes one Syrian refugee father saying: \u201cIf they don\u2019t have a birth certificate, it\u2019s like they don\u2019t exist.\u201d In the countries bordering Syria that are taking in the majority of refugees, statelessness is already a major concern.    If they don't have a birth certificate, it's like they don't exist  Syrian refugee father     The UN says more than 30,000 babies born to Syrian refugees in Lebanon are at risk of statelessness. And research by Refugees International (RI) this year found that many of the 60,000 children born to Syrian refugees in Turkey since 2011 could be in the same position.  In these countries, the risk of statelessness is partly due to refugees being unable to properly register births. But children conceived through rape, as well as those born to underage Syrian girls illegally married to men in the host countries, may be at particular risk. \u201cThe scale of sexual violence both inside Syria and [against] refugees is difficult to quantify, but appears quite high,\u201d said Daryl Grisgraber, from RI. \u201cSo I think these numbers are probably higher than we are even guessing at right now. In addition, there are fathers who are dead, in detention in Syria, or who have simply disappeared, and so can\u2019t be verified for the purpose of birth registration in a host country.\u201d Statelessness is also a serious concern for couples who don\u2019t have the documents they need to prove their own legal status. Rama and Rashed fled Syria separately and met in Turkey. Their son, Sayed, was born in Antakya, just a few miles from the Syrian border. Because they wed in an informal ceremony in Turkey, they do not have the legal documents to prove they are married, and Rashed is not named on his son\u2019s birth certificate. \u201cWho is he? What\u2019s his nationality?\u201d he asked hopelessly, cradling his young son in his lap. Without legal status, they fear the child will not be able to attend school. In Berlin, the authorities treated Sanaa with scepticism when she was unable to name Siba\u2019s father, questioning the new mother about her sexual history. Rather than acknowledging her statelessness, they have given Siba travel documents that identify her as a Syrian refugee. But according to Syrian law, she has no right to Syrian nationality.     Refugees heading for Germany queue in an Austrian field. Photograph: Armin Weigel/EPA    \u201cRight now the issue of statelessness is clouded by the fact that these people are in the asylum system,\u201d said Karel Hendriks of the Amsterdam-based refugee support organisation ASKV. \u201cThe problem will emerge in a few years, when hopefully the war eases off but also governments start to decide that people are able to return. Then we will have cases of people whose residence permits will not be extended but, because they are stateless, cannot be sent back.\u201d According to the UN, a stateless child is born every 10 minutes somewhere in the world. The report adds that this is particularly startling \u201cgiven how robust the international human rights framework is when it comes to protecting children\u2019s rights, including the right of every child to nationality\u201d. Inge Sturkenboom, a protection officer specialising in statelessness at the UNHCR, said it was more important than ever that EU governments met their obligations under international treaties to protect children from statelessness. \u201cWhat we need to see is the implementation of those conventions through nationality legislation, but then also having that legislation applied to the cases of children that should be able to benefit from them.\u201d In Jordan and Turkey the authorities are making moves to improve the registration of refugee births. But even when every effort is made to do so, if children fall short of Syrian citizenship requirements, they will be left in limbo unless governments accept their responsibility to identify children born stateless and grant them nationality. Abdoulla and Marah live in the same apartment block as Rama and Rashed. Like their neighbours, they married informally in Turkey. Marah is heavily pregnant and one day recently the four parents debated the best course of action to give their children legal status.

Photograph: Muhammed Muheisen/AP    Marah was so concerned about her child\u2019s statelessness she was considering returning to Syria to give birth and register the baby there. But the others argued she would end up stuck in the war-torn country because, under Syrian law, a woman cannot bring her child out of the country without the father\u2019s permission. Abdoulla could not go with her because he would face arrest for defecting from the Syrian army. \u201cI would have preferred not to have a baby,\u201d said Marah, welling up with tears. That they could not agree on the best course of action points to how complex the situation is. The Syrian conflict has upended legal and social conventions, leaving children in legal limbo and their parents unsure of their rights. Sanaa said being a single mother would have been impossible in Syria because of social stigma. She hopes that she and her daughter will eventually be able to become German citizens, although there is no guarantee that their application will be accepted. \u201cTo study here, to live here, to have the freedom to have her life,\u201d Sanaa said of the benefits for her daughter of growing up in Germany. But she added: \u201cI think in the future, she will wonder why she doesn\u2019t have Syrian nationality.\u201d * Names have been changed This article was made possible by a fellowship from the French-American Foundation \u2013 United States.

TravelSupermarket\u2019s analysis is based on 14.5m searches made on the comparison website for holiday and hotel breaks between September and November.

Winter sun pretty much guaranteed, great value for money due it being tax-free and the chance to party in the way that you want means no one is disappointed.  Who is taking a new year break? The data just on holidays (with flights), rather than hotel-only breaks, shows couples dominating holiday travel, with 68.6% of all holiday queries by two adults intending to share a room.  Families, or groups that feature both grownups and children, were the second largest bloc, with 21.1%. The remaining searches were divvied up among groups of three or more adults (6.2%) and solo travellers (4.1%). Tenerife proved popular among all travellers on holiday breaks, but the appeal of other locations was less broad. Disneyland Paris was the target of 8% of search traffic by people looking to book a family trip, but that dropped to 1% or less among adult-only groupings.      Lads on tour?

Some 61% of all trips in the city are made by bicycle, rising to more than 70% for trips made to educational institutions. But even that\u2019s not enough for the city authorities: they want to push cycling even more.

Before the housing development of Barking Riverside got a local shop, residents had to make an hour-long round trip just to buy a pint of milk. Tim Burrows visited this isolated community in the far east of London, the UK\u2019s largest brownfield regeneration scheme, which is still awaiting a rail station that may never come. There\u2019s no pub, no doctor\u2019s surgery, no cafe. \u201cWe get very tired of being told what we\u2019re going to have and [then seeing] what we end up getting,\u201d said one resident. 12.

The city of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky, in Russia, sits on a distant peninsula surrounded by volcanoes. Iquitos, in the heart of the Amazon jungle, has no roads leading in or out. Even Perth is 1,300 miles away from its nearest metropolis, Adelaide. But where exactly is the world\u2019s most remote city?

Paris goes car-free Around the world, cities are making concerted efforts to limit car use, whether through temporary events or new policies. This September saw Paris implement its first car-free day: children cycled, a group of 1,000 skateboarders took to the streets, outdoor yoga was practised and the sky was bright blue. Angelique Chrisafis took a stroll along the pedestrianised Champs Elys\u00e9es.      Paris held a car-free day on 27 September. Photograph: Aurelien Meunier/Getty Images    10. The great bike helmet debate It\u2019s a debate that at the time attracted the most comments the Guardian Cities site had ever seen: should cyclists wear helmets or not? Renate van der Zee looked at two cities with different approaches: Seattle, where you will be fined $102 (\u00a367) for not wearing a helmet, and Amsterdam, where most resident adult cyclists don\u2019t ever feel the need to wear one. Which city has it right? 9. The strange city of Astana In the middle of Kazakhstan\u2019s seemingly endless flat plains lies Astana, the country\u2019s capital. Adorned with an array of extravagant buildings \u2013 including a glass pyramid, a Disney version of the White House and a finance ministry shaped as a dollar bill \u2013 Astana can be a bizarre pace to visit. Giles Fraser and Marina Kim took us inside the \u201cflashy toy-city\u201d, stuck between a Soviet past and a market-savvy present. 8. Pricey living: the world\u2019s most expensive cities Each day it can feel that life in our cities becomes increasingly expensive. But where is the most expensive city in the world, in terms of food, housing, living expenses or goods? A basic fast-food meal can set you back $18.95 in Luanda, Angola. In Monte Carlo, $1 million will buy you just 17 square metres of property. How does your city fare in the rankings? 7. The bare truth of France\u2019s popular nude town In the French town of Cap d\u2019Agde, people walk around, shop at the supermarket, go to the beach, queue up at the bank. Sound pretty normal? Well, it would be \u2013 but here, residents predominantly undertake these activities in the nude. Phil Hoad visited the resort, to understand what life is like in a naked town \u2013 and wondered if we\u2019ll see a totally nude city any time soon.  6. The subway sign quiz Subway signs can feel ubiquitous in those cities with underground public transport: they become a familiar feature of the cityscape. Familiar enough to identify the city though? Take this quiz to see which cities you can recognise simply from their subway typefaces.  5. The cities that really stress us out Anyone who lives in a city will know that urban life can cause a huge amount of stress: crowds, delays, noise and traffic all have to be contended with. But can one metropolis claim to be the most stressful city of all? From Cairo to Shanghai, Hayley Birch explores the places where daily city life can get a bit overwhelming.

Windy cities Chicago may be known as the \u201cwindy city\u201d, but is it really the windiest metropolis in the world? Sitting on the Cook Strait, New Zealand\u2019s capital Wellington experiences a so-called \u201criver of wind\u201d effect. St John\u2019s in Canada, Punta Arenas in Chile and Spain\u2019s Pamplona all have reputations for their blustery weather. But from resilient residents to non-existent air pollution and the harnessing of green energy, there are some upsides of a windy city too, as Karl Mathieson explained. 3. Homes made of shipping containers From housing for the homeless in Brighton to student housing in Amsterdam, shipping containers seem to be the innovative material of choice for low-cost housing (as well as pop-up shopping malls). But what is it really like to live in one \u2013 and are we actually going to see them become a standard format for new homes? Adam Forrest took us inside life in a steel box.    Related: The top city stories of 2014    2. Can you identify cities by their street patterns? Some cities have distinctive street patterns, like the Haussmannian boulevards of Paris and the grid of Manhattan. But can other cities be identified by their street plans alone? Test your knowledge of city street patterns with our picture quiz.  1. The \u2018naked\u2019 metro map quiz And finally, it\u2019s another quiz which takes the crown. We already tested you with the subway signs and street patterns, now what about the geographically accurate maps of the underground metro systems? See if you can guess the city by looking at the patterns of their \u201cnaked\u201d metro maps \u2013 without any names or references \u2013 and let us know your score!", "sentences": ["Renate van der Zee looked at two cities with different approaches: Seattle, where you will be fined $102 (\u00a367) for not wearing a helmet, and Amsterdam, where most resident adult cyclists don\u2019t ever feel the need to wear one.", "Homes made of shipping containers From housing for the homeless in Brighton to student housing in Amsterdam, shipping containers seem to be the innovative material of choice for low-cost housing (as well as pop-up shopping malls)."], "title": "Cycle gangs, naked towns and metro maps \u2013 the top city stories of 2015", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/dec/30/top-city-stories-2015", "tags": ["Cities", "World news", "2015 in review"]}, {"publicationDate": "2015-12-30T11:52:23Z", "article": "Of course, gamers go into every year filled with excitement and anticipation. This is a medium that thrives on slow burn hype, with even tiny indie projects using months of teaser shots and YouTube trailers to garner interest. The good news is, there\u2019s usually enough brilliant, innovative and compelling fare to justify that enthusiasm \u2013 and 2016 looks to be no exception. Although you could fill a dozen \u2018most anticipated\u2019 lists with all the grandiose sequels and blockbusting franchises due out this year, there are also dozens of smaller-scale independent projects, keeping the idiosyncratic and experimental heart of video game culture beating. Here, then, is our pick of the biggest, smallest and strangest titles to look out for in the coming 12 months. Astroneer (PC)     Compelling and graceful \u2026 Astoneer. Photograph: System Era    Space exploration and construction games are as plentiful as planets these days, but this one from Seattle studio System Era, looks like a truly compelling and graceful combination of Kerbal Space Programme and No Man\u2019s Sky. Explore procedurally generated worlds and terraform them for fun (and profit).  Block\u2019Hood (PC)     An environmentally aware Sim City \u2026 Block\u2019Hood.   Cities: Skylines was last year\u2019s breakout urban construction sim, but in 2016, it could all be about Block\u2019Hood. Described by its creator, architect and game developer Jose Sanchez, as a neighbourhood building game, it\u2019s a more modular, environmentally aware take on the Sim City concept, with players building small, self-contained spaces that balance nature and amenities. It\u2019s beautiful to look at, too. Crackdown 3 (Xbox One)     Totally destructible environments \u2026 Crackdown 3. Photograph: Microsoft    The classic sandbox shooter is set to return under the guidance of Dave Jones, DMA Design founder and father of Grand Theft Auto. The big sell right now is the game\u2019s use of cloud computing to allow for totally destructible city environments. It\u2019s going to be huge with YouTubers. Dishonored 2 (PC, PS4, Xbox One)     Introducing Emily Kaldwin \u2026 Dishonored 2. Photograph: Bethesda    The return of Arkane Studio\u2019s steampunk stealth adventure brings a new lead character, Emily Kaldwin, and a fresh upgrade system. It also promises to take us beyond the grim, plague-ridden city of Dunwall, which should mean intriguing new environments to learn and navigate. (Disclosure: Guardian contributor Cara Ellison is a narrative designer on the game.)  Fabulous Beasts (iOS)     Animal magic \u2026 Fabulous Beasts. Photograph: Sensible Objects    Best described as a cross between a creature simulation, a virtual pet and Jenga, Fabulous Beasts gets you to stack model animals on a RFID-powered plinth to inhabit a virtual world represented on your iPhone or tablet. The more animal blocks you balance the more fabulous the world you create. Developer Sensible Object successfully demoed its innovative game at a series of festivals throughout 2015 and is launching a Kickstarter campaign at the end of January. Fire Emblem Fates (3DS)     Doll houses meets Action Man \u2026 Fire Emblem Fates. Photograph: Nintendo    The Fire Emblem series of romanticised role-playing games allows you to play puppet master with your troops, both corralling them into battle strategies \u2013 and also making them kiss. It\u2019s like doll houses meets Action Man, the ultimate combination of childhood fantasies. The latest instalment is split into two versions, each giving you control of a different army in the same epic war. It promises a wonderfully written story and a gorgeously illustrated world populated with characters that you really, really want to force into marriage. In a ... nice way? Firewatch (Mac, PC, PS4)      firewatch Photograph: Campo Santo    Set in a vast rural area of Wyoming, this first-person mystery adventure puts players in a remote watch tower, looking out for forest fires. But then weird things start happening and your only link to the outside world is a walkie talkie and a disembodied voice that you may or may not be able to trust. Developer Campo Santo was formed by Jake Rodkin and Sean Vanaman, who previously oversaw Telltale\u2019s excellent Walking Dead games, so expect plenty of creepy atmosphere.  Glitchspace (PC)     Stylish coding \u2026 Glitchspace. Photograph: Space Budgie    There have been several attempts to teach the principles of coding through a game, but this is one of the most genuinely interesting. Created by independent team Space Budgie, Glitchspace is a first-person platformer in which you effectively reprogram the world around you to progress through levels. The stylish, minimal visuals provide a sort of cyberspace environment and from the demo we played at GameCity in 2013, it really does make you think like a coder. Home Free (Mac, PC, PS4)      Animal adventure \u2026 Home Free. Photograph: Kevin Cancienne    Previously with experimental New York studio area/code, designer Kevin Cancienne has spent the last two years developing this canine simulation where you play a stray mutt lost and alone in a procedurally generated city. Similarly to cult hit, Tokyo Jungle, you have to use your animal instincts to survive, find food, and perhaps even companionship. After a successful Kickstarter campaign, it\u2019s clear a lot of dog lovers see something moving and compelling in this new slant on the open world adventure. Horizon: Zero Dawn (PS4)     Robots and dinosaurs \u2013 what\u2019s not to like? Horizon: Zero Dawn Photograph: Sony Computer Entertainment    You can kind of imagine the brainstorming session that led to this action role-playing adventure from Amsterdam-based PlayStation veteran Guerrilla Games: \u201cHmm, so robots are cool, dinosaurs are cool, so, wait a minute, how about ...\u201d Hey presto \u2013 a game where you\u2019re a hunter on a post-apocalyptic planet battling robot dinosaurs. It looks beautiful though, mixing open world exploration and survival with varied combat techniques. Killzone meets Skyrim? Yeah sure, why not?  The Last Guardian (PS4)     Fumito Ueda returns for The Last Guardian. Photograph: Sony Computer Entertainment    Most of us gave up on ever seeing Fumito Ueda\u2019s follow up to legendary PlayStation titles Ico and Shadow of the Colossus \u2013 then came that E3 presentation. We\u2019re expecting another atmospheric, ennui-driven adventure, this time following a young boy and his ... giant bird-fox thing, as they seek to escape a crumbling city. Get ready to be heartbroken.  No Man\u2019s Sky (PS4)     A deep-pink future \u2026 No Man\u2019s Sky. Photograph: Hello Games    Procedural content generation is the future we never realised we wanted \u2013 but it\u2019s the one we\u2019re increasingly getting. So throw away your dreams of hoverboards and flying cars and start imagining No Man\u2019s Sky instead: a vast space exploration adventure filled with gorgeous deep-pink and teal candy worlds filled with creatures and spacecraft. At a time when our troubled planet seems ever more chaotic and weather-beaten, it\u2019s little wonder this bright vision of the future has enraptured so many. Persona 5 (PS3, PS4)     Return of a cult favourite \u2013 Persona 5. Photograph: Atlus    Often described as a combination of traditional Japanese role-playing game (JRPG) and Pokemon, the Persona series has been a cult hit since the original spun off from the Megami Tensei series of RPG adventures in 1996. These tales of high school romance, murder, friendship and occult power are idiosyncratic and often daft (there was a dancing game instalment), but they\u2019re richly imaginative and Persona 5 promises to live up to the series that\u2019s spawned musicals, fan fiction and many crushes on creepy dudes dressed like an ovoid teddy bears. Routine (Mac, PC)     Edgy, lo-fi, terrifying \u2026 Routine. Photograph: Lunar Software    What is it about abandoned bases? Last year, Frictional Games terrified us with Soma set on a remote underwater research facility and 2016 should finally see the release of Routine, a chilly horror adventure set on an abandoned moon base. The work of four-person UK studio Lunar Software, Routine uses a \u201cperma-death\u201d mechanic, which means you get no health packs or lives, as you explore the dark confines, trying to work out what has happened. Very much an edgy, low-budget 1980s sci-fi movie reimagined as a first-person adventure. Scalebound (Xbox One)     Dragon fighting with a killer soundtrack \u2026 Scalebound. Photograph: Microsoft    Kamiya, headphones, dragons. Someone could have come on stage at E3 a couple of years ago, said these three words and we\u2019d be sold, just like that. If you need more detail, Hideki Kamiya is the creative genius behind Devil May Cry, Bayonetta and Viewtiful Joe and Scalebound is his latest project, an action roleplaying adventure that looks like Final Fantasy\u2019s modern revamp crossed with How To Train Your Dragon, featuring a hero who fights monsters while listening to music on his headphones. As long as this isn\u2019t some surreptitious tie-in with Apple Music it could be a runaway hit. Tacoma (Linux, Mac, PC, Xbox One)     Tacoma could be 2016\u2019s breakout hit.   The brief: Gone Home in space. The reality: probably still Gone Home in space. But is that such a bad thing? Tacoma is by the same team, Fullbright, with significantly greater backing after their first runaway success. Think Gravity meets Portal meets, uh, Gone Home - and as quiet, exploratory indie stories like this one are the Big Thing in games right now, this could be a breakout success. That Dragon, Cancer (Mac, Ouya, PC)     A touching experience \u2026 That Dragon, Cancer. Photograph: Ryan Green    It may seem odd, looking forward to a video game that deals with the creator\u2019s true story of losing a child to cancer. But what Ryan Green is building with his small team is a touching, quiet experience that takes you through both the joys and the struggles of his son Joel\u2019s life. If games like Depression Quest and Actual Sunlight can help people understand their struggling loved ones, then this can, too. It also looks absolutely beautiful, a fractured polygonal jumble of shapes and colours, soft lighting and shadows hinting at the darkness to come. Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division (PC, PS4, Xbox One)     Tom Clancy\u2019s The Division Photograph: Ubisoft    A deadly pandemic has hit New York so naturally what the city needs is a crack squad of spec-ops warriors to restore order by sort of shooting everyone. OK, that\u2019s the plot out of the way, the interesting part of this latest Tom Clancy franchise-\u2019em-up is that it\u2019s a co-op role-playing strategy shooter set in a persistent online world inhabited by other player teams that you can fight or trade with. The result looks like an urban survivalist take on Destiny, and if the server tech can handle the load, this could be the military shooter evolution we\u2019ve all been waiting for. Uncharted 4: A Thief\u2019s End (PS4)     Epic cinematic storytelling \u2026 Uncharted 4. Photograph: Sony Computer Entertainment    Though the Uncharted series has its detractors, developer Naughty Dog has consistently pushed the envelope in terms of epic cinematic storytelling, and this fourth and final Nathan Drake adventure looks set to continue that legacy. It\u2019s the classic \u201cone last job\u201d story: Drake is married and retired but then his desperate brother emerges with tales of a vast pirate fortune and our hero is pulled back into the fray. Expect huge set-pieces, sassy wisecracks and actual emotions. Unravel (PC, PS4, Xbox One)     Heart-melting \u2026 Martin Sahlin\u2019s Unravel. Photograph: Electronic Arts    It\u2019s hard to tell whether we\u2019re more in love with Yarny, Unravel\u2019s handicraft mascot, or his creator, Martin Sahlin, who came on stage at the E3 conference in LA last year to pour his heart out about his incredibly personal development journey. The cute platforming game has you using your slowly unraveling yarn-body to explore a wilderness based on the Sahlin\u2019s homeland of Sweden. It\u2019s about love, he told us, as his hands shook from nerves. Hearts melted. If this is the future of marketing, we\u2019re all doomed. Way to the Woods (PC)     Way to the Woods Photograph: Anthony Tan    Existing as little more than a demo right now, there is already much interest in this visually poetic game about the adventures of a deer and her fawn in a stylised forest. The work of 16-year-old coder Anthony Tan, the concept and look are inspired by Studio Ghibli classics like Spirited Away and Princess Mononoke, rendered into interactive life using the advanced Unreal 4 engine. A 2016 release may be a little optimistic, but we wanted to flag this intriguing project anyway. We Happy Few (PC)     Back to the retro-future \u2026 We Happy Few. Photograph: Compulsion Games    Described on its website as \u201ca game of paranoia and survival in a drugged-out, dystopian English city in 1964\u201d, We Happy Few is not short on interesting ideas. Like Bioshock Infinite reimagined by George Orwell and Stanley Kubrick, it puts you into an alternative retrofuturistic Britain where you must appear to confirm, while investigating a weird collapsing society. It\u2019s also a \u201csurvival roguelike\u201d, which means there are no respawns or save points: if you die, you have to start again in a newly generated city. The Witness (iOS, PC, PS4)     The Witness Photograph: Sony Computer Entertainment    We\u2019ve waited years for Jonathan Blow\u2019s follow-up to Braid, the Xbox Live platformer that is often credited with kickstarting the modern indie scene. Set on a mysterious island, the object is to solve a series of oblique environmental puzzles, unpicking the secrets of the isle as you go. It\u2019s like the PC classic Myst reimagined as a Jorge Luis Borges story. XCOM 2 (Linux, Mac, PC)     XCOM2 Photograph: 2K Games    Set 20 years after the critically acclaimed turn-based strategy sim was, XCOM 2 takes place on an Earth that has fallen to the alien invasion. Now acting as a resistance movement, the XCOM team has a new set of soldier types and specialisms, with missions taking on a guerrilla warfare feel. Plus, environments are now procedurally generated to add surprise and variety to the tense, tactical fun.  Yooka-Laylee (Linux, Mac, PC, PS4, Wii U, Xbox One)     Yooka-Laylee Photograph: Playtonic    Last year a group of veteran Rare employees set up their own studio, Playtonic, and set about developing a spiritual sequel to Banjo Kazooie, immediately answering the prayers of N64 nostalgics everywhere. The co-op characters at the centre of this appropriately bright and playful platform adventure are a chameleon and a bat rather than a bear and a bird, but the humour, setting and story are unmistakable in their origin.

She has re-invented herself from a singer who played the celeb tabloid headline grabbing game into a spokesperson against austerity and as advocate for doing something about climate change. Her banner at the anti-austerity march in Cardiff just after the election read: \u201cI\u2019m mad as hell and I\u2019m not going to take it anymore\u201d, it's good to see someone high profile fighting back.       7) Yanis Varoufakis     Greece\u2019s maverick finance minister Yanis Varoufakis resigns in style.

And for giving us all a chance to take part in the conversation about how to build a better Europe.      8) Sam Simon     Simpsons creator Matt Groening with executive producers James L Brooks and Sam Simon, 1990.

She is the carer for her 93 year old mother who is overwhelmed with dementia. My wife is not alone. There are millions of unpaid carers in the UK and without them the NHS would disintegrate.

The head of a South African community group, he was in pain, on liquids, and getting weaker by the hour. It was not the best time to think about moving to Amsterdam to run the world\u2019s most recognised environmental organisation. But it took a threat from his 16-year-old daughter to persuade him to go for the job. \u201cShe said, \u2018Dad, I won\u2019t talk to you ever again if you do not consider it.\u2019 Ten days later, still on liquids, I relented,\u201d says Naidoo. \u201cYes, the head of Greenpeace needed a kick from his daughter. She is my fiercest critic.\u201d Naidoo is now at the end of his six-year stint as head of Greenpeace and is preparing to head home to his native South Africa. His tenure has brought a very different focus to the group that had traditionally paid little attention to broader, cross-cutting issues such as human rights, health, development, peace and security.  \u201cThe struggle has never been about saving the planet. The planet does not need saving. If we warm it up to the point where we cannot exist we\u2019ll be gone, the planet will still be here,\u201d he says. \u201cIt will be bruised and scarred by humanity\u2019s crimes on it but actually once human beings become extinct, the forests will recover, the oceans will replenish. This struggle is fundamentally about whether humanity can fashion a way of mutually coexisting with nature and protecting our children and their children\u2019s future.\u201d When Naidoo took the job he was known not as an environmentalist but as a child, and enemy, of apartheid. Brought up in a township in Durban, he was expelled from school as a teenager and threw himself into the anti-apartheid movement. Several years later, accused of violating the state of emergency through his civil disobedience, he was forced to leave South Africa and sought refuge in a scholarship at the University of Oxford. As the first outsider and African to take the top job at Greenpeace, his appointment took on a symbolic resonance. He was seen as a man who could save the organisation from itself, build bridges and shape the international NGO into a people-focused, people-powered movement, rather than a heroic stalwart fighting on behalf of others.     Naidoo gives a thumbs up as he climbs the Prirazlomnaya oil platform and holds a banner reading \u2018Don\u2019t kill the Arctic\u2019 in Russian, in the Pechora Sea, in 2012. Photograph: Denis  Sinyakov/AP    \u201cThe one thing that we wanted to shift is the idea that Greenpeace is going to save the world, that our activists \u2013 brave and courageous as we are \u2013 will come in, do an action, enrage public opinion and then changes will happen,\u201d he says, \u201cToday we want to campaign together with people, break the idea that people can outsource their conscience to us.\u201d He says the green movement could learn a lot from the struggle against apartheid. \u201cOne of the great mistakes of the environment movement was to frame the climate debate as one about environment. \u201cI was two weeks into the job in 2009 when the Copenhagen climate summit took place. I picked up the communique. I said, \u2018This is a death warrant for most vulnerable people in the world. So why is there a lack of urgency \u2013 or is it because of the colour of the people who are facing the impacts?\u2019 Why we won the battle against apartheid is because we built the broadest possible alliances.  \u201cWe have to give a voice to people on the frontline. I do not believe that people like us of privilege should be given the greatest voice. We have to put our struggle on a war footing. Change became possible in South Africa when people believed change was possible. Today more and more people believe we can make the transition [to a carbon-free economy]. We haven\u2019t reached that tipping point yet.\u201d But becoming a people-focused movement has required some apologies. Greenpeace had become the bitter enemy of indigenous peoples in the Arctic for its unconditional stand against whaling \u2013 a small-scale but vital industry in Greenland \u2013 and its campaign against seal hunting in Canada. The group has since offered apologies to indigenous peoples and drawn a distinction between commercial whaling and that practised by the Inuit. In recent years, Greenpeace has kept its target firmly fixed on the Arctic, building a campaign that has attracted the support of 7 million people worldwide, including celebrities from the model Kate Moss to the actor Judi Dench. In September, it celebrated the its most significant victory to date when Shell abandoned drilling operations in the region, at a cost of $4bn (\u00a32.7bn) to the oil company. The campaign has not been without sacrifice. In 2013, the Russian coastguard boarded Greenpeace\u2019s ship in the Arctic and arrested its crew at gunpoint. The group of activists who were held in jail for two months became known as the Arctic 30, with the fight for their freedom set to be dramatised on the big screen by Lord Puttnam. Naidoo does not regret the decision to push ahead with the campaign in Russia, although on this occasion he stayed behind. \u201cI made a judgment call that it was probably going to be OK, but obviously the politics in Russia had shifted by then. I didn\u2019t think the Russian state would respond. As a famous American grandmother once said, if you\u2019re going to make an omelette you\u2019re going to have to break some eggs \u2026 The sacrifice they [the activists] made contributed to the whole world knowing the Arctic has to be protected.\u201d     Naidoo flanked by Mohamed Aslaam (l), the minister of environmental affairs of the Maldives, and Bobby Peek, a South African environmental activist, at a demonstration during UN climate talks in Durban, in 2011. Photograph: Stephane de Sakutin/AFP/Getty Images    Naidoo is to now bring together the two great struggles of his lifetime. He is determined to take the clean energy fight to South Africa, where the government is pushing ahead with an $85bn plan to replace its coal economy with a new generation of nuclear plants. Naidoo has described the challenge as one of the most pressing since the end of apartheid. Greenpeace has had a longstanding anti-nuclear stance. This is not the end of Greenpeace for Naidoo. He will return to becoming a volunteer, \u201cthe most precious and honourable title within Greenpeace\u201d, he says. It is a role he held for three years before becoming director and one that he refused to abandon during his tenure at the top, taking annual leave to volunteer on actions. He grins; he clearly enjoyed the role. In 2011, he defied water cannon and a court injunction to scale the oil rig owned by the Scottish drilling company Cairn Energy. He was arrested and spent four nights in a prison in Greenland. Not to be deterred, the following year he boarded an oil rig 600 miles east of Murmansk, north-west Russia, carrying a banner that read \u201cSave the Arctic!\u201d in Russian. The experiences made him reflect on the organisation\u2019s narrative and its relevance to the people 8,700 miles (14,000km) away in South Africa. He recalls travelling on a ship with other activists to the rig. \u201cI think they saw that I was looking a bit shit scared \u2026 I was thinking if I died here, most of the people back home in Africa where I come from won\u2019t understand that slogan. I was discussing with my daughter and some of the kids in my family and they said, \u2018Uncle Kumi, a better slogan would have been \u201cSave Santa Claus Now\u201d\u2019 \u2013 because that\u2019s the only connection that ordinary people have with that part of the world.\u201d So if Greenpeace is determined to become more people centric, why all the polar bears? Naidoo slaps the table, and says: \u201cIt is wrong for humanity to think that we can live in a way that shows no regard to animal and plant species \u2026 I don\u2019t think Greenpeace should walk away from that idea. The Arctic is the refrigerator of the planet. As an African you might wonder where I am here \u2013 it\u2019s a bloody cold place for an African to go to, but it\u2019s because of the critical role that the sea ice plays in climate regulation \u2026 it should be a wake-up call to our leaders.\u201d Naidoo\u2019s time at the top of Greenpeace has been bookended by landmark climate change negotiations. He started the job weeks before the opening of the doomed talks in Copenhagen, where Greenpeace activists were arrested on the final night for gatecrashing a banquet held by the Queen for heads of state. At the UN climate change talks in Paris earlier this month, Naidoo used his weight to praise the leadership of low-lying states such as Kiribati and the Philippines \u2013 and to call out developed countries for a lack of it. Although optimistic about the landmark global deal that emerged, he says that a subtle form of racism \u2013 \u201cclimate apartheid\u201d \u2013 is at play in international negotiations. \u201cIf you look at the dominant demography of the parts of the world that carry the historical responsibility for the problem and the parts of the world that are paying the first and most brutal price, it\u2019s a very uncomfortable demography,\u201d he says. \u201cIn these negotiations we will not be having a debate about 1.5 or 2 degrees or 2050 or 2100 if Europe was facing sea level rise as the people in the Pacific islands \u2026 If you are brutally honest, subliminal racism is at play in these negotiations.\u201d     Naidoo, when he was head of the Global Action Forum, gives a press conference in 2005, with Bono and Bob Geldof ahead of the Live 8 event \u2013 that coincided with the G8 summit in Gleneagles.

A year ago, the group again had to offer an apology after staging a protest on the Nazca lines in Peru, ancient geoglyphs considered sacred by many. Just weeks ago as world leaders arrived in Paris, thousands of people came out on to the cold streets of London for a march organised by a coalition of NGOs, including Greenpeace. A group representing indigenous people and those from countries in the global south have since claimed that they were pushed back from the front of the march, to be replaced by people in animal headgear and slogans such as #FortheLoveofSkiing. \u201cNeither the government nor the NGO liberal line will lead us to justice. This is a war of narratives and ours is \u2018decolonial\u2019,\u201d activists from the Black Dissidents group said. Naidoo says that no Greenpeace activists were involved but accepts that all organisers share responsibility. He finds the complaints of indigenous peoples disturbing. \u201cIt was a conscious decision that we all made that the frontline communities, the people being impacted by climate change, would lead \u2026 I am surprised. I am still trying to find out the facts of what happened but I have to say it is something that distresses me a lot.\u201d There have also been accusations during his tenure of Greenpeace\u2019s finances being in disarray. There was more pointed criticism of a senior executive being allowed to fly several times a month between his home in Luxembourg and group\u2019s offices in Amsterdam. Naidoo defended the arrangement at the time, saying that the executive had a young family and was unable to move Amsterdam straight away. Perhaps referring to these incidents, in a farewell blog to supporters just before Christmas, Naidoo conceded: \u201cThe organisation is still licking its wounds from setbacks that have occurred on my watch \u2013 times when we have failed to live up to the values we champion.\u201d He added that the organisation was learning from its mistakes. But Naidoo says that he has been changed by his time leading Greenpeace. \u201cI was dealing with climate change as if it is any other problem but climate change is a \u2018game-changer\u2019 \u2026 My biggest debt to Greenpeace is how much I\u2019ve learned about how environmental justice and protection is about clean water, uncontaminated food, clothing that doesn\u2019t have toxins in it, how poverty is an environmental issue.\u201d It is a message that he hopes will remain at the organisation\u2019s core: \u201cImagine we are the last people on the planet and climate change has happened and we decided to write up the history of humanity and put it in a capsule so that if human life emerges again they won\u2019t make the same mistakes, one of the things we would probably conclude is that those who historically deem themselves to be civilised and need to civilise the uncivilised \u2013 that is the indigenous peoples of the world \u2013 we would conclude that the people who were most civilised were the indigenous peoples of the world.\u201d", "sentences": ["It was not the best time to think about moving to Amsterdam to run the world\u2019s most recognised environmental organisation.", "There was more pointed criticism of a senior executive being allowed to fly several times a month between his home in Luxembourg and group\u2019s offices in Amsterdam.", "Naidoo defended the arrangement at the time, saying that the executive had a young family and was unable to move Amsterdam straight away."], "title": "Kumi Naidoo: 'The struggle has never been about saving the planet'", "webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/dec/31/kumi-naidoo-struggle-never-been-about-saving-planet-greenpeace", "tags": ["Greenpeace", "Kumi Naidoo", "Environmental activism", "Environment", "Protest", "World news"]}]}
