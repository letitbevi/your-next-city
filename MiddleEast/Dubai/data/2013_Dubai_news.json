Albeit this time the familiar narrative of minute and gripping drama shaded at the sides by a wider power struggle of perma-tanned and buffet-fed administrators will be played out on an altogether more refined stage, offering a year of white-flannelled comedown after the mass sporting intoxications of the past 12 months. This time it is the turn of cricket to attempt, precariously, to take centre stage. Yes, really, cricket: that neglected staple of the British summer, a business of mannered and weather-bound slow-wrought drama, doggedly championed but somehow always reassuringly in retreat. For various reasons 2013 feels like a vital moment in cricket&apos;s occasionally fraught modern history. Most obviously this is because it offers a chance to emerge with a sense of calculated urgency into the hiatus of a precious sporting summer without football tournaments or Olympic Games. Beyond this, 2013 might even be cast as something of a first last stand for Test cricket, the grand Victorian antecedent of all modern spectator sports and still a garishly irresistible metaphor for post-colonial relations across the defunct imperial map. Mainly, though, there will just be loads of cricket. In 2013 England and Australia will stage back-to-back Ashes series for the first time in the modern era. Ten Test matches and 15 limited overs internationals are scheduled across both hemispheres in the course of six months, with 32 out of 67 days from July to August set to feature televised Anglo-Aussie cricket. It is, in its own way, a hijack of the sporting summer, not to mention in the grander scale a show of Anglo-Aussie resistance to the pull of global Twenty20 cricket and the relocation of the sport&apos;s financial and geographical power-base towards the Indian subcontinent. At bottom, of course, this is a cash-generating exercise, an extension of the startling transformation in cricketing governance over the past 20 years. From the early 1990s onwards a sport previously managed by blazered worthies has turned itself over to administrators whose backgrounds are in business and marketing, whose instinct, on spotting a revenue stream, is always to maximise it (the England and Wales Cricket Board is currently headed by Giles Clark, brains behind Majestic Wine Warehouse). The cramming together of home and away Ashes series has been explained away as a means of avoiding a clash with the 2014 World Cup, but in reality this is the ECB and Cricket Australia wringing peak-cricket revenues from what has proved a wonderfully rich source. Ashes Tests always sell out. Prestige sporting tourism continues to thrive, driven by a muscular sub-culture of VIP-tented corporate networking. Plus, for better or worse, there is an element of cold war arms-race about all this, a shadow-boxing struggle for influence. Cricket&apos;s power-base is now no longer confined to Lord&apos;s (in fact the International Cricket Council is sited in a half-built desert super-town in Dubai). England and Australia are no longer the sport&apos;s gatekeepers; cricket&apos;s centre of gravity has shifted to the unanswerable fiscal might of India, with its billion-strong cricket-leaning populace and its lucrative obsession with the more punkish shorter formats of the game. Not to mention, of course, its aggressively expansionist board of control, which takes delight in bloodying the noses of the ICC, ECB and all who resist its urges to reconfigure the global cricket-scape. Make no mistake, the Ashes will be huge this year: social media-swamping huge, Fiona Bruce-looking-pleased-on-the-news-huge. England will be captained by the irresistibly stern, man-band handsome Alastair Cook, a reluctant sporting crossover-celebrity in the making. But outside England and Australia it is now a lonely old world for supporters of Test cricket. The fact is, cricket&apos;s newer forms are winning this battle. It will be 50 years this coming summer since the first appearance of one-day cricket, 1963&apos;s debut season for the old Gillette Cup. In which time English cricket&apos;s own invention has become its commercial master. The Indian Premier League, which will stage its sixth edition three months before the Ashes, represents short-form cricket in its most evolved and bullish form. Across India&apos;s booming urban centres, aspirational full-house crowds watch what is as much nationalistic crickertainment as hard-edged sport, with Bollywood royalty bestriding the team dugouts, an advertising saturation of alarming proportions (even the six-hit has been replaced in IPL by the &quot;DLF Maximum&quot;: DLF is a major sponsor) not to mention the usual inanity of fireworks, music and groin-thrusting podium girls. And if it is all a long way from the managed restraint of Lord&apos;s (no jeans, no T-shirts: no corks to be popped before midday) it is also a riotous success. The IPL brand is valued at $4.13bn, stoking the furnace of the BCCI&apos;s unmatchable commercial revenues. Little wonder that other nations are drawn to this cricketing gold and that the younger players of the West Indies, New Zealand and Sri Lanka now look to the IPL&apos;s frenzied excitements as an ultimate destination and life-changing payday, and that one-day cricket retains its popularity while stadiums on the subcontinent are often pretty much empty for Test matches. This is perhaps only to be expected. In the wider context, Test match cricket remains a glorious anachronism, its tempo and texture utterly out of kilter with the modern world. If you were to come up with it now, to pitch the idea of a major global sport based around a glacial five-day struggle devoid of noticeable activity for hours on end, you&apos;d be laughed out of the room. Test cricket is neither interactive, celebrity-friendly or geared overtly towards the mass market. It is difficult, remote, gently nuanced and academically meritocratic. Its continued existence sometimes looks like an oversight, or a fluke. With this in mind it is little wonder that Test cricket has for many years been quietly shrinking back towards its keenest strongholds. Test cricket is not about to die out, but its reach is demonstrably reduced. So much so that at times during 2013 England and Australia might start to look a bit like the last two men left on deck, energetically slugging it out while the ship goes down around them, waves lapping the balustrades, gaslights flickering and the band, groggily defiant, giving it one last blast of Waltzing Matilda.", "title": "Cricket: The Ashes will be a show of Anglo-Aussie resistance to the global pull of Twenty20", "sentences": ["Cricket&apos;s power-base is now no longer confined to Lord&apos;s (in fact the International Cricket Council is sited in a half-built desert super-town in Dubai)."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-01T07:00:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2013/jan/02/united-arab-emirates-egypt", "tags": ["Media", "United Arab Emirates", "Egypt", "Muslim Brotherhood", "Press freedom", "Human rights"], "article": "A journalist is reportedly among 11 Egyptians detained by the authorities in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

HMRC posted pictures of the 32 tax cheats, who were last year sentenced to a total of 155 years and 10 months behind bars, on the image hosting site Flickr. They include four men jailed for a total of 21 years and three months for one of the biggest alcohol smuggling frauds uncovered in the UK, worth \u00a350m a year. Among the named and shamed are a garlic importer, platinum traders, dealers in bogus carbon credits and sophisticated carousel fraudsters who obtained VAT rebates worth millions on mobile phones. Only one of the top tax criminals was a professional tax adviser: Roy Faichney of Pinner in Middlesex. He helped operate a fraudulent \u00a370m tax avoidance scheme sold to wealthy customers, but was jailed in October for four years. David Gauke, the exchequer secretary to the Treasury, said: &quot;We hope publishing these pictures will help get across that it always makes sense to declare all your income, and tax dodgers are simply storing up trouble for the future. &quot;Most people play by the rules and pay what they owe, but HMRC is cracking down on those who don&apos;t.&quot; An FBI-style list of Britain&apos;s &quot;most wanted&quot; tax fugitives who owe HMRC more than \u00a3700m has already received 660,000 hits since HMRC published it on Flickr in July. The moves are part of a \u00a31bn government crackdown on tax evasion. But campaigners said that while &quot;common criminals&quot; were being named and shamed by HMRC, holders of multimillion-pound Swiss bank accounts who had been found evading tax had been given guarantees of anonymity and immunity from prosecution. Richard Murphy of Tax Research UK, who has led campaigns against corporate tax avoidance by multinationals, said: &quot;I&apos;m delighted that HMRC is tackling the common criminals. But these are the people on the fringes \u2026 When is HMRC going to go after the billions held in Switzerland? &quot;They know who they are, they know the level of tax fraud, but they are guaranteed anonymity and non-prosecution under the Liechtenstein disclosure facility. &quot;The truth is that &apos;nice&apos; people don&apos;t get their pictures shown in the press or posted over the internet. There&apos;s an implicit snobbery in this exercise: it&apos;s class-based and about pursuing the smaller person while ignoring the organised tax avoidance of the banking industry.&quot; But other experts said the risk of being publicly named and shamed was having an impact on the wealthy and corporations. Phil Berwick, a partner at international law firm Pinsent Masons, said: &quot;We have seen a lot of people come forward under the Liechtenstein facility. The potential for having their photo published in this way if they don&apos;t come forward is having a real deterrent effect. It is flushing out people who voluntarily want to be compliant and bringing substantial amounts to the exchequer at very little cost.&quot; Gary Ashford of RSM Tenon, a global accounting firm, said he expected future name-and-shame lists to include those masking their wealth in offshore accounts. &quot;We are seeing a lot of activity by HMRC around offshore accounts, although in terms of pictures, you&apos;re not seeing it yet. We could well be seeing more people prosecuted and pictured in this way,&quot; he said. David Cameron said last week that a crackdown on international tax evasion would be one of the top priorities of the UK&apos;s leadership of the G8 group of richest nations this year. But critics argue depleted resources at HMRC will make the crackdown impossible. Murphy said: &quot;There are simply not enough people left to tackle the problem and there&apos;s a lack of political will. Osborne&apos;s only strategy for the UK is to be open to business \u2013 open for the business of tax avoidance.&quot; YesterdayOn Friday the prime minister said foreign companies such as Starbucks and Amazon that had avoided large corporation tax bills lacked &quot;moral scruples&quot; and vowed to make &quot;damn sure&quot; they paid their fair share.

Comporta is a village on the Tr\u00f3ia peninsula, a 13-mile long sandy spit in the north of Portugal&apos;s Alentejo region. It sits at the heel of the peninsula, at the southern end of the wide Sado estuary, sandwiched between dense forest and the Atlantic. The village is lovely and has affordable places to stay. I turn right off the road that runs south from the ferry dock and the car lurches from pothole to crater for half a mile until, out of the blue, there appears an organised car park, with marked bays and shady canopies. I stroll along the wooden boardwalk and feel as if I&apos;ve stumbled on to the White Isle. Before me is a sizzling hot beach resplendent with palm umbrellas, sun loungers and two beach cafes, where people lie on hot-pink bean bags, nodding to chilled-out tunes. The Atlantic sparkles, and foamy waves break hard on the shore. At Ilha do Arroz (restauranteilhadoarroz.com), a beach lounge and restaurant, where specialties include past\u00e9is de bacalhau (salt-cod fishcakes) and am\u00eaijoas a bulh\u00e3o pato (clams in a garlicky broth), I get into the laid-back groove with that blueberry caipirosca.

Early the next day I take to the beach on horseback, on a former polo pony who prances across the dunes and canters through the waves. Totally alone, I feel like I&apos;m staging a Foreign Legion desert escape. Comporta has been found only by a knowing few, but it is about to become less of a secret, sadly. The 12,500-hectare estate is to be developed, with five hotels, including a luxury Aman (the chain&apos;s first on the Iberian peninsula) and two golf courses \u2013 though it is claimed all will be low-density and architecturally sensitive. For now it is quiet. On a Sunday in mid-June the ferry that crosses the Sado estuary from Setubal once an hour is only a third full. The passengers included locals popping to the beach for a picnic, a few Lisbonites and the odd foreign tourist. All was peaceful, until the two dozen passengers rushed en masse to the side of the boat to watch two bottlenose dolphins. Beaches strewn with driftwood and the odd sunseeker greet us at the shore. It&apos;s a wonderful place to spend a day, though the coast further down is dominated by tower blocks that would have had Fred Dibnah reaching for the dynamite. This is the Troia Resort, a 1,200-acre development regarded by some as a model of sustainable tourism: it is the first resort in Portugal to be ISO 14001 certified (a global standard for environmental management). To me, though, it looks like it belongs in Dubai. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is rumoured to own several luxury properties nearby, which kind of says it all.

Why is architect-speak so impenetrable? Rowan Moore, the Observer&apos;s architecture critic, answers question one and could not be accused of accusation number two. One of the UK&apos;s most accomplished writers on the profession, he critiques the most important buildings and the people who masterminded them with a style that is both entertaining and cuts through the crap. Why We Build, his new book, does not disappoint. It does not set out to be a definitive study, more a set of musings. As he tours the world, Moore dips into themes. He guides us through the relationship between architecture and eroticism, power and finance in a journey from S\u00e3o Paulo to New York, Beijing and beyond. The more eccentric the destination, the more amusing is the language. The Atlantis hotel in the ridiculous bling fest of Dubai is &quot;a Blofeltian phantasmagoria of giant aquaria and rooms with views of sharks, which suffered the rare ignominy of being accused of bad taste by the British tabloid the Sun&quot;. He stops off at the super-rich folly of self-made software mogul Larry Dean in Atlanta, Georgia \u2013 a mansion the colour of salmon mousse. The marital bed is &quot;engulfed by writhing turquoise vegetables \u2026 and by gooey blossomings the colour of vulvas&quot;. Architecture is perhaps the ultimate form of human self-expression. A less charitable term would be self-indulgence. Sex plays a major part in this narrative, from a farmhouse in Sussex designed for swingers, to the compulsiveness of American architect Stanford White, a &quot;man with fire between his legs and lead between his eyes&quot;. Frank Lloyd Wright apparently built his career &quot;servicing the wives of rich men while designing their\u00a0houses&quot;. From the late 1960s housing estate outside Amsterdam called Bijlmermeer, the author takes us to Moscow, to the Park of National Economic Achievements and the marbled metro stations. These testaments to Stalin personified &quot;force with charm, the twinkling eyes with the mailed fist&quot;. He describes Kijong-dong, a prosperous-looking North Korean town in sight of its enemy to the south, &quot;which turns out to have no glass in its windows nor rooms behind its doors&quot;. Architecture as tool of propaganda is a long-established motif, but instead of the bombast, Moore chooses to focus on the relationship with power, not from the perspective of client, but of architect. Thus in his view Mies van der Rohe &quot;lingered longer in Nazi Germany than was decent, apparently in the hope that the regime might\u00a0adopt his architectural style&quot;. He also tries to explain the thinking of Rem Koolhas when he agreed to build a new HQ for Chinese state television. Moore has conjured a rare feat in producing a work that will be appreciated by professionals and punters alike. My only quibble was the use of small, dusky black-and-white photographs and illustrations. I would have preferred more boldness and\u00a0colour. His overarching message is that buildings are inextricably linked to time and space. They are defined by their context. I agree with this assertion, with a little personal experience. As chair of Turner Contemporary, I watched as David Chipperfield created a gallery by the sea in Margate that has taken the UK art world by storm. Chipperfield is doggedly proud of his achievement; he is also self-deprecating. His &quot;shed&quot;, as he calls it, has transformed not just the built environment but the mood in a town that has seen so little success in recent times. &quot;Buildings will never exist independently of the stuff around them, and the events and thoughts that occur inside them and out,&quot; Moore concludes. &quot;One description of bad architecture is that it ignores this inescapable circumstance.&quot; John Kampfner is the author of Blair&apos;s Wars and Freedom For Sale", "title": "Why We Build by Rowan Moore \u2013 review", "sentences": ["The Atlantis hotel in the ridiculous bling fest of Dubai is &quot;a Blofeltian phantasmagoria of giant aquaria and rooms with views of sharks, which suffered the rare ignominy of being accused of bad taste by the British tabloid the Sun&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-06T00:08:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2013/jan/06/teaching-music-becoming-a-teacher", "tags": ["Career advice", "Professional development", "Teacher Network", "Education", "Schools", "Secondary schools", "Primary schools", "Teaching"], "article": "I&apos;d like to say I became a teacher because I was so passionate about teaching children but that&apos;s not quite how it happened. I&apos;d always sung, and was involved in choirs all my childhood through church and my great mentor Marjorie Judson. I was passionate about singing in the East Riding County Choir. But I never got noticed at school. I went to Beverley High School in Yorkshire. I wasn&apos;t as academic as some of the girls who were going on to do medicine. No one ever told me I was bright and somehow at school I always felt I was the poor relation. I didn&apos;t get into the school choir. I didn&apos;t even do music O-level or A-level. The school didn&apos;t do me any great service musically really but this experience ignited my passion to support and encourage young musicians in the schools I have taught in later.  When I was in the sixth form I went on a music cruise on the SS Uganda with my choir. We played concerts in different parts of Europe over two weeks and were involved in all kinds of wonderful musical activities and competitions. The most memorable one for me was a concert in St Michael&apos;s Cave in Gibraltar. We had to walk down the mountain after the concert and that&apos;s when I realised what I wanted to be a musician. However at 18 it was really too late to make that decision. I was allowed to stay on one more year at my sixth form at Beverley High to do a crash course in O-level or A-level music. I picked up my piano again and went from grade 3 to grade 7 in a year and also learned the French horn. There was a new music teacher in that extra year. While we were doing some oral work in one of the first lessons she said: &quot;Oh, what a beautiful voice you have&quot;. It was a real &apos;hallelujah&apos; moment for me. At last someone at school had noticed. So it was really too late for me to study be good enough to study music at university. The advice I got was to do a teaching degree and become a music teacher. I got onto a fantastic BEd at Bath College of HE, now Bath Spa University. When first visited it I thought I&apos;d died and gone to heaven. The campus has an old castle and a lake where you could wander off and think great thoughts, or not. Starting college was a new beginning for me. I got so much support and encouragement from my tutors and colleagues. I joined the college choir and I found there were so many great projects to get involved in. I also discovered I loved teaching. I found, as so many teachers find, I had a natural ability to communicate with young people. Now one of my mantras to students is: you have to do what you want to do and be want you want to be. Many students come to me who are embarrassed to sing. But someone will always put you down, whether it&apos;s your peers or your family. If you want to sing you must. Some of my students have gone on to be professional musicians, many others have gone down different paths but music has given them confidence and the performing skills that have helped them in whatever field they have entered. My first school was Sir John Nelthorpe in Brigg. It was amazing to have my first pupils and I can still remember so many of them now. I realised how much I love working with young voices and developing confidence. We played a lot of guitar (this was the 1970s after all) and we entered local music festivals. Throughout my career I&apos;ve always done a lot of singing myself away from school. When I moved to Wiltshire and taught at Stone Henge School I joined Salisbury Musical Society choir. Later when I taught in Bury St Edmunds, I joined the Operatic Society. Getting my own musical satisfaction has always been important for me and I think it has helped my teaching. When my husband died in 1992, my young son and I moved up to Sheffield where I spent five years as head of music at Wales High School. That&apos;s the longest I&apos;ve ever worked in one school to date. The head was excellent and the kids were fantastic. One of my ex pupils now teaches in my current music department, so it&apos;s strange that sometimes life turns a full circle. I missed Suffolk and my friends there. So I got a job at the National Teaching and Advisory Service for Looked After Children and Children in need. We were working with children who were on the edges of society and isolated, excluded, in a home or with foster parents. It was our responsibility to work with them and find them places at schools and support them. I loved the job and found it really fascinating, but in the end I missed music teaching too much. So when a music teaching job came up at Culford School where my son was a pupil, I got the job. After a couple of years at Culford, I went to teach in Dubai at a huge international school Jumeirah College. The kids were so eager to learn but there was very much a gap in the consistent quality of instrumental teaching within the schools. We needed to have a team of instrumental teachers working across several sites. So I set up GEMs music academy, which was essentially our own peripatetic instrumental music service. I loved my job so much. But when the financial crash happened in 2009 it had a big impact on GEMs schools. I was made redundant. I was devastated. By this point I was over 50 and I have to say I was glad be out of the classroom. Music teaching is wonderful but very tiring. It&apos;s give, give, give \u2013 and a very physical job. I had all the joy of putting on concerts with the children but the job of managing the project was far less exhausting than teaching. Being made redundant had a huge impact on me. When I came back from Dubai, I moved into my current job as head of music at Hinchingbrooke School. It&apos;s a wonderful place, a large state school set in beautiful grounds. I&apos;ve been here since 2010 and the school is going through some big changes with a new principal. I lead a team of four in the music department and we follow a skills-based curriculum. Teachers work to their strengths and the pupils rotate around the staff rather than the other way round. I&apos;ve seen music education change so much over the years. When I was a younger teacher I used to kowtow to the national curriculum but I am a big believer in teaching skills, so I&apos;m delighted to focus on skills-based curriculum. I&apos;m lucky that in this school we&apos;ve invested in high-quality instruments and music technology. We&apos;ve got full sets of all sorts of real instruments that kids really like to play, which makes a huge difference. If children can make beautiful sounds they are going to be far more excited about music. I think teaching has been a great career for me. I&apos;ve loved every minute of it. I&apos;ve always followed my heart. Looking back I think I&apos;ve made some rather silly decisions to move about so much. At times I have been frustrated and would have liked to move on to an assistant head job, or even a headship, but good music teachers are difficult to find, once discovered schools tends to want to keep you in that box. I&apos;ve no doubt that I made the right decision all those years ago to train as a teacher. It&apos;s a wonderful career because you are always learning and growing. I have learnt new things just last term from a student I&apos;m mentoring from Homerton College on her first teaching practice. Meeting teachers just coming into the profession is a breath of fresh air. Liz Mummery is head of music at Hinchingbrooke School in Cambridgeshire. Interview by Emily Drabble.

Ish \u2026 Strictly speaking, it&apos;s now the tallest building in western Europe, at 309.6m, since Moscow&apos;s Mercury City tower overtook it last year \u2013 with a 29m advantage. How does it compare to the world&apos;s highest observation decks? With the highest deck on the 72nd floor at 244m, it&apos;s got a long way to go before it can compete globally. More than 30 public decks rise higher around the world: Dubai&apos;s Burj Khalifa; the vertiginous Canton Tower in Guangzhou, China; the Tokyo Skytree; and the CN Tower in Toronto all boast decks at around 450m. Even the Eiffel Tower beats the Shard, with a viewing platform at 276m. What&apos;s inside? Hailed as a &quot;vertical city&quot; by its architect, Renzo Piano, the bulk of the Shard is taken up by offices, up to the 28th floor, followed by three floors of restaurants \u2013 to be run by Hong Kong&apos;s Aqua Group and the founders of the Japanese restaurant chain Zuma, Arjun Waney and Rainer Becker, and open from April. Above this sits 18 floors of the five-star Shangri-La hotel (complete with a swimming pool on the 52nd floor), topped off by 10 apartments \u2013 each expected to fetch between \u00a330m and \u00a350m. At the top, occupying levels 68\u201372 is the public gallery, The View from the Shard. How do I get a ticket? To save the queuing scrum of most London attractions, The View from the Shard operates on a pre-booked timed ticket system \u2013 already on sale, you can book online here up to four months in advance, and print out your airport-style e-ticket at home. Billed as a &quot;premium attraction&quot;, it comes at a premium price: \u00a324.95 for adults and \u00a318.95 for children (compared to a trip on the London Eye for \u00a317.28, or the Emirates Air Line at only \u00a33.20 on an Oyster card, and the Walkie-Talkie tower, which will be free when it opens at the end of 2014). Open daily from 9am to 10pm from 1 February, a limited number of &quot;walk-up&quot; tickets are also available on the day \u2013 at the increased price of \u00a329.95 and \u00a323.95. How do I get there? The Shard might be hard to miss, rising 300m above London Bridge station, but the entrance to the View is trickier to find \u2013 located in the brick vaulted passage of Joiner Street that threads its way beneath the station. Arriving by train or tube, you won&apos;t even have to go outside, and the exit deposits you back on the station concourse level after your visit. There is no dedicated cycle-parking and whatever you do, don&apos;t come by car: there are no parking or drop-off facilities. What do I get for my money? Anyone hoping for a &quot;4D theatre experience&quot; or other interactive distractions along the way will be disappointed. As the name of the attraction suggests, the main draw is the view, and it is rightly given centre stage. Elevators whisk you up to the 68th floor at six metres per second, where a triple-height viewing gallery offers a 360-degree panorama up to 40 miles across the city on a clear day. Digital telescopes provide extra information on what you&apos;re looking at, and you can feel the wind in your hair on the open-air 72nd floor. Visits are not timed, so once you get up there you can stay as long as you like \u2013 although there is nowhere to sit down. There is also a &quot;sky boutique&quot;, and the best thing on offer is its cuddly toys of Romeo the fox (the dare-devil creature found living at the top of the Shard during construction). Anything else? Leave big bags at home \u2013 anything over 55 x 38 x 20cm will not be allowed in, and there is no cloakroom facility, although folded pushchairs can be left downstairs. Binoculars might be handy \u2013 there are 12 digital telescopes, but with 250 people in the galleries at any one time, you might be in for a wait. And remember to check the Met Office forecast before you go \u2013 it&apos;s so high that low fog can easily scupper the view.", "title": "The Shard: a visitor's guide", "sentences": ["More than 30 public decks rise higher around the world: Dubai&apos;s Burj Khalifa; the vertiginous Canton Tower in Guangzhou, China; the Tokyo Skytree; and the CN Tower in Toronto all boast decks at around 450m."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-08T14:37:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/public-leaders-network/2013/jan/10/procurement-jobs-middle-east-asia", "tags": ["Public Leaders Network", "Procurement", "Professional development", "Joining the public sector"], "article": "Anyone with decent expertise and ambition in procurement should seriously consider obtaining work in the Middle East or south-east Asia. My overwhelming impression gained in 2012 about south-east Asia, the Middle East and, to a degree, South Africa, is the massive investment in infrastructure in those regions. These countries have a tremendous can-do attitude in these countries, with a clear intention in many of them to attract business, such as financial and IT sectors, away from the developed western world. While the UK seems bogged down in deciding whether or not to build a third runway at Heathrow, Dubai airport has quadrupled its number of passengers in 10 years. In November 2012, the prime minister for the United Arab Emirates announced that, just three years after the world fiscal crisis had hit the state-owned Dubai World conglomerate, a new city will be built, with a park one-third as big again as Hyde Park and with the biggest shopping mall in the world. The country&apos;s total infrastructure spend is 17.5% of its GDP. Despite recent increases, the total UK spend on transport infrastructure is less than \u00a310bn a year, ie under 1% of our GDP. In contrast, Singapore spent nearly \u00a33bn in 2012 on transport infrastructure, one-third of that of the UK, even though it covers an area only 0.25% the size of the UK, while its population of just over five million is only 8% the size of the UK. Singapore also plans to invest \u00a330bn to double the reach and capacity of its metrorail network over the next few years from its capacity in 2008. In 2012, government IT spending increased to \u00a30.6bn. Two-thirds of the value of Singapore&apos;s procurement for its IT network is going to local businesses. Based on population, it could be argued that to keep up with Singapore, the UK&apos;s capital spend on transport should be \u00a336bn a year, and on IT infrastructure \u00a37bn. The difference between the two countries was underlined in UK chancellor George Osborne&apos;s autumn statement in December 2012. Theadditional infrastructure spend announced by Osbornewill do little more than slightly reduce the speed at which the gap between parts of Asia and the UK is growing. For example, many people may be surprised that there is just one decent main road across the Pennines south of Cumbria and no plans to change this. There are no proper direct road links from the industrial east Lancashire councils to the nearby metropolitan areas of Leeds and Bradford, nor between Sheffield and Manchester \u2013 just 40 miles apart. If this were Dubai, we would have six-lane highways. The ambitions of the Asian and Middle Eastern countries far exceed those even of Michael Heseltine. The UK seems to be on a course of managed decline. The implications for UK procurement personnel are immense. Procurement expert Peter Smith says procurement employment in the UK may have peaked. I agree \u2013 but would go much further. As public sector procurement in the UK becomes more integrated, there will be a shakeout out of procurement posts \u2013 in particular, a huge reduction in the number of heads of procurement. This is in addition to what appears to be a trend for multi-national companies to move their procurement operations to south-east Asia. And there is no income tax in Dubai. Procurement experts looking to work in this part of the world will get great experience of project contracting work, demandfor which are likely to continue to increase.

If players such as Andre Wisdom and Raheem Sterling are looking for advice on how to cope, they could do no better than turn to Rob Jones, who a little over 21 years ago not only made his full Liverpool debut at Old Trafford but did so two days after signing for his boyhood club from Fourth Division Crewe Alexandra. Adding to the sense of fantasy, Jones went on to be named man of the match after marking an exciting 17-year-old winger called Ryan Giggs out of the game. Indeed, such was the job Jones did on Giggs during that goalless draw in October 1991, that the Welshman took time out to pay tribute to him in Jones&apos;s recently released autobiography, Robbed, describing him as one of the best full-backs he has ever faced. &quot;For someone like Ryan Giggs to say that means a lot,&quot; says Jones, who like Giggs was born in Wales but raised in the north of England. &quot;I&apos;ve spoken about the United game lots of times but it still feels like a blur. I just remember getting a good few touches early on and covering Ryan whenever he knocked the ball past me. That gave me confidence and from there I grew into the game. &quot;The main thing I wanted to do was concentrate on stopping Ryan Giggs. He was incredible, not just at running at pace but running at pace with the ball; he went at the same speed, which is an amazing thing for a player to be able to do. The only other person I came across in my career who was able to do that was Steve McManaman.&quot; McManaman&apos;s name crops up regularly in Robbed, the team-mate who became a close friend and subsequent shoulder to lean on after Jones was forced to retire in 1999 due to a chronic knee injury, aged 27. His was a career that burnt brightly and quickly at club and international level \u2013 he made his England debut in a friendly against France in February 1992, four months after his impressive step up into the top flight \u2013 before being cut off in its prime. The title of his book would suggest Jones has been left feeling bitter by the entire experience but he insists this is not the case. &quot;I wasn&apos;t 100% sure about Robbed but went with it because that is what Liverpool fans often say whenever they bump into me \u2013 &apos;You were robbed of your career,&apos;&quot; Jones says. &quot;But I had a great career; I got to play for the club I&apos;d supported since I was a kid, won trophies with them and also got to play for my country. Yes, I could have achieved a lot more but there is no bitterness there.&quot; The sincerity and warmth in Jones&apos;s voice suggests he means what he says but there is no denying that this was a player who with better fortune could have hit the heights at domestic and international level. Having broken into Crewe&apos;s first team at 16, Jones was signed by Liverpool on the back of the club&apos;s then manager, Graeme Souness, watching him play against Newcastle United on a cold Wednesday evening at Gresty Road. The following day Jones got a call from Crewe&apos;s manager Dario Gradi telling him that Liverpool, the club his late grandfather Bill had represented immediately after the second world war, wanted to sign him for \u00a3300,000. The day after that Jones was at Anfield meeting Souness face to face. &quot;After signing, Graeme drove me to Melwood [Liverpool&apos;s training ground] to meet the rest of the squad and on the way he asked if I felt I could handle playing against Manchester United on the Sunday. I told him &apos;Of course I could,&apos;&quot; Jones remembers. &quot;Liverpool had a lot of injuries in defence at the time and Graeme obviously saw something in me that he fancied and decided to take a gamble. &quot;Nowadays you would never see a Fourth Division player sign for Liverpool and go straight into their first team but it was rare even back then. What made it even more amazing was that I was going from being someone who cheered the team on from the Kop to suddenly playing alongside them, alongside my heroes. It felt like a dream that shouldn&apos;t have come true.&quot; Quick, defensively astute and a threat going forward, Jones was the complete full-back and it was no surprise that following his outstanding display at Old Trafford he instantly became a mainstay of the Liverpool team during a difficult time for the club, with Souness, having replaced Kenny Dalglish as manager, struggling with the process of refreshing an all-conquering team that was reaching its end. &quot;I saw Graeme in Dubai last year for the first time since he was sacked [in 1994] and he admitted he would have done things differently at Liverpool,&quot; says Jones. &quot;He knows now that he should have asked the older players for help instead of trying to move so many of them on \u2013 and that it probably wasn&apos;t a good idea making Mark Wright his captain given he&apos;d just signed for the club. &quot;He tried to change things too quickly but it should be remembered that it was Graeme who brought through the likes of Steve McManaman and Robbie Fowler. He was trying to build a young, exciting team and some of the football we played was great. We just weren&apos;t consistent enough.&quot; That was a theme that continued after Roy Evans became manager, a period which saw Jones switch from right-back to left wing-back in a 3-5-2 formation. Again he excelled but by now the player&apos;s career was beginning to be blighted by injuries. He had been forced to miss out on Euro 92 due to shin splints before having to sit out Euro 96 due to a cracked vertebra. &quot;That was hard to take,&quot; admits Jones. &quot;I had done well the season leading up to the tournament and Terry Venables [the then England manager] told me I was in his thoughts as far as his final squad was concerned. But I cracked my back after the &apos;96 FA Cup Final [which Liverpool lost to Man United] and that was that. I had no chance of making it.&quot; Jones made only eight appearances for England and, as Liverpool supporters never tire of saying, if he had stayed fit, then Gary Neville would not have won the 85 caps he ultimately achieved, a view shared by Jamie Carragher. Jones is more diplomatic in his outlook. &quot;You can say &apos;if this&apos; and &apos;if that&apos; but Gary Neville was a consistent player and, whatever happened, he would have played for England many times,&quot; he says. &quot;What&apos;s for sure is that, had I stayed fit, then Gary and I would have provided strong competition for the right-back slot, which would have only been good for the country.&quot; It was eventually patella tendinitis, otherwise known as jumper&apos;s knee, that did for Jones, forcing him after numerous operations to call it a day shortly after a brief spell at West Ham, whom he joined after leaving Anfield. A career that promised so much ended with Jones making 243 appearances for Liverpool, winning the FA Cup and League Cup and, famously, not scoring a single goal for the club. Life for Jones is now based around being a father to three children and running a hugely successful nursery and care-home company with his wife Sue. He remains in touch with a number of figures from his Liverpool days, in particular McManaman, who claims that he enjoyed playing with Jones at Liverpool even more than he did with Michel Salgado at Real Madrid. &quot;In some ways the Liverpool of today is similar to the team I played for, in that Kenny Dalglish has just left and those that remain are finding it tough to get back to the top,&quot; says Jones. &quot;I&apos;m confident they can get back there in the next two or three years and winning on Sunday would definitely give the players a huge boost. I&apos;ll be watching and hoping they can do just that.&quot; To order Robbed visit www.robjonesbook.co.uk", "title": "Rob Jones: I went from being on the Kop to playing alongside my heroes", "sentences": ["&quot;I saw Graeme in Dubai last year for the first time since he was sacked [in 1994] and he admitted he would have done things differently at Liverpool,&quot; says Jones."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-10T16:38:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/10/adam-kirby-banned-pipers-piping", "tags": ["Horse racing", "British Horseracing Authority", "Sport"], "article": "Adam Kirby, the leading jockey on the all-weather circuit this winter with a strike rate of nearly one in four, said on Thursday that the British Horseracing Authority had put &quot;a slur on my character&quot; after he was banned for seven days for failing to ensure that a horse ran on its merits. Kirby was banned for his ride on Pipers Piping in a seven-furlong handicap at Kempton Park on 5 December. His horse was slowly away from a good draw one off the rail and then trapped behind runners in the home straight and, though Pipers Piping still appeared to be going well, it was a situation which Kirby seemed to accept at least a furlong from the line. The local stewards did not inquire into Kirby&apos;s performance on the day but it was subsequently referred to the BHA&apos;s disciplinary panel following a review. The BHA did not suggest that Kirby was riding to orders or that he intended to prevent Pipers Piping achieving the best possible placing but the disciplinary panel decided that Kirby had put insufficient effort into the ride. The official notice of the inquiry&apos;s findings said that &quot;the panel noted that inside the final two furlongs a gap developed on the inside which Kirby failed to attempt to take advantage of. The panel also considered from this stage to the winning post his riding was not seen to be vigorous enough. In its opinion the panel felt that Kirby failed to take all reasonable and permissible measures to ensure the gelding ran on its merits.&quot; Kirby, who attended the hearing with a solicitor, left immediately afterwards to travel to Lingfield, where he rode his 49th winner of the winter campaign on the 1-2 favourite Grendisar.

He ran well. As soon as you get vigorous with him, he stops. He was well beaten before and after, so it&apos;s a shame. It&apos;s a slur on my character. I don&apos;t prevent horses from winning.

One is a sexual violence typhoon that is impacting most countries in the world. It&apos;s been happening forever but, like climate change, it&apos;s suddenly impossible to ignore. I first noticed more ominous waves during the US elections, the extreme and ignorant anti-women policies perpetrated by the Republicans. Then, like climate storms, floods and fires, specific extreme manifestations began to gain attention. A group of boys allegedly raping a girl in Steubenville, Ohio; a 14-year-old girl shot in the head for insisting girls have the right to learn in Pakistan; the gang rape and murder of a girl on a bus in Delhi; and in Britain the revelations that Jimmy Savile was able to abuse hundreds of girls over six decades, while British institutions from the BBC to Broadmoor turned a blind eye. And, like the response to climate change, first there was an attempt at denial, then there is the blaming of the victim: a woman raped in Dubai fined after telling police she had been drinking; a priest in Italy telling women they are beaten because they don&apos;t clean the house well and wear tight clothes; women in the US military raped by their comrades who then use that as proof that they never belonged there in the first place; raped girls in Rochdale being ignored by police and social workers because they were seen as damaged goods who were &quot;making their own choices&quot;. It goes on and on. Like climate change, only the patriarchs with power seem to be blind to the magnitude of the horrors. As a matter of fact they are engineering it. There is a rape culture \u2013 a mindset that seems to have infected every aspect of our lives: the raping of the Earth through ecological destruction by the corporate powerful, pillaging resources for their own coffers with no concern for the Earth, or the indigenous peoples, or the notion of reciprocity; the rape of the poor through exploitation, land grabs, neglect; the rape of women&apos;s bodies through physical violence and commodification, where a girl can be purchased for less than the cost of a mobile phone. The modelling and licensing of this rape culture is done by those protected by power and privilege \u2013 presidents, celebrities, sports stars, police officers, television executives, priests \u2013 with impunity. But there is another rising. In the last year I have travelled the world for One Billion Rising, the global campaign that is a call for the one\u00a0billion women who have been beaten or raped and the men who love them to strike, rise and dance on 14 February to end violence against women and girls. This movement is moving through the planet with a force and urgency unlike anything we have experienced \u2013 it is what the Indian activist Kamla Bhasin calls a &quot;feminist tsunami&quot;. Across 182 countries entire communities are planning to rise and voice their outrage and dreams. Nurses, teachers, domestic workers, indigenous leaders, fisherwomen, peasants, scholars, union organisers, all have come together. Coalitions are being forged, with a new openness between issues, classes, tribes, races, artists, activists young and old. From Anna Cruz prosecuting 700 murders of women a year in Guatemala to Fartun, who opened the first shelter for women in Somalia, bravely organising for women to take to the streets of Mogadishu. From farmworker women \u2013 calling themselves Vaginas Campesinas \u2013 who will be dancing in their fields for less violent conditions, to the brave and outspoken nuns Sister Mary John from Philippines, Joan Chittester from the US, and Tenzin Palmo from Tibet. Entire networks are being activated \u2013 Gabriela in the Philippines, Unite in Britain, the AFL-CIO union in the US, and more than 14,000 other groups around the world. Feminists and activists across the world have been tirelessly working for this moment for decades. If you don&apos;t believe the door is opening look to India, where sexual violence has now become the central issue. Look to the winning of the US elections by women who said no to the anti-women extremists. Look to the UK, where a real debate is beginning about institutional violence against women \u2013 Keir Starmer, the director of public prosecutions, spoke for many when he said the Savile report &quot;must be seen as a watershed moment&quot;. Look to loving men such as Kaizaad Katwal, Jason Day, Robert Redford, the Dalai Lama and millions of others who are rising with us. Look to City of Joy in Bukavu, Democratic Republic of Congo, where women who, in spite of the violent escalations of the M23 militias and the daily threat of annihilation, continue to heal and study and become powerful in order to save their sisters. So I am opting for Rising #2. We don&apos;t\u00a0have any idea what&apos;s going to happen when one\u00a0billion women and men protest on the same day. We do know that the preparation for it over these last months has already announced, united and catalysed a movement that, like the violence, can and will no longer be denied. Now is the time. One month. 14 February. Rise in the streets, in the schools, on the buses, in your homes, in the dark alleyways, in the offices and factories and fishing boats and fields.

Western governments have built waivers into the sanctions regime \u2013 aimed at persuading Tehran to curb its nuclear programme \u2013 in an effort to ensure that essential medicines get through, but those waivers are not functioning, as they conflict with blanket restrictions on banking, as well as bans on &quot;dual-use&quot; chemicals which might have a military application. &quot;Sometimes companies agree to sell us drugs but we have no way of paying them. On one occasion, our money was in the bank for four months but the transfer repeatedly got rejected,&quot; Naser Naghdi, the director general of Darou Pakhsh, the country&apos;s biggest pharmaceutical company, told the Guardian, in a telephone interview from Tehran. &quot;There are patients for whom a medicine is the different between life and death. What is the world doing about this? Are Britain, Germany, and France thinking about what they are doing? If you have cancer and you can&apos;t find your chemotherapy drug, your death will come soon. It is as simple as that.&quot; European officials are aware of the potential for disaster reminiscent of the debacle of the UN oil-for-food programme imposed on Iraq under Saddam Hussein, and discussions are under way in Brussels on how to strengthen safeguards for at-risk Iranians. The US treasury says its office of foreign asset control is seeking to reassure banks that they will not be penalised for financing humanitarian sales. However, the US and EU bans on doing business with the major Iranian financial institutions still make such transactions extremely difficult and risk-averse western companies have tended to avoid them. Naghdi, the head of Darou Pakhsh, which supplies about a third of Iran&apos;s pharmaceutical needs, said he can no longer buy medical equipment such as autoclaves (sterilising machines), essential for the production of many drugs, and that some of the biggest western pharmaceutical companies refuse to have anything to do with Iran. &quot;The west lies when it says it hasn&apos;t imposed sanctions on our medical sector. Many medical firms have sanctioned us,&quot; Naghdi said. A senior British official acknowledged that discussions between London, Brussels and Washington had been going on for months with the aim of unblocking the supply of medicines, but without a decisive outcome. &quot;The problem is that for some of the big pharmaceutical companies and banks it&apos;s just not worth the hassle and the risk of reputational damage, so they just steer clear,&quot; the official said. The international financial sanctions and the EU oil embargo last year have caused severe damage to the Iranian economy but have so far not forced the Tehran regime to accept restrictions on its uranium enrichment programme. Iran insists it is for electricity generation and medical purposes, while the west and Israel claim it is a front for Iranian ambitions to build nuclear weapons. Major western powers have suggested a new round of talks in Istanbul in mid-January, but Tehran has yet to confirm any date or venue. Meanwhile, the scale of the looming Iranian health crisis threatens to overwhelm recent efforts to mitigate the sanctions regime. At present 85,000 new cancer patients are diagnosed each year, requiring chemotherapy and radiotherapy which are now scarce. Iranian health experts say that annual figure has nearly doubled in five years, referring to a &quot;cancer tsunami&quot; most likely caused by air, water and soil pollution and possibly cheap low-quality imported food and other products. In addition, there are over 8,000 haemophiliacs who are finding it harder to get blood clotting agents. Operations on haemophiliacs have been virtually suspended because of the risks created by the shortages. An estimated 23,000 Iranians with HIV/Aids have had their access to the drugs they need to keep them alive severely restricted. The society representing the 8,000 Iranians suffering from thalassaemia, an inherited blood disorder, has said its members are beginning to die because of a lack of an essential drug, deferoxamine, used to control the iron content in the blood. In the absence of an official supply, the drug market is being flooded with smuggled products. Many arrive on donkeys from Turkey, but there is no way of knowing which products are counterfeit and which are real. The drugs routinely spoil on the long, precarious journey over the rugged frontier. A drugs bazaar has boomed on Tehran&apos;s Naser Khosrow Street, but prices have doubled in a few years and the provenance and authenticity of the medicines on sale are questionable. US and European governments put the blame squarely on the Tehran regime. &quot;Financial sanctions against Iran are in place because of the Iranian government&apos;s refusal to address the international community&apos;s well-founded concerns about its nuclear programme,&quot; said John Sullivan, a US treasury spokesman. &quot;If there is in fact a shortage of some medicines in Iran, it is due to choices made by the Iranian government, not the US government.&quot; Last month, Iran&apos;s health minister, Marzieh Vahid Dastjerdi, was sacked for complaining that her ministry had only received a quarter of the \u00a31.5bn allocated for the imports of medicine, noting that foreign currency at a subsidised official rate had been spent on imported luxury cars. In London, the Foreign Office said: &quot;There are a number of explicit exemptions within EU sanctions to allow Iran to purchase humanitarian goods such as medicines. The UK issues, as a priority, licenses for transactions for humanitarian goods. The responsibility for any shortage in humanitarian goods in Iran lies with the Iranian regime.&quot; Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American business consultant based in Dubai, argues the regime&apos;s own shortcomings may well exacerbate the acute medical problems in Iran but are not their direct cause. &quot;There is a lot of government mismanagement that is compounding the problem. But Iran had the same government before and there was plenty of medicines around. This is not a chicken-and-egg situation. The shortages have come after the sanctions,&quot; said Namazi. One of the unintended consequences of sanctions on the health sector is that they have strengthened companies linked to the regime and the Revolutionary Guards at the expense of the private sector, because of their privileged access to hard currency at the official rate. In some cases, those regime-connected firms are actually using their access to cheap foreign currency to acquire drugs cheaply and smuggle them into Iraq, deepening the crisis.", "title": "Iran unable to get life-saving drugs due to international sanctions", "sentences": ["The responsibility for any shortage in humanitarian goods in Iran lies with the Iranian regime.&quot; Siamak Namazi, an Iranian-American business consultant based in Dubai, argues the regime&apos;s own shortcomings may well exacerbate the acute medical problems in Iran but are not their direct cause."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-13T18:20:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jan/15/french-troops-triple-mali", "tags": ["Mali", "France", "Africa", "Europe", "World news"], "article": "France is expected to more than triple its troop numbers in Mali as raids continue on Islamist insurgents following overnight air strikes on a small town that had been seized by the rebels. Sources close to the French defence minister said the number of French troops deployed in the west African country would &quot;gradually&quot; reach 2,500. There are currently 800 French troops in Mali, with hundreds more on the way over the next few days. France carried out a fifth day of air strikes in a vast desert area seized last year by an Islamist alliance, which combines al-Qaida&apos;s north African wing, AQIM, with Mali&apos;s home-grown Movement for Oneness and Jihad in West Africa (Mojwa) and Ansar Dine rebel groups. In a news conference in the United Arab Emirates, the French president, Fran\u00e7 ois Hollande said France had three aims: to stop the rebel advances, to secure the capital, Bamako, and to help the Mali government regain control of the whole country. He said France would take a lesser role &quot;as soon as there is an African force, in coming days or weeks&quot;, adding that France did not intend to stay. Hollande said: &quot;France should only intervene in Africa in exceptional circumstances and for a limited time. That&apos;s what we will do.&quot; In response to questions about a return to France&apos;s controversial role in its former colonies, he said the Mali intervention, in an international legal framework with UN backing, had nothing to do with the practices of &quot;a bygone era&quot;. But he added that France&apos;s role was to ensure that &quot;when we end our intervention, Mali is safe, has legitimate authorities, an electoral process and there are no more terrorists threatening its territory&quot;. Commentators in France said this would imply a drawn-out presence in the poor west African country, which is in political disarray following a coup last year and the fall of the desert north to Islamist groups, who operate a drug trafficking and kidnap economy in northern Mali and other Sahelian countries. Asked what France intended to do with the insurgents, Hollande said: &quot;Destroy them. Take them captive, if possible.&quot; West African defence chiefs were meeting in Bamako to approve plans to speed up the deployment of 3,300 regional troops, foreseen in a UN-backed intervention plan to be led by Africans. African troops are expected to begin to be deployed within a week. Troops from the Ecowas grouping of west African states are expected to bolster the dishevelled Malian army. A convoy of 40 to 50 armed trucks carrying French troops crossed into Mali on Tuesday from Ivory Coast, where they were stationed. The UN refugee agency said the military clashes in northern Mali were adding to the already large numbers of people who had fled its recent conflicts. The agency spokesman, Adrian Edwards, said 1,230 refugees from Mali had arrived in Niger, Burkina Faso and Mauritania as a result of recent clashes between the French-backed Malian army and the rebel groups. More than 144,000 Malian refugees fled to neighbouring countries in 2012, while nearly 200,000 people fled their homes in northern Mali and were displaced within the country. French raids took place overnight over the town of Diabaly, 220 miles (350km) from the capital, Bamako. The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius \u2013 accompanying Hollande on the Dubai visit aimed at firming up trade relations and making progress on a possible sale of 60 Rafale fighter jets \u2013 said he was confident Gulf Arab states would also help the Mali campaign. Fabius said there would be a meeting of donors for the Mali operation, most likely in Addis Ababa at the end of January. He predicted the current level of the French involvement in Mali would go on for &quot;a matter of weeks&quot;. But a Mojwa commander taunted the French, telling Associated Press: &quot;I would advise France not to sing their victory song too quickly. They managed to leave Afghanistan. They will never leave Mali.&quot; Oumar Ould Hamaha said: &quot;It&apos;s to our advantage that they send in French troops on foot. We are waiting for them. And what they should know is that every French soldier that comes into our territory should make sure to prepare his will beforehand, because he will not leave alive.&quot; In Lisbon, the US defence secretary, Leon Panetta, said no American troops would be put on the ground in Mali. The US is providing intelligence-gathering assistance to the French, and officials would not rule out having American aircraft land there to provide airlift and logistical support. Panetta said the US was still working through the details of assistance it would provide France. The Ecowas mission head in Bamako, Aboudou Toure Cheaka, said west African troops would be on the ground within a week. Their immediate mission would be to help stop the rebel advance, while preparations for a full intervention continued, he said. The original timetable for the 3,300-strong UN-sanctioned African force \u2013 backed by western logistics, money and intelligence services \u2013 did not initially foresee full deployment before September due to logistical constraints. Senegal, Burkina Faso, Niger, Nigeria and Guinea have all offered troops. But the regional powerhouse, Nigeria, which is due to lead the mission, has cautioned that even if some troops arrive in Mali soon, training will take time. The plan is being fast-tracked following a plea for help by Mali&apos;s government after mobile columns of Islamist fighters last week threatened the central garrison towns of Mopti and Sevare, with its key airport. The French prime minister, Jean-Marc Ayrault, said France&apos;s goals were to stop the Islamist rebels, to &quot;safeguard the existence of Mali&quot; and pave the way for the African-led military operation. French intervention has raised the risk for eight French hostages held by al-Qaida allies in the Sahara and for 30,000 French expatriates living in neighbouring states. Concerned about reprisals at home, France has tightened security at public buildings and on public transport. The Mali government contradicted other reports that the Islamists who seized control of Diabali \u2013 a town in the government-controlled south \u2013 had entered the country from Mauritania. &quot;The people in Diabali are bandits who fled there from the north,&quot; said Manga Dembele, the minister of communication, in an interview with the Guardian at the government headquarters in Bamako. &quot;They have come to seek refuge in the town and they are hiding in the population.&quot; But relations with Mauritania to Mali&apos;s west and Algeria to the north have been fraught in recent months, with accusations that both countries have harboured Islamists who crossed over porous desert borders from Mali to stock up on fuel and other supplies. &quot;We are not worried that the Islamists will arrive in Bamako,&quot; said Dembele. Responding to questions about the apparent lack of security in the capital where government offices and ministries have little security and are accessible to members of the public. Dembele said the situation in the city was under control. Dembele sought to calm increasing anxiety in Bamako about the existence of Islamist &quot;sleeper cells&quot;, which it is feared could launch an attack on the city in response to the mounting campaign against them in the north.", "title": "France expected to more than triple Mali troop numbers", "sentences": ["The French foreign minister, Laurent Fabius \u2013 accompanying Hollande on the Dubai visit aimed at firming up trade relations and making progress on a possible sale of 60 Rafale fighter jets \u2013 said he was confident Gulf Arab states would also help the Mali campaign."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-15T14:13:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/on-the-middle-east/2013/jan/15/egypt-iran-morsi", "tags": ["Middle East and North Africa", "Egypt", "Iran", "Saudi Arabia"], "article": "Forging better relations between Iran and Egypt is turning out to be harder than the Islamic Republic might have imagined after the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak \u2014 the biggest upheaval of the Arab spring. In general, Tehran has misrepresented the uprisings as an &quot;Islamic awakening&quot; \u2014 a partial and self-serving view even though in Egypt, Tunisia and elsewhere Islamist parties have played significant roles. Iran (which crushed the opposition Green movement protests in 2009) has also made an important exception for its long-standing ally Syria, backing President Bashar al-Assad against his enemies when key Gulf states have actively opposed him and other Arabs kept their distance. It has reserved its most enthusiastic support for Bahrain, where the Shia majority is demanding that the western-backed Sunni monarchy institute genuine democratic reforms. Syria was the main item on the agenda last week when Ali Akbar Salehi, Iran&apos;s foreign minister, visited Cairo. The event was trumpeted by Iranian media as the harbinger of a new era in relations, though there is little common ground on Assad and President Mohamed Morsi even called publicly for the Syrian leader to face war crimes charges. There is a good deal of historical baggage in the way of a rapprochement between the two countries. During Mubarak&apos;s 30 years in power Egypt was firmly in the US camp in the Middle East. Iran severed ties with Egypt when Anwar Sadat signed the 1978 Camp David accords with Israel and then offered asylum to the deposed shah. Egyptians have long bristled at the infamous Tehran mural which praises the &quot;martyr&quot; Khaled al-Islambouli, who led the 1981 assassination of Sadat. Part of the change since the revolution is that many Egyptians, including those who dislike the peace treaty with Israel, support a more independent foreign policy that includes normal relations with Iran. Still, links with Tehran remain a sensitive issue. Over the weekend the Egyptian government flatly denied press reports that Qasem Suleimani, commander of the elite al-Quds force of Iran&apos;s revolutionary guard corps, had visited Cairo in December to advise on security issues. To many observers this sensational claim appeared intended to smear the president, who is on the defensive after opposition protests over the new constitution. It remains unclear whether the story was somehow linked to the dismissal of the interior minister, Ahmad Gamal al-Din. Suleimani also issued a denial. Egypt&apos;s Muslim Brotherhood has certainly been too quick to blame outsiders for Morsi&apos;s difficulties, but there is no doubt that he faces intense hostility both at home and abroad, especially from the United Arab Emirates, which has arrested 11 Egyptians on suspicion of national security offences. Dahi Khalfan, Dubai&apos;s outspoken police chief, has said that the threat from Iran and the Brotherhood was similar. &quot;They both want to export the revolution,&quot; he told al-Sharq al-Awsat. &quot;What the Muslim Brothers are aiming for at the moment is to shred and denigrate the reputation of the Gulf rulers.&quot; (The exception is tiny Qatar, which has just given $2.5bn in loans and grants to help Egypt shore up its faltering currency.) In general though Egypt&apos;s Arab friends are more worried about Tehran. Iran, according to the Saudi columnist Hamad al-Majid is &quot;a virus spreading in a contaminated region. Gulf governments and their media &quot;must build on President Mursi&apos;s policy of spurning Iran&apos;s advances, rather than doubting it,&quot; he advised. Indeed, while Salehi was seeing Morsi another Cairo event underlined the limits to Egyptian-Iranian d\u00e9tente. That was a conference of Iranians from Ahwaz, capital of Khuzestan province, about what organizers called &quot;the Persian occupation of Arab land.&quot; It had a strong sectarian tinge and enjoyed the backing of a key Morsi aide and al-Azhar, the voice of Egypt&apos;s official Sunni religious establishment. Iran complained that it was the work of &quot;radical Salafis&quot; backed by Saudi Arabia and Qatar. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, Iran&apos;s president, is due in Cairo next month for a summit of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference. That will mirror the newly-elected Morsi&apos;s participation in last summer&apos;s Non-Aligned Conference in Tehran, where, to American and Israeli dismay, he signaled a more independent post-Mubarak foreign policy but then embarrassed his hosts by calling it an &quot;ethical duty&quot; to support the uprising in Syria. Signs are, all in all, that it will be some time before these two important Middle Eastern powers manage to find a way of rubbing along despite the obvious tensions. Still, it will suit both sides to try to keep them from getting out of hand.", "title": "Iran struggles to woo reluctant Egypt", "sentences": ["Dahi Khalfan, Dubai&apos;s outspoken police chief, has said that the threat from Iran and the Brotherhood was similar."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-15T14:48:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jan/18/low-cost-holiday-destinations-2013", "tags": ["Family finances", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "Travel", "Spain holidays", "Europe holidays", "Greece holidays", "Italy holidays", "Egypt holidays", "Australia holidays", "Caribbean holidays", "Bahamas holidays", "Thailand holidays"], "article": "Spain has regained the crown as the cheapest European holiday destination for Brits, with the cost of eating out down 50% compared with five years ago, according to a survey. It shares first place with Sri Lanka in the annual Post Office Worldwide Holiday Costs Barometer \u2013 which compares in-resort prices for a shopping basket of eight items including drinks, suncream and a meal for two \u2013 as the best value places to stay out of 42 surveyed. But if you&apos;re heading to Australia, the survey makes grim reading. Holiday essentials cost a remarkable four times the amount holidaymakers pay in Spain. The Post Office found that a typical meal out for two, with a bottle of wine, will set you back \u00a3106 in Australia compared with \u00a322 on the Costa del Sol. The good news for travellers on a budget is that prices are down in around a third of the destinations surveyed, with widespread cost-cutting by restaurants and bars. In Europe, for example, the basket of goods tested has fallen 18% in Greece (Corfu) to \u00a357.50, making prices a third cheaper than Italy (Sorrento) at \u00a387.06, the most expensive of six eurozone destinations surveyed. Winter sun is now perhaps most affordable in Egypt, after a fall in prices of around 20% in resorts such as Sharm el Sheikh, where the basket of goods cost \u00a356.02. Egypt is struggling to regain ground after the scenes of protests and revolution in Cairo&apos;s Tahrir Square deterred tourists. It is now 45% cheaper than mid-haul competitor Dubai, at \u00a3101.69. In the Caribbean, resort costs have fallen sharply in Barbados, accounting for a 26% drop in the barometer basket to \u00a384.24. By contrast, higher meal prices have made Jamaica 18% more expensive than last year, at \u00a397.59. Sri Lanka registered a 27% increase but remains cheapest of the 42 destinations, because a weaker currency helped to cushion the blow of significant price rises in the country&apos;s beach resorts. The Czech Republic (\u00a339.17) is in third place for the third consecutive year, followed by Bali (\u00a340.47), which has leapt up from 12th place last year through a combination of lower resort prices and a weaker Indonesian rupiah. At number five, Vietnam (\u00a343.20) is up five places on the back of lower meal prices. Good news for bargain hunters is that prices have tumbled in Turkey, where meal prices are down 22%, probably because of fierce competition between restaurants after cuts in flight capacity brought fewer visitors during 2012. This took Turkey (\u00a352.89) back into the top 10 for the first time since 2008. Rising resort prices in Thailand (\u00a358.31) mean that holidaymakers can expect to pay 22% more than 12 months ago and the destination has fallen from the top 10 to 16th place. For city breaks, Eastern European cities sweep the board as best value destinations when compared with eurozone cities, according to the Post Office.     Source: Post Office    Low costs for meals, drinks, transport, sightseeing and accommodation, together with the pound&apos;s stronger buying power, give Prague, Budapest, Riga, Tallinn and Warsaw a clear price advantage over rivals in the west. Prague and Budapest were less than half the price of Paris and Bruges, the most expensive. Accommodation was more than twice as expensive in five eurozone cities \u2013 Vienna, Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris and Bruges \u2013 than in Budapest, while meal costs in Prague were less than half the price of Berlin, Amsterdam, Paris and Bruges. The Post Office is tipping Lithuanian capital Vilnius as the next city break hotspot. It heads the Post Office list of emerging destinations based on the back of a 42% surge in sales of its currency (Lithuanian litas) during 2012, and Vilnius looks set to emulate the success of Estonia&apos;s Tallinn and the Latvian capital, Riga. \u2022 Sign up to the Money Talks email for the latest news and deals", "title": "Low-cost holiday destinations in 2013", "sentences": ["It is now 45% cheaper than mid-haul competitor Dubai, at \u00a3101.69."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-18T09:46:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/18/rory-mcilroy-misses-cut-abu-dhabi", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Tiger Woods", "European Tour", "Sport", "Golf"], "article": "     A black Friday for Rory McIlroy, Tiger Woods and Nike. And not one that was in keeping with any of that trio&apos;s Abu Dhabi script. McIlroy began the week confirming his multimillion-pound contract with the sporting goods giant against the kind of glitzy environment routinely enjoyed by film stars. He ended it with the rare ignominy a missed cut and doubtless having caused embarrassment at Nike by reverting back to his old, Titleist putter for the second round of the HSBC Championship. Money, suffice to say, doesn&apos;t arrive with the guarantee of professional success. McIlroy was characteristically pragmatic about his failings in this, his debut tournament as a Nike player; Woods, on the other hand, was just angry. The 37-year-old incurred a two-shot penalty after taking an incorrect &quot;free&quot; drop on the 5th. Woods was made aware there was an issue by the time he played the 11th with the penalty confirmed by the tournament referee before he signed his scorecard. That moved Woods from one shot inside the cut line, having made a strong effort to get there, to the same margin outside of it. Woods departed Abu Dhabi with his $3m appearance fee untouched but having played only 36 holes for the first time in 39 regular European Tour events. Whatever other character flaws he retains, the fierce competitive instinct of Woods ensures that alone will wound him. McIlroy&apos;s issues were more basic. On a tight course, the Northern Irishman was at times astonishingly wayward on his way to a second successive 75. This is a venue at which McIlroy traditionally profits \u2013 11th was his worst finish before this \u2013 with the general finger of blame pointing towards his new clubs. &quot;I knew it was going to be a tough week with everything going on but I was just looking forward to getting to the golf course and getting back to what I do and what I&apos;m comfortable with,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;It just didn&apos;t work out like that. I hit the ball really well last week in practice in Dubai and just sort of gradually got worse this week for some reason.&quot; McIlroy will now head back to Dubai for work with his coach, Michael Bannon. He has no plans \u2013 as yet \u2013 to make the considerably longer journey to Melbourne to watch his girlfriend, Caroline Wozniacki, in Australian Open tennis action. On his unforeseen putter change, McIlroy said: &quot;I just felt like the greens that I&apos;ve been practising on in Florida are a lot faster than these. The putter, the Nike putter is great on that. But then getting to here, it&apos;s just lighter so it&apos;s just a weight issue more than anything else. I can feel the head of this one I used today a little bit better. On fast greens, the other one works fine.&quot; McIlroy plans, then, to be using the Nike putter when he returns to competitive action in the United States next month. Nike said: &quot;We understand it takes time. It&apos;s a process and we are confident he&apos;ll change when he&apos;s ready.&quot; McIlroy added: &quot;I&apos;m not here to talk about my contract. I&apos;m here to talk about my golf, and today it wasn&apos;t so good.&quot; Woods took what he believed to be free relief, upon consultation with his playing partner, Martin Kaymer, when his ball was embedded but the ball was in a sand area from where there is no free drop. Journalists first pointed the issue out to rules officials, with Woods&apos;s back nine of 34 ultimately in vain as the penalty slipped him back to three over par. &quot;It&apos;s tough because I didn&apos;t get off to a very good start, fought and got it back,&quot; Woods said. &quot;I was right there and I felt that if I had close to even par, I had a chance going into the weekend, being only eight back. Evidently, it wasn&apos;t enough.&quot; Andy McFee, the chief referee of the European Tour, explained: &quot;In the recording area Tiger and I had a conversation. Tiger was quite happy to accept, he said: &apos;Look, if you think that area is not entitled to a drop, then that&apos;s good enough for me.&apos;\u00a0It&apos;s just one of those situations that both he and Martin, unfortunately, got that rule wrong.&quot; It was almost lost amid this unseemly melee that Justin Rose continued his excellent touch at the summit of the leaderboard. The Englishman holds a one-shot advantage over Gonzalo Fern\u00e1ndez-Casta\u00f1o, Jamie Donaldson and Thorbjorn Olesen.

One family went on a Mediterranean cruise. &quot;Food was OK, but they had had the norovirus, so staff served it wearing rubber gloves. Finding a sunbed unoccupied was impossible. Plus they had three deaths on board.&quot; On the other hand, she records, &quot;the cabin crew folded towels into shapes, of a monkey, turtle etc&quot;. \u2712One chap, from the West Midlands, writes a lengthy newsletter every year in which he records his holidays in pitiless detail, especially parking charges, which he can recall months later.

Nicky Henderson, Sprinter Sacre&apos;s trainer, confirmed that he intends to run last year&apos;s Arkle Trophy winner at Cheltenham if the cold weather eases in time to allow the track to stage its final card before the opening day of the Festival meeting on 12 March. He will also send Grandouet to a re-arranged Champion Hurdle Trial at Doncaster the same afternoon following the abandonment of the Peter Marsh Chase card at Haydock. &quot;We&apos;ve got to have these races and it&apos;s great that the British Horseracing Authority are doing all they can to save them,&quot; Henderson said. &quot;Sprinter Sacre will run at Cheltenham if it goes ahead, and Grandouet will go to Doncaster. One week [without racing] isn&apos;t going to kill us.&quot; Ascot had been due to inspect at 4.30pm on Friday but decided just after midday it was a lost cause. &quot;There are two inches of snow on parts of the track and we can&apos;t cope with that,&quot; Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, said. &quot;We had an attempt to get one of the covers off but there is so much snow on them already and there is more to come. If we didn&apos;t have covers down we wouldn&apos;t be raceable anyway.&quot; Lingfield&apos;s scheduled card on Friday was abandoned two hours before racing after heavy snow started to fall at the Surrey track and the prospects for racing at the same course remain uncertain with an inspection planned at 7.30am. Racing is also scheduled at Kempton Park, following a decision by the BHA to add a card to the programme when poor weather was forecast earlier in the week.That card must also pass an early-morning inspection but the prospects are poor. The clerk of the course, Barney Clifford, who is currently in France, is not optimistic of the fixture beating the elements. Clifford said: &quot;They&apos;ve had three inches of snow, it&apos;s still snowing and there is more snow forecast. The course is not raceable now and we&apos;ll just have to see what they can achieve. &quot;It is not just about the track, there is the infrastructure and everything else to consider. They will inspect at 7.30am and they&apos;ll know what can be achieved by then.&quot; If possible, Channel 4 Racing will broadcast a seven-race programme on Saturday afternoon, with three races at Lingfield (2.00, 2.35 and 3.10) and four from Kempton (1.45, 2.20, 2.55 and 3.30). Channel 4&apos;s Morning Line programme will be reduced from a hour to 30 minutes, starting at 8.00am. Totesport&apos;s Scoop6 bet, however, will be depend entirely on racing abroad, at Naas in Ireland \u2013 where some snow showers are forecast - and also at Meydan in Dubai, where the only snow is confined to an artificial ski slope in a major shopping centre. The 2.10, 3.20 and 3.50 races at Naas and the 3.05, 3.40 and 4.15 at Meydan will comprise the Scoop6 bet. The Naas card scheduled for Saturday, which includes the latest appearance of Un Atout, a leading contender for the Supreme Novice Hurdle at the Cheltenham Festival, must pass an 8am inspection. Kempton is also due to stage a meeting on Sunday while at Fairyhouse in Ireland, where temperatures have yet to fall below freezing, there is concern that further rain could threaten its Sunday card on the same day. &quot;We&apos;re wet and very windy. We&apos;re inspecting at two o&apos;clock tomorrow and the chase track is particularly vulnerable,&quot; Peter Roe, its general manager, said on Friday. &quot;There is more rain due until lunchtime tomorrow, then it should be dry until after racing on Sunday. We are waiting to see what falls and see how we go from there.&quot; The BHA has announced that there will be an additional fixture at Wolverhampton on Tuesday afternoon but Wetherby will hold an inspection morning before its planned meeting the same day, with the chance that the card will go ahead looking remote. &quot;We have a covering of snow,&quot; Jonjo Sanderson, the clerk of the course, said . &quot;It&apos;s not heavy but it&apos;s no longer light.

But there are at least a couple of halfway respectable prizes and some interesting contests due to be staged there today, so long as the weather is a little brighter than yesterday. Connections of Anaconda (3.10) apparently hoped for something a bit better than this, too. He had his first two races as a juvenile at Deauville, the second in a Listed race, and when they sent him to this track last month, it was reportedly part of a plan to get him invited to the Dubai Carnival, which is now underway. He undermined those aspirations by being beaten half a length but that still counts as a highly respectable effort on his first outing in nine months, following treatment for bone chips in a knee. Anaconda proved rather fresh but should be more professional here, with some of the air now out of his tyres, and he appeals as a horse on an upward curve. Of course, he will need to be, having been raised half a stone for that effort. But there are a few likely front-runners in this field and he may be able to get a nice run behind them. Loyalty is unlikely to be able to dictate a steady pace from the front, as he has done here successfully in his last two runs. Kempton 1.45 A winner here three times from six visits, Zing Wing hasn&apos;t been seen for three months but comes from the bang in-form David Evans stable. Lingfield 2.00 Once third in a Group Three as a juvenile in France, Khawatim was rated 95 when he first came to Britain but a series of woeful efforts sent his mark tumbling to 71. On his fifth run since joining Noel Quinlan, he finally turned things around a fortnight ago, forcing his head in front near the line at Wolverhampton after being heavily backed. He&apos;s been raised 4lb but has plenty more to give, though market weakness would be a concern. Kempton 2.20 Three times a winner at Brighton last summer, Toga Tiger was unfancied for his first start since July when scoring at Wolverhampton recently. He&apos;ll be even better for this return to a mile. Lingfield 2.35 Twice a winner over this course and distance, most recently from a mark just 4lb below the one he has today, Proper Charlie ran as though needing the outing when sent here shortly before New Year. That was his first start for almost four months and he can do better this time. Kempton 2.55 A frustrating sort last year, Fluctuate has a chance to start making amends in this company with first-time blinkers on.

Rose chose the phrase &quot;under the radar&quot; to explain how he enjoys avoiding the limelight when the two biggest stars are around. There is also extra validation, Rose believes, from winning a tournament in which McIlroy and Woods are in the field. Through absence has come opportunity for Rose. A chance, namely, for the world No5 to be afforded the attention his game richly deserves. As McIlroy and Woods departed here on Friday evening, Rose was offering an admirable example of frontrunning that continued into Saturday. The 32-year-old is now 18 holes from victory at the HSBC Championship with his overnight lead sitting at two strokes from Jamie Donaldson and Thorbjorn Olesen. &quot;Anyone that wins this week will have beaten the No1 and No2 player in the world,&quot; said Rose after a third-round 68. &quot;That gives this tournament absolute huge amounts of credibility. You can say you&apos;ve beaten the best players, and that&apos;s exactly what you need to do. You need to do that in majors, and you need to do that most weeks on tour. But there are a lot of weeks on tour where there&apos;s sort of a lack of the best players in the world. So these are great opportunities.&quot; A chance, indeed, that Rose is looking to take on this occasion without the added heat of McIlroy or Woods chasing him down on the closing stretch. &quot;If it&apos;s Tiger and Rory that are the two guys right behind you, there&apos;s a lot of hullabaloo about the day and I guess it would be more intense out there,&quot; Rose said. &quot;I would love to sit here and tell you it&apos;s all about playing the golf course. That&apos;s ultimately what I need to do tomorrow whether I&apos;m playing against Tiger, or Thorbjorn Olesen. No other opponent can influence you. They can&apos;t come and rugby tackle you or anything like that. I think what does influence you when you are going up against Rory and Tiger is the crowd, there&apos;s a lot more people milling around, there&apos;s more cameras and more distraction, and that&apos;s what makes it more difficult.&quot; It is a sign of Rose&apos;s current stature that he now looks a better bet to end his run without a major than the other Englishmen who have endured a similar drought \u2013 Lee Westwood and Luke Donald. Heroics against Phil Mickelson on the final day of Europe&apos;s Ryder Cup win at Medinah seem to have triggered fresh belief within Rose; he subsequently won a matchplay event featuring Westwood, Woods and McIlroy in Turkey and came close to another victory, at the Dubai World Championship. If Rose maintains such touch, and there is no reason why he should not, he will be a strong contender for the Masters in April. &quot;My scoring average on Sunday in the last year or two has been pretty good,&quot; said Rose. &quot;Often from 20th or 25th place, I&apos;ve been having great Sundays to finish top 10, as happened in weeks like Dubai. Playing with the lead is always a little bit different but I feel pretty comfortable and the last few times I&apos;ve had the opportunity, I&apos;ve done well.&quot; There would be eyebrows raised if Olesen, an outstanding young Danish talent, is the man to usurp Rose. Like Woods and now McIlroy, Olesen is a Nike-sponsored player; the 23-year-old at least has a legitimate hope of handing the sporting goods giant some cheer after the troubles of their blue chip assets. &quot;I&apos;m enjoying their equipment, I think it is great,&quot; Olesen said, smiling. &quot;It looks like Justin is playing really well, but if I can get some birdies in quickly, I think it can be exciting. I won last year and that gave me a lot of confidence and I also had a few second places.

Pietersen lingered at the crease and finally departed shaking his head after being given out caught behind off a ball from Ishant Sharma that seemed to have brushed his thigh, a key moment that triggered England&apos;s collapse from 68 for one to 155 all out and inevitable defeat. Ashley Giles, England&apos;s one-day coach, confirmed when the team arrived in Chandigarh on Sunday that Andy Pycroft, the referee for the series, had a quiet word with Pietersen during the journey west from Ranchi and that no further action will be taken. But it is the failure of any of England&apos;s four senior batsmen \u2013 Pietersen, Ian Bell, Eoin Morgan and the captain Alastair Cook \u2013 to post a substantial innings in either of the last two games that is a cause of greater concern to Giles, whose side now trail 2-1 in his first series in charge. All four made promising starts in Rajkot, with Bell&apos;s 85 remaining the highest individual score on either side, Cook not far behind with 75 and Pietersen and Morgan both out in the 40s as England posted a total of 325 \u2013 more than they have managed in the last two matches combined. But in the second game, in Kochi, Bell fell cheaply, Cook for 17 to a poor lbw decision, Pietersen for 42 and Morgan for a duck. It was a similar story in Ranchi with Pietersen unlucky but Cook, Bell and Morgan all out trying to force the pace after reaching double figures. Giles reflected on that collective failure rather than a duck for Craig Kieswetter as the root cause of England&apos;s problems. &quot;It&apos;s easy to identify one or two players who might be in the firing line, that always happens, but we need all our guys to stand up and we need the senior guys to stand up as well,&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ve got an experienced top order bar Joe Root and the way we play our cricket we need one of those guys to get us a score. If they can do that, then we bat round them and it enables the guys from five downwards to play with a bit more freedom. Then you get your bigger totals, which is what happened at Rajkot.&quot; Root has faced more balls than anyone in making 36 and 39 in Kochi and Ranchi and there must now be an argument for promoting him to the No3 position usually filled by Jonathan Trott \u2013 who will join the squad for their series in New Zealand next month \u2013 thereby providing Pietersen with more protection from the new ball and boosting the chances of him being able to take advantage of the new fielding regulations later in the innings. Giles would not be drawn on either positional or personnel changes ahead of discussions with Cook but hinted that at least a couple of the three players yet to make an appearance \u2013 Jos Buttler, Stuart Meaker and Danny Briggs \u2013 would be used in the remaining games. &quot;Part of this trip is to look at those options because we&apos;re missing some senior players,&quot; he added. &quot;This is where you find out about people, under pressure.&quot; Kieswetter has played in all 34 of England&apos;s one-day internationals since June 2011, whereas his Somerset team-mate Buttler, who is three years younger, has made a single 50-over appearance, against Pakistan in Dubai last February . Then Buttler played as a specialist batsman and was out for a duck, with Kieswetter keeping wicket and scoring 43. Jade Dernbach would seem the bowler most likely to make way for Meaker, having conceded 187 runs in 24 overs in the series \u2013 lifting his economy rate in a 21-match ODI career to 6.28 runs per over, the worst for anyone who has bowled that often. &quot;It&apos;s tough on Jade because he&apos;s played a lot of cricket here [India] and it&apos;s a hard place to come and play,&quot; said Giles. &quot;But again you have to adapt. What the Indians have done very well is hold lengths and lines, so you have to go at them to try to score. Really that&apos;s what we&apos;ve got to do.&quot; Any remote chance of Stuart Broad adding to England&apos;s options for the rest of the series has been scuppered by the snow which prevented him from flying out to Chandigarh at the weekend.He will now link up with the squad when they move on to Aucklandon Mondayweek.", "title": "Kevin Pietersen escapes punishment for dissent during defeat by India", "sentences": ["&quot;This is where you find out about people, under pressure.&quot; Kieswetter has played in all 34 of England&apos;s one-day internationals since June 2011, whereas his Somerset team-mate Buttler, who is three years younger, has made a single 50-over appearance, against Pakistan in Dubai last February ."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-20T22:01:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/22/buttler-replace-kieswetter-odi-india", "tags": ["England in India 2012-13", "England cricket team", "India cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "Jos Buttler is set to replace Craig Kieswetter as England&apos;s wicketkeeper in the fourth match of their one-day series in India in Chandigarh on Wednesday, raising major questions about the international future of his Somerset team-mate. England will not confirm their team until the morning of the match but Buttler was wearing the gloves for the bulk of practice for the second day running on Tuesday, with Kieswetter not involved. Kieswetter has played in 34 consecutive ODIs since June 2011 and had clearly been identified as England&apos;s first-choice wicketkeeper for the Champions Trophy on home territory next summer. But the 25-year-old, who has already lost his place in the Twenty20 squad to Buttler after failing to make an impression in the World Twenty20 competition in Sri Lanka last September, has been left floundering again by India&apos;s spinners as England have suffered consecutive defeats in Kochi and Ranchi. He took 38 balls to make 18 in Kochi before falling to Ravi Ashwin&apos;s off spin, and in Ranchi he was bowled for a third-ball duck by the skiddy, slow left arm of Ravindra Jadeja. Even the unbeaten 24 he made from 20 balls in the first game of the series in Rajkot was a mixed bag, as before launching two late sixes he had failed to play with the same fluency as Samit Patel, failing to score off too many balls. Buttler, who is three years younger than Kieswetter but rarely keeps even in county cricket, has made 18 Twenty20 international appearances but was out for a duck in his only previous ODI against Pakistan in Dubai last February \u2013 when he played a specialist batsman and Kieswetter wore the gloves. All is not yet lost for Kieswetter, as he has already been included in the squad for the ODI series in New Zealand next month. But Buttler now has the chance to stake his claim for the position before a third contender, Jonny Bairstow, rejoins the squad in New Zealand. Bairstow had also been selected for the India series but withdrew for personal reasons and he will now link up with the squad in Auckland next week ahead of a three-match Twenty20 series. England&apos;s national selector Geoff Miller has confirmed that he will name a 15-man squad for the three-Test series in New Zealand that follows the Twenty20 and ODI fixtures on Thursday. England will also add one more seamer to the squad that they have already selected for the ODI series \u2013 Ashley Giles, the one-day coach, wanted to delay that decision until he saw how Jade Dernbach, Stuart Meaker and Chris Woakes performed on this tour. So far Dernbach has played in all three games but proved expensive, Woakes made one appearance in Kochi when Tim Bresnan was injured and Meaker has yet to play a game. Steve Finn, who was hit on the finger in fielding practice on Monday, removed any doubts about his fitness for the Chandigarh fixture, which England must win to keep the series alive, when he bowled and batted in the nets. Virat Kohli became the first India player to admit there are doubts about whether the last game of the series scheduled for the Himalayan hill station of Dharamsala on Sunday will even go ahead. The temperature is not forecast to rise above freezing point until the scheduled start at 9am raising major questions about whether the ground will be playable. However there is no question of it being switched to another venue \u2013 most obviously playing a second match in Chandigarh \u2013 at this late stage. &quot;It&apos;s not certain we&apos;re going to have a game in Dharamsala, so this game becomes even more important,&quot; said Kohli. He also confirmed that Yuvraj Singh, a Punjabi who spent his formative years in Chandigarh before moving to Mumbai as a teenager, is relishing this return to home turf in Mohali, just as MS Dhoni was the star of the show in his home city of Ranchi last weekend. Yuvraj has mixed memories of Mohali, having suffered a serious knee injury in a practice session in 2006 but Kohli said: &quot;He&apos;s always really glad to be here.

Coming close to tears in front of a hostile media, she vehemently denied gamesmanship and claimed a rib injury that had troubled her for two days flared in the sixth game of the second set, restricting her breathing. After dropping serve then blowing five match points at 5-4, she rushed from the court to have a rib &quot;unlocked&quot; so she could breathe more freely and to ease back pain that, she said, had given her a panic attack on court. &quot;I had to unlock my rib, which was causing my back problem,&quot; she said. &quot;The trainer said: &apos;We have to go off court to treat that.&apos; I didn&apos;t really want to take off my dress on the court. I had been struggling a little bit throughout the whole match and it just kept getting worse. &quot;I should have called the trainer a little bit before that, when I got to the point that I couldn&apos;t really breathe. The timing, yeah, it was my bad. The game before that when I lost my service game, it kept getting worse. I thought I would have to play through it and keep calm. What can I do? Is it my fault the doctor took that long to evaluate?&quot; However, in the on-court television interview immediately after the match, the former British player Sam Smith asked her specifically why she had left the court and she prevaricated. With a restless crowd still buzzing about the incident, she said: &quot;I had nearly the worst choke of the year.&quot; She spoke of &quot;anxiety&quot; but did not mention a sore rib or being unable to breathe. She claimed this was the first time she had suffered such a problem and &quot;that was freaking me out, that I never felt something like that before.&quot; Agnieszka Radwanska, whom she beat in the quarter-finals here last year, complained after a match against her in Dubai last February that Azarenka had repeatedly hobbled and winced between rallies, although she recovered well enough to win the match. &quot;I was angry because I don&apos;t think this is the great image for the women&apos;s tennis, what was going on there,&quot; Radwanska said at the time. The Pole had also criticised her for grunting during the Australian Open a month earlier. Stephens, though, said the delay of nearly 10 minutes before she unsuccessfully served to stay in the match had not bothered her. &quot;I did lose the next game,&quot; she said, &quot;but I wouldn&apos;t say that&apos;s because of the medical timeout. I love Vika and we share the same agent. We actually are pretty good friends. I&apos;m sure I&apos;ll see her and we&apos;ll talk about it. I hope she wins the final. It&apos;s happened before. I&apos;ve had it in the last match, medical breaks, go to the bathroom, the whole showdown. It was just something else, but it didn&apos;t affect anything.&quot; The charitable interpretation of the young player&apos;s response was that she is relatively new to the tour and did not want to cause a fuss. She added: &quot;There&apos;s a certain thing in the locker room that tells you, like, if you take more than six a year or something that they&apos;ll start charging you. That&apos;s a good rule. But the whole time I&apos;ve been on the WTA Tour I&apos;ve never had a medical timeout, so I don&apos;t know how it feels. I don&apos;t know what they do. I don&apos;t even know what you say. Honestly, I don&apos;t even know how you would call the trainer to the court.&quot; Azarenka said she did not think the rules about timeouts were being abused generally. &quot;I&apos;m being really honest here. When I play and somebody takes a medical timeout, I don&apos;t doubt them.&quot; There was fevered discussion among commentators and journalists, and there was little consensus. Some point blank did not believe her, others were less sure. &quot;There were two ways she could respond,&quot; the former world No1 Lleyton Hewitt said later on the host broadcaster Channel7, &quot;disappointment that people are questioning her morals, but she doesn&apos;t take a backward step on court and she could go out there and say: &apos;No, I&apos;m going to prove you all wrong and take the title.&apos;&quot; It was always asking a lot of Stephens to embarrass the best player in the world, Serena Williams, then back up in the Melbourne heat 24 hours later and do the same in her first (but surely not last) grand slam semi-final to the player officially rated No1, but now derided for gamesmanship. At the end, Stephens, who had shown her cool in handling a similar, and genuine, break against Williams the day before, pushed tentatively at a backhand, which slid long and wide. Stephens left the scene of her greatest triumph \u2013 and then curious defeat \u2013 waving to an audience who celebrated her departure with more fondness than they afforded the winner. Stephens played, as expected, with the fearlessness of youth, smiling through good patches and bad, but she struggled to recapture the killing power and consistency with which she had cut down the stricken Williams in three sets. The packed arena cheered her every winner \u2013 of which there were 14, nine on her devastating forehand, some of them superb, \u2013 and moaned at her 19 errors, forced or not. In the earlier match, on a day when the temperature on the main court flirted with the &quot;wet bulb&quot; cancellation reading, Li Na brought Maria Sharapova&apos;s gilded run here to an emphatic halt, winning 6-2, 6-2 in a little over an hour and a half. It was the Russian&apos;s longest stint in six matches, after having conceded a record low nine games to put herself within one win of a rematch for the title with Azarenka. It was an uneventful and disappointing conclusion to the Russian&apos;s tournament, after her seamless progress.", "title": "Victoria Azarenka defends controversial timeout at Australian Open", "sentences": ["She claimed this was the first time she had suffered such a problem and &quot;that was freaking me out, that I never felt something like that before.&quot; Agnieszka Radwanska, whom she beat in the quarter-finals here last year, complained after a match against her in Dubai last February that Azarenka had repeatedly hobbled and winced between rallies, although she recovered well enough to win the match."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-24T11:58:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jan/24/australian-open-diary-victoria-azarenka", "tags": ["Australian Open 2013", "Victoria Azarenka", "Australian Open", "Tennis", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "article": "On the WTA&apos;s 40th birthday, women&apos;s tennis could have done without the No1 player having to defend herself against accusations of gamesmanship to reach the final of the Australian Open. But that was the gory story in Melbourne on Thursday. Did the defending champion Victoria Azarenka really have to leave the court a set and 5-4 up for a medical timeout, having just dropped serve and looking vulnerable against the rampant young American Sloane Stephens? She says so. She says she thought she was &quot;having a heart attack&quot;, that she could hardly breath because of a rib injury. Except she failed to mention any such injury or physical inconvenience to Sam Smith in the on-court television interview immediately after her win \u2013 after she&apos;d returned to the court and, apparently fully recovered, finished Stephens off. Smith asked a simple question: &quot;You had a few difficulties out there. Can you tell us why you had to go off, and how are you?&quot; &quot;I almost did the choke of the year,&quot; she told Smith. &quot;So many chances \u2026 couldn&apos;t close it out. I just couldn&apos;t lose, that&apos;s why I was so upset.&quot; No heart attack. No rib injury. No breathing problem. She was fit enough after treatment to break the younger player&apos;s serve and book her place in the final, yet about 10 minutes earlier, she though she was &quot;having a heart attack&quot;. It did not go down well with the crowd. True or not, it didn&apos;t look right, something neither player was willing to accept later. The Belarusian, whose English is good, was more certain of her story in the 12-minute media grilling about two hours after the match, than she was earlier, when giving versions that did not exactly conflict but nor did they fit. And Stephens, with whom she shares an agent, said she had no problem with her friend leaving the court. Both maintained they were not aware that it might have looked bad \u2013 even though questionable use of the timeouts has been an issue in the game for some time. Azarenka claimed to be blithely unaware that what she did appeared to everyone but her (and to Stephens) to be, well, cheating. So, that&apos;s all hunky dory, then. Except it&apos;s not. The hanging committee in the press conference pretty much did not believe a word she said. There were too many inconsistencies, too many convenient agreements between players sharing the same agent. But it&apos;s tough to accuse someone of outright lying on mere suspicion. My take, after examining tape of the last few games of the match, is that she was showing mild signs of discomfort, that there might have been a physical problem \u2013 but it hardly looked worse than the regular stress of any big match. Her first serves were still going in at 160kph-plus, her second sometimes dipping to 130kph, occasionally lower. Her movement, not exactly her strength, was OK, her shots solid \u2013 and her demeanour typically downbeat. Azarenka is not a smiling presence on court at the best of times. Her grunting is infamous \u2013 so is her theatrical behaviour. Agnieszka Radwanska, who lost to her here last year, complained subsequently about Azarenka&apos;s behaviour after their match in Dubai in February, when she recovered during rallies after hobbling about in the breaks, and went on to win. It was not a good look for the game, Radwanska said \u2013 and she had plenty of supporters. In Thursday&apos;s press conference, Azarenka was adamant nothing like this had happened before. Would Radwanska see it that way? The sequence of the incident in Melbourne was simple: after Stephens had saved five match points to get back to 4-5 down, Azarenka called for assistance from the trainer at courtside and, a few minutes later, left for a medical timeout. Stephens, meanwhile, sat motionless in her chair and stared straight ahead, unblinking for fully 30 seconds, staying &quot;in the zone&quot;, as they say. Later, she said the break, four minutes longer than the mandated five, had not bothered her. They were friends, they shared the same agent, she would have a chat with her later and she hoped she would go on and win the final. The issue, though, is not one for Stephens or Azarenka to resolve, but those who allow star players, so central to the game&apos;s finances, to stretch the timeout and exploit the system to their advantage, especially against inexperienced or timid opponents. Stephens admitted later she had never taken a medical timeout and would not know how to if she had to. Blas\u00e9 or ignorant? Azarenka said she could have taken two five-minute timeouts, as her knee hurt too. So that&apos;s all right, then. She just took a five-minute break and stretched it to nine. An opponent a little more distant from her than 19-year-old Stephens obviously is \u2013 Li Na in the final, for instance \u2013 might not be so understanding, might not take kindly to having their momentum so rudely interrupted at such a crucial point in a big match. In fact, Stephens did herself no favours with such a meek response. If she were more aware, more attuned to playing it hard, she would have wanted Azarenka back on court as quickly as possible so she could capitalise on her weakness. Radwanska would have been livid. Professional sport is a tough, tough place. It is not somewhere to hide, however rich and important the key players are to its financial success. Footballers are constantly ridiculed for getting away with crimes and misdemeanours on and off the pitch that ordinary citizens would be prosecuted for. These millionaire athletes are all well remunerated. They should also be well policed. Today in Melbourne, Azarenka got away with something. We are still not sure what. We wish her a full recovery. Her opponent let her off the hook, and so did tennis. Why would she not do it again? ON THE LIGHTER SIDE ... The Australian Open website has collected some cute and not so cute moments from the tournament. Here are a few to treasure on a cold winter&apos;s night: 1) Jerzy Janowicz&apos;s absolutely top-of-the-range, Jeff Tarango Commemorative Medal-winning rant; Sam Stosur wrapping up the Greg Norman Cup. Do try this at home. It&apos;s easy; And, sorry Sam, gotta play it again (it wasn&apos;t all bad, by the way).

Accounts of the dispute vary. The islanders say the Berkeley-based conservation group failed to pay them, as agreed, for stopping the traditional hunt. Earth Island says the slaughter was the work of a &quot;renegade group&quot; trying to sabotage conservation work. What is clear, however, is that a misunderstanding between the villagers and Earth Island has resulted in one of the worst cases of dolphin slaughter in the Solomon Islands for some time, and delivered a huge setback to conservation efforts in a world &quot;hot spot&quot; for the dolphin trade. The Solomon Islands were notorious among conservationists as a source of live dolphins for sea aquariums in China and Dubai. A captive dolphin sells for up to $150,000. &quot;We are very very disappointed,&quot; said David Phillips, who oversees international dolphin protection efforts for Earth Island. &quot;This is a tragedy. It&apos;s bad for dolphins. It&apos;s bad for the community. It&apos;s bad for the Solomon Islands as a nation to have this blot on the record.&quot; Earth Island had been working with islanders of Malaita for two years to try to stop the hunt. The islanders&apos; account, which was aired by Australian broadcasting, accused the conservation group of failing to live up to a deal to pay up to $400,000 to people in the village of Fanalei, to stop the dolphin hunt. The villagers said they received barely a third of the promised funds before the money dried up. Atkin Fakaia, a community leader now living in the capital, Honiara, told Radio Australia the disillusioned Fanalei villagers had gone back to hunting when the money did not come in. &quot;The issue of them going back fishing for and killing dolphins was on the understanding that Earth Island had been reluctant to pay the agreed amount that was due to the community,&quot; he said. &quot;They were just disappointed and dissatisfied over the attitude of Earth Island.&quot; Phillips said the causes of the dispute were far more complicated \u2013 although he did not dispute the charge villagers in Fanalei had not seen the money they were expecting. Under the agreement, funds were supposed to be paid out as small grants for community projects in the village, and for income generating efforts. However, Phillips said villagers living in the capital had seized control of the funds, and had not distributed the money. &quot;The renegade group grabbed funds that were supposed to go to the community and that resulted in a lot of the discord,&quot; he said. &quot;In our view there are proper charges of corruption in what has happened in the community.&quot;  Phillips said the conservation group was still working with two other villages on the island, and hoped to resolve the dispute with the people of Fanalei.

There, bobbing up and down, lashed to a floating dock, was the white dual-engine DeHavilland Twin Otter, on its tail a phantasmagoric mural depicting the supposed sights of Sri Lanka: leopards, giant squid, elephants and whales. Seeing the plane floating on two giant pontoons, its wings set on top of a fuselage that holds 15 passengers, I\u00a0was transported back to a time when air travel was still an adventure, when stepping onto a plane amid the uproar of whizzing propellers felt intrepid. I&apos;d long wanted to visit Sri\u00a0Lanka&apos;s hills, though driving from Colombo up to Kandy and then on to Nuwara Eliya \u2013 while an exciting experience \u2013 can eat away at your itinerary. That&apos;s why, on a recent trip, I decided to see the country from the sky, by opting to take SriLankan Air Taxi, a little-known seaplane service that, for the price of a hire car, plies routes from Colombo to the coastal towns of Galle and Tangalle, as well as the hill towns of Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, and Dambulla, famous for its cave temple complex. SriLankan Airlines&apos; seaplane service was set up in 2004 but was promptly suspended due to the country&apos;s protracted civil war, which finally ended in 2009. The service was re-launched last year but its existence is still under the radar. It has only been possible to book online since June 2012. The ceasefire has been a boon to domestic air travel. It is now possible to fly from Colombo to Jaffna in a Cessna operated by ExpoAir (expoavi.com) and another seaplane service, Cinnamon Air (cinnamonair.com), will be launched in early 2013. Over a piquant fish curry on the veranda of the painstakingly restored Amangalla hotel in the Dutch fort at Galle, I imagined life in wartime Ceylon, having read about Sri Lanka&apos;s seaplane legacy and Leonard Birchall, the Canadian second world war pilot remembered as the &quot;saviour of Ceylon&quot;. After taking off from Koggala lake, about nine miles east of Galle in a Catalina &quot;flying boat&quot; seaplane in 1942, Birchall spotted a &quot;black speck&quot; on the horizon, which turned out to be the Japanese fleet, the co-ordinates of which he radioed back to Colombo before being shot down (he survived).     The hotel dining room at Amangalla hotel. Photograph: ./Bloomberg    Today, Koggala is still a naval base, and doubles as a SriLankan Air Taxi runway. I took the morning flight to Colombo for \u00a340. The cabin was basic and unpressurised; the seatbelt was the only amenity. There was no cockpit door, so I was able to watch the captain and copilot manipulate the yoke, foot pedals and throttles. I could read the plane&apos;s instruments and feel the vibration of the propellers. The plane only needed about a quarter of a mile to take off. Rising off the water, we climbed steeply to 7,500ft and for most of the 45-minute journey followed the ribbon of the Colombo-Galle highway as it bisected paddy fields and palm oil plantations. I barely moved my eyes from the window, from which I could see hilltop Buddhist temples, mosques and cricket pitches. As we approached Colombo, the pilot banked the plane to the left and we followed the coast to one of SriLankan&apos;s two bases in the capital. Since landing a seaplane depends on water levels, currents and visibility, the air taxi&apos;s schedules are flexible, their bases changeable. Two more bases are being prepared, one downtown at Colombo Fort and another at the international airport. During the layover the pilot, Canadian George McBain, told me that, though run by SriLankan Airlines, the whole operation \u2013 the plane, the crews, the maintenance \u2013 have been leased from Kenn Borek Air, a Canada-based charter airline specialising in Twin Otters. Borek Air leases SriLankan the same planes that ply hunting and fishing lodges in western Canada and Alaska, and support Antarctic research missions. &quot;The Twin Otter is fun to fly,&quot; McBain said. &quot;It can go anywhere. There is no other plane in the world that can fly where it goes. It can fly in the open oceans in the Maldives, land on riverbeds, frozen water, glaciers. And you can&apos;t see anything from a jet. At 5,000 or 10,000 feet, I have stuff to look at all day long.&quot;     Fly into the heart of Kandy. Photograph: Getty Images    We flew to Kandy from the Peliyagoda base, which is at an elbow in the river Kelani in a suburb of Colombo. Its dock is leased from a Buddhist temple, its terminal comprised of a collection red plastic chairs. I spun the giant prayer wheels under the gaze of a statue of a standing Buddha as five passengers checked in, posed for pictures on the dock and inspected the plane. As we flew north-east from Colombo towards the hills, we passed in and out of clouds, the plane skating gently on the wind. Passengers took photographs of waterfalls, plantation houses, still more temples and cricket pitches. At Kandy, we descended between the trees lining a dammed segment of the Mohaweli river. There were about 50\u00a0locals by the dock waiting for the plane to land, taking pictures on their mobile phones. After disembarking, Saleh al-Estry, an Omani tourist who was on my flight, called the journey &quot;fantastic&quot;. He said he clicked the seaplane icon on the SriLankan website by chance. &quot;I saw there was a seaplane and thought, &apos;I should try this&apos;,&quot; he said. &quot;The funny thing is, in Colombo nobody knows about this. Even the guy in my hotel had never heard of it.&quot; After a walk around Kandy lake and a tour of the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic, which supposedly houses one of the Buddha&apos;s teeth, I boarded a\u00a0train for the former British redoubt of Nuwara Eliya, Sri Lanka&apos;s best-known hill station. For three hours we wound through the jungle and tea plantations I&apos;d seen from the air and at station stops I bought sweet coconuts and wadi (fried savory snacks with chilli chutney) through the\u00a0window. After a night at the Hill Club, a rambling colonial pile where guests are served seafood thermidor in a formal dining room by white-gloved waiters, I embarked on the flight from lake Gregory back to Colombo. Seaplane travel now felt routine. In the air I thought of all the remote places I&apos;ve been that could be made less remote by Twin Otters, and thought with vertiginous dread of the inevitability of future long-distance journeys on pitted and perilous roads. Not in Sri Lanka, though. George McBain, the pilot, suspected he&apos;d see me again. &quot;A lot of passengers \u2013 the ones that we do have \u2013 are repeat passengers,&quot; he said.

Never is a holiday more needed than October half-term. But where to escape to find sun? The Maldives? &quot;Eye-watering expense!&quot; The Caribbean? &quot;And be hit by a hurricane?&quot; Oman was the ideal choice: perfect weather, an\u00a0eight-hour flight and four-hour time difference, with clear sea and clean air. Oman boasts a long coastline of empty beaches, an Arabian Grand Canyon, ancient forts, authentic souks, diving, no\u00a0waterparks \u2013 yet \u2013 but crystalline waterfalls and hundreds of miles of sand dunes, whipped up\u00a0like peaks of meringue, which you can slide down on bin-liners. Oman! Romantic and mysterious! One fancied that the allure of its mention at drop-off somehow rubbed\u00a0off on one. More adventurous and mysterious still, we were going away with school-gates friends Chris\u00a0and Lucille. Our kids, who demographically matched each other \u2013 girls, aged six; boys, aged\u00a0eight \u2013 are at different schools now, but the\u00a0bonds formed at the nursery gates had stuck\u00a0like glue. When I was late, Chris and Lucille would be later. When a snowball landed down my neck, they hurled it. They were infinitely more childish than me but, best of all, the blight of competitive parenting was not an issue since it was clear that we were all as bad as each other. My lot had been to Oman before, on a\u00a0glamping trip to the Empty Quarter. We slept like nomads in camel-hair tents, dined by starlight in the immense empty silence of the desert. This time, though, we were all stressed out and wanted to go to a hotel \u2013 the sort of place where they have flushing toilets and ceilings that aren&apos;t hairy. We wanted a\u00a0short hop from the plane, and then a week of chilling out. Muscat was our choice. The city has only a\u00a0handful of posh hotels \u2013 more are on their way \u2013 but a burgeoning bar and restaurant scene that warrants its own edition of Time Out. We decided on the glamorous Al Bustan Palace. The website showed a handsome man in robes galloping along a white beach on a horse with rugged, ochre-hued mountains in the background. It was a done deal. Holidaying with untried travelling companions is always a worry \u2013 might hideous defects and ugly conflicts emerge, wrecking the friendship? But from the first disorganised airport meet, it was clear our styles were in sync. As we all agreed, there are huge advantages to arriving late at airports, not least avoiding check-in queues, especially useful since we were travelling during the busy festival of Eid. The downside was that Oman serves alcohol to tourists in hotels except during religious festivals, which meant that it was a terrible scramble to get our duty free \u2013 though, on the plus side, for the children to hear their names in the &quot;last remaining passenger call&quot; was practically like being on The X Factor. The overnight flight was relaxing and the charm of Oman immediately obvious. There is a grace about the Omanis, pleasant, but not obsequious, with an elegant calm that, even at Muscat passport control, one fancied was already beginning to rub off on one. Unfortunately, however, just as the formalities were completed, I noticed my children sitting on\u00a0the floor tucking into their snack of bacon-wrapped chipolatas \u2013 pork being, of course, an insult to the waiting Muslims. Horrified at having\u00a0offended local sensibilities so soon, I\u00a0panicked and bustled the passports, sausages and confused children into what I thought was the exit but, to the consternation of the immigration officials, was actually the detention/deportation area.     Muscat: 'Eventually becoming ashamed at not moving an inch, we managed to hit up the souk.' Photograph: Clint McLean for the Guardian    This sense of not quite matching up to the elegance of one&apos;s host nation lingered throughout the trip. The drive from the airport followed the red rock coastline past the low-rise buildings of the capital and out through whitewashed villages. We wound round a pass in the hills, down through\u00a0an area of grand government buildings, and came upon our Palace, once a government building used\u00a0for hospitality. (I had my hair blow-dried for the photoshoot and the hairdresser, who&apos;d been there since the old days, told me he&apos;d also done the hair of Hillary Clinton and Tony\u00a0Blair!) An octagonal monolith, the Al Bustan\u00a0sits in rural\u00a0splendour on its own white sandy beach, surrounded by\u00a0gracious lawns and palm groves. As we entered the hotel lobby, we felt like a\u00a0gaggle of dishevelled tinkers turning up at a\u00a0royal wedding. The majestic atrium soared, five\u00a0storeys high, marbled, gilded, with the sort of\u00a0giant chandelier that could flatten a multitude, were it to fall. The tinkling of a piano and the smell of incense filled the air, as men in white robes glided as if on wheels, and we were greeted with mysterious drinks and ice-cold face cloths. Trying to avoid the pristine white jellabas of our fellow lift passengers, we were escorted down\u00a0to our ground-floor rooms. On first view, they were classic posh Ritz-Carlton: huge beds, plump armchairs, hair-free ceilings. But there was\u00a0a hidden excitement. The patio doors revealed a\u00a0private deck right on the edge of a\u00a0lagoon pool. The children were beside themselves. There were palm-tree islands to hide behind and underwater sun loungers that turned into Jacuzzis at the touch of a button. At first we were alarmed \u2013 some of the underwater edges were a bit sharp \u2013 but soon we were too relaxed to worry. Lounging on the deck was like being at the penguin enclosure at the zoo. You could watch the children through the glass fence, and every so\u00a0often chuck them a fish or something. The first two days were a frenzy of activity. We\u00a0swam in a sea as warm, sandy-bottomed and shallow as we were. We kayaked. We played tennis. We played ping-pong. We played crocodiles in the lagoon. This was followed by a\u00a0four-day frenzy of inactivity, when the grown-ups wanted only to lounge and say how lovely it all was. There wasn&apos;t so much a kids&apos; club where you could abandon your children, more a\u00a0schedule of\u00a0activities that generally needed one of us around. But abandonment wasn&apos;t our plan, and we took it in turns to throw fish and sun-lounge among the palms. The Al Bustan was at its most beautiful at night.\u00a0Flaming torches lit the pathways, fountains came on and the stairs were lined with fairy lights. At breakfast we would eat in the excellent buffet, where the kids eschewed healthy options for piles of sugar doughnuts and Nutella-smeared waffles. But at night it was time for the glamorous feet-in-the sand restaurant. The outdoor bar area had comfy sofas, the food was divine, and the whole scene was lit by decorative glowing golden orbs on the sand \u2013 the sort of glowing decorative orbs that are irresistible to.... &quot;Go ahead: they cost $700 each,&quot; said the smiling waiter, with the sort of hopelessly mixed message we were so practised at giving the children ourselves. We looked on horrified as one of the $700 orbs rolled into the sea and the kids discovered you could change the colour. Suddenly, in place of the gentle orange glow, the diners were hit by glaring red and luminous green orbs, now the centre of contretemps over who had which colour. But actually the Al Bustan really is kid-friendly. It was we, not they, who decreed the orbs must be banned. The next night, the children wistfully eyed the forbidden orbs, only to leap up with, &quot;It&apos;s not fair!&quot; when a rival band of embarrassing children starting changing the colours, squabbling and rolling them into the sea. One of the traits we all share is that we fancy ourselves as adventure travellers. Eventually becoming ashamed at not moving an inch from the Palace, we managed to hit up the souk and, on\u00a0the final night, mustered the energy for a dhow ride, an experience initially reminiscent of\u00a0being the last passengers on the plane at Gatwick\u2026 sorry, Heathrow. It proved very difficult to get everyone out of the lagoon pool at\u00a0once, so we ended up frantically driving wet children along the dockside like a herd of goats. But it was the highlight of the trip. We sailed off\u00a0into the sunset, marvelling at the stark beauty\u00a0of the coastline. The gentle rocking of the\u00a0boat, the turtles frolicking alongside and the\u00a0warm desert wind soothed us into exactly the\u00a0state of deep calm required to lurch back into\u00a0pick-ups and drop-offs. It had been a dreamy\u00a0holiday. And the risk of travelling with school-gates friends? Chris and Lucille were easygoing, straightforward, adventurous, kind, great parents\u00a0and great fun. I&apos;d go away with them again in a heartbeat. How was it for you? Chris Hallatt Wells     Helen, Chris and the children on the beach.

It began at the airport where my party arrived uncharacteristically early:\u00a0the &quot;Now Boarding&quot; sign had only just been\u00a0switched on. Then my phone pinged. It was a text from Helen: &quot;Yayy! We&apos;re all packed and on our way. Is it Gatwick Sth or Nth?&quot; &quot;It&apos;s Heathrow Terminal 3, Helen.&quot; &quot;Oh shit!&quot; We just made the plane. It was the first of many near-misses \u2013 taxis to the airport home, a\u00a0dhow ride along the coast \u2013 that gave an added adrenaline rush to the whole experience. Oman must be the most beautiful country in the Middle East. Ancient culture is everywhere. We visited the Muttrah souk and it was great \u2013 until the children found a\u00a0gift shop selling awful tourist tat: genuine Omani daggers made in Egypt, stuffed camels. It was then that the only potential flashpoint arrived. The\u00a0adults had agreed to give the children the same pocket money, but missed the crucial\u00a0step\u00a0of\u00a0agreeing how much. My approach\u00a0to the gift shop scenario is to say, &quot;No&quot;\u00a0and then be nagged\u00a0into conceding a minuscule\u00a0budget. Helen\u00a0is nicer. &quot;It&apos;s not\u00a0fair!&quot; mine\u00a0were saying, and I\u00a0could see\u00a0their point. Fortunately there was a\u00a0simple solution. We had got the exchange rate wrong. It\u00a0was a\u00a0win-win-win situation. The\u00a0children got their tat. The shopkeeper was so happy, he threw\u00a0in a\u00a0free postcard. And we grown-ups felt generous and thrifty until we realised what we&apos;d done: \u00a370 for a pair of lethal swords, which wouldn&apos;t fit in\u00a0the\u00a0suitcase!. But, overpriced weapons aside, it was a fantastic trip: gorgeous hotel, lots of fun, no\u00a0rows, and a pleasing sense of triumph at returning with the same number of children we\u00a0set off with. If Helen needs travel companions again, we&apos;re there. Although no doubt she&apos;ll be at a different airport at the wrong time. \u2022 The party travelled with Virgin Holidays.

Plus a fair degree of terror. I&apos;ve\u00a0always thought it a great loss to this country,\u00a0for example, that Emma, my daughter, is not home secretary, head of Scotland Yard and\u00a0the forensic expert on Silent Witness. In anyone&apos;s book we are not ideal travel companions. Let us count the ways: I like flying first class, preferably British Airways, which is not much different from spending a day in intensive care at the London Clinic. There is a\u00a0particular bonus at Gatwick, where Bob from special services always takes me to the aircraft last and does so in his trusty little white car. This is not only hassle-free but has the added advantage of pissing off the rest of the passengers at the front of the plane. Believe me, I&apos;ve done my time travelling the world in cramped conditions and carrying my own luggage. Now my leisure is summers in the south of France or the Hamptons, walking in Connemara, and year-round shopping in Manhattan and Paris. Emma, on the other hand, sees anywhere other\u00a0than the back of the plane as an unnecessary extravagance. She commutes zoo\u00a0class between London and New York with two small babies without blinking. She also has\u00a0an unhealthy appetite for dangerous sports.\u00a0She hunts, kayaks, skydives, leaps off cliffs to paraglide with eagles and so on. Last year\u00a0she crossed the world presenting a travel series for Channel 5 called Heaven On Earth. The\u00a0only small but satisfying chink in her otherwise uncompromising position of woman of\u00a0the people was to note that in almost all locations she\u00a0was wearing outfits borrowed from her mother. And so to our trip, organised to reflect our differences and in a country well off my radar: Sri Lanka. First at a &quot;luxury spa&quot;, then somewhere unpromisingly called the Mud House. Typically, I arrive at Gatwick at exactly the hour Emma books her car to leave for the airport. Her carry-on luggage is a wheelie I threw out a\u00a0decade ago. Although throwing out in our family is a\u00a0loose term since Emma&apos;s need to go through waste bins and retrieve half the contents is legendary. I&apos;ve never flown Emirates before, but I&apos;d concede that business class is hardly a burden. Except to say in first class it&apos;s only ever a delight for the cabin crew to bring you your on-board luggage as often as you wish. In business, an ungracious daughter huffs and puffs, making heavy weather of hauling down my suitcase a\u00a0couple of times after we&apos;re airborne. Whatever class of transport, no woman is entirely sane following more than 14 hours of travel, including a change at Dubai. By Colombo, the Sri Lankan capital, once we&apos;re through immigration, have dodged the dozens of locals inexplicably trying to sell us washing machines and have collected our luggage, I&apos;m well past my best. In the circumstances, it&apos;s unhelpful of Emma to stand behind me barking orders while I\u00a0take money from the ATM. The public spat that follows is made worse by our driver placing a\u00a0ridiculous garland of bright flowers around my neck as a greeting. The journey south to Wadduwa through the morning rush hour is foul. Think three hours of dust, potholes, crazy traffic, endless beeping of horns and no obvious signs of a highway code. The Reef Villa &amp; Spa, run by Brendan and Bernadette, is undoubtedly charming. Sadly, the weather falters between rain, overcast skies and bursts of sunshine. Even more distressing, the Guardian had decided that one room with a small double bed, albeit in the hotel&apos;s finest suite, would suffice. Brendan sweetly offers to install a second four-poster. I suggest a child&apos;s bed including mini mosquito net will be fine for Emma. Do you think I ever hear the end of this? Again, it is hardly Brendan&apos;s fault that the solar panelling directly above Emma&apos;s cot comes to grief and she spends two days lying next to a blue plastic bucket.     The Reef Villa & Spa: 'There's nothing to do,' says Anne Robinson. Photograph: Angelo Samarawickrema for the Guardian    The Reef&apos;s spa turns out to be one small Sri Lankan, offering massage and manicures \u2013 as long as I don&apos;t want colour. He&apos;s not very good at colour, he says. We try yoga with a beautifully calm instructor whose omming is so deep that I\u00a0keep opening an eye to check the noise is her and not the hooting of a train on the track outside. That&apos;s the point about Sri Lanka \u2013 outside\u00a0is another land of noise, badly beaten paths and rotting debris. In contrast, the Reef, with only seven bedrooms, is all about stillness. Not one of my hobbies. The rest of the guests are mainly quietly spoken, middle-aged Brits dressed much as I imagine Nigel Farage and his Ukip supporters might in a tropical climate. There&apos;s nothing to do except chill and read. Oh, and eat. Unfortunately, I like only plain food. I\u00a0loathe Thai food, Indian food, Vietnamese food \u2013 in fact, anything Asian and spicy. The smell of coriander makes me throw up. So the daughter airily ordering a Sri Lankan curry breakfast can\u00a0reasonably be described as mother abuse. There&apos;s the nub of it. Grown-up daughters, once\u00a0they have babies, cease to distinguish between their small charges and their mother. &quot;Focus, look down, down, down. Now see the bolt,&quot; she instructs one afternoon when I fail to open a door quickly enough. At least the mosquitoes \u2013 an accepted part of life in this country \u2013 suffer even worse than me under Emma&apos;s watch. In fact, should you be considering a trip to Sri Lanka, now is a good time since, thanks to Emma&apos;s murder mission, the population has considerably decreased in the last month. It&apos;s the mosquitoes that decide for us that a visit to the Mud House, sleeping outside with no electricity, is beyond our skill sets. Instead, I book us into one of the five-star hotels in the capital, Cinnamon Lakeside, where we can busy ourselves in the seven restaurants, the Balinese spa, the beauty salon and the navy blue-bottomed outdoor pool. But no. Emma insists we explore in a tuk-tuk taxi, a sewing machine with a\u00a0hood and no visible signs of protection. The rides are nothing short of terrifying. Tuk-tuk drivers can be bargained down, never have any change and the messing around in the scorching heat in order to find the right money is ridiculous given the line of air-conditioned limos waiting to be hired outside the hotel. Shopping with Emma is always an endurance test. Choosing a cabbage takes her a fortnight. We&apos;re hours in an admittedly wonderful emporium called Barefoot, an oasis along the main Galle Road, while she dithers and changes her mind. In another too-long outing to a mall in\u00a0the Old Dutch Hospital, our driver narrowly misses a dog, which already has only three legs. On our final night, again in a perilous tuk-tuk, we make it to the Liberty cinema to see the new Tom Cruise movie. Sri Lankan cinemas are small and the start time very approximate. Actually, the\u00a0whole experience is not dissimilar to a drive in a tuk-tuk, since the audience tends to come and go randomly, with the ones behind yanking our seats back and forth to make their exit. Foolishly, a woman nearby takes a\u00a0telephone call.\u00a0Inspector Emma naturally turns and delivers\u00a0a lecture on good manners. The woman,\u00a0duly shamed, takes herself off, yanking my seat another half-dozen times between coming and going. Did we enjoy our trip? Do I mind that Emma thinks I urghh and arrgh at every corner? Does it\u00a0matter that she treats me like a child? And that, while her trusty striped holiday bag manages to contain every possible emergency item \u2013 fountain pen, ink cartridges, sewing kit, mosquito deterrent, notebook, plastic spoon, chopsticks, sugar, salt, pepper, paper clips, headache pills, rotting food \u2013 these are only grudgingly handed out? Like my grandsons, I am allowed only half a\u00a0paper tissue at a time. Do I despair, when I&apos;ve\u00a0spoken sharply to a British businessman thoughtlessly standing in our way as we struggle to our row on the flight home and she feels the need to apologise? &quot;I&apos;m just here to say sorry after she&apos;s been rude. It&apos;s a full-time job.&quot; Yes, to the first question. No, of course, to the\u00a0rest. She makes me roar with laughter. I\u00a0adore\u00a0her company. Every mother and daughter\u00a0should make time for a trip together. It&apos;s\u00a0good for the soul. How was it for you? Emma Wilson     Anne and Emma: 'I\u2019ve been filmed in a cage with great white sharks. Being confined with my mother is more daunting.' Photograph: Angelo Samarawickrema     Travelling with my mother is not for the faint-hearted. As far as she&apos;s concerned, being in business class with a glass of champagne before takeoff and a fluffy white mattress that reclines to a bed is slumming it. Not me. I&apos;ve two babies, 17 months apart. I barely pee alone. Fourteen hours trapped in these conditions is utter bliss. We are greeted at Colombo with garlands of orchids. We&apos;re not very appreciative \u2013 too busy trying to negotiate the ATM. Mrs Don&apos;t-talk-to-me-I&apos;m-concentrating manages to extract 400 rupees, roughly two quid. We motor down the south-west coast to the sanctuary of Reef Villa. This is low-key to the nth degree. Colonial suites surrounded by tranquil ponds are a throwback to the days of Ceylon. There&apos;s a pink giant gourami fish called Rosemary, but she&apos;s pretty darned quiet. An iguana strolls across the garden, the equivalent of rush hour. I&apos;ve been filmed in a cage with great white sharks, but being confined in a suite with my mother is a more daunting prospect. Six days of rain doesn&apos;t help. There&apos;s no chance she&apos;ll be looking at temples or tea tasting \u2013 not unless Coco Chanel serves the Pekoe. This trip will require a\u00a0woman who doesn&apos;t do &quot;downtime&quot; to embrace nothingness; sitting, reading and, of course, the spa. But by day three she&apos;s spa&apos;d out. The young lad makes a fatal error. &quot;When did you last have a\u00a0facial? Your skin is very dry,&quot; he says. &quot;No, it&apos;s not. Just get on with it.&quot; Similar charm is unleashed on the yoga instructor. &quot;I&apos;m old. Very, very old,&quot; she snaps, as if it&apos;s the girl&apos;s fault. It&apos;s a 90-minute session of eye exercises and neck stretches. No threat of breaking into a sweat. She bails on the second session. I&apos;m given a rigorous workout. It&apos;s painful to laugh for the rest of the stay. In the mornings, we sip coffee on her balcony. &quot;Did you know these mosquito bands you bought are for children?&quot; No, but I do find she&apos;s a child at times. &quot;Make that bird go away.&quot; &quot;I can&apos;t open my water bottle.&quot; &quot;Emma, tell the man to leave me alone.&quot; &quot;Am I in the shade?&quot; You&apos;d think a woman who&apos;s travelled through China with Thatcher and Cuba with Castro would know if she was in the sun. The food is exceptional and the Sinhalese people are beyond gracious and gentle. I slowly work my way through the cocktail list, but I\u00a0can&apos;t keep up with her Diet Coke habit. At dinner there&apos;s a young London spark who&apos;s yet to put down his iPhone. His redheaded girlfriend watches him or reads To Kill A Mocking Bird. He&apos;s lucky. We carrot-tops debate whether we&apos;d stab him with a fork or throw the mobile in the pool. We play Scrabble. It&apos;s utterly humiliating \u2013 46\u00a0on a\u00a0triple, using all letters: another 50 points. Come on! We&apos;re both wired to win. At least I can thrash her at table tennis. In Wadduwa, the market isn&apos;t geared to outsiders. I buy an apple cutter, Tigger mugs, jigsaws and a child&apos;s cricket bat: total \u00a32.95. Have I mentioned my cot has been displaced by a blue bucket? I\u00a0might be over 40, but this arrangement makes me feel like Edie from Grey Gardens. &quot;If you&apos;ve such a difficult relationship, why go away together?&quot; Brendan asks, missing the nuance. Our relationship isn&apos;t difficult. She is difficult. We&apos;re as loving as any mother and daughter, with occasional sparks. She calls me &quot;tricky&quot;. I find this rich. She hates spicy, loathes coriander \u2013 we&apos;re in her eating hell. In Colombo, where she eats chocolates for breakfast, cake for lunch and pastries for supper, I buy her a bag of oranges. She rolls her eyes and beelines for the mini-bar nibbles. I explore Fose market alone. There&apos;s a limit to what I can make her endure. Even so, I suspect my mother secretly enjoys the buzz of street life. &quot;Go slower, Mr Tuk-Tuk!&quot; This, from a woman who lost her licence speeding. My Mary Poppins bag is a constant source of ridicule. (Babies have sanctioned my squirrelling ways \u2013 you never know when you may need half an avocado, a toothbrush, or clean socks.) But she has no qualms asking for a needle and thread, pen, mosquito wipe, map, measuring tape or water. And that&apos;s just the stuff she knows about. Cue shopping. We empty Barefoot. I\u00a0manage to spend more than her, which is impressive. She needs to sit down with an espresso and carrot cake to recover. Wild rabbits do not breed tame ones. \u2022 Emma Wilson&apos;s trip was provided by Experience Travel Group and Emirates Airlines; Anne Robinson covered the cost of her trip.

The man whose al-Qaida-inspired Signed in Blood Battalion led the attack on the In Amenas gas plant in Algeria, in which at least 38 people were killed, was considered a relatively unimportant figure in the political ecosystem of the vast region. But Belmokhtar, who fought for the mujahideen in Afghanistan and the Islamist GIA in the Algerian civil war before becoming a commander in the Mali-based al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), was ambitious. In 2003 he masterminded the kidnapping of 32 European tourists whom he successfully ransomed. The money gave him the seed capital he needed to develop a sophisticated trading business throughout Saharan Africa, along the ancient 2,000-mile salt route used by the Tuareg tribesmen to transport goods from the continent&apos;s west coast through to Timbuktu in Mali, then on to Niger before arriving in the Algerian south, gateway to the Mediterranean. But while the Tuareg made their money in trading salt, gold and silk, Belmokhtar, who secured close links with the tribesmen through marriages to the daughters of several of their most prominent families, made a fortune through a different commodity: smuggled cigarettes. Such was the volume of his trade that he earned himself the sobriquet &quot;Mr Marlboro&quot;. &quot;He was not an important figure in AQIM, he was quite different from al-Qaida and Bin Laden,&quot; said Morten B\u00f8\u00e5s, a senior research fellow at Oslo University and editor of African Guerrillas: Raging Against the Machine. &quot;He is generally known as one of the more pragmatic figures, more interested in filling his own pockets than fighting jihad.&quot; The key role cigarettes play in facilitating terrorism has been inexplicably ignored. But it has become of urgent interest to western intelligence agencies as they seek to check al-Qaida&apos;s diverse factions operating across the Saharan region.     Source: UNODC 2009. Credit: Observer graphics    Indeed, after interviewing numerous agents and experts in the field, the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) has concluded that &quot;cigarette smuggling has provided the bulk of financing for AQIM&quot;. AQIM&apos;s affiliates include Ansar al-Sharia, an offshoot blamed for the killing of the American ambassador, Chris Stevens, in Benghazi, Libya, last year, and was thought to be behind threats last week that prompted the Foreign Office to urge Britons to leave the city. The total value of the illicit tobacco trade in north Africa is thought to exceed $1bn (\u00a3632m). The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates that Africans smoke 400bn cigarettes a year, of which 60bn are bought on the black market. However, five countries \u2013 Algeria, Egypt, Libya, Morocco and Tunisia \u2013 smoke 44% of Africa&apos;s cigarettes, and their black markets are significantly larger. More than three-quarters of all cigarettes smoked in Libya, for example, are illicit. Controlling the flow of contraband into these counties has triggered a turf war as Belmokhtar and other AQIM factions compete with each other, as well as with Tuareg tribes and corrupt army and government officials, in an attempt to &quot;own&quot; the trade. Some of the cigarettes transported across Saharan Africa are fakes produced in China and Vietnam. But most are genuine branded product, sourced through the Middle East and shipped through a multitude of countries via a Byzantine network of middle-men and companies, many in offshore tax havens. The cigarettes often enter west Africa through Ghana, Benin and Togo. A second route is via Guinea, where the supply, according to UNODC, vastly exceeds the country&apos;s demand. The cigarettes are then moved to Mali by road or by boat on the Niger river, where there is little risk of detection. A third distribution hub \u2013 for Senegal, Morocco and Algeria \u2013 is provided by Mauritania. In each case, Mr Marlboro and AQIM clean up, either by charging a &quot;tax&quot; for the safe passage of the cigarettes along the salt route, or facilitating their transport, using 4x4s, trucks, motorcycles and even bicycles. Often the smuggled products are not a premium western brand, such as Marlboro, but one of the cheaper, less prestigious marques that the tobacco giants are keen to introduce to developing nations as a way of gaining a foothold in their markets. Inevitably, the endemic smuggling of cigarettes in such countries has raised questions about the role played by big tobacco, and in particular the extent to which it should be made responsible for distribution routes being used to fill the coffers of some of the most dangerous terrorist groups in the world. Internal company memos show that in the 1980s British American Tobacco in Africa used a Liechtenstein-based company, Sorepex, as a key distributor. BAT documents reveal that the company saw Sorepex as a &quot;gravy train&quot; and a way of providing &quot;cover, albeit increasingly flimsy, for BAT in some fairly shady business&quot;. The company insists that it condemns all forms of smuggling. In 2002, RJ Reynolds, owner of the Winston brand, was accused by the EU of selling its products in Iraq in breach of embargoes. The cigarettes were allegedly smuggled into the country by the PKK (Kurdish Workers&apos; party), named by the American government as a terrorist group. Documents allegedly revealed that the cigarettes were transported from the US and shipped to Spain and then to Cyprus and Turkey before arriving in Iraq. The case is currently before a federal appeal court in the US. More recently, Japan Tobacco confirmed last year that it is being investigated by the EU amid claims it broke sanctions by shipping cigarettes to a firm linked to the Syrian regime. The company has denied any wrongdoing. Experts say that the profits provided by cigarette smuggling fuel other criminal activities, including drug, oil and human trafficking, activities which often use the same distribution networks. But cigarettes remain the most profitable and least risky form of contraband. As Louise Shelley, a crime expert at Washington&apos;s George Mason university, told the ICIJ: &quot;No one thinks that cigarette smuggling is too serious, so law enforcement agencies don&apos;t spend resources to go after it.&quot; This helps explain why terrorist groups exploit the illicit trade. According to the US Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, the IRA made as much as $100m between 1999 and 2004 by smuggling cigarettes into Northern Ireland. Hezbollah ran a successful smuggling operation in the US, shipping cigarettes from low-tax North Carolina to higher- tax Michigan. &quot;Tobacco smuggling is lucrative and widespread,&quot; said Deborah Arnott, chief executive of the charity Action on Smoking and Health. &quot;It helps to fund global terrorism and conflict, encourages corruption and remains a source of funds for some of the most repressive regimes in the world.&quot; Intelligence experts told the Observer that pushing illicit cigarettes into north Africa was at the &quot;low end&quot; of cigarette smuggling. The real money, they said, comes from shipping big-brand products back into Europe via Greece, Spain or sometimes Italy. So far, this is believed to be a small but growing market for the smugglers. While there is no suggestion that the tobacco giants are actively working with terrorist groups, monitoring where their products end up is extremely difficult. The companies&apos; use of well-connected middlemen makes tracing their cigarettes almost impossible. Documents shared with the Observer by intelligence experts show how one middleman, who regularly buys product from a major tobacco company, has a complex operation involving offices, warehouses and bank accounts in Cyprus, Brussels, Dubai, Malaysia, Egypt, Israel, Uruguay, Panama and Singapore that allows him to move cigarettes around the world without being traced. &quot;Those providing &apos;protection&apos; along the routes \u2013 often customs officers or security services, but in some instances &apos;terrorists&apos; \u2013 make good money for little or no work,&quot; said one intelligence expert who has worked in counter-smuggling operations. &quot;What&apos;s best for them is that the trade is either in US dollars or euros. It&apos;s hard currency into clean accounts which they can then use at their leisure to buy whatever they need.&quot; Experts want countries to ratify the international treaty on the illicit trade in tobacco that would force cigarette companies to monitor and trace the distribution of their products while conducting due diligence on their customers. &quot;The only way you can effectively police this is if the manufacturers accept legal responsibility for their products all along the chain of supply \u2013 that will force them to deal with reputable agents,&quot; said Eric LeGresley, a Canadian lawyer who has studied tobacco companies. Ironically, Belmokhtar may have been too successful at smuggling cigarettes. It is rumoured that late last year he was forced out of AQIM and his base in Mali after the organisation&apos;s leaders questioned his commitment to their cause. Mr Marlboro, they suggested, was more interested in money than ideals. The slaughter in the Sahara may have been Belmokhtar&apos;s grotesque attempt to prove them wrong, something that has huge consequences for his smuggling operations. &quot;His days as a smuggler are over,&quot; B\u00f8\u00e5s predicted. &quot;No bandits or traders will want to be within a kilometre of him now. They don&apos;t want to be targeted by American drones.&quot; But, given the money at stake, there will be no shortage of others ready to take his place. Tobacco and Terrorism The Taliban Across the tribal belt of Pakistan, Taliban militias collect money from cigarette smugglers in exchange for allowing counterfeit Marlboro and cheap local brands into Afghanistan and China. Cigarettes have become an increasingly important source of financing for the groups, second only to the heroin trade, according to Pakistani intelligence officials. The PKK Charges a fee for every container of cigarettes allowed to pass through its territory. Controlled the flow of contraband cigarettes into Iraq during the 1990s; now controls the flood of counterfeit cigarettes out of the same country.

An aide whispered that Kerry&apos;s flight home from Dubai had been delayed. No one knew that Kerry had traveled to Dubai, and no announcement was made afterward. All that is known, even unofficially, is that he was on a private diplomatic mission for President Obama. He has made many of these. In some parts of the world, especially in the volatile region that stretches from the Persian Gulf to Central Asia, Kerry is already a familiar figure in the corridors of power. He has also established an evidently strong working relationship with Obama. Even the fact that his friends in the Senate brutally crushed his main rival for the job, Susan Rice, who is one of Obama&apos;s close and trusted advisers, was not enough to sour the president on his nomination. One fundamental aspect of American foreign policy making will not change as Kerry takes over the job Hillary Clinton has held for the last four years. Major policy decisions will be made in the White House, not at the State Department \u2013 and the secretary of state may not even be in the room when they are made. Nonetheless, Kerry will be a key figure as the United States confronts the crises of the moment. His most encouraging credential is that he truly believes diplomacy is preferable to war \u2013 hardly a unanimous view in Washington. Whether this will result in a serious change in America&apos;s approach to the world, however, is far from certain. The first test will be Iran. Kerry is less prone than some others in Washington to throw around threats about war being an option that is &quot;on the table&quot;, and it is hard to imagine him blithely reminding Iranians, as Clinton did, that the United States has the power &quot;to totally obliterate them&quot;. Yet, the essence of American policy toward Iran \u2013 shaped around threats, sanctions, and demands that Iran submit to western power without expecting much in return \u2013 is unlikely to change. Kerry will also be unable, and quite possibly unwilling, to rein in the ever-expanding US drone war, which is not run by the State Department but feeds the anti-Americanism that will make his job ever more difficult. Nor is there much prospect that he will be able to calm the fundamentalist radicalism that is surging through Egypt, Syria, and Israel. The area in which Kerry may be able to have the greatest impact is redefining the meaning of national security for Americans. He recognizes that the main threats to the United States no longer come from foreign armies or what George W Bush liked to call &quot;evil-doers&quot;. His most encouraging statements are those that suggest he recognizes the enormous security challenges posed by climate change, global energy politics, and economic troubles at home. Kerry&apos;s greatest challenge may be persuading Americans that their long-term interests are best served by a less activist, more restrained foreign policy. Even if he believes this, which is unclear, he will find many in Washington still determined to try reshaping the world. Kerry himself has hardly been immune to the interventionist temptation. In 2011, he and Senator John McCain introduced a Senate resolution aimed \u2013 successfully, as it turned out \u2013 at pushing the Obama administration into military action in Libya. Kerry went so far as to argue that if the United States attacked Libya, &quot;our own security will be strengthened immeasurably.&quot; Like all military interventions, the one in Libya set off a cascade of unexpected consequences. The worst is the new crisis in Mali, which began after heavily-armed ethnic Tuaregs from the defeated Libyan army fled home to Mali, following the overthrow and killing of Muammar Gaddafi. Kerry&apos;s prediction that the Libya operation would strengthen American security now sounds like a tragic misjudgment. Kerry can hardly avoid realizing that he, McCain, and Obama helped create the grave crisis in Mali. Perhaps this realization will sober him. Just as likely, however, is that he will shrug it off as a bad call or a set of circumstances no one could have predicted, and continue on his interventionist way. The combination of Kerry at the State Department and Chuck Hagel as secretary of defense \u2013 presuming he is confirmed \u2013 opens intriguing possibilities. Perhaps one or the other will dare to suggest that the United States does not need more than 700 military bases around the world, or 50,000 soldiers in Germany, or 11 aircraft carrier groups when no other country has more than one, or staggeringly expensive weapons systems like the F-35 fighter jet. The United States has very few truly vital interests. It must defend its access to global sea lanes, assure that weapons of mass destruction are not used against the United States, and prevent wars elsewhere from spreading onto American soil. Very little beyond that is really worth fighting over. The world will soon find out whether Kerry agrees with this, or clings to a more expansive definition of &quot;vital interests&quot;. If he can persuade Americans that it is in their interest to do less in the world, he will be remembered as a truly transformational figure.", "title": "John Kerry and the restraint of American power in US foreign policy | Stephen Kinzer", "sentences": ["An aide whispered that Kerry&apos;s flight home from Dubai had been delayed.", "No one knew that Kerry had traveled to Dubai, and no announcement was made afterward."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-31T13:30:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2013/jan/31/migrants-fight-rights-moving", "tags": ["Migration and development", "Global development"], "article": "About 2,000 people with no legal papers have died trying to reach the US from Central America in the past 10 years. These deaths are usually due to exposure or dehydration \u2013 across the deserts of Arizona \u2013 but also drowning, for those who tried to cross rivers. More striking, however, are the tens of thousands who are kidnapped by criminal gangs and killed because they fail to pay a ransom. There are structural reasons for rising migration flows into the US. One is doubtless the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement, which caused the bankruptcy of many small-scale Mexican farmers, forcing them to leave and look for jobs in the US. In Europe, it is estimated that at least 20,000 people have drowned since 1990 trying to leave Africa and the Middle East across the Mediterranean, often fleeing conflicts. In these cases, the war against immigrants does not seem to stop at borders. Even when Africans succeed in reaching Europe, they face discrimination, exploitation and abuse \u2013 including xenophobic propaganda and racist attacks. Some of the worst stories, however, come from Asia. At Kathmandu airport, in Nepal, an average of two coffins arrive every day, bringing back the corpses of migrants who went to work in the Middle East or the Gulf. The authorities say they die in accidents, particularly on building sites or on the roads. But many are murdered by traffickers and many others, especially women, commit suicide because of sexual abuse and harassment. All these cases show that national migration policies have failed. They show the complete inadequacy of what is still a unilateral, temporary and often repressive approach to mobility. It should be clear by now that economic migration is not exceptional, but, increasingly, part of normal life, linked in particular to the demand for labour in advanced economies and to globalisation. Not only do migrants contribute significantly to the GDP of their own countries through remittances, but they are indispensable to the economies and societies of wealthier countries. In the US, studies have shown that immigrants generate public wealth in excess of their cost in the long term to state and federal services. On the other hand, the international community has failed to ensure that migration is managed realistically and co-ordinated globally. The UN treaties that try to regulate labour migration, and ensure safety and dignity along the route, have been ratified and implemented by a relatively small number of states, and rarely by richer receiving countries. The only alternative to further exploitation and violation of human rights is genuine grassroots organising by migrants, along with local workers and citizens. A new generation of migrant workers is revealing its potential for collective action, as many change from being passive victims of exploitation to conscious, social agents. Over the past few years, migrants have been more and more determined to assert their social and labour rights. From the building sites of Dubai where south-east Asian workers fought for fair wages and better living conditions, to Mexican farm labourers who joined the protests in the fields of California against immigration reform under George W Bush; from the sans papiers (without documentation) African cooks in the restaurants of Paris that demanded and obtained full regularisation, to Moroccan metalworkers who downed tools in Italian factories and took to the streets to protest against rampant xenophobia and discrimination. Immigrants are increasingly participating in local trade unions, and they are more inclined to organise and make demands than locals. Through these struggles, migrants not only promote their rights and push for reforms, but help reinvigorate local social movements. The protagonists of today&apos;s diasporas are more and more engaged in online activism and can create virtual communities, groups and networks, reaffirming feelings of transnational solidarity. Network relationships created by migrants and encouraged by technological tools such as Facebook, Twitter and Skype are effective for producing a response by social and labour movements against the widespread erosion of rights, which keeps producing exploitation and social insecurity almost everywhere, and for everyone.", "title": "Migrants fight for their rights as moving becomes part of normal life  | Vittorio Longhi", "sentences": ["From the building sites of Dubai where south-east Asian workers fought for fair wages and better living conditions, to Mexican farm labourers who joined the protests in the fields of California against immigration reform under George W Bush; from the sans papiers (without documentation) African cooks in the restaurants of Paris that demanded and obtained full regularisation, to Moroccan metalworkers who downed tools in Italian factories and took to the streets to protest against rampant xenophobia and discrimination."], "publicationDate": "2013-01-31T14:04:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/feb/01/adam-afriyies-adfero-churnalism", "tags": ["Media", "Adam Afriyie", "Politics", "Conservatives", "UK news", "Google", "Search engines", "Technology", "Internet"], "article": "This article is the subject of a legal complaint made on behalf of Axonn Media Ltd I spent just under 18 months working as a journalist for Adfero, &quot;the UK&apos;s leading dedicated online news provider&quot; and brainchild of Adam Afriyie, MP for Windsor and would-be leader of the Conservative party. It was easily the most stressful, bizarre and, at times, hilarious period of my life. The warning signs were there from my first morning on the job. I was encouraged by colleagues to enjoy lunch while it lasted because in the next couple of weeks I would get my full allocation of clients, which would make lunch breaks a thing of the past. The workload subsequently increased from writing 16 stories a day (which was barely manageable) to 25 within a couple of weeks. When I raised concerns with my manager about not being able to handle the amount of work being given to me I was told that the desk had to accommodate it somehow. With everyone else battling their own burden and unable to help, I was plunged headlong into a world of trying to produce 25-30 stories a day about double glazing, human resources, conservatories, holidays in Dubai, garden tools and \u2013 my personal favourite \u2013 white furniture. The job boiled down to scouring the internet for stories to rewrite such that they were tailored to a client and, most importantly, could include keywords that would boost search engine optimisation. By publishing this material on their websites, clients would, it was hoped, be given a leg up in the Google rankings. My team was made up of young, recent graduates whose Adfero adventure was, for many, their first employment since gaining a degree. We worked in a cramped office [see footnote] above a takeway where the smell of fast food would waft in on a regular basis, and when the internet was disconnected some of us worked in a coffee shop over the road. On another occasion the editor had to break into the office because workmen had accidently locked a door that no one else had a key for. You couldn&apos;t make it up. We often joked that it was like an out of control GCSE business project. The turnover of employees, who soon realised what the gig entailed, led to low morale \u2013 propped up by gallows humour and large quantities of caffeine. Alongside the desks of writers there was a dedicated team of researchers who tried their best to provide us with interviews that were general enough to be relevant to a wide range of subjects, but when things get as specific as white furniture \u2013 writers had to pad things out. I remember being so desperate for a white furniture story that I wrote a 160-word piece based solely on this picture of Martin Amis&apos;s writing room, which \u2013 thank the Lord \u2013 contained some white bookcases. The darkest day on the job was when I had to write 36 stories in order to meet my end-of-month target. I was in the office at 7am and at about 25 stories in, things started to get surreal. After a 10-minute lunch break I was looking down the barrel of my fifth story about holidays in Dubai. I couldn&apos;t find a thing. I&apos;d searched all the usual sources, but nothing \u2013 I was desperate. Then it happened. I found a story about Robert Mugabe being treated in a Dubai hospital. Quickly my brain put two and two together and made crazy: a piece about medical tourism in Dubai pegged to the Mugabe story. Job done! Thankfully my equally overworked subbing partner was more lucid, and reasoned with me before spiking the piece. But that was the kind of tenuous, content-farm churnalism that came from the tired minds of Adfero employees and was dished out to clients on a regular basis. If Afriyie thinks this is the right way to run a business God knows what he&apos;d do if in charge of the country. There is a strand within the Conservative party that can&apos;t help themselves when it comes to filling the internet with rubbish \u2013 whether it&apos;s former Tory MP Louise Mensch&apos;s Menshn, Afriyie&apos;s Adfero or Grant Shapps and his Michael Green internet marketing guru alter-ego. In the case of Adfero, it&apos;s the employees who suffer. After working so hard to get a degree they are then faced with a ridiculous workload, non-existent support and a work culture that means they know if they don&apos;t like it they can soon be replaced by another hopeful graduate. Before readying his leadership bid, perhaps Afriyie should get his own house in order. \u2022 Lanre Bakare worked at Adfero in Leeds for 15 months between April 2009 and July 2010.

Sources said investigating officers had as yet been unable to determine if McGeever&apos;s story was true or not. One Craughwell resident said most people in the village had never seen Mr McKeever in their lives as he lived in a mansion &quot;behind locked gates&quot;. &quot;We had no idea who he was until this week, I don&apos;t know anyone who knew of him,&quot; she said. &quot;Apparently there was a missing poster in the local garda station, but if a person who was a developer goes missing, people presume they are all living the high life. &quot;It&apos;s just the most bizarre thing ever. The mystery thickens.&quot; McGeever originally married in Australia decades ago. During the Celtic Tiger boom, McGeever ran an international property business selling luxury homes in Dubai to rich Irish and British clients. He is currently listed in legal proceedings before the high court in a case being taken against KMM Properties, which began in 2009. Before his ordeal, McGeever lived in a swish property that was christened &quot;Nirvana&quot;, and during the boom years of the Irish economy was estimated to be worth well over \u20ac3m. The two security gates decorated with stained-glass features guard the entrance. The property is surrounded by immaculately groomed lawns, a cobble-lock driveway, a separate guesthouse and a glasshouse. As part of his business selling luxury properties in the Gulf, McGeever set up an office on Mullingar&apos;s Ashe Road, where he had staff working for him. He also conducted property deals at the Mullingar Park Hotel, and those who encountered him took to calling him &quot;The Yank&quot; due to a pronounced American accent. McGeever&apos;s initials, KMM, were branded across a EC120 helicopter in which he travelled the country. When not taking to the air, he had a fleet of high-range vehicles to use \u2013 often with personalised number plates: a black SL55 AMG with tinted windows, a grey Porsche 911 GT2, and two H2 Hummers. Yet despite his wealth, the tycoon liked to mix with the locals, often drinking in a main street pub in Craughwell in County Galway not far from his mansion. McGeever is the first multi-millionaire to have been kidnapped in the Irish Republic for many years. In the 1970s and 80s the Provisional IRA pioneered the strategy of kidnapping wealthy businessmen to raise finances from ransoms. In 1983, the IRA kidnapped supermarket boss Don Tidey and demanded a ransom of 5m Irish punt.

Iranian state media highlighted the story, which is also likely to be seized upon by jihadi groups. Saudi Arabia has previously publicly denied co-operating with the US to target al-Qaida in Yemen. Evidence of Saudi involvement risks complicating its relationship with the government in Sana&apos;a and with Yemeni tribal leaders who control large parts of the country.     John Brennan. Photograph: Getty Images    Disclosure of the Saudi co-operation comes the day before the architect of the drone programme, John Brennan, appears before the US Senate for a confirmation hearing to become the CIA director. The drone issue is sensitive in Saudi Arabia because of the unpopularity of US military bases, which were thought to have been largely removed after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Saudi Arabia is home to the Muslim holy cities of Mecca and Medina and the continued presence of US troops after the 1991 Gulf war was one of the stated motivations behind al-Qaida&apos;s 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Khobar Towers bombing five years earlier. The date of the 1998 US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania was eight years to the day after US troops were first sent to the kingdom. Osama bin Laden interpreted the prophet Muhammad as banning the &quot;permanent presence of infidels in Arabia&quot;. The last significant US military presence was at the King Sultan airbase in Khobar in the eastern province. The forces there were relocated to Qatar. The revelation is unlikely to make significant waves inside the kingdom. Saudi Arabia has no independent media but there is no sympathy for the jihadis of al-Qaida targeted in Yemen.

Otherwise it is not going register in public opinion.&quot; US government requests to American media to refrain from disclosing the location of the CIA base were made in part because it could potentially damage counter-terrorism collaboration with Saudi Arabia.

They are disappointed to see the former England footballer leave Bournemouth, but say it made sense: he was headed for the Meadows rehabilitation centre, in Phoenix, Arizona, thousands of miles away where, alone and unknown, he can get on with the task in hand \u2013 of saving his\u00a0life. There was a horrible inevitability about his recent lapse. The most talented, and most tainted, England player of his generation was back on the booze. It was as unseemly as it was pitiful, and the redtops devoured it. Last week, he had to be helped on to the stage for an evening of chat in Northampton. He was weepy, abusive, and obviously ill. The Sun reported that he was close to death, and if the accompanying pictures were anything to go by, that didn&apos;t seem much of an exaggeration. On Wednesday, it was revealed that a few of Gazza&apos;s celebrity friends, including Chris Evans and Piers Morgan, had clubbed together to pay for the stay in Arizona, where he has previously been treated. Morgan told the Guardian he believed Gascoigne was &quot;at the last chance saloon \u2013 an all-too apt metaphor for Paul because he has always found it so difficult to pass a saloon without being lured in for a drink&quot;. For the past two years, Gascoigne, 45, has lived in Dorset, either at the Providence or in a flat close by. And for 18 months of that time, he was dry. I met him in 2011, and he was cautiously optimistic. He spent his time fishing, playing golf and six-a-side-football with fellow addicts, and attending AA meetings. But there was also, as always with Gascoigne, a desperation. He had lost pretty much everything \u2013 his money and his wife (after an infamous domestic violence incident, many years ago) \u2013 and he was no longer in touch with his\u00a0children. He had moved to Bournemouth to get away from &quot;friends&quot; who just wanted to take him for one last night out and hear one last story about his famous goals and celebrations and tears. Perhaps it was always doomed: Gascoigne \u2013 even a sick, emaciated Gascoigne \u2013 is one of the most recognisable people in the country. Soon enough, he made new friends in Bournemouth who wanted to treat him to one last drink. As well as his addictions, he has been diagnosed bipolar, and has made several suicide attempts. According to those who worked most closely with him, he showed admirable discipline for most of his time at the Providence, but over the past few months he lost it. The golf and football and meetings went by the wayside, and he was often seen swaying through town looking for the next pub, the next stranger&apos;s shoulder to cry on. Despite his history of physical and verbal abuse, the tortured Gascoigne remains one of Britain&apos;s most loved public figures. It isn&apos;t simply the super-human talent he had with a football: it was his ability to find the funny in the game, whether celebrating a goal with the &quot;dentist&apos;s chair&quot; tribute to a drunken incident or brandishing an admonitory card at a referee. At the Providence, there is widespread anger at the &quot;leeches and hangers-on&quot; desperate to cash in on Gascoigne. One worker said: &quot;He was taken to Dubai a few months ago. Well, of course he was going to get wrecked there. It was a ridiculous thing to do, and he came back in a state. &quot;And how anyone could have taken him to Northampton and carried him on stage to answer questions is so \u2026 cruel. Absolutely outrageous. They treat him like a novelty act, and people wait for him to turn up drunk and make an idiot of himself. It&apos;s a horror movie.&quot; But his agent, Terry Baker, insisted he was only there to help Gascoigne. &quot;The only way Paul would accept he needed treatment was to be made to realise it,&quot; he said. &quot;His counsellors brought him to me in the first place, and he and I have had a good couple of years until now. He has had no help from any of his counsellors or friends recently because he wouldn&apos;t accept he needed it until the events of last week.&quot; Gascoigne has often been compared to another footballing genius, George Best, who died in 2005, aged 59. &quot;He had an irresistible charm, like George Best,&quot; Morgan said. &quot;Gazza was incredibly funny \u2013 a naturally quick-witted, funny character. And there is the emotional side: when he cried at the World Cup, the country fell in love with him because we saw that underneath the cheeky chappy character was this very caring, sensitive, emotional, vulnerable guy.&quot; But, Morgan said, in another way Gascoigne couldn&apos;t be more different to Best: &quot;George Best was a happy drunk. He never wanted to be helped \u2013 he just wanted to be left alone to drink himself into the grave; Gazza is a very unhappy drunk. He has been through innumerable hellish treatments, and although he keeps falling off the rails, he is still desperate to sort himself out.&quot; While Gascoigne is an extreme case, he is one of many former sporting heroes who have struggled to adapt to life after retirement, and sought solace in drink. The boxer Frank Bruno has had severe mental health problems, and the former England cricket captain Andrew Flintoff recently made a television documentary about the prevalence of depression in former sports stars. Flintoff has suggested that more has to be done to prepare sports stars for a life away from the adulation. Bruno has said the worst thing is trying to fill long, empty days that were previously mapped out with fierce training regimes. It was reported on Wednesday that on arriving in Arizona Gascoigne had slipped his minder for &quot;one last drink&quot; before going into rehab. Meanwhile, at the Providence, staff said they will be glad to see him on his return \u2013 but they hope that&apos;s no time soon. In a statement, the Providence said: &quot;The Providence Projects are continuing to support Paul Gascoigne and family members but felt that he would have a\u00a0better chance starting his journey back into recovery away from the media\u00a0frenzy.&quot;", "title": "Paul Gascoigne's lonely road to the last chance saloon", "sentences": ["One worker said: &quot;He was taken to Dubai a few months ago."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-06T16:42:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/06/white-house-cia-drones-john-brennan", "tags": ["Drones (military)", "John Brennan", "Yemen", "US foreign policy", "US military", "CIA", "Barack Obama", "US news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Al-Qaida", "World news"], "article": "The pressure on John Brennan, Barack Obama&apos;s nominee for CIA director and the architect of the White House strategy on drones, intensified on Wednesday amid revelations of a secret CIA drone base in Saudi Arabia. The Obama administration and Saudi Arabia were silent over reports on Wednesday that the CIA is secretly using an air base in Saudi Arabia to conduct its controversial drone assassination campaign in neighbouring Yemen. The reports revealed that the drones that killed the US-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki and his son in September 2011, and Said al-Shehri, a senior al-Qaida commander who died from his injuries last month, were launched from the unnamed base. A senior administration official told the Associated Press that Obama has directed the justice department to provide congressional intelligence committees access to classified information providing the legal rationale for drone strikes against al-Qaida-linked American citizens. The official says the classified advice from the office of legal counsel backs up an unclassified &quot;white paper&quot; from the department that key lawmakers received last year. Several lawmakers have pressed the White House for more information on how decisions are made to target US citizens abroad. The unclassified memo says it is legal for the government to kill US citizens abroad if it believes they are senior al-Qaida leaders continually engaged in operations aimed at killing Americans. The revelation about the Saudi air base is an embarrassment to the White House, which pressured the Washington Post and some other news organisations to suppress the information for 12 months on national security grounds. The timing is also unfortunate for Obama because the killings of Awlaki and his son have contributed to demands in Congress for greater transparency by the White House over the legal basis for drone attacks on US citizens. Senators are expected to quiz Brennan at his confirmation hearing on Thursday about the drones policy, and have pressed the White House to release the detailed legal opinion justifying the targeting of Americans, as well as the broader policy that permits Obama and some other officials to sign off on a &quot;kill list&quot; of named targets. On Tuesday, NBC made public an administration document dating from 2011 justifying the killing of US citizens who hold senior positions in al-Qaida and who pose an &quot;imminent threat of violent attack&quot; against America. But some members of Congress said the document left many questions unanswered. &quot;The committee continues to seek the actual legal opinions by the Department of Justice that provide details not outlined in this particular white paper,&quot; said Dianne Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate intelligence committee. Eleven Senators wrote to the White House hinting at a prolonged fight over the appointment of Brennan, pictured, if the administration did not co-operate with its request.     CIA director nominee John Brennan arrives to meet with Senator Dianne Feinstein on Capitol Hill. Photograph: Saul Loeb/AFP/Getty Images    &quot;The executive branch&apos;s co-operation on this matter will help avoid an unnecessary confrontation that could affect the Senate&apos;s consideration of nominees for national security positions,&quot; the letter said. Some Senators have also raised questions about civilian casualties and whether the drone attacks are a recruiting tool for the US&apos;s enemies. The confirmation hearing is also expected to throw some light on the future use of drones, which Obama has rapidly expanded in Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia. Brennan had helped forge the policy from his White House basement office, and persuaded the president of its value. Senators are likely to want to know where Brennan will take the strategy as head of the CIA, which carries out drone attacks in parallel with the US military. The CIA&apos;s use of drones has come under challenge as a breach of international law because the agency is not a recognised military force. The revelation of the CIA drone base in Saudi Arabia was seized on by Iran, where state media highlighted the story. It is also likely to be grasped as an opportunity by jihadi groups. Saudi Arabia has previously publicly denied co-operating with the US to target al-Qaida in Yemen. Evidence of Saudi involvement risks complicating its relationship with the Yemeni government in Sana&apos;a, and with tribal leaders who control large parts of Yemen where al-Qaida operates. The drone issue is sensitive in Saudi Arabia because of the unpopularity of US military bases, which were thought to have been largely removed after the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Saudi Arabia is home to the Islamic holy cities of Mecca and Medina, and the continued presence of US troops after the 1991 Gulf war was one of the stated motivations behind al-Qaida&apos;s 9/11 terrorist attacks and the Khobar Towers bombing five years earlier. The date of the 1998 US embassy bombings in Kenya and Tanzania was eight years to the day after US troops were first sent to Saudi Arabia. Osama bin Laden interpreted the prophet Muhammad as banning the &quot;permanent presence of infidels in Arabia&quot;. The last significant US military presence was at the Prince Sultan airbase in Khobar in the eastern province. The forces there were relocated to Qatar in September 2003 after 13 years, and at the height of the Iraq war it housed 10,000 US troops and 200 planes. It was supplanted as the Middle East&apos;s main American military air operations centre by Al Udeid Air Base in Qatar. Still, the revelation is unlikely to have a significant impact inside the kingdom. Saudi Arabia has no independent media or expectations of government transparency, but there is no sympathy for the jihadis of al-Qaida targeted in Yemen. Saudi Arabia conducted its own successful campaign against al-Qaida, in effect destroying it by 2004.

Aqap has tried repeatedly to hit Saudi targets. In 2009, Mohammed Bin Nayef, the deputy interior minister and anti-terrorist chief, had an extraordinarily lucky escape when an al-Qaida suicide bomber from Yemen blew himself up in the minister&apos;s palace but left his target only lightly injured. Eight men accused of plotting attacks in Riyadh were arrested last September. Six of them were Yemenis. &quot;These planes are unmanned and unmarked, so there will not be the same impact as when American planes were flying from the Prince Sultan base,&quot; Mustafa Alani of the Gulf Research Centre in Dubai told the Guardian. &quot;No one will say that the Americans are occupying the country. &quot;I don&apos;t think people care about this any more.

The sound of traffic filters through the curtained windows. It is dark and they are talking about their rescue a few hours before and how \u2013 if \u2013 they might get back to their homes almost 1,000 miles away. Malti, 22, and Sita, 35, were promised well-paid jobs in the Middle East. Neither reached the Gulf. Instead they were stripped of their valuables, travel documents and phones and held with 18 others in one room in a rundown apartment in the Indian capital for four months. Denied any outside contact, they were freed only when police, acting on a tip-off, raided the &quot;human warehouse&quot; where the women were being kept. The pair are victims of a new wave of abuse as more and more women from India are recruited by unscrupulous agents for jobs in the Middle East. There were 3,517 incidents relating to human trafficking in India in 2011, says the country&apos;s National Crime Records Bureau, compared to 3,422 the previous year. Most involve women, often from very poor backgrounds, being seized forcibly or misled into lives of harsh domestic labour or sex work within India. But increasingly police and campaigners are uncovering illegal operations which channel women to countries such as Saudi Arabia, Bahrain or the United Arab Emirates. Many work without problems, sending much-needed cash back to their families. But others fall prey to unscrupulous and often violent intermediaries. An increasing number are forced into prostitution. Anis Begum, 27, an almost destitute mother-of-four from Hyderabad, southern India, said she had paid 10,000 rupees (\u00a3120) to an agent to go to Saudi Arabia after being promised well-paid work as a maid. Instead, she was locked in a storeroom and then sold as a sex worker at an auction for the equivalent of \u00a3300, beaten, imprisoned and abused. &quot;I was scared I might get pregnant. If I did, I thought they might kill me,&quot; she said. She was freed by her captor&apos;s wife after months of confinement in one room at their home in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. Such stories are increasingly familiar to police. The problem of human trafficking is huge, said Neeraj Kumar, Delhi&apos;s police chief. One case last year, was an eye-opener, he said. Nearly 40 women were intercepted by police at Delhi airport in an operation launched in co-operation with authorities in Mumbai and the United Arab Emirates. They were destined for brothels, investigators believe. In another police operation last April, a trafficking ring in Bangalore which had sent more than 200 women to the Gulf was broken up. The gang received around \u00a32,500 for every woman they delivered to brothels in Muscat and Dubai. Most of the women recruited by the agents come from severely deprived backgrounds and are often illiterate. Unable to verify inflated or misleading claims, they travel willingly. In the Bangalore case, the women were told they were to be maids and then forced into sex work. Those freed in the Delhi operation were told they would be dancers. Anis Begum was told she could earn \u00a3125 a month, four times her wage as a hospital cleaner. The two women released from the Delhi flat-cum-prison were typical of many victims. No one had forced them to leave their homes and Malti, from northern West Bengal, had already spent two years in Saudi Arabia, where she was neither abused nor denied pay, as a domestic servant. She was trying to return to the Gulf for more work when she got involved with the agent who imprisoned her. Sita, an illiterate mother of five whose husband earns around 130 rupees a day (\u00a31.60) as a labourer when he can find work, had little idea where she was going or what awaited her when she left her village, also in India&apos;s poverty-stricken north-east, late last summer. &quot;I was told I was going to earn a good salary by a woman who came to my home. I need to feed my children so I went with her. I had high hopes. She brought me to Delhi in a train but then I was locked up,&quot; Sita said. One reason for the women&apos;s imprisonment in Delhi could have been a problem with paperwork, perhaps an official who had not been paid off. Mandha Bheem Reddy, a campaigner with the Indian Migrants&apos; Rights Council, said corruption was endemic among border control officers. &quot;They often give clearance for poorly educated or even illiterate women who are particularly vulnerable. Many of these women can be stopped at the airport when questioning shows they have probably not met the requirements for emigration to the Gulf countries but they are allowed to leave,&quot; he said. Anis Begum said her travel documents had been falsified to get round Indian laws designed to restrict abuse. &quot;[The agent] told me to tell the emigration desk at Hyderabad airport that I was going to Dubai to visit my aunt. When they asked me too many questions, I called him and handed over the phone. Once he spoke to the official, they let me through,&quot; she said. Last month an Air India employee was arrested at Delhi airport for falsifying boarding passes to allow workers to travel overseas illegally. A police officer was also involved in the scam. Even substantial bribes to officials do not dent profits. &quot;There is a lot of money at stake,&quot; said one Bahrain-based activist who works with Indian domestic workers in the Gulf state. &quot;Employers over here are willing to pay up to 800 Bahraini dinar (\u00a31,350) to an agent to bring a [maid] from India. Agents are taking money from both the employers and workers and in the process cheating both parties.&quot; Once in the Gulf, workers have little protection. A recent Human Rights Watch report described migrant domestic workers in Saudi Arabia working 15 to 20 hours a day with no holidays and few breaks, minimal access to healthcare and poor accommodation. Many reported sexual abuse by employers. According to the US state department, the kingdom is a &quot;destination country&quot; for men and women being trafficked for labour and, &quot;to a lesser extent, forced prostitution&quot;. Some are forced to work in brothels or simply abused. There are frequent reports of such incidents in the Indian press. In May last year a 21-year-old told recounted how she was forced to dance in a bar in Bahrain with 20 other women from the northwestern province of the Punjab by a violent trafficker before she drank chemicals to force him to bring her back home. In August last year, authorities in Dubai arrested four people accused of running a prostitution ring after members allegedly beat up a Bangladeshi woman and held her in a cell where she was raped and pimped to paying customers. In Sharjah, another of the United Arab Emirates, a decades-old business which took impoverished Indian women who had been promised jobs in supermarkets or as housemaids and forced them into prostitution was uncovered by police in November. Campaigners admit that as abuses occur overseas they are difficult for Indian authorities to deal with. But the agents are &quot;here, not there&quot;, said Subhash Bhatnagar, the Delhi-based activist who received the tip-off which led to the raid on the &quot;human warehouse&quot; and freed Malti and Sati. &quot;There were maybe 40 or 50 girls who spent time in the flat while we were there,&quot; said Malti. &quot;All were supposed to be going to Saudi Arabia, Kuwait or somewhere else in the Gulf. Every week one or two of them would disappear, probably flown off to the Middle East. But most of us stayed put. No one had any money or contacts. We were helpless.&quot; Conditions were harsh. Food, brought in from outside, was bad and there was no privacy. &quot;It was cramped, everyone was ill, there was no work and no one gave us any money. We were not allowed phone calls or any contact with relatives or friends. Our mobiles were confiscated and we were physically stopped from leaving. We kept asking when we would be going to Saudi Arabia. They just said soon,&quot; Malti said. As their imprisonment entered a fifth month, Malti managed to contact a distant acquaintance through a sympathetic intermediary. Eventually word reached Bhatnagar, the activist, who informed the police.

My brother&apos;s wedding had been arranged. The man who arranged the match, Majjid, told me I could earn four times more if I went to work in Saudi. He said my children \u2013 I have four and my husband has left me \u2013 could live better lives. I&apos;d been at the hospital for six years, earning 5,000 rupees (\u00a360) a month. It was very difficult to support my children since my husband didn&apos;t contribute at all. But I was reluctant to travel to Saudi because the thought of going overseas to a strange country scared me. So Majid introduced me to another man Feroz who, I think, is an agent who recruits people from Hyderabad to work in the Gulf. He was working for someone based in Delhi who has a network for recruiting. I had got my passport four months ago because my aunt and I were keen on going [for pilgrimage] to Mecca. Feroz used to come to my house and tell told me if I worked as a domestic help in Saudi I could go for Haj as well. He said I was getting the ticket and the visa for free. Even his wife spoke to me and told me there was nothing to fear. She had travelled to Saudi as a tourist and told me I should go to Riyadh. So I paid him 10,000 rupees (\u00a3120) for his services. Then I spent another 10,000 rupees buying clothes and other things for my stay in Riyadh. On 12 June 2012, I flew to Dubai \u2013 Bahrain \u2013 Riyadh. I was told to tell the emigration desk at Hyderabad airport I was going to Dubai to visit my aunt. When they asked me too many questions, I called Feroz and handed over the phone. Once he spoke to the official, they let me through. I think he had bribed officials at the airport so they wouldn&apos;t stop people like me from going. Once I reached Riyadh, I called the employer, Ahmed, but there was no response. They took me to the police station and I was there for four days waiting for my employer to come and pick me up. When Ahmed finally arrived, they gave him my passport. He took me to a hotel. I got nervous so I locked myself in the room and refused to open the door even when he knocked. There was a trap door through which he would pass the food. After two days, Ahmed&apos;s mother and sister arrived at the lodge and I agreed to open the door. I left with them for Ahmed&apos;s mother&apos;s house. There were six men in that house, all of them Ahmed&apos;s brothers. They made me sleep in the storeroom. They gave me a blanket that smelled so much that I had to wash it before I could use it. And it was so hot. I opened the windows at night. They didn&apos;t like the way I cooked, so they threw away the food the first day. After that, I did other work like washing the pots and pans, cleaning and so on. I was at the house for 15 days when Ahmed started approaching me at night and asking if I liked him and if I would live with him like his wife. I got scared and told him I wanted to go back to India. He said he would take me to the airport but instead he sold me to another man, a sheikh called Gazi. I was taken to an office where sheikhs were paying for women. There were five other women and three men who were quoting prices. Ahmed sold me for 25,000 rupees (\u00a3300). I was scared that I might get pregnant. If I did, I thought they might kill me. I was locked in a room with three other women during the day. Ghazi poured hot water on my hands and feet, burning them. My phone had been smashed but I managed to piece it back together and called my aunt in Hyderabad to ask for help. I asked [a customer] who let me use his phone. Finally, it was Ghazi&apos;s wife who helped us. She unlocked the room like she did every morning so we could bathe and have something to eat. But she told us we could leave if we wished. So we went to the police station and the police called Ahmed so he could bring my passport. I got back to India on 23 July 2012. I filed a [criminal complaint] with the police against Feroz but they haven&apos;t found him yet. He has left his house. Majid says he didn&apos;t know this would happen.

That it was all in danger of getting a little too hectic, at least as far as the Stoke element was concerned, was down to Reading&apos;s now famed capacity to rescue games that look beyond them, and had the referee, Michael Oliver, decided Adam Le Fondre was fouled by Ryan Shotton in the Stoke penalty area in the final moments of added time, they might have done so again. Oliver was right to shake his head though, for all the Royals&apos; manager, Brian McDermott, reckoned otherwise, and Stoke deserved to hang on for a first win in seven league games. In their own unsubtle way they had taken the initiative from the start, and if there was nothing special about Robert Huth&apos;s opening goal, headed past the Reading goalkeeper, Adam Federici, directly from Glenn Whelan&apos;s corner, their second was worthy of the three points all by itself. The manner in which Cameron Jerome controlled the ball, turned and, in the same movement, volleyed gloriously into the corner of the net was rendered all the more remarkable by the ordinariness of all that had gone before. But Reading are never beaten. Jimmy K\u00e9b\u00e9, scorer of the two goals that gave them victory over Sunderland last week, had already squandered one wonderful opportunity with a criminally misplaced final pass, when Adrian Mariappa nodded in a near-post corner to ensure the Stoke faithful had to endure a tortuous final few minutes before victory was confirmed. McDermott was convinced that Shotton had fouled Le Fondre, although replays suggested it was far from as clear cut as the Reading manager seemed to think. &quot;It was a stonewall penalty, he caught Alfie, but the ref didn&apos;t see it that way,&quot; McDermott said. &quot;It&apos;s part of football. We&apos;ve had a few. Sometimes as a manager you get those things \u2013 with the last kick of the game, it would have been great to get the point. &quot;I&apos;m disappointed because we hung in the game and showed great resilience and this is not an easy place to come to, as everybody knows, but the lads gave it a right go.&quot; With no game for a fortnight, Reading are off for some warm-weather training, and perhaps a little R&amp;R, in Dubai.

He is a great impact player and he scored a great goal. If it was a penalty at the end I&apos;d say thank goodness we had a break, we deserve one.&quot; Stoke, for once playing a traditional 4-4-2, with Jon Walters joining Peter Crouch up front, did create a couple of early chances in an appropriately traditional manner, which is to say crosses aimed at a tall centre-forward. Unfortunately for them, while Matthew Etherington&apos;s delivery was good, Crouch reacted too slowly to get on the end of the first and, though he got on the end of the second, he badly mistimed his header. Only in the final few minutes of the half, when Stoke finally began to put them under concerted pressure, did Reading start to wobble. Crouch, with one of his trademark sideways scissor-kick volleys, brought a good save from Federici, and a Huth shot was blocked by Stephen Kelly.", "title": "Stoke City 2-1 Reading | Premier League match report", "sentences": ["&quot;I&apos;m disappointed because we hung in the game and showed great resilience and this is not an easy place to come to, as everybody knows, but the lads gave it a right go.&quot; With no game for a fortnight, Reading are off for some warm-weather training, and perhaps a little R&amp;R, in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-09T17:00:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/feb/09/swansea-city-qpr-premier-league", "tags": ["Premier League", "Swansea City", "QPR", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2012-13"], "article": "Swansea fly off to Dubai on Sunday for some well-earned warm-weather training, leaving behind another job well done. In contrast, QPR are probably heading for the Championship after a comprehensive defeat that saw the Harry Redknapp revival come to a halt. The Premier League&apos;s bottom team were unbeaten in five before this, but remain in dire straits after a dreadful performance that was characterised by the fumbling hands of their goalkeeper J\u00falio C\u00e9sar. Redknapp believes Rangers need to win at least six of their 12 remaining matches to stay up. &quot;It&apos;s going to be tight, but Wigan and Reading lost today and it&apos;s still all to play for. Yes, we can do it,&quot; he said. C\u00e9sar, playing with a groin injury, let two shots escape his from grasp in the first 18 minutes of the game, and the Swans punished him ruthlessly, scoring on both occasions. Bobby Zamora, on as substitute, did pull one back early in the second half, but Swansea quickly reasserted themselves to score two more. Their only concern after a good win was the ankle-ligament injury sustained by Chico Flores, which threatens to put the Spanish centre-half out of the Capital One Cup final in two weeks&apos; time. His replacement was Kyle Bartley, who cleared a shot from St\u00e9phane Mbia off the line. Injuries to Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my (hamstring) and Zamora forced QPR to start without a conventional centre forward. Zamora needs surgery to remedy his hip condition, and is delaying it until the end of the season in the hope that cameos like today&apos;s might help the team to stay up. &quot;Without those two we are short up front, That&apos;s why I tried to get [Peter] Odemwingie,&quot; Redknapp said. Swansea were ahead after only eight minutes, when C\u00e9sar failed to hold Nathan Dyer&apos;s shot from the edge of the penalty area and Michu forced the ball in at close range for his first goal in seven games. For the second goal Wayne Routledge supplied Angel Rangel, who cut inside Jamie Mackie before letting fly. Again C\u00e9sar saved the initial shot but allowed the ball to get away from him, enabling the full-back to make sure with his second attempt. QPR were briefly back in contention three minutes into the second half, when Michel Vorm palmed Adel Taarabt&apos;s shot from the right straight to Zamora, leaving him with a simple tap-in. Two minutes later, however, the Welsh team restored their two-goal advantage, with C\u00e9sar again at fault. Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez, supplied out on the left by Michu, cut inside two QPR defenders, then beat the Brazilian goalkeeper at his near post from what looked like an almost impossible angle near the byline. Midway through the second half Michu added his 18th of the season, holding off Chris Samba before scoring with a sublime finish from near the penalty spot, one Spaniard&apos;s cool expertise doing full justice to a lovely through pass from another, Hern\u00e1ndez. Shaun Wright-Phillips struck the crossbar in stoppage time at the end, but it was far too little, much too late. Redknapp acknowledged that C\u00e9sar had been at fault, but refused to criticise the man he described as &quot;a world-class goalkeeper&quot;. &quot;We gave bad goals away today,&quot; said Redknapp, &quot;they were bad errors. Shots came back off the keeper. He [C\u00e9sar] had been absolutely fantastic for us, as good as any goalie in the league. I wouldn&apos;t swap him for anybody, but he played with a groin strain today and it handicapped him. He told me he was all right to play but obviously he wasn&apos;t. I&apos;m not going to have a go at him. In our previous five games, when we&apos;ve done so well, he was our best player. It was a bad day for him today, but that&apos;s how it goes. &quot;When we bring Bobby Zamora on we&apos;re a different team. He holds the ball up and brings others into the play, but he&apos;s only 50% fit and can&apos;t play 90 minutes. It makes a massive difference to the team when he&apos;s fit.&quot; The Swansea manager, Michael Laudrup, said: &quot;Overall it was a good day for us, apart from Chico&apos;s injury. We&apos;re hoping that it&apos;s just a twisted ankle, but if the scan shows it&apos;s ligaments he&apos;ll miss the [Capital One] final.&quot;", "title": "Swansea City 4-1 Queens Park Rangers | Premier League match report", "sentences": ["Swansea fly off to Dubai on Sunday for some well-earned warm-weather training, leaving behind another job well done."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-09T17:07:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/feb/09/jackals-share-morgan-jones-review", "tags": ["Thrillers", "Fiction", "Books", "Raymond Chandler", "John le Carr\u00e9", "Culture"], "article": "Chris Morgan Jones&apos;s debut novel, An Agent of Deceit, was rightly praised for continuing the reconfiguration of the spy novel begun by such terrific authors as Charles Cumming after the Berlin Wall came down and east versus west became too simplistic an analysis of world politics. (With hindsight, of course, it always was.) But with The Jackal&apos;s Share it becomes clear that, actually, Morgan Jones is writing detective as well as spy fiction. The novel is as much Raymond Chandler as John le Carr\u00e9; as much The Big Sleep as The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. Broadly speaking, classic spy fiction twists and tweaks apparently straightforward facts and re-presents them in startling ways. Classic detective fiction starts with a simple job that becomes more complicated with the turn of every page. The Jackal&apos;s Share is both. The author gives a nod to the influence of the classic private eye story when he points out that the offices in protagonist Ben Webster&apos;s HQ are named after his colleague&apos;s favourite detectives, including Chandler&apos;s Marlowe and Rex Stout&apos;s Nero Wolfe. The job is apparently straightforward for the returning private spy (or private investigator, according to taste). A charismatic, uber-rich Iranian client wants Webster to find out if there is something dirty about him on record that will explain why an American company is cautious about concluding a massive deal. It doesn&apos;t take long for Webster to figure out that the real story \u2013 which he is discouraged by pretty much everyone he knows from exploring \u2013 lies in family secrets and the supposedly random killing of one of the billionaire&apos;s closest colleagues. Ben Webster&apos;s character has interesting complexities. Like Marlowe, he has his own morality and doesn&apos;t much like the wealthy \u2013 including his own client. But down these moneyed streets a man\u00a0must go, although, unlike Marlowe, Webster does it with wife and kids in tow. The family stuff and the titillating descriptions of Webster&apos;s encounters with another woman are a bit tedious and seem written by rote, but Webster&apos;s characterisation is strong and carried along in the flow of the plot, which has the broad canvas of a spy novel: Middle Eastern politics are central and there are trips to Lake Como, Dubai and Marrakech. The author is deft with all his characterisations but, in particular, he has created two genuinely chilling antagonists, one whose menace is horribly physical, the other whose seeming omniscience provides the\u00a0threat. He also has an assured sense of place\u00a0whether in his foreign locations or moving around London \u2013 a description of swimming in the capital&apos;s Hampstead ponds is particularly pleasing. Chris Morgan Jones has more than equalled his powerful debut and in Ben Webster has created a flawed (of course), likable central character. I look forward to getting to know him better.

But a decade of blistering increases, which took the average home from \u00a368,777 in 1997 to \u00a3199,766 in late 2007, ended with a whimper. Prices slipped over 2008 and hit a low of \u00a3157,767 in summer 2009. Today the national average has climbed back a little, to \u00a3162,932, according to Halifax. But regional variations have been extraordinary. In Northern Ireland, the implosion was devastating. Houses that typically sold for \u00a3230,000 in 2007 now fetch just \u00a3100,000, a 57% collapse. In mainland Britain, Hartlepool in the north-east has seen the biggest slide, with the average home now selling for \u00a374,000 compared with \u00a3113,000 at the peak. Meanwhile many buyers of new-build luxury flats in provincial cities remain deep in negative equity. Then there&apos;s London. The contrast with the rest of the UK has never been more stark. Prices in some outer boroughs are below their peak, but in wealthier central districts, the crash never happened. In Kensington and Chelsea, the average home now costs \u00a31.08m, up 13% during 2012 and \u00a3330,000 ahead of 2007. Meanwhile, tenants have never had it so bad. Young adults and families unable to afford huge the huge deposits demanded by lenders have turned to the private rental market, where rents have climbed even as average pay has stagnated. Experts think the market will stay flat across Britain, even in central London, in 2013. There are signs that the funding for lending scheme is feeding through to lower interest for first-time buyers, but the Council of Mortgage Lenders expects total transactions to edge up from 930,000 to 950,000 in 2013, but slip back again in 2014. Patrick Collinson Spain Five years after Spain&apos;s residential property bubble burst, prices are still tumbling and have much further to go, with 1m properties unsold. Spain&apos;s Mortgage Association reports a fall of 27% from the peak so far, with 10% of that last year. The Economist says prices will not bounce until a further 20% is wiped off the value of Spanish homes. Uncertainty is added by the arrival of a new player, the &quot;bad bank&quot;, Sareb, set up by the government to take toxic real estate assets of banks that have had eurozone bailouts \u2013 to the tune of \u20ac40bn. The assets are often new developments and land belonging to developers who failed to repay loans. Sareb has not said how many properties it holds, nor how it plans to sell them over a 10-year period. But the properties will number in the tens of thousands, if not more. Estimates are that it will eventually mop up \u20ac65bn worth of property \u2013 making it Europe&apos;s biggest single real estate portfolio and twice the size of Ireland&apos;s bad bank, Nama. Spanish banks&apos; profits fell as they sold off or wrote down property last year, but developers still owe them \u20ac270bn \u2013 with a third of that considered toxic. Experts say the unsold houses should take three to four years to sell \u2013 so it will be a long time before the residential construction industry starts creating jobs. Giles Tremlett Dubai Back in the good old days, &quot;investors&quot; in Dubai could make 10% profit on a property deals in a matter of minutes. At big property fairs staged in the glitzy emirate in early 2008, people would queue to buy apartments and villas &quot;off plan&quot; \u2013 from developers&apos; architectural drawings \u2013 long before construction work started. Smart operators would get there early, write a cheque for the property, then sell the receipt to another &quot;investor&quot; at the back of the queue for a 10% mark-up. That was the kind of scam \u2013 then entirely legal \u2013 that fuelled the Dubai property bubble from 2002 (when foreigners were first allowed to buy there). It burst spectacularly in autumn 2008 as investment cash dried up, the nascent mortgage market collapsed, and the &quot;Dubai dream&quot; evaporated for many. Property prices plummeted by 60% in a few months, and &quot;iconic waterside developments&quot; were mothballed in their hundreds. Their skeletons, topped with stationary cranes, lined the emirate&apos;s skyline. Some $75bn-worth of projects were shelved, bankers estimated in 2009. One developer, government-owned Nakheel, responsible for the spectacular Palm Jumeirah and other man-made islands, almost went bust with $16bn of debt. Nakheel is still paying that off, but there are now signs the Dubai property market is coming back to life. Estate agent Cluttons said recently that prices were heading back towards the 2008 peaks, especially in areas such as Dubai Marina and Arabian Ranches, where foreigners are allowed to buy. A six-bedroom penthouse apartment, valued 12 months ago at $17m, was recently priced at $25m. William Butler Ireland Ireland is emerging at a snail&apos;s pace from one of the worst property downturns in the postwar developed world. Overall, the average cost of a house in Ireland is now down to \u20ac207,000 (\u00a3175,000), which is 50% below the market rate at the height of the republic&apos;s property boom in 2006. However there appeared to be a slight upward trend in house prices in Dublin towards the final quarter of 2012, according to Daft.ie, Ireland&apos;s biggest property website. Dublin house prices climbed 1.6%, the first increase in six years, and the overall rate of market decline has been slowing. A closer breakdown of Daft.ie&apos;s figures also shows disparities between houses in the Irish capital and the average home in other parts of Ireland. A three-bedroom house in Dublin, south of the river Liffey, will cost around \u20ac252,950 while a similar house in Cork City is \u20ac148,424. And even compared with Cork, attractive Galway City in the west of Ireland is a far cheaper place to buy a similar property. The price of a three-bed in the &quot;capital&quot; of the ancient province of Connaught is estimated at around \u20ac132,060. On an upbeat note, the length of time it takes to sell a property is speeding up \u2013 a sign that the market is starting to recover. Now four in 10 properties find a buyer within four months, compared with just three in 10 a year ago. Henry McDonald Iceland After a sharp decline since the economic bubble burst four and a half years ago, house prices in Iceland have been rising for the last couple of years. Today the average price of a residential property in Reykjav\u00edk is about 260,000 kr\u00f3nur (\u00a31,300) per square metre. From 2000 to 2008, house prices in Iceland doubled, with most of that increase coming after 2004. But when the Icelandic economy came crashing down in October 2008, so did the property market. From peak to trough the fall in real (inflation-adjusted) house prices was 34%, and more than 27% of households were left with mortgages bigger than the value of their homes. The scale of the negative equity problem was partly due to the two types of mortgages that were on offer \u2013 inflation-indexed mortgages and low-rate loans indexed to foreign currencies (&quot;FX loans&quot;). After the crash, the amount borrowed on indexed loans rose because of inflation (the relevant index rose by 37.5%) and FX loan debt soared when the kr\u00f3na fell by more than 40%. Since the crash, there have been debt-restructuring measures that reduced mortgage debt to 110% of property values, and a special interest rebate. In addition, most of the FX loans have been deemed illegal and recalculated. As a result, real house prices are now back to where they were in 2004-05 and are forecast to rise by some 5% this year and next. This recovery is due partly to capital controls that limit the investment opportunities available and push cash into the property sector. There is also huge demand, as construction has been very limited since 2008.

That much was evident when, after an hour&apos;s stultifying football, the exasperated Stoke manager sent on the strikers Cameron Jerome and Kenwyne Jones. Neither is a regular starter under Pulis and both were the subject of interest from other clubs in January. Jones might have gone to Swansea City as a replacement for Danny Graham, Jerome to Championship-leading Cardiff; but both remained and their introduction won Stoke this game. Jerome&apos;s arrival was particularly influential. His control, turn and beautifully struck angled volley to score Stoke&apos;s second after Robert Huth had headed them into the lead was every bit as spectacular as the thunderous shot that rescued a point against Southampton at the end of December. Though Reading set about staging their now customary comeback, and Adrian Mariappa scored with a near-post header, this time they had just too much to do.

The difference is that while Swansea have a cup final to come back to, Queens Park Rangers may be tempted to stay. As an avid follower of the sport of kings, Harry Redknapp loves a handicap but he could do without the burden he inherited from Mark Hughes at the Premier League&apos;s bottom club, where he needs a Devon Loch from his rivals if he is to triumph against mountainous odds. When Redknapp took over from Hughes, QPR had failed to win any of their first 13 league games, from which they had taken a paltry four points. Under their new master they have managed 13 from 13, but their 4-1 drubbing at the Liberty Stadium leaves them four points adrift at the bottom, in need of a footballing miracle if they are to survive. Ever the optimist, Redknapp points out that he has been there and done it before. At Portsmouth he took over a relegation-bound team in December 2005 and masterminded a revival that brought 20 points from the last 10 games [six wins and two draws] and the security of 17th place. In the two seasons that followed Pompey finished ninth and eighth. &quot;The situation was similar\u201a&quot; Redknapp said. &quot;What happened then is what we need now, and yes, I&apos;m confident. I know it&apos;s going to be hard, and I think it will go to the wire, but it&apos;s not impossible.&quot; On Saturday&apos;s lame performance no sane observer would give QPR a prayer, but there were mitigating circumstances. J\u00falio C\u00e9sar, who was to blame for three of the goals conceded, was injured and should not have played, Bobby Zamora is soldiering on in need of surgery on a hip condition and Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my, the new striker on who Redknapp is pinning his hopes, was absent with hamstring trouble.     Harry Redknapp remined upbeat despite watching his side submit meekly to a Swansea City side inspired by Michu. Photograph: Rebecca Naden/Reuters    In the circumstances, Rangers were easy prey for an impressive Swansea team who are up to seventh, playing football of a quality that merits a European place. They have been known locally as &quot;Swanselona&quot; for a long time now, since Roberto Mart\u00ednez first made his mark in management, and the good work carried on by Paulo Sousa, Brendan Rodgers and now Michael Laudrup has won them new fans everywhere. Redknapp and Laudrup provide an interesting contrast \u2013 old school English versus new European. QPR&apos;s veteran Anglo-Saxon was bemoaning his lack of the archetypal centre-forward to &quot;lead the line&quot; while his Spain-educated Danish counterpart prefers to play without one. Michu&apos;s two goals took his tally for the season to 15 in the Premier League and 18 in all competitions, but neither he, nor the man who bought him, see him as a conventional No9. The \u00a32m bargain from Rayo Vallecano said: &quot;I prefer to play behind the front line. Playing there, you have the surprise factor. Most of my goals come from the second line. I think I&apos;ll always score more from there.&quot; Michu pointed out that it is common in Spain to play without an orthodox striker, leaving it to attacking midfielders to fill the void, and that he was doing that with Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez, Jonathan de Guzman and the much improved Wayne Routledge. Laudrup said of his most successful import: &quot;Too many people look upon him as just a goalscorer. He is much more than that.&quot; The Swansea manager added that he was delighted by his side&apos;s progress. He said: &quot;To have 37 points after 26 games and to be in a cup final then yes, we are definitely ahead of schedule.&quot; His only concern is the ankle injury that threatens to keep his centre-half Chico Flores out of the Capital One Cup final against Bradford on 24 February.

The event, which was played at the Sam Boyd Stadium over three days, attracted an aggregate crowd of 67,341, 3,000 more than the previous best, which was set last year. On Saturday, a crowd of 31,228 set a single-day record for the event. The home team qualified for the cup quarter-finals with a 22-7 victory over Spain in their final pool game, in which Carlin Isles, the former college running back and national top-40 sprinter now known as the fastest man in rugby, added two spectacular tries to one scored against Australia. The Eagles were beaten in the last eight by Fiji, 21-19 in a thriller decided by a missed US conversion, the last kick of the game. Alex Magleby, the USA coach, said: &quot;Credit to the boys. Three of our tries to three of Fiji&apos;s tries. The effort was there, and they are playing smarter rugby. It was good to see.&quot;  The USA then lost 24-19 in extra-time to Canada in the semi-finals of the plate, one of the consolation competitions for teams beaten at different stages in the tournament. Magleby said: &quot;There is no excuse, that was a game that was always competitive, emotions fly and Canada played well enough to win.&quot;  The Canadians completed an encouraging event for north-American rugby by beating Scotland to win the plate; France beat Argentina to win the bowl and Australia beat Uruguay for the shield. The Samoans won another extra-time game, 36-31 against Fiji, in the play-off for third place. New Zealand are in the overall lead in the HSBC Sevens World Series, of which the American tournament was the fifth stage, with 96 points.

Imagine a more serene transport experience for people looking for a more reflective journey, where the experience of travel itself is more important than getting from A to B quickly. Imagine a world cruise not on the ocean, but in a giant, zeppelin-like hotel in the sky, from which you have time to marvel at natural or manmade wonders. Your trip to New York or Dubai would take a couple of days during which you&apos;re enjoying the absolute freedom of flight, with family or friends. Imagine all this being powered, in elevation and direction, only by hydrogen, topped up by solar panels covering the vast structure. Imagine no more as the Aircruise concept has already been created by a visionary team of designers. You may even be able to try it soon, as Korean conglomerate Samsung are investigating the feasibility of the concept. This vision is not a have-your-consumerist-cake-and-eat-it scenario, or even a prediction of the future. This is a re-imagining of how things could be \u2013 an alternative take on future leisure and travel, in which slow is the new fast. It perfectly illustrates the final point in our sustainability and design series \u2013 how designers can create inspiring visions of the future that help advance sustainability. The use of visions in sustainability is not new, but design-driven visions might be. While sustainability theoretically fits neatly with concepts such as futurity, legacy or long-term thinking, one problem that Forum for the Future&apos;s Peter Madden notes is that: &quot;Our main narrative is fundamentally overwhelmingly negative \u2013 apocalyptic, doom and gloom. It&apos;s anti-growth. But it stops us being listened to, and acts as a barrier to the majority of people.&quot; We have not painted particularly inspiring pictures of how sustainable living can be better for people. &quot;Designers don&apos;t just see the world as it is, they see how it could be&quot;, says sustainable design Professor Cameron Tonkinwise. Talk to a designer and they don&apos;t focus on what&apos;s wrong or what&apos;s broken, invariably they&apos;ll want to fix it or make it better. Designers are ideas people, able to imagine new ways of doing things, but critically they can bring these ideas to life by visualising them in inspiring ways, and also by presenting ideas and visions from the end-user/citizen/consumer backwards \u2013 meaning they are about people not technology. Look around and you&apos;ll find more than the odd designer working on visions for a sustainable world. The Siemens Future Life film at the crystal installation in London recently caught my eye through its explanation of how tomorrow&apos;s sustainable city dwelling can be healthy, communal, beneficial and fun. Picking fruit and veg from your New York city skyscraper&apos;s urban vertical farms, or bathing in the outdoor communal pools of Copenhagen&apos;s harbour look particularly appealing. Some of the best visions of this kind come from Philips Design, via their Design Futures program. The company even has a formal methodology for this process titled Design Probes, which looks at far-future lifestyle scenarios, which culminate in a design provocation. One of my personal favourites is their Home Farming concept to grow some of your food inside your home. An indoor mini-ecosystem, containing fish, crustaceans, algae and edible plants, all interdependent and in balance with each other, provides your very own indoor vertical farm. Cynics may see this as just whimsy or creative indulgence, yet the original Aircruise concept film has more than 650,000 YouTube views to date, and though impact shouldn&apos;t be measured by clicks alone, part of this is clearly about some much-needed sustainability inspiration. One of our own philosophies is that innovation is best delivered if you &quot;step into the future and drag the present towards you&quot;, so we use these kinds of visions in our everyday work. This refill concept \u2013 called Boomerang \u2013 was created for personal care products such as shampoo or bodywash, and has helped us talk to our consumer brand clients about design beyond single-use, disposable products. The resulting designs may not be an exact extrapolation of the vision, but it does show another role for visions in being catalytic. A while back, Philips Design published some of its former visionary concepts, presented next to similar products they may have catalysed, which had been introduced to the market since. Ironically, many of these were not developed or launched by Philips, so vision projects can be a wider stimulus for innovation too. The visionary starts with a blank sheet and re-imagines the world, but designers can help with that extra step of making these visions a reality. Our series has covered many aspects of sustainability and design, presented a complete roadmap in which designers must: add sustainability to everything designed, help cleantech to scale up and win, redesign people&apos;s behaviour, even take on some of the worlds big challenges \u2013 through design. Yet this final blog presents the ultimate role, and challenge, to designers \u2013 bringing inspiring visions of sustainability to life. This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

In the midst of an escalating diplomatic storm over the 34-year-old&apos;s treatment and the revelation that he was being investigated by Australian authorities as a suspected Israeli agent who used Australian passports for operations, it emerged that he was confronted shortly before his arrest by an Australian journalist who accused him of being a spy. As the scandal over Zygier&apos;s suicide, while being held incommunicado in Ayalon prison, continued to grow in Israel and Australia, it was also revealed by Australian news organisations that he was under investigation by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation [ASIO] as one of three citizens suspected of using of Australian passports on behalf of Mossad. More details of the case emerged as the Israeli government partially lifted its blanket ban on reporting any details of Zygier&apos;s imprisonment, first imposed by an Israeli court after his arrest. Zygier, who was married to an Israeli and had two young children, was found hanged in his cell in late 2010. His body was flown to Melbourne for burial the following week. In Israel the case has triggered demands by opposition politicians, human rights groups and the media for Benjamin Netanyahu&apos;s government to supply more information about the man&apos;s imprisonment and death, and to reform its antiquated and authoritarian military censorship rules. When the story about Prisoner X first emerged, Israeli media said the unidentified man was being held incommunicado at Ayalon high-security prison in the wing built to accommodate Yigal Amir, the assassin of the Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin. While the case remains deeply murky, the new revelations will be deeply embarrassing to Mossad, not least because they have lifted the lid again on how the Israeli spy agencies acquire cover identities for agents. In the last three years the Mossad department charged with providing cover identities has been caught out in a series of high-profile bungles as it has been found to have been improperly using foreign passports for its operations. The details came only a day after an ABC documentary revealed Prisoner X&apos;s identity for the first time, and after ham-fisted efforts by Netanyahu&apos;s office to prevent reporting of the story by Israeli media messily backfired. According to The Age, Zygier had applied for Australian passports using three identities over the years \u2013 those of Ben Alon, Ben Allen and Benjamin Burrows. The new details about Australian suspicions that Zygier was a Mossad agent came as the Australian government was forced to backtrack on claims that it had no knowledge of his arrest and to admit that Israeli officials had briefed Australian diplomats over the case. There has still been no official explanation for why Zygier was secretly imprisoned without trial, and information on his case ruthlessly suppressed. But speculation is growing that he may have offered to provide information to a foreign power. It is still not clear whether Zygier was actively working for Mossad, or whether he simply acquired passports for the spy agency to use in its overseas operations. According to The Age, Zygier had been approached by a Fairfax journalist after being tipped off that the Australian intelligence agency ASIO was investigating three dual national citizens who had emigrated to Israel, on suspicion that the men had used Australian passports to spy for Israel in Iran, Syria and Lebanon \u2013 which is illegal under Australian law. Zygier, known as Benji, was approached by the reporter Jason Koutsoukis shortly before his arrest in 2010 and asked whether he was an Israeli spy after being accused of travelling back to Australia to change his name and obtain a new Australian passport. At the time Zygier said: &quot;I have never been to any of those countries that you say I have been to, I am not involved in any kind of spying. That is ridiculous.&quot; In recent years the issue of both Mossad operations involving citizens of friendly nations and use of passports of allies, has become a source of serious friction with governments usually friendly with Israel. &quot;There are informal rules,&quot; said one person familiar with intelligence co-operation arrangements. &quot;You inform your allies if you want to speak to someone or do something. There is a feeling the Israelis don&apos;t play by the rules.&quot; Mossad&apos;s use of foreign passports became an international scandal not long before Zygier&apos;s secret arrest and detention when it was revealed that the spy agency had used almost a dozen foreign passports in its assassination of Hamas&apos;s Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, in a Dubai hotel, in January 2010. In seven cases it turned out that the passports used were in the name of Jews who had immigrated to Israel from Britain and Germany and had no knowledge that someone using their identity had visited Dubai. At around the same time it emerged that the Australian intelligence service was investigating the use of identities of at least three Australians. In a further development deeply embarrassing for the Canberra government the Australia foreign minister, Bob Carr, was forced to revise his claims that the Australian embassy in Tel Aviv knew nothing of the case until after Zygier died in prison in December 2010 when his family, a prominent Jewish family in Melbourne, asked for his body to be repatriated. Carr&apos;s office now admits that an Australian diplomat (who was not the ambassador) was aware that Zygier was being held. The case, however, remained encircled in a host of unanswered questions, as Zygier&apos;s family and friends in Australia remained tight-lipped about the circumstances of his death, refusing to discuss the case with the media.", "title": "Australia was investigating 'Mossad agent' Zygier who died in Israeli jail", "sentences": ["There is a feeling the Israelis don&apos;t play by the rules.&quot; Mossad&apos;s use of foreign passports became an international scandal not long before Zygier&apos;s secret arrest and detention when it was revealed that the spy agency had used almost a dozen foreign passports in its assassination of Hamas&apos;s Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, in a Dubai hotel, in January 2010.", "In seven cases it turned out that the passports used were in the name of Jews who had immigrated to Israel from Britain and Germany and had no knowledge that someone using their identity had visited Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-13T17:32:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/13/mossad-australian-spies-fairfax-katsoukis", "tags": ["The Mossad", "Israel", "World news", "Espionage", "Australia news", "Europe"], "article": "For Jason Katsoukis, the Australian journalist who first investigated allegations that Ben Zygier was a Mossad agent, the claims initially sounded &quot;outlandish&quot;. In 2009, while living in Jerusalem and filing stories to the Australian Fairfax group, Katsoukis was contacted by an anonymous source with connections to the intelligence world. The story that the source told over a series of conversations was indeed extraordinary. The source named three Australians with joint Israeli citizenship whom, he said, were working for a front company set up by Mossad in Europe selling electronic equipment to Iran and elsewhere. &quot;I was tipped off in October 2009,&quot; Katsoukis told the Guardian on Wednesday, recalling the events that would lead to his calling Zygier at his home in Jerusalem and accusing him of being an Israeli spy. &quot;The story was that Mossad was recruiting Australians to spy for them using a front company in Europe. It all seemed too good to be true. &quot;But what I was told seemed to check out. The company did exist. I also managed to establish that Zygier and another of the individuals had worked for it. I wasn&apos;t able to confirm the third name. &quot;I was told too that the Australian authorities were closing in on Zygier and that he might even be arrested. &quot;There was other stuff about Zygier. In Australia you can change your name once a year. He&apos;d done it four times I think, but they were beginning to get suspicious. I also found out that he had applied for a work visa for Italy in Melbourne.&quot; The repeated changes of name would have allowed Zygier to create new identities and multiple passports. While Katsoukis was working on the story \u2013 still uncertain if it stacked up \u2013 something happened that encouraged both his editors and Katsoukis himself to bring forward their contact with Zygier. In January 2010, a Mossad hit squad murdered the Hamas official Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, in Dubai. It emerged that the team had been supplied with false passports from a number of countries including Germany, Ireland and the UK, apparently confirming the very practice Katsoukis was investigating. &quot;The feeling was that we should go to Zygier and put the story to him. It wasn&apos;t difficult to find him. He&apos;d was back in Jerusalem so I called him at home. &quot;When I spoke to him he was incredulous at first and said fuck off \u2013 but what was interesting was that he did not hang up. He did soundly genuinely shocked. But he listened to what I had to say. &quot;I still wonder why he didn&apos;t hang up. He denied everything however. He said he hadn&apos;t visited the countries it had been claimed he had. I tried calling again but in the end he told me to buzz off.&quot; Katsoukis also spoke to the CEO of the alleged front company, and had an equally strange series of exchanges. &quot;He seemed a bit weird. He denied all knowledge of what I was talking about, but then wanted to talk to me again and make an arrangement to meet up.&quot; Still believing that the story sounded &quot;crazy&quot;, Katsoukis wanted to check with other sources. Among them was a senior government official he knew. To his surprise, when he was given the opportunity to knock the story down, this person instead appeared to confirm it.

Liverpool&apos;s appearance in St Petersburg will be Zenit&apos;s first competitive game since their largest supporters&apos; group, Landscrona, issued a manifesto that included calls for the club not to sign black players or &quot;any representatives of sexual minorities&quot;. That controversy and others, with Zenit fined by the Russian Football Union after a supporter offered a banana to Roberto Carlos, and a fake bomb left outside the training ground after the signing of Brazilian striker Hulk, prompted Liverpool managing director Ian Ayre to make public concerns that he also raised with Uefa. Rodgers said he would raise the potential problems with his squad before the Europa League round of 32 first leg. Liverpool insist their reaction to any abuse at the Petrovsky Stadium, however, including whether to walk off, should be led by European football&apos;s governing body, an organisation not known for taking a tough stance on racism. The Liverpool manager said: &quot;I&apos;ve never known a set of fans refuse to support black players but I have not spoken directly to the players at the moment; we still have a few meetings and I will make reference to it as we have some players who it could affect. Anything that goes on outside of that will be taken care of. &quot;No one in life wants to see anyone come under any sort of scrutiny like that. We hope the officials and Uefa can take care of all that side. There&apos;s no doubt if there is anything untoward we will do everything as a football club to stand behind those players it may affect. It&apos;s a social issue, not a football one. We as a football club and in Britain have done a lot of work to prevent racism. It&apos;s a social aspect of life. No matter your race, colour or creed, everyone is equal.&quot; Glen Johnson, Andre Wisdom and Raheem Sterling have all travelled to Russia and Rodgers had no hesitation taking players who may be targeted by Zenit supporters. Equally, however, he could have been accused of succumbing to potential racism if he had left the players on Merseyside. &quot;I didn&apos;t think of leaving anyone out,&quot; he said. &quot;These are young players who have experienced this in their lives before so we are going into a sporting arena and everyone from football, Uefa and referees, will support any player it may affect. I didn&apos;t think of it too much because they want to play and some are young players progressing. &quot;Glen Johnson has a lot of experience.

Zenit have won the Russian title for the past two seasons under Luciano Spalletti, though they entered the winter break five points behind leaders CSKA Moscow, and have not played a competitive fixture since early December. &quot;That might not be to their advantage,&quot; said Rodgers. &quot;They have played five friendly games since December in training camps [in Dubai and Turkey] and we had those games covered. It was important for us to do our work on them as much as possible. I don&apos;t think their fitness will be affected by the winter break, but there is no doubt that if you are out of competitive football for a while the first few games back in can be difficult.

The 11-strong gang laundered more than a million euros per year since mid-2011, sending money back to Russia. The leader, a 27-year-old Russian, was arrested while on holiday in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in December on an international arrest warrant. Spain is seeking his extradition. On Wednesday the rest of the group \u2013 six Russians, two Ukrainians and two Georgians \u2013 were rounded up by Spanish police in the Costa del Sol. The arrests point to the growing cooperation between private organisations with hi-tech expertise in identifying the source of some of the commercial &quot;malware&quot; used to infect computers and steal data or persuade people to hand over money, and police organisations in multiple countries which have insufficient time or resources to perform that analysis themselves. The latest arrests were helped by the security company Trend Micro, but in other cases Microsoft and the security companies Symantec and F-Secure have played major roles in pointing to the locations of criminal gangs. The &quot;Ransomware&quot; virus would freeze Windows PCs and then display messages on the screen claiming to be from police authorities, including Europol, which said that the user had been fined \u20ac100 for accessing file sharing, child pornography or terrorist sites. Researchers from security company Trend Micro, who were pivotal in tracking down the origin of the software, said there were 48 different variations of the virus in use. Early versions of the software were first seen in Russia in 2005, but the gang refined it so that it would display appropriate logos for the police in which country the user&apos;s PC was being used. Europol director Rob Wainwright \u2013 whose name was used in the scam \u2013 estimated that &quot;hundreds of thousands&quot; of European had been affected by the scam. &quot;If we take into account that the average fine was \u20ac100 ($130) and 3% \u2026 paid it, then the estimated damage is millions of euros,&quot; he said. Spanish police said in a statement that since first discovering the virus in May 2011 they had received 1,200 complaints \u2013 but that the number affected was &quot;certainly much higher&quot;. The 10 men arrested on Wednesday were used for the money laundering, while the 27-year-old was behind the virus&apos;s design. The money laundering system involved a system known as PaySafeCard/UKash vouchers, to which the &quot;ransom&quot; was paid, and which was then sent from the US to the gang in Spain, where they converted it into ready cash and wired the money to Russia. Trend Micro said: &quot;This coordinated activity \u2013 in much the same way as the Trend Micro/FBI action against the DNS Changer gang in 2011 \u2013 leading directly to the arrest of individuals believed to be actively engaged in cybercrime, rather than simply taking down associated infrastructure, should serve as a model for how the security industry and law enforcement can effectively cooperate int he fight against online crime.&quot;", "title": "Russian-led cybergang broken by police", "sentences": ["The leader, a 27-year-old Russian, was arrested while on holiday in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates in December on an international arrest warrant."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-13T22:15:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/13/prisoner-x-israel-admits-holing-australian", "tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "The Mossad", "Australia news", "Asia Pacific", "Benjamin Netanyahu", "World news"], "article": "In the midst of an escalating international row with Australia, the Israeli government has been forced to admit that it secretly imprisoned a &quot;dual-nationality&quot; citizen \u2013 known as &quot;Prisoner X&quot; \u2013 who subsequently killed himself while being detained in Ayalon prison.     Ben Zygier. Photograph: ABC TV    Prisoner X has widely been reported as being 34-year-old Ben Zygier, who had both Australian and Israeli citizenship and has been described as an agent of Israel&apos;s external intelligence agency, the Mossad, who was arrested in Israel in 2010 on serious but unspecified charges. The information was released after a draconian gag order preventing reporting of the case in Israel was partially lifted by a court on Wednesday evening after media and political pressure. According to reports earlier in the week, Zygier had been held in circumstances of such secrecy and isolation that even his prison guards did not know his identity or alleged offence. The document released admitted that an inmate was registered under a false identity &quot;for security reasons&quot;, but added that his family in Australia \u2013 who have refused to comment on the case \u2013 were notified immediately upon his arrest. It added that the secret detention of Prisoner X was authorised by the most senior officials in Israel&apos;s justice ministry; and that the prisoner \u2013 referred to as &quot;John Doe&quot; \u2013 had been represented by three Israeli lawyers. The document did not make clear either the charge he faced or whether the lawyers were appointed by the state in secret. Israel&apos;s belated admission of the existence of Prisoner X follows a two-year effort to gag any media reporting about the controversial case which saw the office of Israel&apos;s prime minister, Binyamin Netanyahu, threaten editors with fines or jail if they disclosed details about the case earlier this week. That effort backfired as Israel faced a deluge of embarrassing revelations about the case which appeared to expose the detailed workings of its overseas intelligence agency in the most graphic detail, as well as the growing irritation of Israel&apos;s allies over the Mossad&apos;s behaviour. The disclosure came at the end of a day of extraordinary new details about the alleged double life of Zygier. It emerged that Zygier had been confronted shortly before his arrest by Australian journalist Jason Koutsoukis of Fairfax newspapers, who accused him of being a spy. Koutsoukis told the Guardian Zygier had been identified to him as one of three Australian-Israeli citizens working for the Mossad under the cover of a European front company that sold electronic equipment to Iran. He also said Zygier was under investigation by the Australian intelligence services and was close to being arrested for using his Australian passport for espionage. As the scandal over Zygier&apos;s treatment and suicide in Israel&apos;s Ayalon prison continued to grow, the Australian government was forced to admit that Israeli officials had briefed Australian diplomats over the case. Previously it had been claimed they knew nothing of Zygier&apos;s detention and death until his family asked for help to repatriate his body. In an embarrassing about-face on Thursday, Australia&apos;s foreign minister, Bob Carr, said his country had been made aware of Zygier&apos;s detention in February 2010. He said Australia had been given assurances by Israeli intelligence sources about Zygier&apos;s safety.  &quot;The Israeli government further advised the Australian government the individual would be treated in accordance with his lawful rights as an Israeli citizen,&quot; Carr said.\u00a0&quot;The Australian government relied on these assurances. At no stage during his detention did the Australian government receive any request from the individual or his family to extended consular support.\u00a0&quot;The Australian government was advised through intelligence on 16 December 2010 of this individual&apos;s death on the previous day and the deceased family had been notified by Israeli authorities.&quot;\u00a0According to the secretary of Australia&apos;s department of foreign affairs, Peter Varghese, who is carrying out a review of how the Zygier case was handled, the Australian embassy in Tel Aviv had not been involved in the Zygier case but instead communications were carried out through intelligence channels. \u00a0&quot;The decision to continue communications through intelligence channels rather than to deal with this as a more normal consular case, can only I assume reflect a judgment that, given the nature of this case and that the charges pertained to national security issues, the more effective means of continuing to communicate would be through intelligence channels,&quot; Varghese told a Senate committee. Carr said a review would be conducted of his department&apos;s handling of the prisoner, who was found hanged in an Israeli prison cell in 2010. In Israel, meanwhile, the media was on Wednesday able to report parts of the story for the first time after the government partially lifted its ban on reporting any details of Zygier&apos;s imprisonment, imposed by an Israeli court after his arrest. The case has triggered demands by Israeli opposition politicians, human rights groups and sections of the media for Netanyahu&apos;s government to supply more information about his imprisonment and death, and to reform its antiquated and authoritarian military censorship rules. Zygier, who was married to an Israeli and had two young children, was found hanged in his cell in late 2010. His body was flown to Melbourne for burial the following week. While the case remains murky, the new revelations will be deeply embarrassing to the Mossad, not least because they shed new light on how the Israeli spy agency acquires cover identities for agents. In the last three years the Mossad department charged with providing cover identities has been caught out in a series of high-profile bungles as it has been found to have been improperly using foreign passports for its operations. According to Australian media reports, Zygier had applied for Australian passports using three identities over the years \u2013 those of Ben Alon, Ben Allen and Benjamin Burrows. It is still not clear whether he was actively working for the Mossad, or whether he simply acquired passports for the spy agency to use in its overseas operations. There has also been no official explanation from Israel for why Zygier was secretly imprisoned without trial, and information on his case ruthlessly suppressed. But speculation is growing that he may have offered to provide information to a foreign power. Zygier, known as Benji, was approached by Koutsoukis shortly before his arrest in 2010 and asked whether he was an Israeli spy after being accused of travelling back to Australia to change his name and obtain a new Australian passport. At the time Zygier said: &quot;I have never been to any of those countries that you say I have been to, I am not involved in any kind of spying. That is ridiculous.&quot; In recent years the issue of the Mossad operations involving citizens of friendly nations and use of passports of allies has become a source of serious friction with governments usually friendly with Israel. &quot;There are informal rules,&quot; said one person familiar with intelligence co-operation arrangements. &quot;You inform your allies if you want to speak to someone or do something. There is a feeling the Israelis don&apos;t play by the rules.&quot; The Mossad&apos;s use of foreign passports led to an international storm not long before Zygier&apos;s secret arrest and detention when it was revealed that the spy agency had used almost a dozen such passports in its assassination of Hamas&apos;s Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, in a Dubai hotel, in January 2010. In seven cases it turned out that the passports used were in the name of Jews who had moved to Israel from Britain and Germany and had no knowledge someone using their identity had visited Dubai. In a further deeply embarrassing development for the Canberra government, Carr was forced to revise his claims that the Australian embassy in Tel Aviv knew nothing of the case until after Zygier died when his family, a prominent Jewish family in Melbourne, asked for his body to be repatriated. Carr&apos;s office now admits an Australian diplomat (not the ambassador) was aware Zygier was being held. The case has provoked a host of unanswered questions, as Zygier&apos;s family and friends in Australia remained tight-lipped about the circumstances of his death, refusing to discuss the case with the media.", "title": "Israel admits it was holding Prisoner X after court eases gagging order", "sentences": ["There is a feeling the Israelis don&apos;t play by the rules.&quot; The Mossad&apos;s use of foreign passports led to an international storm not long before Zygier&apos;s secret arrest and detention when it was revealed that the spy agency had used almost a dozen such passports in its assassination of Hamas&apos;s Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, in a Dubai hotel, in January 2010.", "In seven cases it turned out that the passports used were in the name of Jews who had moved to Israel from Britain and Germany and had no knowledge someone using their identity had visited Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-14T04:12:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/feb/14/sammys-great-escape-review", "tags": ["Animation", "Film", "Culture"], "article": "This 3D animation from Belgium (actually a sequel to an earlier film called Sammy&apos;s Adventures) is really\u00a0nothing more than a cut-rate knockoff of the 2003 Pixar-Disney classic Finding Nemo.

Something a bit odd is happening this season. Bradford are in the League Cup final. So are Swansea. Top-flight teams are outnumbered 9-6 in the FA Cup fifth-round draw \u2013 and it could end up 10-6 if Brentford beat Chelsea in their delayed fourth-round replay. Luton have become only the sixth non-league side since the Second World War to reach this stage and still want to go further. &quot;It&apos;s such a buzz,&quot; their captain, Ronnie Henry, says. &quot;When you&apos;re young, you dream of winning the FA Cup. Who knows?&quot; There is only one all-Premier League tie in the fifth round, giving lower-division teams a great chance to challenge assumptions of top-flight supremacy. On the other hand, the natural order could be restored emphatically. Simon Burnton 2) Can Chelsea write another chapter in the tales of Frankie&apos;s Magic Football? The FA Cup is often spoken about in terms better suited to fiction. There are storybook or fairytale endings, the killing of giants and an inanimate silver-plated object that is imbued with &quot;magic&quot; or &quot;romance&quot;. All grist to the mill for a writer like Frank Lampard, whose deal to pen a series of children&apos;s books called Frankie&apos;s Magic Football was announced this week. &quot;I first had the idea of Frankie and his Magic Football when reading stories to my own children,&quot; Lampard said. &quot;I made up my own football stories and adventures.&quot; It seems as if his own football adventure will not end with Frankie and his club living happily ever after but a fourth Cup-winner&apos;s medal in five years would certainly make for a decent last chapter. SB 3) Playing catch-up That game at Stamford Bridge is the rogue fourth-round outlier on fifth-round weekend, with the clubs vying for the right to play at Middlesbrough on Wednesday week. The Bees have won one in five league games, though at least it was the last of them, against Stevenage on Tuesday night. &quot;As a group of players, we have not even discussed Chelsea,&quot; Tony Craig said after that game. &quot;I know it&apos;s a bit of a clich\u00e9 but we have just been focusing on each game as it comes.&quot; The Bees&apos; produced a splendid performance in the first game, twice leading on the way to a 2-2 draw. It seems all but certain that they will find life considerably more difficult at Stamford Bridge, against opponents who have reached three of the last four FA Cup finals. But Chelsea have kept only two clean sheets since Boxing Day and have a crowd prone to turning quickly against their manager. In the ultimate no-pressure tie could the Bees spring an upset? SB 4) Arsenal should not underestimate Blackburn Blackburn have had a pretty dismal season, continuing to be run as if for comic, rather than sporting, effect. But for the first time they can be considered to be in something approaching form \u2013 one defeat in their last 10 games, six of them won, and only a single goal conceded in their last four (and that a penalty). Suddenly they sit two places (but six points) outside the play-offs. Arsenal, in good form themselves, desperate for a trophy and with fond memories of the 7-1 pasting they handed out the last time Blackburn visited a year ago, would do well not to let thoughts of a place in the final eight get too entrenched too soon. SB 5) Will Liverpool beat a top-half team at last? To be the only Premier League teams playing on an FA Cup weekend is football&apos;s equivalent of placing the slowest child in class in a dunce&apos;s cap. Of course everyone knows that Liverpool are having a(nother) poor season and nobody has forgotten their fourth-round defeat at Oldham but the scheduling of their fixture against Swansea provides another reminder. Brendan Rodgers admits the timing of the game &quot;doesn&apos;t help us, if I&apos;m being honest&quot;, while Michael Laudrup is not helping with his insistence that Swansea &quot;go there with no pressure at all ... the pressure will be on Liverpool&quot;. And the home side cannot even use this week&apos;s trip to Zenit St Petersburg as an excuse for under-performing \u2013 Swansea have travelled even further, even if their visit to Dubai will have involved less competitive football and more topping-up of suntans than their opponents&apos; trip to Russia. After the hideousness of Monday&apos;s defeat by West Bromwich Albion Liverpool will hope to lay their top-half hoodoo here, in the knowledge that they will have only one more chance in the following six league games. SB 6) Watching the detectives So far this season underneath many fans&apos; radars a hit popular music act has performed at one FA Cup match each round (since the third round, anyway). The idea is that after the semi-finals the public will vote for their favourite performers, whose song will be played when the players emerge for the final. It&apos;s one hell of a prize, to be sure \u2013 Lethal Bizzle even said, &quot;It really would be a dream come true.&quot; There are signs, though, that this competition is no longer being treated with the utmost seriousness. After all, when Bizzle, rapper and distant relative of Arsenal&apos;s Emmanuel Frimpong, performed Not a Saint in round three he did so before a massive tie between West Ham and Manchester United. And when Devlin, rapper and brother of the former Sheffield United and Birmingham City ace Paul Devlin*, performed Sun Goes Down in round four he did so before the enormous 2011 FA Cup final rematch between Stoke and Manchester City. Yet when the Pigeon Detectives, anointed beat combo in round five, perform Animal this weekend, they will do so for anyone who has turned up at MK Dons v Barnsley a bit early. &quot;It&apos;s every schoolboy&apos;s dream to play in the FA Cup,&quot; says singer Matt Bowman in a bravura display of putting-on-a-brave-face and, &quot;while we&apos;re not lacing up our boots and running on to the pitch, it&apos;s still a massive buzz to be involved&quot;. SB * Actually not true. 7) Who at Manchester City is up for a fight? Looking ahead to this weekend&apos;s match against Leeds, Roberto Mancini told the Manchester Evening News that he was likely to make extensive changes to the side that beat themselves 3-1 at Southampton last week. &quot;I will change players,&quot; he promised. &quot;I only want players who are ready for the fight in the last 12 games. I am very angry with a lot of my players and very disappointed.&quot; So who, then, will be cast aside? SB 8) Ticket prices It is not uncommon for big teams to slash ticket prices when they face unglamorous opposition in the FA Cup, perhaps because fans are used to seeing more famous faces and perhaps because everyone knows they are not really giving the game their full attention. What is unusual this weekend is that the usual rules have been inverted and one of the lower-division teams find themselves desperately trying to flog seats to watch Premier League players. Huddersfield, of the Championship, are charging just \u00a310 for adults and a fiver for concessions in most of the ground, and \u00a315/\u00a38 in the posh seats, for the visit of Wigan \u2013 and you can buy tickets at the turnstiles. This seems the most likely source of an upset in round five but might the Terriers, three points off the bottom three and having appointed Mark Robins as their new manager on Thursday, decide that Tuesday&apos;s visit to Nottingham Forest is a more important occasion? SB 9) Jose Baxter Remember Jose Baxter? In Everton&apos;s first team at 16, hyped as the new Wayne Rooney. Whatever happened to the young forward? Well, he never quite made it at Goodison Park, a mooted move to Crystal Palace fell through and Baxter considered quitting football until Alan Stubbs, the former Everton centre-half, phoned him to ask what on earth was happening and how could he help. Stubbs persuaded Baxter not to give up, made some calls and got him a trial at Oldham. He passed and is scheduled to face David Moyes&apos;s team in the FA Cup at Boundary Park on Saturday evening. As Everton&apos;s Leighton Baines put it: &quot;Jose should still be in the Premier League, I can&apos;t understand why he isn&apos;t. We&apos;ll have to watch him.&quot; LT 10) Iain Dowie wandering down Sheepfoot Lane Oldham fans are keen on Dowie being appointed as Paul Dickov&apos;s replacement at managerless Oldham but there appear to be difficulties over salary and Dowie giving up his television work. In the meantime Tony Philliskirk will continue as caretaker against Everton in the FA Cup and the club affect a laid-back approach to this impasse. The Manchester Evening News has summed up the situation rather wonderfully. Its report on the matter reads as follows: &quot;In the same week that the Pope announced his intention to vacate the Vatican the sight of white smoke wafting up Sheepfoot Lane appears to be on the backburner as the battle to bring in a new manager shows no sign of heating up.&quot; LT", "title": "Ten things to watch for in the FA Cup and Premier League this weekend", "sentences": ["And the home side cannot even use this week&apos;s trip to Zenit St Petersburg as an excuse for under-performing \u2013 Swansea have travelled even further, even if their visit to Dubai will have involved less competitive football and more topping-up of suntans than their opponents&apos; trip to Russia."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-15T09:59:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/canneslions/bringing-cannes-to-the-uk", "tags": ["Cannes Lions"], "article": "As an official representative of Cannes Lions, the Guardian has the honour of appointing the UK contingent of the festival jury, as well as being able to put forward jury member nominations for EuroBest, Spikes Asia and Dubai Lynx.

City approach this game with renewed questions being posed over Roberto Mancini following last week&apos;s 3-1 defeat at Southampton but Leeds supporters would swap their situation greedily for the luxury of agonising about being second in the Premier League. After almost eight largely depressing years under Ken Bates&apos; control the Leeds hard core at a half-empty Elland Road hoped the takeover by GFH Capital, based in Dubai, owned in Bahrain, would be their version of City&apos;s Sheikh Mansour: multimillion-pound deliverance by a Middle East benefactor. Instead, eight weeks on, that optimism has crumpled for many into further disillusionment. Responding to the revelation by BBC Radio Leeds last week that they had turned down an offer from local businessmen \u2013 still unnamed \u2013 to buy a majority stake, GFH issued a statement professing they were &quot;thrilled&quot; with their January transfer window and &quot;delighted with the progress made&quot;. For most Leeds supporters the transfer window&apos;s loudest statement was the exit of their leading scorer, Luciano Becchio, following Bradley Johnson, Jonny Howson and Robert Snodgrass, in recent years, to Norwich City. Middling in the Championship, with play-off hopes faint as the manager, Neil Warnock, conceded on Friday, just over 19,000 watched the 1-0 home defeat by the leaders Cardiff City last week. Leeds lost again on Tuesday, 1-0 at Middlesbrough. In the same statement GFH acknowledged: &quot;We continue to seek strategic investors,&quot; an admission understood in West Yorkshire to mean the investment bank does not have sufficient money itself. David Haigh, the GFH Capital deputy chief executive, in England for Leeds business and the City match, and Salem Patel, the parent company GFH&apos;s chief investment officer speaking from the Gulf by telephone, accepted, in an in-depth interview with the Guardian, that they do not have Mansour-level backing. However they deny, as is widely believed by fans, that they began the long and arduous negotiations with Bates last summer representing a mega-rich backer who then pulled out. &quot;The money we paid to buy the club and to provide it with working capital since has come from us, our institutional investors and some smaller strategic investors,&quot; Patel said. &quot;There was never a single, hugely wealthy person with us. And we paid for the club with cash; we did not borrow money to buy it.&quot; Both men emphasised that, although Bates remains chairman until June, they have paid him in full. They stick to the confidentiality agreed when concluding the deal on 21 December, refusing to divulge how much they paid \u2013 it was less than the \u00a344m mooted then; figures from \u00a314m to \u00a323m are cited around Leeds, with more to pay if Leeds are successful. &quot;It is absolutely, categorically incorrect that we owe Ken Bates money,&quot; Haigh said. &quot;He is staying on as the chairman until June because that was the agreement we made.&quot; Their pitch to Leeds fans disillusioned because of that continued association and the lack of big money and evident change is partly to ask for patience. Patel and Haigh point to significant investment already made, say they are still reviewing the club&apos;s operations and do have planned improvements and that it will take time to revitalise the once mighty Leeds who have never recovered from the calamitous, over-borrowed financial collapse of 2001. Even before they concluded their takeover, GFH put \u00a32m in as working capital; Haigh says they have put substantial money in twice since, in November and on 21 December, and they say the club will need further support until the end of next season. Patel declines to confirm the \u00a34m figure doing the rounds of the Leeds grapevine as the cash needed now but does say that the club is short because Bates mortgaged season-ticket money to Ticketus for this season and next, receiving \u00a35m up front to pay for refurbishing work in the East Stand. Bates also sold the catering rights for five years, Leeds receiving \u00a32m plus a profit share from Compass catering, and as recently as October the club borrowed \u00a31.5m at 7% interest from the club&apos;s sponsor, Enterprise Insurance. &quot;There is a cashflow shortfall,&quot; Patel says. &quot;This is largely because more than \u00a313m has been spent on building projects, financed by selling things forward. We are supporting the club and will continue to but, once this is worked through, we can see a business which can operate without significant input from the owners.&quot; They argue they never promised to spend millions on transfers and envisage a more gradual rebuilding based on bringing through a fair crop of youth but they nevertheless believe their transfer window was sound. Becchio was not sold, as Leeds&apos; best players have mostly been in recent years, but swapped for Steve Morison, whom Warnock wanted. Stephen Warnock arrived from Aston Villa while the loans of Ryan Hall and Michael Tonge were converted to signings. Sam Byram, a 19-year-old bright light this season, signed an improved contract and El-Hadji Diouf extended his. &quot;A lot of people have criticised us for not spending money in January but we are supporting the club,&quot; says Patel. &quot;We wanted to reward and retain our best players and our goal is to build the club slowly but surely.&quot; Rather than be judged a crushing disappointment after eight weeks the men from Bahrain say they consider this a period of transition. Bates&apos; presence as chairman will end in June. Warnock&apos;s contract is also up at the end of the season. &quot;Whether Neil goes immediately then or not, when Neil goes we will look to appoint a young manager who will particularly work to build the young players into great players for the club,&quot; Patel says. &quot;We understand that many fans are disillusioned and we want to engage with their concerns; their loyalty is amazing to us. One complaint is high prices, so we have introduced cheaper deals&quot; \u2013 the &quot;Leeds for Less&quot; \u00a315 adult and \u00a35 children&apos;s tickets for the forthcoming Blackpool and Peterborough matches \u2013 &quot;which we hope the fans will take up.&quot; They are still seeking investment and would prefer to sell 30% to reduce their exposure, which rather signals how tight are the means with which they hope Leeds can be cheered up.

Tom Ince, though, must still serve a one-game suspension imposed in the wake of the controversial Under-21 play off against Serbia in Krusevac last October, which led to the host country also being punished for racist abuse and violent behaviour, after his attempt to overturn the original ruling failed. Outraged by what were widely perceived as enormously unjust bans for Caulker and Ince, the FA appealed on behalf of the pair, but Uefa counter-appealed in an attempt to increase the sanctions imposed on both Serbia and England. Serbia&apos;s Under-21 side must now play two, as opposed to one, games behind closed doors. Caulker&apos;s punishment, however, was reduced to a written warning in respect of the Tottenham centre-half&apos;s future conduct and an undertaking to perform one full day of community football service. Ince, the Blackpool winger, and Caulker made personal appearances at the appeal hearing at Uefa&apos;s headquarters in Switzerland, where they were accompanied by Stuart Pearce, the England Under-21 coach, and two FA legal representatives, including a Swiss lawyer. The fracas erupted after England&apos;s black players Ince, Nathan Delfouneso, Marvin Sordell and, most notably, Danny Rose were subjected to racist chants from Serbian supporters during the 1-0 win which ensured Pearce&apos;s side qualified for the finals in June. Ince will now miss England&apos;s opening match in that tournament against Italy. Uefa&apos;s disciplinary panel initially ordered Serbia to play their next competitive under-21 match behind closed doors, imposed individual suspensions on four Serbian players and two coaches and issued a \u00a365,000 fine on that country&apos;s FA, less than Nicklas Bendtner was forced to forfeit recently for displaying sponsored underpants. On Friday, however, Uefa \u2013 who heard audio linked evidence from Rose in Dubai, where the Tottenham loanee is warm weather training with Sunderland \u2013 proved partially successful in its appeals regarding Serbia&apos;s fitness coach Andreja Milutinovic who was banned for two years instead of one and Nikola Ninkovic, a player, suspended for three matches rather than two. Meanwhile, the FA reminded the hearing that Jack Butland, Pearce&apos;s goalkeeper, had been hit by assorted missiles, Steve Wigley, England&apos;s assistant coach, was kicked in the stomach and Martin Thomas, the goalkeeping coach, was headbutted.Pearce said: &quot;We respect Uefa&apos;s decision and we will now move on and focus on the finals tournament.

They had flocked east in the hope of unearthing gems to ease the hardship of the financial crisis \u2013 but however savage the economy might have felt at the time, their situation was about to become more brutal. Infantry, estimated to be 1,500 strong, supported by helicopters, descended on the area. As the freelance miners ran, soldiers and paramilitary police began firing AK-47s directly at those fleeing. More than 200 people in Chiadzwa, a previously peaceful but impoverished part of the Marange diamond zone, are thought to have been massacred. The purpose of the assault, campaigners say, was to clear the diamond fields and hand control to the military. The WikiLeaks cables record James\u00a0D\u00a0McGee, US ambassador to Zimbabwe, filing this report on 7 January 2009. &quot;[An official] met with Newman Chiadzwa, the tribal chief of the Chiadzwa region that contains the diamond-rich Marange fields, to discuss violence in the region as well as recent developments in the turbulent Marange diamond trade. Chiadzwa described how the military expansion in Chiadzwa in late November has been displacing the police and diverting the diamond flow from the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe to the Zimbabwean military.&quot; The Zimbabwean embassy did not respond to requests for comment. Clearly these assaults will forever haunt those involved, but four and a half years after the nightmare in Marange, the issue remains current: this week, the European Union will review the sanctions it imposes on Zimbabwe, which could result in a lifting of restrictions, despite protests from the UK. Simultaneously, UK parliamentarians are calling for tougher measures against all Marange diamond miners, including naming them on the sanctions list, as well as asking for an investigation into one major City name \u2013 FTSE 100 financial services firm Old Mutual \u2013 that has an indirect investment in the Zimbabwean fields. Kate Hoey, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on Zimbabwe, said Marange diamond companies were &quot;suspected of directing millions of dollars to corrupt and violent interests associated with Zanu-PF,&quot; adding: &quot;Old Mutual needs to be investigated for a potential breach of sanctions.&quot; Hoey said it was a stakeholder in one of the shareholders in Marange miner Mbada Diamonds &quot;and was therefore effectively in a joint venture with a sanctioned entity \u2013 the Zimbabwe Mining Development Corporation [ZMDC]. We cannot allow a British company to behave like this.&quot; Old Mutual, which opened its first office in Harare 86 years ago, indirectly holds a 1.5% stake in Mbada Diamonds, after investing its clients&apos; funds in a 6% stake in a scrap metal company, New Reclamation Group (NRG). NRG subsequently acquired 25% of Mbada, while a further 50% of the diamond company is controlled by ZMDC, a state-owned company on HM Treasury&apos;s sanction list because of its close association to President Robert Mugabe&apos;s Zanu-PF party. A spokesman for Old Mutual said: &quot;Our holding in this investment is legal and we would never knowingly take action that did break any laws.&quot; He added that Mbada had passed the &quot;Kimberley Process&quot; \u2013 the international agreement established in 2003 to prevent &quot;conflict diamonds&quot; from entering the mainstream rough diamond market \u2013 and that an Old Mutual investigation had found &quot;no human rights abuses&quot; since the company had been formed. &quot;In our view, our involvement should be good for Zimbabwe,&quot; he said. &quot;We will stay in this investment, while, like all our investments, keeping it under review.&quot; Sanctions experts said that in most circumstances an indirect investment in a company part-owned by a company on the sanctions list was unlikely to be illegal. However, Old Mutual&apos;s position on the mine&apos;s human rights record is being directly challenged. In July 2011, the campaign group Human Rights Watch (HRW) interviewed 10 miners in Marange who claimed to have been mauled by dogs and beaten by private security guards. They claimed that the majority of incidents involved guards working for Mbada. One miner said: &quot;The Mbada guards are the worst. They don&apos;t hesitate to set the dogs upon you and they also beat you up.&quot; The campaign group reported another incident in which Mbada private security guards set four dogs on a handcuffed artisanal miner caught digging for diamonds close to the company&apos;s mines. &quot;I was attacked by all of them,&quot; said the man. &quot;The dogs were biting me and I was screaming. It was terrible.&quot; Mbada did not respond to repeated requests for comment on HRW&apos;s research. Old Mutual declined to say if it had contacted the campaign group but added: &quot;We have engaged with a number of stakeholders and NGOs regarding the Mbada mine. In addition, the independent directors of our Old Mutual life company in South Africa conducted an extensive on-site visit of the mine last year and are confident that human rights are being respected at Mbada.&quot; Old Mutual declined to identify which NGOs it had approached, however. And some believe these debates represent only a fraction of a wider issue. Roy Bennett, treasurer general of the Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), which since 2009 has shared power in Zimbabwe with its rival Zanu-PF, said: &quot;The broader immorality of the move is clear to any fair-minded person. First, mining rights were stolen by the government and handed over to Mbada. Second, their control of the area was secured on the basis of egregious human rights violations; Mbada was the direct beneficiary of this. And third, the operations of Mbada and the revenue generated by it has been completely opaque.&quot; Nor does Mbada&apos;s accreditation under the Kimberley Process impress everybody in the diamond trade. The jeweller Tiffany&apos;s states: &quot;We have advised all of our business partners of our zero tolerance policy for diamonds of Marange origins.&quot; Meanwhile, the campaign group Global Witness, which was one of the key bodies behind the original establishment of the Kimberley Process, left the scheme in December 2011. It claims the process &quot;has failed to address state-sponsored violence in the Marange diamond fields and resisted calls for reform&quot;, and it has also raised concerns that &quot;Mbada Diamonds \u2026 has a complex structure, with associated companies located in secrecy jurisdictions including Mauritius, Hong Kong, British Virgin Islands and Dubai.&quot; Mbada did not respond to questions. However, Old Mutual said: &quot;Mbada&apos;s remittances to the treasury and other relevant government departments are audited by KPMG on an ongoing basis. This has established that all remittances from Mbada related to royalty payments, reserve depletion fees, taxation and dividends sent to the Zimbabwean treasury are substantial and in line with existing agreements and regulations. &quot;As you are no doubt aware, Tendai Biti, the secretary general of the MDC, heads the Zimbabwean treasury. We also sought guidance from the MDC in Zimbabwe, and were given assurances by Morgan Tsvangirai, the president of the MDC, and Tendai Biti that they want Old Mutual to maintain its indirect investment in the mine. The MDC is clear that the revenues from the Mbada diamond mine will help finance Zimbabwe&apos;s recovery.&quot; Or, as Douglas Mwonzora, the MDC&apos;s spokesman, puts it: &quot;The MDC&apos;s position is that all diamond mines should be nationalised.&quot; Like all things in the diamond trade, it depends which way you cut it.", "title": "Death, sanctions and big business   in the struggle for Zimbabwe's diamonds", "sentences": ["It claims the process &quot;has failed to address state-sponsored violence in the Marange diamond fields and resisted calls for reform&quot;, and it has also raised concerns that &quot;Mbada Diamonds \u2026 has a complex structure, with associated companies located in secrecy jurisdictions including Mauritius, Hong Kong, British Virgin Islands and Dubai.&quot; Mbada did not respond to questions."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-17T00:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/feb/17/roberto-mancini-manchester-city-leeds-united", "tags": ["Roberto Mancini", "Manchester City", "FA Cup", "Football", "Leeds United", "Sport", "FA Cup 2012-13"], "article": "     Roberto Mancini hopes Manchester City&apos;s 4-0 win over Leeds United that secured their place in the FA Cup sixth round is the &quot;brodino&quot;, or soup-starter, to a comeback in their title defence.

Goals from Yaya Tour\u00e9 and Carlos Tevez plus a Sergio Ag\u00fcero double gave City a first win in four matches, though by the time Chelsea are welcomed on Sunday they could be 15 points off the pace as Manchester United play the day before. Asked if the win could help kick-start City&apos;s challenge, Mancini said: &quot;In Italy we say a game like this is a brodino \u2013 a starter. I hope it can happen that we start to win in the Premier League again.&quot; The Italian is unfazed that his side might be 15 points behind United when Chelsea visit. &quot;This is possible, but I think we should always be confident in ourselves, even when we&apos;re 12 points behind at this moment,&quot; he said. &quot;We lost seven points in [our last] three games and this can happen for any team. But now they [United] play a lot of games, at this moment they deserve to stay there because they have been better than us and scored more goals than us.&quot; Mancini is hopeful that the FA Cup can again be won following their 2011 triumph. Of the victory over Leeds, he said: &quot;I&apos;m happy because it was important to win after Southampton \u2013 the FA Cup is difficult. We started this game very well, we started very quickly and scored two goals, after [that] it was easier. Arsenal showed this yesterday [in being knocked out]. Every game in the FA Cup is difficult if you don&apos;t have a good approach. &quot;Every team plays like it&apos;s a Champions League final. The FA Cup is an important trophy in England because you should play 100% if you want to win.&quot; Ag\u00fcero&apos;s double took him to 13 goals for the season, Tevez&apos;s strike made it 10 for him, and with City having scored 14 fewer than United in the league, Mancini hopes their form can be consistent. &quot;Our strikers need to continue to score like they did today,&quot; he said. &quot;If they do that, we can have other chances. I hope Sergio will be like this from now to the end of the season because if he is and our other strikers continue to score until the end, then I think the championship isn&apos;t finished.&quot; Kompany and Gareth Barry, who was unavailable because of a foot problem, should return to face Chelsea. &quot;Gareth was nothing, I think he will be ready,&quot; Mancini said. &quot;We hope we can recover Vinny for the next game.&quot; He said of Javi Garc\u00eda, who was replaced in the second half: &quot;We will see tomorrow or Tuesday, I don&apos;t think it&apos;s big problem.&quot; Neil Warnock, the Leeds manager, suggested his future may be in doubt under the club&apos;s Dubai-based owner, GFH Capital.

But looking down from my small plane, I thought how the popular media narrative of militia and smugglers of conflict gold in isolation from the desires and consumption of developing and developed nations did not ring true. Based in Bunia for a week, my journey took me through the small towns of Iga Barrier\u00e9 and Kobu, north of Bunia, and past the new Chinese gold mining concession and eventually to the highly controversial AngloGold Ashanti mine near Mongbwalu. I wanted to review and understand peace building in the war torn DRC and its relationship with artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) and my guide was Henri Ladyi, co-ordinator of the Centre for Resolution Conflicts (CRC), a partner of Peace Direct. An inspirational man, Ladyi lost his father in a rebel attack before joining a militia to protect his family before finally becoming a peacemaker. The situation is &quot;calm but volatile&quot;, I was told. Gold fever only adds to the madness. Inadequate OECD efforts CRC has chosen to take a pro-active stance on the issue of conflict minerals and has identified employment of former combatants across towns and villages in eastern DRC as key to reducing or de-escalating the conflict. It&apos;s a markedly different approach to the OECD&apos;s top-down process for governing the export of conflict minerals \u2013 or &quot;due diligences in supply chain management&quot; \u2013 which doesn&apos;t address the root causes of an ethnic conflict in which gold can easily be used to fund the violence. The OECD conflict minerals process deals with the fruit, not the root of the problem. It has created a set of recommended procedures that only corporate mining companies can afford to follow, rather than address the majority employed by the gold trade, namely the small-scale miners. In Ituri, small-scale gold miners and former combatants have never heard of the OECD, or transparency or supply chain management. Nevermind have the ability to read a complex UN-style report. All they know is that they currently sell their gold to traders and its final destination is Bunia. Exercising our moral outrage at the appalling conflict that has to date claimed 5.5 million lives by boycott isn&apos;t the answer; we risk removing the population&apos;s ability to earn a living in an honest fashion, and which forces the same people to militia activity or illegal smuggling to earn a living. Or as one mining leader in North Kivu wrote in response to the Enough Project&apos;s call to boycott eastern DRC minerals: &quot;We will die by the bullet or die of starvation&quot;. It remains to be seen if the OECD due diligences on conflict minerals will work, but its clear that currently, it&apos;s just another CSR badge that the World Gold Counsel, the London Bullion Market Association and the Responsible Jewellery Council corporate members, can add to their collection. Small-scale and artisanal miners CRC asks whether responsible and well-organised small-scale mining by former combatants can lead to genuine peaceful and sustainable transformation? My work securing traceable gold in Columbia showed me the benefits in certified Fairtrade gold programmes. But Peru is not the DRC and it&apos;s a fledgling process that has harder goals than the blowing up and crushing that their large-scale mining cousins do to satisfy the greed of stock markets and bank vaults. To describe the artisanal gold fields of Africa as chaotic is to understate a reality more akin to one of Dante&apos;s circles of hell. Small-scale mining is the second biggest employer on the planet, with a global workforce of 100m. There are sad stories of fraud and lost opportunities. In Iga Barrier\u00e9, local miners lost 40kg of gold after a Korean called &apos;Mr Dave&apos; dazzled them with a mechanised processing unit, which they used to mine for a month, before he disappeared. The first thing you notice about any small-scale mine site is a constant humming of mechanised water pumps and generators followed by the noise of countless workers, digging and hauling up pans of soil to be panned and washed. All this is backbreaking, dirty, noisy, insecure and dangerous work carried out on the promise of payment plus a daily meal until the gold is delivered. It is mind-boggling how the sheer muscle of humanity, driven on by the primeval urge to survive can move tonnes of earth every hour and in doing so carve vast ravines out hillsides, re-direct river courses, and sculpt entirely new landscapes as they pursue gold veins. But to truly understand the ASM sector you need to look beneath the obvious of environmental mismanagement, systemic mercury usage and child labour issues to understand the hidden driver of money and survival. Day-to-day work as a small-scale miner I talked to lots of miners and traders in the towns I visited. They all told the same basic story, best illustrated by one miner I spoke to in Kobu. He borrows money from a local trader which allows him to open up a small pit and employ a group of local diggers, maybe as many as forty a pit. The diggers move the soil until they hit the gold bearing rock or start to wash the gold from the river sands. If he digs rock he will also be loaned some mercury to amalgam the gold from the rock dust. Once this gold is extracted, he pays the trader back in gold, plus interest, which can be as much as 30% to 50%. He is then obliged to then sell the remaining gold to the same trader at discounted rates on the international fix, determined by weight and purity. The trader determines purity through a process called &apos;acid burning&apos; where the gold is heated and melted to liquid and burned with acid to remove any material that is not gold. After selling the remaining gold he then pays 30% of his income to Kilomoto, the government mining group, as license for working on their concession, before paying his workers. From pit to closing the deal, he manages a myriad of different quasi-official interests; payments to the police, the Congolese security service, soldiers, the local government office, local chiefs, the environmental office as well as the hydro carbon tax (he actually offsets his carbon omissions) and anyone else who may have the power to stop him from mining \u2013 if he is left with as much as $3,000 from a $50,000 transaction for 1kg of gold he will feel himself fortunate. When you ask him why he does it he simply replies: &quot;It is all I know how to do, and I earn just enough per month to feed my family&quot;. It is little wonder then people in the DRC don&apos;t benefit. Since OECD measures to stem the flow of conflict metals, the UN Security Council has concluded that official export figures for eastern DRC were falling rather than increasing. However well intentioned the OECD&apos;s due diligences, smuggling is clearly on the increase, which will only lead to more insecurity and violence. Everyone wants conflict-free gold, none more so than the exploited miners. But influenced by the corporates, the OECD&apos;s top-down guidelines have framed a solution that seems to be adding to the already highly complex problem rather than making it better. The UN report estimated that three tonnes of gold was illicity sold to the international market in 2010. Uganda is the principle destination, which ends up in the Dubai refineries and eventually in India and China. China is the world&apos;s biggest jewellery manufacturer with several of the UK&apos;s leading high street jewellery brands manufacturing their collections there. There is no doubt in my mind, given the lack of enforceable traceability in the gold supply chain, that smuggled gold that funds conflicts is making its way into jewellery in the UK high street. The National Association of Goldsmiths and the British Jewellers Association are due to report on the state of the UK gold industry, but more needs to be done to assure consumers they are not funding conflicts, war and violence.

All of them are in purposeful poses, idealised workers cast in bronze. Around the statue base run the words &quot;labour&quot;, &quot;courage&quot; and &quot;progress&quot;. Its structure feels like something from the Soviet Union in the 30s. But the statue is British and only eight years old. Its subject and design, slightly startling in a country that stopped celebrating most factory workers decades ago, is explained by a small plaque.

No job losses. Stuff the Tories.&quot;) This week, David Cameron&apos;s much-hyped trade visit to India is promoting the Typhoon as one of its key objectives. Robin Cook, the late Labour minister, a rare defence industry critic in Westminster, wrote in his 2004 diaries that the then chairman of BAE, Dick Evans, seemed to have &quot;the key to the garden door of No 10&quot;. Roger Johnston, a defence analyst at Edison Investment Research, says: &quot;As an industry, it is reasonably unique in how it&apos;s viewed within government.&quot; In this business, in defiance of the past three decades&apos; free-market orthodoxies, the state is pivotal. Accompanying Cameron in India are representatives of a dozen British or partly British-based companies \u2013 the industry is clever at blurring such definitions \u2013 with defence interests: Rolls-Royce, Serco, BAE, EADS, Thales, Atkins, Cobham, JCB, Strongfield Technologies, MBDA, Ultra Electronics. The British state is also the industry&apos;s biggest customer, with our armed forces accounting for four-fifths of its annual sales; the provider of an &quot;export support team&quot;, including &quot;serving British army personnel&quot;; the provider of export insurance, for a fee, in case foreign customers fail to pay for products. Above all, the state is the provider of the wars that act as the industry&apos;s best showcase. &quot;The Typhoon fighter jet performed outstandingly in Libya,&quot; said Cameron in December, before an official visit to the Middle East. &quot;So it&apos;s no surprise that Oman want to add this aircraft to their fleet.&quot; On landing in the wealthy Gulf state, he strode quickly from his prime ministerial plane, in front of the TV cameras, to where a pair of dart-like Typhoons had been specially parked in the perfect, sales-catalogue sunshine, barely a hundred yards away. He climbed a set of steps to the open cockpit of one\u00a0of the fighters, and held a stagey conversation with its pilot. That day, it was confirmed that Oman had bought a\u00a0dozen of the aircraft. &quot;Boosting exports is vital for economic growth, and that&apos;s why I&apos;m doing all I can to promote British business \u2026 so [it] can thrive in the global race,&quot; said Cameron on the eve of his Oman trip. &quot;Every country in the world has a right to self-defence, and I&apos;m determined to put Britain&apos;s first-class defence industry at the forefront of this market, supporting 300,000 jobs across the country.&quot; Despite leading an overcommitted, often embattled government, he has frequently found time for foreign visits with a defence exports element. He has been to India before, in July 2010; Egypt and Kuwait in February 2011; Saudi Arabia in January 2012; Indonesia, Japan, Burma, Malaysia and Singapore in April 2012; Brazil in September 2012; and Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Abu Dhabi in November 2012. Throughout, his salesmanship and justifying rhetoric have been strikingly unashamed. &quot;The PM has done a fantastic job,&quot; says Howard Wheeldon, director of policy for ADS, a defence trade body. &quot;He has picked up the value of defence to the national economy. Other PMs haven&apos;t, necessarily. Mrs T was very supportive of defence exports \u2026 Brown wasn&apos;t, but Blair was \u2026&quot; Kaye Stearman, of the British activist group Campaign Against Arms Trade (CAAT) says: &quot;We&apos;re quite gobsmacked. For decades, governments have promoted arms sales, but there was always some degree of embarrassment \u2026 The\u00a0coalition are much more blatant \u2013 quite shameless.&quot; Last March Peter Luff, the minister for defence equipment \u2013 the position itself is telling \u2013 said in a speech in London: &quot;The individual UK armed forces are in themselves a brand \u2026 If they are using a particular piece of kit, then that&apos;s the kind of endorsement a lot of companies are very keen indeed to have.&quot; In 2011, the then defence secretary Liam Fox said in a speech at Defence and Security Equipment International, a huge biennial trade fair held at the ExCel Centre in east London: &quot;Defence and security exports play a key role in promoting our foreign policy objectives: building relationships \u2026 and spreading values.&quot; This April, a Royal Navy frigate is scheduled to arrive in Tripoli in Libya, reportedly with British companies exhibiting on board for a Whitehall-backed &quot;defence and security industry day&quot;. Even government policy on the London Olympics has produced a pay-off for the defence business. The brand of missiles controversially deployed around the Olympic site, Starstreak, made by Thales in Belfast, was sold to\u00a0Thailand four months later. John Warehand of Thales says the London deployment was a factor in the sale, and is still contributing to &quot;interest&quot; in\u00a0the missiles &quot;from countries in the Middle East and Asia&quot;.

Photograph: Lewis Whyld/PA Archive/Press Association Ima    With the government desperate for economic growth, and seemingly just as quick as its recent predecessors to involve Britain in overseas conflicts, the defence industry&apos;s position is in some ways stronger than ever. Last month, Cameron suggested that if he was re-elected in 2015 British military spending would be exempt from the seemingly endless austerity planned for every other branch of government. But how important is the defence industry to Britain really? The assertion that it supports &quot;300,000 jobs&quot;, repeated like a mantra in recent years by Cameron, trade unions with defence members and the industry itself, is less conclusive than it appears. It is 1% of the UK workforce. According to the government-run UK Trade &amp; Investment (UKTI), almost twice as many Britons work in food and drink manufacturing. And according to Ian Prichard of CAAT, the 300,000 figure is an exaggeration: &quot;It includes all the ancillary services connected with defence, such as the people looking after the [ministry of] defence estates. The actual defence industry workforce is, maximum, 215,000, and could well be 30,000 or 40,000 less.&quot; In 2003, Tony Blair told a prime ministerial press conference: &quot;There are roughly 100,000 jobs in this country that depend on defence or associated industries.&quot; The figure of 300,000, says CAAT, is also based on six-year-old government statistics. Conveniently for the industry, an official tally is no longer kept, for the defence workforce has been shrinking for decades: from 750,000 in 1980 in the nervous final phase of the cold war, according to the Defence Manufacturers Association, to 475,000 in 1989 as the Berlin Wall came down, to 350,000 in 1997 when Blair came to power. Despite Cameron&apos;s efforts, Johnston says the workforce will &quot;probably continue to trend down&quot;. The industry remains important by\u00a0global standards. After the US, the world&apos;s biggest defence exporter in 2011, with a 35% market share, Britain came second, with a 15% share, narrowly ahead of Russia and France, according to UKTI. There are only a few other businesses \u2013 such as pharmaceuticals and pop music \u2013 where Britain is still so internationally prominent. Yet like other defence statistics, this ranking should be treated with caution. The value of military exports, with their complex, often politicised, sometimes deliberately slow and secretive payment and delivery schedules, is notoriously difficult to measure. &quot;Our own government&apos;s figures are not very transparent in terms of what they&apos;re counting,&quot; says Professor Malcolm Chalmers of the defence thinktank the Royal United Services Institute. &quot;They show a much higher level of export sales than other sources do. The American Congressional estimates of our defence exports are much less.&quot; But a few things about the industry can be said with certainty. Air warfare has for at least a decade been by far its most important overseas market. And the keenest foreign buyers of British military products have for at least as long been Middle Eastern countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, and the US.     A customer checks out a grenade launcher at the Defence Systems and Equipment International Arms Fair at London's Excel Centre. Photograph: Rex Features    Our defence business used to be broader-based. Barrow is a remote peninsula town that was created in a few decades by Victorian industrialists. Starting in the 1880s, naval shipyards and arms factories were established on its flat, watery western extremities. As well as pioneering military submarines, they produced guns and torpedos, warships and airships, depth charges and aircraft carriers. Barrow products were sold to Turkey, Chile, Israel, Iran, Portugal and Japan, and to Britain&apos;s own expanding armed forces. During the first world war, the dockyard workforce hit a peak of 30,000, and whole Barrow suburbs were built to house it. &quot;When I started in the yard in 1960, everything was done there,&quot; says Terry Waiting, a former leader of Barrow council who still works in the town for BAE \u2013 Barrow&apos;s politics and dominant industry have long been intimately intertwined. &quot;We had our own foundries and engineering department.&quot; At lunchtime, bicycling workers would pour out of the yard and into Barrow&apos;s many pubs: &quot;You used to have three pints, pie and peas, and go straight back to work.&quot; In the 60s, the British defence industry was still benefitting from the fact that two potential rivals, Germany and Japan, were, as the second world war&apos;s defeated aggressors, unable to act as major military exporters. Meanwhile, the cold war was underway, Britain still had close ties to its former empire and the booming global oil trade was making many Middle Eastern countries rich but militarily anxious. Overseas markets for our defence products were plentiful. In 1966, with the British economy struggling, Harold Wilson&apos;s Labour government set up the Defence Export Services Organisation (Deso). Part of the Ministry of Defence, but employing arms company executives as well as civil servants, Deso quickly learned to chase export orders without too many scruples. &quot;Bribery has always played a role in the sale of weapons,&quot; Denis Healey, Wilson&apos;s defence secretary when Deso was established, told this newspaper in 2007. &quot;In the Middle East, people couldn&apos;t buy weapons unless you bribed them to do so, and that was particularly true in Saudi Arabia.&quot; During the 70s and 80s, British companies, first as nationalised then as\u00a0privatised concerns, sometimes sold\u00a0weapons to both sides in potential conflicts. A decade before the Falklands war, despite deteriorating Anglo-Argentinian relations, Barrow built identical destroyers for the two countries. But defence employees in\u00a0the town, like defence employees generally, have always been good at justifying what they do, both to themselves and others. &quot;I was in CND throughout the 60s and 70s,&quot; says Waiting. &quot;I&apos;ve still got a lot of time for the ideals of CND. In an ideal world, perhaps we might make big, beautiful liners in Barrow like we also did when I started. But nowadays, really, what else can you do in Barrow apart from build submarines? And they&apos;re good jobs.&quot; Azza Samms is the union convenor for the submarine plant&apos;s manual workers. He started in the Barrow shipyard in 1975, following after his father and grandfather, a common local pattern. He says: &quot;Everybody in Britain wants to be safe in their bed at night, but they don&apos;t want to build the submarines. And we build the submarines, not the [nuclear] missiles.&quot; The plant looms over the town, a single vast building, corrugated and pale, like a cross between a grain silo and a medieval cathedral. Two thousand people work inside the near-windowless, 10-storey walls of Devonshire Dock Hall; and more than 3,000 more in satellite submarine-building facilities across western Barrow. As the defence industry always does, the submarine yard alternates between publicity-seeking \u2013 crowds of locals are invited for submarine launches \u2013 and high security \u2013 &quot;We have Americans working here on the missile sections, but they have to be accompanied at all times,&quot; says Samms. Margaret Thatcher opened the hall in\u00a01986. Samms, a Labour supporter, stayed away from the ceremony. In the 80s, his party had turned critical of the defence business: &quot;We are alarmed by the growth of the arms trade,&quot; said its 1983 general election manifesto. &quot;Labour will limit Britain&apos;s arms sales abroad.&quot; Under the leadership of Michael Foot and Neil Kinnock, the party planned to reduce British manufacturing&apos;s dependency on defence by converting the factories involved to civilian use. At the 1983 election, the Labour candidate in Barrow, a safe seat, was Albert Booth, new to the area and an advocate of unilateral nuclear disarmament. He led a CND march through the town.

Labour did not win it back until 1992. Two years later, Blair became party leader and Labour began to shed its qualms about the defence business. By\u00a01996, the party&apos;s policy handbook stated that the industry was &quot;of vital importance to the nation&apos;s economic performance&quot;. Labour figures who still worried about the ethics of the arms trade, such as Cook, won a concession from their party that British defence products would not be granted the necessary government export licences if, as Cook declared on becoming foreign secretary in 1997, &quot;there is a clearly identifiable risk that the proposed export might be used for internal repression&quot;. But this assurance was quickly undermined by the Blair government&apos;s decision to sell military jets, water cannon and armoured cars to authoritarian Indonesia. As prime minister, like Cameron, Blair travelled widely to lobby for defence sales, to India, Saudi Arabia and the Czech Republic. In 2006, he pressured the Serious Fraud Office into dropping an investigation into alleged bribes paid by BAE to secure Saudi orders. Yet Blair&apos;s arms industry advocacy was less public, and perhaps a little less desperate-seeming, than Cameron&apos;s. The wider British economy was booming, and in the treasury under the chancellor Gordon Brown there were many who felt that the defence industry was unnecessarily feather-bedded. &quot;Officials said to me: &apos;There isn&apos;t a good case for subsidising the arms industry,&apos;&quot; says Stephen Timms, then a treasury minister. Anti-arms trade campaigners such as CAAT \u2013 &quot;thoughtful, sensible&quot; people, says Timms \u2013 told him the same thing. In 2007, the ethical and free-market arguments against the defence industry came together, and its unique Whitehall helper, Deso, was shut down. The industry vented its fury via its many friends in the rightwing press. But the closure of Deso was arguably a last victory for the industry&apos;s opponents. A year later, the organisation was revived as the Defence &amp; Security Organisation (DSO), a remarkably similar body, no longer based inside the Ministry of Defence but still part of government. Timms says a little world-wearily: &quot;I don&apos;t think there&apos;s a possibility of this Deso sort of activity wholly disappearing.&quot; Even Ian Prichard of CAAT admits that currently, &quot;It&apos;s hard to see a mechanism&quot; for reducing the industry&apos;s power behind the scenes. The real threats to the business may be less ideological. Britain remains the fourth-biggest military spender in the world, but the very scale of that spending \u2013 currently \u00a334bn a year \u2013 makes it a\u00a0tempting target for Whitehall economisers. Since the coalition&apos;s austerity programme began in 2010, &quot;defence cuts really have bitten hard,&quot; says Wheeldon. Thousands of defence workers have been laid off. Tellingly, Cameron&apos;s commitment last month that the cuts would cease in 2015 was quickly softened into something more ambiguous by other government figures. And if Britain is becoming a less certain market for the industry, then so are some of its foreign ones. Defence budgets are under pressure across the west. Cameron&apos;s arms-related trips to Asia, South America and the Middle East are partly a tacit acknowledgement that the industry will increasingly have to look to non-western markets \u2013 which are already busy with defence companies from other traditionally strong military exporters such as France and the US, trying to escape their own domestic difficulties. Cameron&apos;s hopes of selling the Typhoon to India depend on the collapse of an Indian order for the French Rafale fighter aircraft. Yesterday, he also had to defend an Anglo-Italian helicopter maker, AgustaWestland, against allegations that its Italian parent company, Finmeccanica, had used bribery to win a\u00a0recent Indian order for the British-made\u00a0helicopters. &quot;Exporting is not an easy game \u2013 never was,&quot; says Wheeldon. Nowadays, says Chalmers, &quot;there is a market saturation issue.&quot; Meanwhile, for reasons of strategy, national pride and economic development, more countries are aiming to be, like Britain, as self-sufficient in defence manufacturing as possible. Foreigners bearing defence goods are received with less gratitude and credulity than they once were. The defence business can be adaptable. It survived the end of two world wars and the cold war. British firms are now diversifying into highly profitable service contracts \u2013 offering export customers training in how to use British products, and British staff to maintain them; and &quot;security&quot; \u2013 alarm systems, surveillance systems, forensic equipment and anti-hacker protection. &quot;There&apos;s more being spent on intelligence, reconnaissance and electronic gizmos,&quot; says Chalmers, &quot;and less on big platforms&quot; \u2013 the industry euphemism for machines that\u00a0kill people. In Barrow, they no longer build aircraft carriers, or destroyers, or surface warships. The manufacture of guns and munitions is almost gone too. The local ironworks closed in the 60s, the steelworks in the 80s. What remains is the submarines, and the alternating local pride, confidence and anxiety around them. Currently, Barrow is making the Astute class of conventionally-armed nuclear submarines. The work will last until the &quot;early 2020s&quot;, says BAE. If the next government approves a new generation of submarines to carry nuclear missiles \u2013 in a typical instance of how defence policy often outflanks democracy, the decision has been postponed until after the general election \u2013 then the beehive of Devonshire Dock Hall will be busy with that &quot;from 2016 to the 2040s&quot;, says Samms. Few 21st-century British employees have that sort of security. And yet, people in Barrow worry. &quot;This town would die without the shipyard,&quot; he says. Unlike in the past, it now does almost no export work. Even with the yard, Barrow is the 32nd most deprived borough in the country. Hard to get to, its once-handsome streets now a little empty and tatty, for\u00a0all its military history and gothic atmosphere it is unlikely ever to draw tourists like the Lake District a dozen miles north. And the north-west of England is ominously full of towns from which economic life has moved on. The current Barrow MP is John Woodcock, a well-connected young Labour figure and defence hawk. He has a not-impregnable majority of 5,208. He says of the local submarine business \u2013 but he could equally be talking about the defence industry as a whole \u2013 &quot;This is a sort of shark. It&apos;s got to keep going forward.&quot; Perhaps not a\u00a0metaphor for pacifists to dwell on.", "title": "Is Britain's arms trade making a killing?", "sentences": ["He has been to India before, in July 2010; Egypt and Kuwait in February 2011; Saudi Arabia in January 2012; Indonesia, Japan, Burma, Malaysia and Singapore in April 2012; Brazil in September 2012; and Saudi Arabia, Dubai and Abu Dhabi in November 2012."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-18T19:00:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/feb/18/laura-robson-yulia-putintseva-dubai", "tags": ["Laura Robson", "Tennis", "Sport"], "article": "Laura Robson was beaten by Kazakhstan&apos;s Yulia Putintseva \u2013 who is ranked outside the top 100 \u2013 in the first round of the Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships on Monday.

McIlroy and Lowry were foursomes partners for Ireland and generally successful team-mates during their amateur days. They have retained a friendship since then which stretches beyond the course. McIlroy has progressed to the top player in the world but Lowry is a fine putter with a capacity for the unpredictable; as highlighted by his Irish Open win before he even joined the professional ranks. McIlroy is making only his second competitive appearance with Nike equipment.

Ben Hogan Division Bill Haas 28 v Nicolas Colsaerts 37 Tee-off time 4.55pm Colsaerts was once, and rightly, viewed as a wild child of European golf. The intervening years have brought a maturity, however, which has allowed the Belgian to realise his dream of playing in a Ryder Cup and taking up a US PGA Tour card. This year, then, holds a lot of promise for the big-hitting European. If he can make an impact on a stage such as this, it would bode well. Haas, the 2011 FedEx Cup winner, should prove favourable opposition for Colsaerts by virtue of his Dove Mountain record; the American has been eliminated in the first round in each of his two appearances here. Yet Haas is ranked higher than Colsaerts and returned a 64 during last weekend&apos;s Northern Trust Open. This should be a keenly fought match. Gary Player Division Hunter Mahan 23 v Matteo Manassero 42 Tee-off time 3.35pm Davis Love III&apos;s decision to overlook Mahan for a place in the last USA Ryder Cup team raised eyebrows. Not least, that is, because Mahan won the WGC Match Play Championship a year ago. Rory McIlroy was his final victim, with Mahan going on to lift the Shell Houston Open trophy only weeks later. Mahan has clear course knowledge and specialism, then, which are useful tools in any event. Manassero is still only 19 but has taken his place in the world&apos;s top 50. The Italian has three European Tour wins, thereby endorsing the promise he displayed as the youngest ever winner of the Amateur Championship. He is unfazed by reputation and has a fantastic short game; both are useful utensils in a matchplay format.

His prospects must be taken seriously; he won this event in 2010 when beating Paul Casey in the final. He is also keen for a strong year, thereby building on his Ryder Cup heroics at Medinah which exemplified his talents in a one-on-one environment. In Gallacher, though, Poulter has a stronger first-round opponent than perhaps he would like.

With consultation platforms such as the Overseas Development Institute&apos;s My World survey and the post-2015.org website, there&apos;s no shortage of space for debate. But is enough being done to facilitate and encourage participation from those at the receiving end of international aid? The use of participatory development methods (PDMs) is not a new concept. Having been pioneered by organisations such as the USAid-funded African Development Foundation, PDMs have been used in various ways for decades. What is new, however, is the role of technology in crowdsourcing participation in development. An example is the recent Map Kibera citizen-mapping project run with media consultancy group GroundTruth, which has brought an online interactive community to the Kenyan town of Kibera. Successful crowdsourcing depends on the availability, acceptance and use of crowdsourcing technologies, as highlighted in a recent paper by economist Maja Bott and impact consultant Gregor Young. The authors also emphasise the importance of a well-defined set of objectives, that are sensitive to the local context, so that the crowd can consider it to be valuable and well-intentioned. Yet critics suggest many development actors do not sufficiently seek what academics call &apos;the wisdom of the crowds&apos;. Far from engaging, some donors and agencies are accused of having rigid and narrow project designs that still consider their &apos;beneficiaries&apos; as a homogenous group, without considering cultural diversity. Development platform Globalhood&apos;s recent report on development projects that didn&apos;t work calls this the &apos;fallacy of under-differentiation&apos;. So, how can agencies, governments and donors better use the tools available to adopt a community-centered approach to development? Controversially perhaps, is beneficiaries-led development even possible and if so, what reforms are needed in the sector to ensure it works?

They have denied charges of &quot;consumption and possession with intent to distribute&quot; and will appear at their first trial hearing on Thursday after spending seven months in custody. In a draft witness statement provided to Calcutt, Williams said: &quot;I remember that the police put a towel on my face so I could not see. They kept telling me I was going to die. I was so scared. &quot;Once I had been knocked to the ground, the police picked me up and put me on the bed. They pulled down my trousers, spread my legs and started to electrocute my testicles. It was unbelievably painful. I was so scared. &quot;Then they took off the towel and I could see that there was a gun pointed at my head. All I could think was that the gun in my face could go off if the policeman slipped, and it would kill me. I started to believe that I was going to die in that\u00a0room.&quot; The torture took place in the desert, it was claimed, where the men were initially taken after their arrest, and subsequently in a hotel room. Calcutt said: &quot;The idea that young British tourists on holiday can find themselves arrested and tortured in this way is truly appalling. &quot;The Dubai authorities need to immediately drop the charges against the men and conduct an independent investigation into how these terrible events occurred,&quot; he said. &quot;If they do not, I am sure this story will linger in people&apos;s memories \u2013 particularly when it comes to booking their holidays.&quot; Charities say the Emirati police are notorious for violence towards prisoners, including foreigners. Suspects are frequently beaten, starved, raped and force-fed drugs, they allege. Even accusations of trivial offences can result in foreigners being kept in cramped cells with up to 20 inmates for weeks and pressurised into signing confessions written in Arabic. In 2011, Lee Bradley Brown, a 39-year-old British tourist, was beaten to death by officers in a Dubai police station after being arrested for swearing. Brown was on holiday at a \u00a31,000-a-night hotel in the UAE when he was arrested and kept for six days in Bur Dubai police station where, it is alleged, guards refused to give him enough food and water and did not let him see a lawyer.

McIlroy&apos;s strong position at the summit of the world rankings, then, is not under threat for now. The youngster&apos;s confidence may be more fragile. Though it is only three months since McIlroy strode towards such an impressive victory at the Dubai World Championship, rounding off a year in which he topped the money lists on both sides of the Atlantic, 2013 has dealt him harsher treatment. Put bluntly, McIlroy does not currently resemble the same player with regard to body language or the way he is negotiating courses. McIlroy&apos;s wayward, missed-cut performance in Abu Dhabi in January has now been followed by a first-round defeat by Shane Lowry at the WGC Accenture World Match Play Championship. Without being disrespectful to Lowry, who is entitled to savour his famous win, this is not the kind of match McIlroy should lose. This is especially so when the world No1 had it well within his capabilities to be four up after four holes and failed to convert his chances. Even more glaring was his lack of accuracy with iron shots, even short ones; the sight of him missing the 10th green by 20 yards when starting 132 yards away was a snapshot of current problems. Lowry, the lowest-ranked player in the field, capitalised just as any unforgiving opponent would. &quot;I probably would have lost by more if I had played someone else in the field,&quot; McIlroy acknowledged. &quot;It wasn&apos;t a great quality match. But it would have been nice to get.&quot; Inevitably chatter turns towards the so-called curse of Nike. McIlroy&apos;s form dip has coincided with his high-profile and lucrative change in equipment, a matter few onlookers are of a mind to view as coincidence even if McIlroy himself disagrees. &quot;I was missing a lot of irons,&quot; he added. &quot;I felt like I drew the ball really well and I hit it well off the tee. I just need to take advantage of the driving I have been doing. It is more a timing thing than anything else. Everything else was actually pretty good out there. I just need to go and work on them [the irons]. &quot;I&apos;m hitting the ball so much better off the tee, which is a positive. I&apos;m also more comfortable around the greens. It shouldn&apos;t be a lot of work that I have to do, I just have to go to the range and have a look at it.&quot; McIlroy has, of course, endured problematic spells before and managed to recover in forceful fashion. It would be folly for him to panic so early in the season, given how entirely logical it is that he would not adapt to new equipment instantly. &quot;It will just take time,&quot; said the renowned coach Butch Harmon on Friday. The WGC Match Play is also a notoriously unpredictable environment. Nonetheless, mentally or even subconsciously it would be only logical if the 23-year-old&apos;s confidence has taken a knock. Nick Faldo has been the most outspoken critic of McIlroy&apos;s Nike move, branding it &quot;dangerous&quot; and suggesting only money was the motivation. McIlroy was clearly irked by that sentiment but Faldo, a six-times major winner, can clearly point to experience in demonstrating that he knows what he is talking about. McIlroy may now put extra and damaging pressure on himself to prove sceptics such as Faldo wrong and deliver with his new clubs. McIlroy&apos;s public rhetoric before the matchplay event was exactly as it had been in Abu Dhabi; that he was playing well and eager to demonstrate as much in tournament conditions. On both occasions all McIlroy has demonstrated is that driving range form is commonly in stark contrast to the real thing. In a basic playing sense he is running out of competitive time to prepare for a tilt at the Masters. McIlroy will play only three more events before heading for that; his first aim is to ensure that build-up constitutes 12 rounds. Eight are guaranteed, given the WGC Cadillac Championship has no halfway cut. Woods refused to be despondent after his own Dove Mountain exit, at the hands of Charles Howell III. The 37-year-old has the salvation, at least, of a tournament win already this year despite, like McIlroy, missing the Abu Dhabi cut. &quot;I played well,&quot; Woods said of his Tucson efforts. &quot;I really did. I hit a lot of good shots out there. I didn&apos;t make a bogey. Unfortunately it&apos;s the nature of the format that means I didn&apos;t advance.&quot; He was in illustrious company.", "title": "Rory McIlroy not panicking after WGC Match Play defeat by Shane Lowry", "sentences": ["Though it is only three months since McIlroy strode towards such an impressive victory at the Dubai World Championship, rounding off a year in which he topped the money lists on both sides of the Atlantic, 2013 has dealt him harsher treatment."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-22T21:52:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/feb/23/angel-rangel-swansea-bradford-capital-one-cup-final", "tags": ["Swansea City", "Bradford", "Capital One Cup", "Football", "Sport", "Capital One Cup 2012-13"], "article": "When Angel Rangel joined Swansea in 2007 he paid part of the transfer fee himself. The following summer he returned to Spain and helped out in his mother&apos;s small supermarket as she recovered from a stroke. If Swansea need a translator for an interview with one of their Spanish players, Rangel steps forward. During Swansea&apos;s recent break in Dubai, when punters asked for their picture to be taken with Michu, Rangel was the one holding the camera. Nothing is too much trouble for this man. And that is before we get to the sandwich run. &quot;I think that went a bit out of proportion,&quot; Rangel says, referring to the widespread praise he received after it emerged he had driven around Swansea for an hour, on a bitterly cold Friday night in January, with his wife, Nikki, looking for homeless people to give sandwiches to after they had discovered that the coffee shop they were in was going to throw the food away. They eventually came across a charity shelter in the city, courtesy of some help from Twitter. &quot;It wasn&apos;t as big as some people were saying,&quot; Rangel says, shrugging his shoulders. &quot;I just gave a few sandwiches to a charity home. I wasn&apos;t driving around Swansea with a truck full of sandwiches. It was just a little gesture. Nothing else. I&apos;m sure there are so many people that do it and they don&apos;t get what they deserve, especially those who work 24/7 in the charity homes and help the homeless people. No one talks about them. OK, I&apos;m a footballer and I&apos;ve done it and it&apos;s been in the spotlight but, at the end of the day, I&apos;m a normal person, like everyone.&quot; Rangel epitomises the humility running through a Swansea squad that hope to claim the first major trophy in the club&apos;s historyon Sunday, when they take on Bradford in the Capital One Cup final. For Rangel, who signed for Swansea when they were a League One club \u2013 Roberto Mart\u00ednez, the manager at the time, went to Spain to watch a striker only to have his head turned by the opposition right-back playing for Terrassa \u2013 winning silverware at Wembley would be another milestone on a remarkable journey. &quot;We&apos;ve got a great chance to put our names into the club&apos;s history,&quot; he says. &quot;We&apos;ll never get a better opportunity to win a cup final.&quot; Not that he is taking anything for granted. &quot;You cannot underestimate Bradford. I&apos;ve played in the bottom leagues and I know what it is like when you play against a big club \u2013 you give everything and more. I think it&apos;s important the motivation of our players is 100%. It&apos;s not going to be easy; they&apos;ve beaten three Premier League clubs. But we have to be realistic and think, if we do our best, we&apos;re going to win.&quot; Rangel smiles when asked about how much Swansea has changed as a football club since the day he arrived. &quot;I could write a book, easily,&quot; he says. &quot;In the first season I was washing my own training kit, I was bringing my own football boots. We didn&apos;t have a training ground. From my point of view it was OK but you couldn&apos;t really bring big players because they wouldn&apos;t accept that. &quot;Then we moved to Glamorgan, to a public gym, and got better things but we were still having a shower with random people and things like that, which is not an ideal situation. But we got on with it and we succeeded on the pitch. And then, slowly, we&apos;re getting a training ground and a lot of better facilities. If we stay here for a long time we&apos;ll get all the rewards of what we&apos;ve been working for.&quot; Away from football Rangel already has plenty to show for his time in south Wales. Having arrived in Swansea single, he met his wife-to-be in the city five years ago and he sounds totally at home in his adopted country. &quot;I feel Welsh,&quot; Rangel says. &quot;I&apos;ve got three kids and they&apos;ve been born in Wales. My wife&apos;s family is Welsh and we&apos;re building a house in Swansea, so I think long-term we are going to be here \u2013 it&apos;s not only football I&apos;m here for. But I know I&apos;ve also got Spain as a home and we&apos;ll go back every summer to see family and friends.&quot; In Sant Carles de la R\u00e0pita, the small Catalonian town where Rangel grew up, they will be glued to their televisions during the final, although that scene will be played out across Spain. The arrival of Michu, Chico Flores and Pablo Hern\u00e1ndez this summer has swelled Swansea&apos;s Spanish contingent and also kept Rangel busy. &quot;I&apos;ve tried to help them. I had experience and they were always grateful to me for what I&apos;ve done, and you could see straight away on the pitch they were settled and they could perform without any concerns. They always say thanks to me.&quot; Michael Laudrup is another with strong Spanish connections and, according to Rangel, the Dane has elevated Swansea to another level since taking over as manager in the summer. &quot;I think Michael has given the players that motivation that we probably needed, that winning mentality and that resilience that probably we lacked before. We know on the ball we are great footballers. But we needed something else and I think what he has done \u2026 we have a lost a bit of possession but we&apos;re creating more chances, being more direct and aggressive with the ball.&quot; Rangel hopes those qualities will shine through on a day when 30 family and friends are flying over from Spain to watch the latest chapter in his fairytale story. &quot;Five, six years with the club, from League One to go to the Premier League, establish yourself in the top 10 of the Premier League and be in a cup final, well, it would be impossible to believe it,&quot; he says. &quot;Hopefully we can win this final, which would put the club in Europe and would be even more incredible.&quot;", "title": "Angel Rangel, Swansea's Spanish samaritan, is happy to feel Welsh", "sentences": ["During Swansea&apos;s recent break in Dubai, when punters asked for their picture to be taken with Michu, Rangel was the one holding the camera."], "publicationDate": "2013-02-23T22:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/feb/26/gulf-states-co-ordinate-crackdown-dissent", "tags": ["United Arab Emirates", "Bahrain", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Freedom of speech", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Press freedom", "Newspapers & magazines", "Newspapers", "Media"], "article": "Nervous Gulf states appear to be co-ordinating a crackdown on critics in the media and academic world as well as on political activists who challenge the status quo and protest about human rights abuses. Two leading Bahraini journalists were blocked from entering the United Arab Emirates on Monday for unspecified reasons, just days after the UAE refused entry to Kristian Ulrichsen, of the London School of Economics, who was scheduled to speak about Bahrain at a conference on the Arab spring, which has unsettled all the region&apos;s conservative monarchies. Mansour al-Jamri, editor of the Bahraini newspaper al-Wasat, was refused entry at Dubai international airport along with his wife, Reem Khalifa, an Associated Press correspondent. Jamri had been due to attend a conference on newspapers but believes the ban stems from a security deal agreed by the six Gulf Co-operation Council (GCC) members last year. &quot;The ban clearly has nothing to do with the conference,&quot; he told the Guardian . &quot;But we were told it was a decision from the top.&quot; The contents of the pact remain secret but it includes a shared database. GCC security concerns focus on the Muslim Brotherhood, other Islamist groups and Iranian influence, while the ongoing unrest and political tensions in Bahrain have a sectarian character. Restrictions on social media have become common. The UAE foreign ministry said that Ulrichsen was not allowed into the country because his work had criticised Bahrain&apos;s monarchy, which has faced street protests since the Pearl revolution erupted two years ago. A UAE contingent was part a Saudi-led GCC intervention force deployed in Bahrain in 2011. &quot;The UAE took the view that at this extremely sensitive juncture in Bahrain&apos;s national dialogue it would be unhelpful to allow non-constructive views on the situation in Bahrain to be expressed from within another GCC state,&quot; the statement said. Ulrichsen had &quot;consistently propagated views de-legitimising the Bahraini monarchy&quot;, it added. The Manama government, under pressure from western allies, wants a dialogue on reform with the opposition but blames it for violence. The LSE cancelled the conference on the Arab spring it had planned to hold over the weekend at the American University of Sharjah, in the UAE, citing &quot;restrictions imposed on the intellectual content of the event that threatened academic freedom&quot;. The last-minute cancellation came after the Emirati authorities requested that a presentation on Bahrain be dropped. Bahrain now routinely restricts access for reporters. A Guardian request for a visa to visit in February was at first rejected on the grounds of inappropriate timing. A request for clarification went unanswered. Then a visa was suddenly issued just before the anniversary of the 2011 uprising, valid for just four days but for immediate use. &quot;These regimes are particularly nervous about respected voices being heard,&quot; said Rori Donaghy of the Emirates Centre for Human Rights in London. &quot;They are trying to manage dissent with their own populations. They are concerned about people who they can&apos;t dismiss as traitors or members of the Muslim Brotherhood or proxies of Iran. That&apos;s the crux of it.&quot; Ulrichsen commented in an account of his experience in Dubai: &quot;The monarchies are reacting to the transformative online power of new media and social networking sites by attempting to close down these spaces for free discussion and debate and reminding would-be detractors of the coercive power at their disposal. &quot;Denying me entry may have been a sovereign right, but it signifies that the gloves are off, and that the UAE currently is a deeply inimical place for the values that universities are supposed to\u00a0uphold.&quot; The UAE has cracked down on political dissent since the Arab spring.

The new skyscraper promises to bring a hectare of forest into the city&apos;s central business district, as well as hundreds of new homes. Rather than cold steel and glass, the surface of this high-rise will ripple with organic life.  Made of two towers \u2013 one 80m high, the other 112m \u2013 Bosco Verticale is currently being planted with 730 specially cultivated trees, 11,000 groundcover plants and 5,000 shrubs. One of the principal architects, Stefano Boeri, calls it both &quot;radical&quot; and an &quot;experiment&quot;; a reaction against the &quot;high parallelepipeds, clad by glass, steel or ceramic&quot; he&apos;s witnessed in Dubai.      Trees being installed onto the Bosco Verticale skyscraper in Milan. Photograph: Marco Garofalo    Big deal for &apos;biological architecture&apos;  Jill Fehrenbacher, editor of Inhabitat and a follower of architecture trends, says proposals for buildings featuring copious vegetation are increasingly common. &quot;I have yet to see very many of these &apos;living building&apos; designs become reality, which is why the Bosco Verticale is such a big deal,&quot; she says. The interdisciplinary team working on the project includes botanists as well as engineers. Their research has ventured into testing the wind resistance of certain species of tree in wind tunnels, as well as finding a suitably lightweight substrate able to meet plants&apos; nutritional demands. The residents&apos; needs are also important \u2013 trees will be trimmed so foliage doesn&apos;t interrupt their views.  Boeri explains that the Bosco Verticale &quot;hands over to vegetation itself the task of absorbing the dust in the air and of creating an adequate micro-climate in order to filter out the sunlight. This is a kind of biological architecture, which refuses to adopt a strictly technological and mechanical approach to environmental sustainability.&quot;     The Park Royal on Pickering hotel in Singapore. Photograph: Patrick Bingham-Hall    Singapore sky gardens The Park Royal on Pickering hotel in Singapore is another example of a towering building-cum-garden in a dense urban area, but this one is already open for business. WOHA, the architects, says it was inspired by headlands, promontories and planted terraces. Richard Hassell, the firm&apos;s founding director, enjoys blurring the distinction between hard architecture and soft landscapes but admits that working with plants is a challenge.  &quot;For architects, it is quite a change in mindset to deal with living things,&quot; he says. &quot;Normally an architect is trying to make things that are as static as possible, and resist wear and tear. But plants grow, and change, and drop leaves, and wilt and die if you forget about them.&quot; Over-ambitious? A &apos;living building&apos; is never really finished. It will change over time and will require much more maintenance than one without plants. For both the Park Royal on Pickering and the Bosco Verticale, the upkeep will be centralised and carried out by specialist staff. Could such projects be called too labour- and energy-intensive? Jill Fehrenbacher doesn&apos;t think so. &quot;Living plants\u2026clean the air and produce oxygen, they help humidify indoor air, they reduce storm water runoff and the urban heat island effect, and they help insulate a building,&quot; she argues. &quot;Even though skyscrapers like the Bosco Verticale inherently use a tonne of resources and energy \u2013 simply by virtue of being a high-rise building \u2013 all of those trees and plants are going to be beneficial to the building occupants, neighbours and local environment.&quot;  And perhaps &apos;living buildings&apos; have worth based on aesthetics alone. &quot;At the very worst, a garden is a delight to the users, so even if there is minimum environmental value, there is still immense value in having more green spaces in dense cities,&quot; says Richard Hassell. The visual impact of buildings like these can&apos;t be underestimated. Apparently Singapore&apos;s taxi drivers now make detours to drive past the planted hotel, while Stefano Boeri talks about his structures being &quot;ecology billboards&quot;.

Momin Mourad Ali, 29, was flying a balloon carrying 20 tourists over the ruins of Luxor at dawn on Tuesday when the basket caught fire in uncertain circumstances. According to witnesses, Ali \u2013 whose clothes were set on fire \u2013 and one guest, 49-year-old Briton Michael Rennie, managed to jump from the stricken balloon while it was still three metres from the ground. Then the balloon rose quickly to a height of 90 metres (300ft), prompting some of the remaining passengers to jump, burning, to their deaths.

Their supporters had woken up to damaging headlines on Saturday morning about tales of players going out drinking during a recent trip to Dubai and it had seemed that theirs was a squad on the brink of civil war; yet there was a unity in this victory over Southampton that has rarely been evident this season and that made a mockery of their position at the bottom of the table. QPR should not crack open the champagne yet. This was, after all, only their third victory of what has been an awful season, and there is still plenty of work to do, but Harry Redknapp, who could hardly have asked for a better 66th birthday on his return to St Mary&apos;s, will look at forthcoming fixtures against Sunderland, Aston Villa, Fulham and Wigan and believe that he can pull off an escape act similar to the one he inspired at Portsmouth in 2006. Southampton&apos;s fans arrived eager to torture Redknapp, who was their manager when they were relegated in 2005 and left for Portsmouth a few months later. But in the end their anger was directed at a desperately lethargic performance from their own side, who gave Mauricio Pochettino little to celebrate on his 41st birthday. Victory for Southampton would have lifted them to 30 points but they are not safe yet. The boos for Redknapp were loud and predictable when he strolled out of the tunnel before kick-off and it was 10 minutes before he stepped out of the dugout and into the technical area. This is the kind of boos problem he can deal with, though, and four minutes later his side led. Redknapp had spoken during the week of his need to give Junior Hoilett more games and the winger rewarded his manager&apos;s faith in him by creating QPR&apos;s opener. From the left, Hoilett drifted a lovely, diagonal ball towards Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my, who had peeled away from Maya Yoshida and Daniel Fox. With Artur Boruc&apos;s positioning offering R\u00e9my a sizeable portion of the goal to aim at, the Frenchman clipped a right-footed shot past the keeper, beating Fox on the line. It was R\u00e9my&apos;s second goal for QPR since his \u00a38m move from Marseille and he nearly had his third minutes later when he tested Boruc from the edge of the area. Southampton were strangely muted, playing with none of the urgency they showed in beating Manchester City here three weeks ago, and for all the plaudits Pochettino has received since replacing Nigel Adkins in January, his side has won only once. &quot;We were not expecting a result like that but we must learn from our mistakes,&quot; he said. &quot;Perhaps the team didn&apos;t have the fluidity in other games. &quot;When we go one goal down we didn&apos;t have the calm to push forward. What&apos;s clear to me is we need to work on the confidence of the team because today was a game we had to win. The team knew what was at stake.&quot; Southampton were gifted a way back into the match in first-half stoppage time when Jay Rodriguez, who had just replaced the injured Adam Lallana, shot from 25 yards out. It was a tame effort, but J\u00falio C\u00e9sar made a mess of it, allowing Gaston Ram\u00edrez to nip in and delicately dink the rebound over him. From there, QPR might have crumbled, and Rodriguez and Jos\u00e9 Fonte went close with efforts from distance. The visitors&apos; plans were further thrown into disarray when Robert Green replaced the injured C\u00e9sar but, with Christopher Samba and St\u00e9phane Mbia outstanding, their defence stood firm. Then, with 13 minutes remaining, QPR pounced. Yoshida was far too meek in a challenge with Park Ji-sung on the right and the midfielder&apos;s low cross was converted by Jay Bothroyd from close range. Southampton were stunned, but pushed forward in search of a second equaliser and thought one had arrived when Fonte met a corner with a powerful header. Somehow Green clawed it away. Six minutes of stoppage time followed but Southampton&apos;s threat had disappeared and when Howard Webb&apos;s final whistle blew at last, there was Redknapp on the pitch, pumping his fists in the direction of the QPR supporters. &quot;I\u00a0might go to Dubai again this week,&quot; he\u00a0said. &quot;It might be a good idea.&quot;", "title": "Southampton 1-2 Queens Park Rangers | Premier League match report", "sentences": ["Their supporters had woken up to damaging headlines on Saturday morning about tales of players going out drinking during a recent trip to Dubai and it had seemed that theirs was a squad on the brink of civil war; yet there was a unity in this victory over Southampton that has rarely been evident this season and that made a mockery of their position at the bottom of the table.", "&quot;I\u00a0might go to Dubai again this week,&quot; he\u00a0said."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-02T17:17:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/02/rory-mcilroy-honda-classic-walked-out", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "The Masters", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Those who pay close attention to professional golf generally take a dim view of players walking off the course mid-round. Sandy Lyle was the recipient of some particularly vitriolic, po-faced comment after cutting short his Open Championship at Birkdale in 2008 halfway into Thursday&apos;s play, and later claimed he was suffering a hand injury. Ludicrously, if true, it was even claimed Lyle&apos;s premature departure from the links played a part in him being overlooked for a stint as Europe&apos;s Ryder Cup captain. The basis for such analysis is deeply flawed, though. If a player claims he is injured, he will be treated lightly. It is therefore preferable for a golfer to cite a medical condition, backed up by letter within a couple of weeks, than volunteer some kind of psychological or professional torment. Enter Rory McIlroy. The world No1&apos;s defence of toothache after making a hasty exit from the Honda Classic was contradicted by comments he reportedly made to journalists in the car park within moments of walking from the course. &quot;I&apos;m not in a great place mentally,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;I can&apos;t really say much, guys. I&apos;m just in a bad place mentally.&quot; McIlroy had slumped to seven over par within eight holes. He had slammed his club into the turf, three-putted once and returned a single double-bogey. He appeared close to tears when walking in. An element of suspicion, then, was inevitable as McIlroy&apos;s public relations regime kicked into operation. A statement appeared, and was verified by the PGA Tour, stating how the 23-year-old had found a problem with his wisdom tooth too unbearable to continue. Advice for McIlroy soon arrived from Tiger Woods, a man who knows a thing or two about negative publicity. &quot;He&apos;s just got to be more \u2013 just got to think about it a little bit more before you say something or do something,&quot; Woods said. &quot;It can get out of hand, especially when you get into social media and start tweeting and all those different things that can go wrong.&quot; Since the very public downfall of Woods, the sport has desperately sought a new hero. McIlroy rose to become that popular figure, rendering him essential to the game&apos;s sponsors, broadcasters and to those who highlight how humble roots are no barrier to topping the world in this particular sport. For those reasons alone, any troubles associated with McIlroy will always be treated more compassionately than would be routine \u2013 as a disappointment, rather than something more sinister. Golf needs McIlroy, of that there is no question. He may well have a dental issue. What is, however, now beyond dispute is that the professional life of someone who has made playing appear so simple has rapidly been shrouded by deep complications. An equipment deal with Nike has made him even wealthier than before \u2013 by at least \u00a378m \u2013 but also served to intensify scrutiny on his every on-course move. Nike have been publicly supportive of their athlete, as is entirely predictable, but privately they can only be concerned at how McIlroy&apos;s most inauspicious professional spell has coincided with this lucrative and high-profile partnership. Last November, McIlroy shrugged aside illness to finish like a train in the DP Dubai World Championship. That final McIlroy round of 2012 was rounded off with five, crucial birdies to endorse his status. This year, his play is unrecognisable and erratic; a missed cut and a first-round matchplay exit preceded Friday&apos;s events in Florida. At the Honda Classic, McIlroy&apos;s behaviour was similarly at odds with his impressive character. Graeme McDowell, a close friend of McIlroy, observed as much: &quot;His demeanour looks a little different. I felt like he was a little off with his swing on the range. &quot;There were a few moans and groans coming from the bay next to me. It&apos;s normally a display. It&apos;s normally a clinic. That&apos;s the sign of a guy who&apos;s lacking a little technique in his swing and a little belief in his game.&quot; McIlroy has shown powers of recovery before. With that in mind, it would be an error to write off his chances of doing likewise again soon. Yet he is now playing for the highest stakes, when in the sharpest focus. McIlroy faces the challenge of his professional life to erase some demons before arriving at Augusta in five weeks&apos; time.", "title": "Rory McIlroy walks tightrope after Honda Classic incident raises stakes", "sentences": ["Last November, McIlroy shrugged aside illness to finish like a train in the DP Dubai World Championship."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-02T18:12:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/mar/02/qpr-harry-redknapp-dubai", "tags": ["Harry Redknapp", "QPR", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Harry Redknapp furiously hit out at individuals who he claimed are trying to &quot;disrupt&quot; Queens Park Rangers after his side&apos;s 2-1 victory at Southampton and rubbished reports in Saturday&apos;s papers that a recent trip to Dubai had been marred by ill-discipline and drinking. A visibly angry Redknapp insisted that the story was untrue and had been fabricated by an agent looking to spread mischief. Despite three unnamed QPR players being quoted in the report, Redknapp said that he knew who was really responsible for the story and that it had a unifying effect on his squad before the game at St Mary&apos;s.

I took the players to Dubai, arrived there at 5 o&apos;clock in the morning, trained at 11.30 that morning, trained the following morning. I think there were six or seven teams out there and we were the only one that trained every day. Two of them didn&apos;t train all week, not one second. Their managers were out there with their wives. &quot;I spoke to the managers. They said we&apos;ve come out here to rest. Let the players unwind, they&apos;ve had a hard season. That&apos;s fine. I could have done that. We trained every day. We did not have one day off. &quot;We trained the first two days and then the doctor came to me with the sports scientist and said to me: &apos;They shouldn&apos;t train tomorrow. I&apos;ve looked at them this morning, they&apos;ve got aches and tight groins, they&apos;re a bit fatigued with the journey.&apos; I said: &apos;No doc, we&apos;re going to train every day.&apos; And I worked the socks off them. I had them on their knees, they worked that hard. &quot;The players were disgusted with it. They had a meeting about it last night. They couldn&apos;t believe it. I said there&apos;s only one way to show people and that&apos;s to go out today and put in a performance and that&apos;s what they did.&quot; Redknapp said that he does not encourage his players to drink and had &quot;stopped a culture of drinking at more clubs than you&apos;ll ever know&quot; but that he had allowed his squad one night out after discussions with his coaching staff. He said that the players were warned they would be fined a week&apos;s wages if they were late for the coach to training the following morning. &quot;I gave them one night out and that&apos;s what they did,&quot; Redknapp said. &quot;And when they went out, they said there were five other teams in the same place they went to. Why has no one written about the other teams having a night out? Why is it only QPR? &quot;You know why? Because this story has come from somebody who is trying to disrupt the football club. I know exactly who it is, I know his reasons for\u00a0doing it and we all know who it is.

At least those of us who live in Britain are. This is because, in the 21st century, efficient, large, well-connected airports matter to prosperity above everything else. &quot;The fastest, best-connected places will win&quot;, and the future belongs to the &quot;city that can see the writing on the wall before the competition can even see the wall&quot;. While China is roaring away with $250bn of investment in airports, London finds the efforts to improve its infrastructure mired in environmental\u00a0opposition, political indecision and local special interest groups. And, with London, so goes the entire UK economy. So, almost, says John Kasarda, travelling preacher for the concept\u00a0of aerotropolis, the idea that a new type of city will and must appear, where &quot;the airport is not at its periphery but at its core&quot;. He\u00a0combines\u00a0a professorship\u00a0at the University of North Carolina with writing books and articles on the subject, with a consultancy advising regional and national governments how to direct their billions to the achievement of their own aerotropolis.\u00a0Boris Johnson has declared his enthusiasm for the idea, and Kasarda reciprocates his passion: &quot;I find the mayor of London extremely visionary. He has his\u00a0finger on the pulse. He has a dramatic style, but he&apos;s a very wise man.&quot; There is, Kasarda says, a &quot;new metric based on time and cost&quot;, and &quot;location, location, location has been replaced by accessibility, accessibility, accessibility&quot;. Kasarda supports his arguments with batteries of statistics and predictions \u2013 that in 2030 there will be 13bn passenger journeys a year, compared with 4.9bn in 2010,\u00a0or that an iPhone 5 is assembled from parts flown in from several countries.     Arlanda airport in Sweden, a popular wedding venue. Photograph: Alamy    As airports grow, argues Kasarda, they become more city-like. The shopping zone of Indianapolis International, he says, &quot;really gives the feeling&quot; of a town square. There are 6,000 weddings a year at Stockholm Arlanda, the Rijksmuseum exhibits art in Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol, and the London Philharmonic is performing at Heathrow. &quot;If you want to see the future,&quot; he says, &quot;look at the Squaire&quot; \u2013 a sleek, glassy slug in Frankfurt where KPMG has moved some of its operations, on the basis that it is only a few minutes&apos; walk from workplace to check-in.     The Squaire, an office building inside Frankfurt airport: 'minutes' walk from workplace to check-in'. Photograph: Alamy    Kasarda&apos;s favourite examples of an aerotropolis are Las Colinas, Texas, which is handily placed for Dallas Fort Worth and &quot;hosts four Global Fortune 500 headquarters&quot;, and New Songdo, a development built (with advice from Kasarda) near Incheon airport in South Korea. Also, Dubai, &quot;an airport with an emirate attached&quot;, and Singapore, whose growth has been assisted by its impressive airport. He shows a plan of an ideal city, with runways at its dead centre and &quot;aerolanes&quot; connecting such things as &quot;E-fulfilment facilities&quot; and a &quot;medical and wellness cluster&quot;. This city is shown as being built on virgin greensward, a site very unlike London, which already has a large number of buildings and services, and people who might resist relocation. Kasarda calls the existing fabric &quot;sunk cost&quot;, which roughly means &quot;money down the drain&quot;, before acknowledging that they might have some value: &quot;You can&apos;t get rid of it, so you have to leverage it as best you can.&quot;     Dubai International, 'an airport with an emirate attached'. Photograph: Corbis    Kasarda is right that international air travel is a growing force, and that London will suffer if it fails to find an intelligent response. But, as currently described, aerotropolis is chilling: a model of a city driven by a combination\u00a0of business imperatives and state control, with the high levels of security\u00a0and control that go with airports. Under the dictatorship of speed, individual memory and identity\u00a0are abolished. An airport shopping mall is, actually, not like a town square, for the reason that everything there is programmed and managed, and spontaneity and initiative are abolished. There may be palliatives. According to Kasarda&apos;s 10 points for planning aerotropolises, &quot;thematic architectural features, public art and iconic structures should make aerotropolis developments interpretable, navigable and welcoming&quot;. New Songdo includes a Jack Nicklaus golf course and areas modelled on Venetian canals and Central Park. But, according to sociologist Richard Sennett, it&apos;s a &quot;stupefying&quot; place where &quot;there is nothing to be learned from walking the streets&quot;. Nor are airport cities precisely pure expressions of the market, as some 19th-century railway towns were. The South Korean government has invested heavily in New Songdo, which has yet to prove that it will be the humming metropolis promised by its makers. Of the plan to build a new airport in the Thames estuary, Kasarda tells me that &quot;most airport transportation connectivity will need to be based on public funding, and this will be expensive. I know of no significant commercial airport that has been privately built that had not received substantial public funding support, at least indirectly.&quot; The deal, in other words, is this: taxpayers would be expected to pay handsomely for an environment created almost entirely to serve the needs of business. If they don&apos;t, as Kasarda says of a Britain without enhanced airports in London, &quot;the city and nation\u00a0will become markedly weakened in the coming decades&quot;. And if the public does foot the bill, the bet might not pay off. &quot;The Thames estuary airport is a high-risk but potentially\u00a0very high-return option,&quot; says Kasarda. In\u00a0other words, the taxpayer might be asked to stake billions upon billions on something that may not work. When London meets aerotropolis, it is quite a face-off. If the game is simply to see who can build airports (and eve rything that goes with them) biggest, fastest and most efficiently, then London, which carries the baggage of history and democracy, cannot beat Asian cities. On the other hand, London has qualities to which the aerotropolis idea adds little value, like an existing fabric that works and gives pleasure and affords space for the accidental (including the colossal and largely unplanned success,\u00a0over the decades, of Heathrow). The evidence of property prices, and of international investment,\u00a0is that these things are worth quite a lot. London can never afford to be complacent \u2013 not least about the current state of its airports \u2013 but the aerotropolis idea offers a too simplistic view of cities.

But in Abu Dhabi, where the aviation industry has grown up almost as spectacularly as the skyscrapers on the shoreline, the sheikhs who bankrolled the towering investment do not doubt that the fruits will come. While London&apos;s great and good grapple with the question of airport expansion, the world beyond is changing, as those running Britain&apos;s biggest airport and airline know all too well \u2013 frequently expressing their frustration that rivals are &quot;eating our lunch&quot; and leapfrogging them to aviation&apos;s top spot. The announcements last week that Etihad Airways \u2013 based in Abu Dhabi \u2013 was splurging $70m (\u00a347m) to secure three Heathrow slots, while British Airways saw its profits wiped out and its parent company, IAG, record a near-\u20ac1bn (\u00a3863m) loss, will not have made them much happier. &quot;In aviation,&quot; says Jos Nuihuis, the boss of Amsterdam&apos;s Schiphol airport, mischievously enjoying his role as the current chief beneficiary of Heathrow&apos;s inability to build another runway, &quot;you have to take the chance when it&apos;s your\u00a0turn.&quot; While the northern hemisphere and transatlantic traffic draws the money, Europe&apos;s five hubs can do battle. But the political geography is changing and the crossroads of the world look ever more likely to be located in the Middle East. Developments at the three expanding hubs in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates underline that shift. The UAE&apos;s biggest airline, Emirates, last month completed the opening of an entire 20-gate concourse at its Dubai airport base purely for its fleet of giant A380s, Airbus&apos;s flagship aircraft which typically carry 500-plus passengers. Etihad \u2013 which was established less than a decade ago \u2013 announced that passenger numbers had passed 10 million a year and it was turning increasing profits, as plans to double the airport capacity take shape. And in Qatar, the $15.5bn Hamad International airport opens next month with a 4,850m runway fit for fleets of A380s to take off in the desert heat. The ambition is immense, as is the speed and scale of the growth to date. Qatar&apos;s airport will be able to handle 28 million passengers a year on opening, but chief executive Akbar al-Baker is planning extensions for 50 million by 2020, when the state hosts the football World Cup. In the gleaming new headquarters of Etihad Airways in Abu Dhabi, the airline&apos;s chief executive, James Hogan, spells out a vision of being a &quot;truly global airline&quot;. Staff drawn from 125 countries come through the training facility on site, the graduating class photos spreading along the walls showing a multinational mix in each intake. With 70 planes, Etihad is the smallest of the Gulf airlines, and all three have orders that will more than double their existing fleets. &quot;With aircraft technology you can fly to all points in the world from the Gulf,&quot; Hogan says. &quot;We fly to 86 cities and connect well [at] Abu Dhabi, and Abu Dhabi itself as a destination is becoming more relevant.&quot; For many British passengers, long-haul to the south and east of the globe has meant going on the classic Kangaroo route to Australia via Asia. But the longer range of modern aircraft and the rise of the Gulf hubs has set a new course for the Gulf and south east Asia. Etihad&apos;s investment in, and partnership with, Virgin Australia is one way that the journey now bypasses Singapore and Heathrow too. More notably, at the end of this month Emirates will take over from the ousted British Airways in a partnership with Australian flag carrier Qantas. Qantas&apos;s UK general manager, Eric Jelinek, said it was an &quot;amicable divorce&quot; from Heathrow&apos;s largest carrier: &quot;BA understands our reasons and that things have changed.&quot; He doesn&apos;t extend the metaphor, but has the air of a man whose airline has found a younger, richer, more glamorous partner, really going places and unsullied by previous trysts. This is Emirates&apos; first alliance, and Qantas is clearly overjoyed to have been chosen. For its Australian passengers flying via Heathrow, it offered five European destinations, with two stops. Now it can sell 33 with just the one stop. Qantas has since reported a surge in ticket sales from Australia to Europe. The Gulf hubs are undoubtedly well-placed to update some long-established routes. As Hogan, a native Australian, puts it: &quot;It&apos;s the new Silk Road.&quot; But, he adds: &quot;What people forget is that India, Pakistan, Bangladesh are huge populations. And even in the Middle East: at a point, post-Arab spring, when the Middle East normalises, Iraq and Iran have huge numbers of young people who want to travel. &quot;If you think within three hours&apos; flying time we have India \u2013 for them this is a weekend destination, a short break destination, an educational or medical care destination. &quot;You want sun, beaches, restaurants, shopping, it&apos;s here all year round. The Gulf states, the subcontinent and the Middle East all see Abu Dhabi as a destination in its own right, as well as all the through traffic.&quot; If Dubai&apos;s tourist industry and hotel scene is well-established, Abu Dhabi has plans to make a different type of tourist sit up, with a new Louvre, Guggenheim and national museum in fantastical designs from the world&apos;s leading architects on a newly linked island on the city&apos;s edge. Such breathtaking, vaulting ambition typifies the Gulf but also leads many observers to question if these are Ozymandian dreams, unsustainable follies in the sand. Can the vast oil wells in the desert successfully nurture not just one but three burgeoning aviation hubs, two within an hour&apos;s drive of each other? John Strickland, an independent aviation consultant, believes so: &quot;Probably they can. If you look at where they&apos;re sitting and the aircraft they&apos;re operating, they can serve pretty much anywhere in the world. None of them are having any difficulty filling their planes.&quot; Andrew Lobbenberg, an analyst at HSBC, predicts: &quot;They will grow very seriously and gain status as major global aviation hubs. They sit at the crossroads from Europe to the east and between Africa and Asia, which are young and vibrant markets.&quot; But the backing of their governments has, he says, been the driver that has capitalised on that geographical logic. Strickland points out that, while the political aspirations of the various emirates mean that all want their own flag carrier and hub, and are backing aviation to the hilt, all three airlines are believed to be heading for profitability (although the accounts are not all transparent). &quot;You&apos;re not talking about carriers which are bleeding as businesses or in terms of the profits.&quot; Etihad&apos;s own strategy of investing in partner airlines is questioned by some analysts \u2013 &quot;when you see them buying parts of Air Seychelles or Air Berlin you do wonder what they&apos;re doing,&quot; says one \u2013 but the depth of the airline&apos;s pockets is emphasised by moves to take a major stake in Indian airline Jet to secure its three Heathrow slots. &quot;Remember that the European flag carriers are retreating,&quot; Hogan says. &quot;You&apos;re not going to see them operating into Tripoli, Basra, Baghdad.&quot; Not to mention other destinations closer to home: &quot;We fly into Manchester. BA isn&apos;t flying out of Manchester.&quot; This, says Strickland, shows where Gulf airlines can directly compete with Heathrow right now. &quot;While we&apos;re agonising about runways in the south-east, they have no capacity constraint and can offer a very attractive proposition to travellers in the UK. If you&apos;re in Manchester or Newcastle you can bypass London altogether.&quot; Intriguingly, Heathrow boss Colin Matthews \u2013 who now counts Qatar&apos;s sovereign wealth fund as a major shareholder with a 20% stake and has Al-Baker on his board \u2013 has started to make a virtue of the growth of the Gulf hubs, as well as Istanbul. He twice suggested at a business event last week that projections of growing passenger demand in the UK might have to be downplayed as aviation&apos;s focus shifts, meaning that a third runway, rather than a new four-runway facility outside London, might be sufficient for future needs. Scant consolation, perhaps, for a struggling European aviation industry that could do without the competition \u2013 and unfair competition with subsidised fuel, some have complained, although Hogan says it is &quot;a myth&quot; that he has access to free kerosene or money. Strickland, though, suggests that the future is one where the Gulf players become ever more prominent, but also more integrated \u2013 and those that embrace them will do best. &quot;Capacity constraints here are going to help their growth, and some of the markets are ones that Europe cannot access. Traffic flows such as China to Africa or even Asia to Latin America are going to be the great growth of the 21st century.&quot; Instead, European long-haul airlines might, Strickland suggests, have to emulate a Ryanair-style model on a global basis. Passengers now are used to taking an Irish plane from Stockholm to Madrid. That possible evolution might mean BA flying passengers from Latin America to China via a future BA base \u2013 in Dubai. Meanwhile, Europe&apos;s aviation industry has to get used to the fact that the Gulf money it has seen splashed again last week has radically tilted aviation&apos;s playing field, even more than the sponsorship of Man City and Paris St Germain has skewed football. Even the analyst who questions Etihad&apos;s investment strategy, likening it to the ill-fated SwissAir that was dragged under by partner airlines, points to an essential difference: &quot;Switzerland has got a lot of chocolate. And the UAE has got a lot of oil.&quot;", "title": "Emirates' concourse for A380s is another staging post on new Silk Road", "sentences": ["The UAE&apos;s biggest airline, Emirates, last month completed the opening of an entire 20-gate concourse at its Dubai airport base purely for its fleet of giant A380s, Airbus&apos;s flagship aircraft which typically carry 500-plus passengers.", "The Gulf states, the subcontinent and the Middle East all see Abu Dhabi as a destination in its own right, as well as all the through traffic.&quot; If Dubai&apos;s tourist industry and hotel scene is well-established, Abu Dhabi has plans to make a different type of tourist sit up, with a new Louvre, Guggenheim and national museum in fantastical designs from the world&apos;s leading architects on a newly linked island on the city&apos;s edge.", "That possible evolution might mean BA flying passengers from Latin America to China via a future BA base \u2013 in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-03T00:05:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/mar/03/harry-redknapp-qpr-southampton", "tags": ["Premier League", "Southampton", "QPR", "Football", "Sport", "Premier League 2012-13"], "article": "It was Harry Redknapp&apos;s birthday, Queens Park Rangers had just snatched an improbable victory and he had got one over on his old club; but he was still unhappy. He did not look in the mood to celebrate, rather he looked as if he was ready for a fight as he railed against what he claimed was a fabricated story in Saturday&apos;s papers about his players spending a recent trip to Dubai boozing and partying. His face was verging on purple and his voice crackled with anger as he defended his squad&apos;s conduct and spoke of an unnamed agent whose only desire was to &quot;disrupt&quot; QPR. Whatever the truth, it seemed to have a galvanising effect on QPR during their victory at Southampton, although nothing would have been quite as disruptive as losing the outstanding Christopher Samba before the closure of the Russian transfer window last week. Here was another Redknapp line: the revelation that QPR had rebuffed a &quot;massive offer&quot; from a Russian club, a mere month after the defender had moved to Loftus Road from Anzhi Makhachkala for \u00a312m. &quot;We had an offer for Samba right on the deadline and the chairman turned it down,&quot; Redknapp said. &quot;It was more money than we paid for him, to go back to Russia \u2013 a massive offer. This week just gone, the window was still open. &quot; The chairman said to me &apos;What do you think?&apos; I said &apos;Listen, it&apos;s up to you, it&apos;s your club, it&apos;s not a problem if you have to.&apos; It was a real good offer. Whether he would have gone back I don&apos;t know. I left it to the chairman.&quot; Taking Redknapp&apos;s comments at face value, it was just as well Samba stayed. He was instrumental at St Mary&apos;s, winning everything in the air and dominating Rickie Lambert, and he was helped by a fine screening performance from St\u00e9phane Mbia in front of him. Southampton&apos;s threat was easily snuffed out and Gaston Ram\u00edrez&apos;s goal in first-half stoppage-time was handed to him on a silver plate by Julio C\u00e9sar, who had spilled a shot from Jay Rodriguez. QPR had to fight for their third win of the season and, although they are four points behind Wigan Athletic in 17th place, their next four games are against Sunderland, Fulham, Aston Villa and Wigan. Redknapp is not getting carried away, though. &quot;We have not had back-to-back wins since \u2026 when was it, just before World War One I think,&quot; he said. It is not quite that long but QPR have not managed consecutive wins in the league since April 2011, when they were in the Championship. If that sorry sequence is to be ended, they require more performances of this quality from such as Junior Hoilett, who created Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my&apos;s early goal, and the much-maligned Park Ji-sung, whose persistence led to Jay Bothroyd&apos;s late winner. Then, when Southampton pressed for an equaliser, Maya Yoshida was denied by a superb save from Robert Green, who had replaced Julio C\u00e9sar after the Brazilian goalkeeper went off with a groin injury. &quot;He made a great save,&quot; Redknapp said. &quot;To come off the bench stone cold, he did well. He&apos;s an England goalkeeper, isn&apos;t he? He is a proper goalkeeper, he is not a fool. You are talking about a top-class goalkeeper and it was a world-class save.&quot; Southampton seemed unable to cope with the expectation caused by beating Manchester City three weeks ago. Jos\u00e9 Fonte admitted they were flat and the defender blamed a lack of movement from the side&apos;s attackers, not that the defence covered itself in any glory. Mauricio Pochettino has been praised since replacing Nigel Adkins in January but Southampton have won only once since then and are three points above the bottom three. &quot;We know which position we are in,&quot; Fonte said. &quot;We are in a battle with the other teams and know we need points. What&apos;s the point in dominating games and not winning, not taking points?&quot; There are no prizes for the right answer.

The judges baffled observers with a last-minute change in the charges against the men, dropping allegations of embezzlement, forgery, money-laundering and other serious offences in favour of &quot;breach of trust&quot;, which carries a shorter maximum sentence. Kabul Bank nearly collapsed in 2010, and has since been described by western officials as virtually a Ponzi scheme. In addition to their prison time, the chairman, Sherkhan Farnood, and chief executive, Khalilullah Ferozi, have been ordered to pay back a combined total of more than $800m. But the new charges will make it far harder for accountants to claw back the stolen cash from offshore accounts and other hiding places. A money-laundering conviction would have brought an automatic confiscation order, but experts say the three judges only issued a much weaker demand for return of goods obtained illegally. &quot;Today was a disappointment for the resolution of issues resulting from the Kabul Bank fraud,&quot; said Drago Kos, the Slovenian chairman of the joint Afghan and international anti-corruption committee, which organised a public inquiry into the crisis last year. &quot;International standards require sanctions that are proportionate, dissuasive, and effective. We feel that this is lacking in the judgment issued today. Even worse for the Afghan people, this judgment fails to take advantage of provisions in the anti-money-laundering law that would facilitate recovery of the missing money.&quot; Instead, there appears to be little more than a request for the men to return money that they had no scruples about siphoning off. One western official said: &quot;It&apos;s almost like a moral obligation: you took the money, you have got to give it back. How do you enforce that? I&apos;m not sure. &quot;Where do you take it, which court do you take it to? Who actually enforces that provision?&quot; The colourful hearing was a reminder of the sometimes informal nature of Afghan justice, held in a worn but once-imposing courtroom at Kabul&apos;s police headquarters, where vivid blue wall panels covered with gilt embossed plasterwork surrounded inlaid wooden desks. Both of the main defendants took to the stand to vehemently attack the prosecution case and each other, and protest their innocence. Ferozi, who shoulder bumped Farnood on his way to the stand, also marched over to the judges with a letter outlining his version of the bank&apos;s collapse. Defendants mingled with the small audience of mostly journalists and diplomats, and after starting more than an hour late the testy chief justice \u2013 who was trying five men in absentia and had 16 other defendants in court \u2013 told the prosecutor to speed up his summary. All but one were sentenced to imprisonment, ranging from two to five years, and one man was fined. There were concerns about the judicial process, however. The judges took less than 10 minutes to &quot;deliberate&quot; on the convictions, issued a one-page verdict with no explanation of the sentences and the prosecution of some regulators among the accused appeared to have a tenuous legal basis, raising concerns about political bias. The western official said: &quot;There was evidence that was very weak on some of these people. They were just there when this happened, and what they were charged with and convicted with was not telling anybody about it. &quot;You&apos;d have to get pretty deep into it to find out if that was an intentional act that qualified as a crime.&quot; Relative to the puny size of the Afghan economy, Kabul Bank was the biggest banking scandal the world has seen, and as the problems first surfaced there were serious concerns that it could destabilise the country&apos;s entire financial system. Officials will be lucky to get back half the missing cash; many of the assets bought with the stolen money have collapsed in value, including the now-grounded Pamir Airways and lavish Dubai real estate purchased at the height of a property bubble there. The brothers of President Hamid Karzai and the vice-president, Mohammad Fahim, were among the bank&apos;s shareholders, although they have not been prosecuted, and handling of the high-profile case has been seen by the international community as a &quot;litmus test&quot; of Kabul&apos;s desire to rein in corruption. William Patey, then the UK ambassador to Afghanistan, said of the case against Farnood and Firozi last year: &quot;Kabul Bank is so symbolic because it&apos;s two people who have been caught bang to rights; they&apos;ve been caught red-handed. &quot;All the rest remains allegations and suspicions, so that&apos;s why it&apos;s a kind of litmus test. If you won&apos;t do these ones, what chance the rest?&quot; Farnood had a murky past, and in 2007 Interpol issued an arrest warrant for illegal banking activities, organising a criminal group and money-laundering in Russia. Afghan police ignored it, even as he went on a spending spree with Afghan bank money, buying luxury properties and helping other shareholders, friends and political connections line their own pockets. He has been ordered to repay $279m. Firozi was ordered to repay $531m. Both men, who have been under a very loose house arrest for nearly two years and sometimes spotted at smart Kabul restaurants, said they would appeal against their sentences. If the appeals process is as slow as the original trial, and the house arrest is counted towards their time in prison, the men might spend very little time behind bars. The ruling contrasts with other high-profile fraud cases, like that of the disgraced US financier Bernie Madoff, who was sentenced to the maximum 150 years in prison for masterminding a $65bn (\u00a338bn) fraud. Although he stole more cash, and caused financial ruin or serious problems for many individuals, that Ponzi scheme was not considered a threat to the entire US economy. The chief justice, Shams-ul-Rahman Shams, said more than 20 people were still under investigation, and there could be further prosecutions.

For most of the past seven months, up to 70 of the 94 activists accused of plotting to overthrow the government of the United Arab Emirates have been held in secret detention. It was only after their families threatened a sit-in that their relatives were brought to the court blindfolded, some showing obvious signs of torture, malnutrition and mistreatment. Some pleaded with their jailers to &quot;give them the tablets&quot;. All were terrified to speak. The evidence against them is also a mystery. The state prosecutor&apos;s file, which was only sent to the court a few days before the trial began, relies heavily on the forced confessions of two of the accused. On the first day, one of them, Ahmed Ghaith al-Suwaidi, had a dramatic change of heart. Denying the charges, he pleaded with the court to protect his family: &quot;I know that what I am going to say may cost me my life, but I deny the charges and I ask the court to protect my life and the life of my family,&quot; he said, according to witnesses. The accused come from all walks of Emirati life. The leader of the alleged plot, Sheikh Sultan bin Kayed al-Qassimi, is the cousin of the ruler and a member of one of the UAE&apos;s seven ruling families. There are three judges, two human rights defenders, lawyers, teachers, academics as well as students. The social spread of the group is at least consistent with the sweeping nature of the charge. The state hopes to convince the court that the members of the group were plotting to form nothing less than a parallel government. Announcing the trial in January, the attorney general, Salem Saeed Kubaish, claimed that the group had sought to infiltrate schools, universities and ministries. Its &quot;unannounced aims were to seize power and confront the main principles on which the ruling system is based&quot;, he said. The prosecutor claims that this secret society put its seditious purpose down on paper, but bizarrely admits that these &quot;documents&quot; have now been destroyed. The trial is overtly political. At the very outset Dubai&apos;s voluble chief of police Dhahi Khalfan warned that all Gulf states faced an existential threat in the form of Egypt&apos;s Muslim Brotherhood. The group from which most, but by no means all of the defendants come, al-Islah (which means reform), does not conceal its ideological sympathies with Egypt&apos;s ruling Islamist group. Ahmed al-Nuaimi, a leader of al-Islah, whose brother Khaled is one of the 94, said: &quot;Egypt is a republic where you can have established parties. But we are Bedouin and we agree to a ruling family leading the country. All we are saying is that it has to be done under a democratic system.&quot; Many other relatives of the accused also claim loyalty to al Nahayan, Abu Dhabi&apos;s ruling family. To make its political demands crystal clear, al-Islah issued a second petition (the first kicked off the initial wave of arrests) on the eve of the trial. It grounded its demands in the UAE&apos;s constitution and the aims of the country&apos;s founding fathers. Those demands are not unusual in a post-Arab spring world \u2013 they want all members of the UAE&apos;s parliament, the Federal National Council, to be elected and to give that body full legislative and regulatory powers. They call for full judicial independence, the retreat of the security state and standard human rights. For his democratic pains, Khaled al Nuaimi has lost 25kg. His back is now curved after being kept in isolation in a freezing cell. The UAE, often described as one of the Gulf&apos;s most stable states, is acutely sensitive to its international image as a modern, advanced state. It acceded to the UN convention against torture in July last year, but refuses to allow the UN committee to investigate individual allegations of torture. The UAE government also made a reservation to the convention stating that &quot;pain and suffering arising from lawful sanctions&quot; did not, in its view, amount to torture. The trial itself was announced on the eve of a UN human rights review. Both Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International will have much to say to that review. Sarah Leah Whitson, Middle East director for HRW, feared the current trial would be a mockery of justice. Already the judicial process has raised serious concerns, including limiting access to lawyers and withholding key documents concerning charges and the evidence against them, she said. None of which will stop the UAE being viewed as a key western Gulf partner. In December the UAE signed up for 60 Eurofighter Typhoon jets from BAE after a visit by David Cameron. The UAE has signed 17 defence contracts for US-built drones worth $1.42bn. It is France&apos;s biggest arms export destination. British, French, US and even Turkish unqualified support for a regime cracking down so crudely on democracy activists is, however, another uncomfortable example of how key western powers in the Middle East bestride the fence that divides the Arab world after its revolution.

Ben Zygier&apos;s death in December 2010, apparently by suicide, has been shrouded in mystery. Last month, Israel was forced to admit that it had secretly imprisoned Zygier on serious but unspecified charges. Zygier, 34, a father of two, originally from Melbourne but who had lived in Israel for 10 years and was also known by the names Ben Allen and Ben Alon, was believed to have worked for Israel&apos;s external intelligence agency, the Mossad. He was arrested in February 2010. Carr, said: &quot;Open sourced material\u00a0\u2026 would suggest he [Zygier] worked for the intelligence arm of the Israeli government. I cannot confirm or deny those reports, but you can draw your own conclusions.&quot; His comments came as he released his department&apos;s review into Australia&apos;s handling of the Zygier case. He said the review raised &quot;unanswered questions about the use of Australian passports of a dual national and they are not easily resolved&quot;. &quot;If it transpires that Australian passports were used for security or intelligence gathering by Israel in this case; it is something against which we take the strongest opposition,&quot; Carr said. &quot;No country can allow the integrity of its passport system to be compromised.&quot; He was unable to confirm speculation that Zygier&apos;s passports had been used in the 2010 murder of Hamas official Mahmoud al-Mabhouh, an operation in which a team of killers, believed to be Mossad agents, used stolen Australian and British identities. Carr said: &quot;We know that in 2010 there was an episode of this in Dubai. We can&apos;t say it took place in this case with Mr Zygier&apos;s several passports. I hope that one of the inquiries taking place in Israel can clarify this position.&quot; &quot;If that&apos;s confirmed we will be registering our strongest protest.&quot; The Mossad&apos;s use of foreign passports prompted furious reactions from Britain and Australian not long before Zygier&apos;s secret arrest and an Israeli diplomat was expelled from Canberra a few months later. Carr confirmed that Israeli authorities had given assurances to Australia&apos;s intelligence service, Asio, at the time of Zygier&apos;s detention that he would be afforded his full rights in jail. Carr also confirmed that Zygier had more than 50 visits from his family and lawyer during the 10 months he was held. &quot;At no time did his family or his lawyer come to the Australian government and say they needed assistance,&quot; he said. Carr said the decision by his department not to follow up on the Zygier case while he was detained &quot;reflected an assessment that Israel would probably not grant access to Mr Zygier&quot;. Carr reaffirmed that the Australian ambassador in Tel Aviv had not been informed of Zygier&apos;s detention but said the Australian government had sought and relied on assurances from the Israeli government that his legal rights would be respected, that he had a lawyer of his own choosing and that he was not being mistreated.", "title": "Prisoner X was working for Israeli government, Australia confirms", "sentences": ["Carr said: &quot;We know that in 2010 there was an episode of this in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-06T09:41:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2013/mar/06/gender-equality-universities-global-issue", "tags": ["International", "Higher Education Network", "Professional development", "Recruitment and HR", "Management and administration", "Higher education", "Education", "University administration"], "article": "Around one in five UK university professors are female. That&apos;s better than 3%, which was the figure in 1989. But it&apos;s nowhere near parity \u2013 and in many parts of the world, the number of women working at the top level of academia or in senior university management positions is far worse. The failure of higher education institutions to fully accept women into their most senior structures has led female academics to demand a radical solution. At the British Council&apos;s Going Global conference in Dubai, an international grouping of senior women called for equality to be made a key performance indicator in quality audits of higher education institutions. The fewer women at the top table, the idea goes, the lower down the league tables a university would slide. It&apos;s the first demand of six in what is being called a Manifesto for Change for Women in Academic Leadership and Research. Female academics, the manifesto says, must also start getting a lot more of the big money for research projects, with &quot;gender implications and impact&quot; being included by grant making bodies as criteria against which funding applications are assessed. Other points include a requirement for &quot;mainstreaming&quot;, so that diversity is fundamentally incorporated in all of a university&apos;s practices and procedures, and the creation of a global database on women and leadership in higher education, so that it&apos;s easier to see how slowly \u2013 or indeed how fast \u2013 the situation improves country by country. A series of British Council workshops and seminars in Hong Kong and Tokyo have been exploring the reasons behind what remains a considerable equality gap in virtually every country in the world. Evidence from an international group of female academics has been analysed by Professor Louise Morley from the Centre for Higher Education and Equality Research, who says that patterns of discrimination appear similar across national boundaries. &quot;Barriers include the failure to recognise, identify and nurture women&apos;s talent, the gendered division of labour inside the academy, with women frequently responsible for the organisational housework, [and the] view that men are more suited to leadership authority,&quot; says Morley. In regions which seem to show less discrimination against women academics with ambitions to progress, a range of factors come into play. Sometimes those factors are not particularly positive: in the Philippines and Sri Lanka, Morley explains, female academics have been able to rise up the career ladder because the profession isn&apos;t perceived as desirable, prestigious, or sufficiently well-remunerated by men. Some barriers apply globally, but others are distinct and particular to a region. Indonesian PhD student Lishia Erza-Evans notes that because her country is made up of 17,000 islands, access to university level education is the first problem to be solved. &quot;Women in eastern parts of Indonesia tend to find bigger challenges in pursuing postgraduate degrees as they might have to travel long distances,&quot; she says. &quot;Culturally as well, men usually get the first option to go outside of their island to pursue higher education. Distance and technology enhanced learning is not impossible in this day and age, but for this to be accessible, infrastructure plays a huge role. The government must take the lead in pushing for more infrastructure development.&quot; Building better infrastructure is expensive, but other actions to support women can be simple and cheap. Morley cites Norway&apos;s mainstreaming practices, which include gender analysis, development programmes, mentoring, and quota systems, and Austria&apos;s Excellentia programme, which offers financial incentives to universities that appoint women to the professoriate. In Sweden, where women make up 43% of vice-chancellors, Morley says &quot;the appointments system has made a difference [with] more accountability and vice-chancellors appointed by the state, rather than by individual universities.&quot; Where women have gained significant seniority \u2013 no matter which country they work in \u2013 they will often have had to fight against powerful expectations of the role they should prioritise: that of mother and home-maker. &quot;Whilst my children needed time and attention from me, I also had to establish myself and prove my capabilities at work,&quot; explains professor Rohayu Abdul-Ghani, now deputy director at Universiti Kebangsaan, Malaysia. &quot;There was no support from the university, at least none that I was aware of other than the flexibility in my work hours, which was a great help but in itself not enough.&quot; Without her husband&apos;s unstinting (and in Malaysian culture, highly unusual) support for her career \u2013 which came at some cost to his own \u2013 Abdul-Ghani says she would most likely have found it impossible to progress into senior management. If a woman is building her career, she cannot bear the workload of family life alone, she continues. &quot;It would be utterly ridiculous to expect career-women on leadership paths to continue to play the role of traditional women. Such expectations and any attempt to fulfill them would only lead to additional conflict, stress and possibly burnout.&quot; While some Malaysian government appointments mean that women have gained vice-chancellor positions \u2013 there is a stated target of 30% \u2013 more action needs to be taken, says Abdul-Ghani, not least because some women have declined senior administrative roles when they have been offered. Mentoring, though it may sound soft and fluffy, can be enormously influential, she believes, and there must be more of it. The need for a space in which female academics can share experiences and support each other&apos;s ambitions is all too evident in Morley&apos;s response to a question over the costs of pursuing seniority in academia. &quot;Leadership is perceived as unattractive by many women,&quot; she explains, &quot;not just because of the long-hours culture \u2013 many women work very long hours anyway \u2013 but because senior leadership can involve implementing unpopular neo-liberal reforms, being in the minority as a woman, and having to constantly prove one&apos;s worth in cultures that do not respect women&apos;s authority. Women have the additional workload of dealing with sexism and discrimination. All of this takes a toll on one&apos;s work life balance, health, social life and general well-being. Many women report a sense of fragility and precariousness and always feeling at risk.&quot; As a high-flying businesswoman able to see the world of academia from an outsider&apos;s perspective, Erza-Evans agrees. &quot;To build a career, academic or others, women tend to have to work harder and longer. We have to endure various external and internal challenges. We are expected to do everything all at once and to be flawless at that too \u2013 for example, if you miss a paper deadline because your child is ill, you&apos;re not cut out to be an academic because you are an emotional woman who cannot prioritise!&quot; Policy measures are needed, but so are practical and imaginative ideas that can be applied globally, not just in one country or region. And it&apos;s not just tinkering at the edges that will make the difference in the end, says Abdul-Ghani. &quot;Higher education must make appointment of women academic administrators and development of young female academic talents part of their strategic goals. I have seen this to be effective at [my university] with the setting up of gender diversity as a key performance indicator. In addition, the institutes are held accountable for gender diversity and for the remedial measures to be taken where necessary. Until this is done, women academics will continue to be excluded and marginalized from becoming senior, influential players in HE.&quot; &apos;Going global&apos; Manifesto for change \u2022 Equality as quality \u2013 equality as key performance indicator in audits, and gender equity included in reputation league tables \u2022 Research grants \u2013 monitoring of applications and awards made to women, with gender implications included in assessment criteria \u2022 Journals \u2013 editorial boards, and appointments of editors, need more transparent selection processes, and policies on equality \u2022 Data \u2013 establishment of global database on women and leadership in higher education \u2022 Development \u2013 more investment in mentorship and leadership development for women and gender included in existing programmes \u2022 Mainstreaming \u2013 review of work cultures to ensure diversity is mainstreamed into all organisational practices and procedures We will be hosting a live chat on gender equality in global higher education on Friday 8 March, 2013 from 12\u20132pm GMT \u2013 email claire.shaw@guardian.co.uk if you are interested in joining our panel This content is brought to you by Guardian Professional.

The new Triple E ships, which will come into service this summer, will be able to carry 18,000 6.1-metre (20ft) containers, known as TEUs \u2013 three times as many as the biggest container ships 15\u00a0years ago. When US businessman Malcolm McLean invented the idea of carrying goods in metal boxes in the 1950s his first vessel, a converted second world war oil tanker the Ideal X, carried just 58 containers. Today, if all the containers on a Triple E were stacked on top of each other they would touch the stratosphere \u2013 29 miles above the earth. If they were unloaded on to a single train it would need to be 68 miles long. Inside, you could squeeze in 36,000 cars. Because they&apos;re so vast the Triple Es \u2013 which stands for economy of scale, energy efficiency and environmentally improved \u2013 will be able to move goods more cheaply and efficiently than current ships. But, they will be far too big for most of the world&apos;s ports. No port in North or South America is currently able to take the vessels, nor the Panama canal locks \u2013 designed for the last generation of container ships \u2013 which are due to open next year. The Triple Es will just about squeeze through the Suez canal, and will ply only the China to Europe route, bringing in goods and returning with cargoes of scrap metal and plastic waste for recycling \u2013 but mostly empty. Only a handful of European ports, including Felixstowe and Southampton in the UK, are equipped to handle the behemoths. Those that cannot are investing hundreds of millions to make sure they can. The UK is building a \u00a31.5bn port 20 miles east of London&apos;s original ports. London Gateway, which is being bankrolled by Dubai&apos;s DP World, has just installed the first of 24 138-metre high cranes designed specifically to reach up and across the Triple Es&apos; vast deck of containers. London Gateway, which is due to open before the end of the year, is Britain&apos;s biggest construction project after Crossrail, employing 2,500 workers. The government hopes the port will support 36,000 jobs. Andrew Bowen, the project&apos;s director of engineering, said the port will be able to handle seven Triple Es at the same time. &quot;There is very limited capacity for the biggest new ships at Felixstowe and Southampton, and it&apos;s very important that we as a country have the capacity to handle the largest vessels travelling the world,&quot; he said. &quot;If we don&apos;t have the capacity to handle them, it would like if we didn&apos;t have an airport to handle the A380 [superjumbo planes] and you&apos;d have to go to the continent to change planes. &quot;It would be the same for containers, and that extra handling would make goods more expensive for British consumers. And cost UK manufacturers more to ship out.&quot; Since 1990 the UK has slid from the world&apos;s fifth biggest exporter to its 11th \u2013 behind Belgium, Italy and Russia. The UK is ranked 19th in exporters to India, with just 1.5% of the market. The EU recently signed free trade agreements with Colombia, Peru and half a dozen central American countries, it is also in negotiations with China, Canada and Singapore. The result could add about \u20ac275bn (\u00a3237bn) to Europe&apos;s economy \u2013 a boost equal to another Austria joining the EU. As well as triggering the construction of new ports, growing freight traffic is also causing the reshaping of some the world&apos;s most historic ports. Napoleon Bonaparte first recognised Antwerp&apos;s strategic position 80 miles inland in 1811 when he ordered the construction of the Belgian city&apos;s first port. Antwerp, which boasts inland waterway and rail-links across Europe, has been at the centre of global trade ever since. The city has Europe&apos;s second biggest port, but is at risk of falling behind Dutch rival Rotterdam as most of Antwerp docks are unable to accept the last generation of container ships, let alone the Triple Es. The Belgians, however, have a solution. They are digging a very big hole \u2013 1km long by 70 metres wide by 18 metres deep. Among the excavated earth \u2013 enough to fill Wembley stadium eight times over \u2013 workers found the preserved remains of a prehistoric whale. Palaeontologist and archaeologists now work alongside construction workers for two days a week.     The world's largest dock is being constructed in Antwerp, and will enable the Belgium port to accommodate Triple Es. Photograph: Yves Herman/Reuters    In 2016, after 53 months of construction, the hole will become the world&apos;s largest lock, and it will enable the biggest ships to enter into all of Antwerp&apos;s docks. The \u20ac340m construction project is central to the EU&apos;s Transport 2050 plan to cope with increasing trade to and from Europe. Philippe Maystadt, president of the European Investment Bank (EIB), which is financing half of the money, said the lock &quot;will benefit not only the port of Antwerp and Flanders but also Europe&quot;. Some fear all the investment pumped into London Gateway, Antwerp and other ports could have a limited shelf life if ships continue to grow. Maersk Line \u2013 a Danish shipping firm that has ordered 20 Triple Es from South Korean shipbuilder Daewoo \u2013 believes the vessels will be the biggest on the seas for some years to come. The company, which is thought to be basis of Robert Zeuthen&apos;s fictional shipping giant Zeeland in the The Killing, is the world&apos;s biggest shipping company with a fleet of more than 500 vessels. Soren Toft, its vice-president of operations, said: &quot;This is not about adding big ships because we like them, this is about adding capacity for our customers. &quot;Parts of the world can&apos;t accommodate these [triple Es], but we believe these are the right and efficient ships for the Asia to Europe route.&quot; But David Tozer, global manager for container ships at Lloyd&apos;s Register Group, warned that even bigger \u2013 25,000-container capable ships \u2013 are perfectly feasible. &quot;We&apos;ve gone from a maximum of 5,000 containers in 1998 to 18,000 now. The technology is there to carry on getting bigger and bigger. It is absolutely massive business \u2013 almost everything that can be carried is carried in a container. And it&apos;s all about economies of scale.&quot; The next generation of ships, he reckons, may be too big to fit through the Strait of Malacca between the Malay peninsula and the Indonesian island of Sumatra. They may then have to take the long route from China to Europe \u2013 possibly all the way round Australia. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 March 2013 to correct a typographical error.", "title": "Size matters as Triple E container ships sail for Europe", "sentences": ["London Gateway, which is being bankrolled by Dubai&apos;s DP World, has just installed the first of 24 138-metre high cranes designed specifically to reach up and across the Triple Es&apos; vast deck of containers."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-06T17:46:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/07/england-dismal-first-test-form", "tags": ["England in New Zealand 2012-13", "England cricket team", "New Zealand cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "Once more England began a Test series abroad by hitting the ground hobbling so badly that they will probably be sent for a scan and surgery in the States.

A recent report Sex and Power 2013: Who Runs Britain? published in the Observer revealed the absence of women in senior roles in UK higher education (as other sectors), with figures showing only 14.2% of vice chancellors are female. Another report published by the UCU suggested one in five professors are women (20.5%), despite the fact they make up almost half (47.3%) of the non-professorial academic workforce. And this is not only a UK picture. In Australia, for example, research shows that despite policy reforms, inequity in terms of pay and status continues to be a problem, with few women academics employed in senior positions. And as Louise Tickle reported this week, some of the fastest growing higher education systems have the poorest records on gender parity. At the British Council&apos;s Going Global conference in Dubai this week, a manifesto calling for university rankings to take the gender gap into account was discussed by an international grouping of senior women. It is part of a range of measures demanded to redress the poor representation of women in academic leadership and research in many countries including the UK. As recent coverage of this subject on the higher education network has shown, there are many issues at hand: 1. Recruitment. Many departments in universities are failing to recruit as many women as they do men to senior positions. When Cardiff University School of Medicine carried out a self-assessment of their department, they discovered they recruited twice as many men as women to the senior lecturer grade, and had three times as many male professional recruits. How can departments ensure more women are selected, or applying, for more senior roles? 2. Applications. Some research shows that women are less inclined to apply for a promotion compared to men, and that they tend to be less motivated and career orientated. This sounds like a broad generalisation, but, why then aren&apos;t women applying for professional posts? 3. Working methods. Women do not appear to write as many sole author articles as expected, according to research conducted by Karen Schucan Bird, but are more likely to embrace co-authorship with other women. Perhaps Bird is right to be worried, with research highlighting a gender bias in the peer-review system for postdoctoral fellowship applications in Sweden, leading to peer reviewers overestimating male achievements and/or underestimating female performance. For women to achieve parity in universities, policy measures are needed, but so are practical and innovative ideas that can be applied globally.

The hearings are likely to put more pressure on Boeing as it fights to get its jets back in the air. Transport secretary Ray LaHood has said plans to fix its battery issues will face &quot;a lot of questions&quot;. On Thursday, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) released its interim report into the fire that broke out in the battery of a 787 parked at Boston&apos;s Logan airport in January. Releasing the findings, Deborah Hersman, the NTSB chairman, said she planned to hold a meeting next month to explore lithium-ion battery technology and transport safety. It would help the industry &quot;better understand the risks and benefits associated with lithium batteries, and illuminate how manufacturers and regulators evaluate the safety of new technology,&quot; Hersman said. She has already criticised the certification process for the battery. &quot;The expectation in aviation is to never experience a fire aboard an aircraft,&quot; she said in January. Robert Mann, founder of consultant RW Mann, said: &quot;It&apos;s pretty tough to come up with a solution if you haven&apos;t found the cause.&quot; He said the investigation could now widen beyond the battery. Mann said that the cargo industry had serious concerns about lithium-ion technology and was likely to raise those concerns at the NTSB meeting. A fatal fire broke out on UPS flight in Dubai in 2008 that had been carrying large quantities of lithium ion batteries. Lithium-ion batteries have caused fires in cars, computers and mobile phones as well as small aircraft. The Dreamliner is the first large passenger jet to use the lightweight technology on such a scale. As well as the Boston fire, a battery in an All Nippon Airways 787 set off a smoke alarm while in flight, triggering an emergency landing. That incident is now being investigated by Japanese authorities. The delays to 787 deliveries led Boeing rival Airbus to ditch plans to use lithium-ion batteries on its wide-body jet, the A350-XWB.The 499-page report is the most detailed yet into what went wrong. The NTSB report makes clear it has yet to find a root cause for the fire. The board is still early in the investigation into the cause of the blaze on the Boston battery and experts said investigators may never determine a root cause because the battery was so badly burned. &quot;With the grounding of the 787 fleet, concurrent international incident investigations, redesign and re-certification activities taking place simultaneously, it is essential to provide the aviation community, policy makers and the public with the factual information we are developing,&quot; said Hersman. &quot;Releasing an interim report provides a window into the significant investigative work that has been accomplished so far.&quot; Boeing had delivered just 50 of its Dreamliner jets when the issue emerged and faces penalties if future deliveries are not made on time. It delivered a plan to address the battery issues to the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) on 22 February. That plan is believed to involve a stronger casing for the batteries, reinforced separation between its eight cells and a venting system that would direct potentially hazardous gases outside the jet. LaHood told the Wall Street Journal that Boeing&apos;s plans would come under intense scrutiny. &quot;I have made it very clear that I want a thorough review&quot; of the Boeing plan, LaHood said. &quot;I am going to ask a lot of questions&quot; before a final decision is made.", "title": "Boeing faces more questions as US watchdog investigates battery technology", "sentences": ["A fatal fire broke out on UPS flight in Dubai in 2008 that had been carrying large quantities of lithium ion batteries."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-07T19:16:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/mar/09/talking-horses-racing-tips-blog", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Horse racing tips"], "article": "Following his debut successes in the Grand National, the Champion Hurdle and the Paddy Power Gold Cup last year, the Imperial Cup is one of the last jump races of any significance to elude Paul Nicholls. The champion trainer of the past seven seasons is well placed to rectify that at Sandown this afternoon, when he fields Mr Mole (3.15). The first horse sent to Nicholls by the prolific owner J P McManus, Mr Mole is as lightly raced and progressive as one could wish after just three starts over hurdles. It is a profile that seems to suit the Imperial Cup, won by 11 horses aged four or five since 1995. The most notable piece of form involving Mr Mole so far is his hurdles debut at Exeter in October, when he readily beat Melodic Rendezvous, two years his senior. The runner-up is unbeaten in three subsequent runs, including the Grade One Tolworth here in January, and is only 10-1 for Tuesday&apos;s Supreme Novice Hurdle, which opens the Cheltenham Festival. While it would probably be a mistake to read that form literally, it was a fair signal that Mr Mole had talent and he proved a long way ahead of his handicap rating last month at Taunton. Another 12lb higher today, he must do much better but looks up to it. David Pipe is good at this race, just as his father was, but he is full of regret that the owner insisted on running Tanerko Emery at Ffos Las last time, when the horse was not quite fit. He ran second anyway and was raised 6lb, without which he would have a fine chance here. As it is, Kazlian appears Pipe&apos;s first string, having had a wind operation since flopping in December. He is just 2lb higher than when fourth at last year&apos;s Festival. 2.05 Sandown Though he lost his unbeaten record last time, Close Touch&apos;s second behind African Gold at Doncaster suggests he is not harshly treated off this mark on his handicap debut. 2.20 Wolverhampton From the Tom Dascombe yard that won this last year, Kenny Powers won his maiden here and has been running well in Dubai.

The twinkle in his eye suggested that will only add to the fun. It helps that Koukash, who spent three years of his childhood in a refugee camp in Jordan after the family farm in Palestine had been bombed, looks every inch the Bond villain. But among the long-suffering rugby league supporters of Salford he is known simply as the saviour, or the Good Doctor. Koukash found out about the latter at Friday&apos;s lunch from the Salford fan Mike Walling \u2013 the sitcom actor and writer who was compering \u2013 and that it became common parlance after it was used in Macbeth. The club, who switched to the Northern Union for its second season in 1896 and were nicknamed les diables rouges (Red Devils) for their adventurous play on a tour of France long before Matt Busby snaffled it for the football team across the Manchester ship canal, appeared to be heading out of existence for much of the winter. John Wilkinson, the proud Salfordian who had kept them going through three decades as chairman, had taken them from The Willows in Weaste to a smart new stadium near the Trafford Centre \u2013 but the financial situation was grim, and the city council&apos;s first attempt to save the club had been defeated by political opposition. Fortunately for Salford the Rugby Football League&apos;s chief executive, Nigel Wood, had given Koukash such an earbashing about the game&apos;s merits during an overnight flight from Manchester to Dubai a few months earlier that he was looking for a new sporting project to add to the string of racehorses that brought him a record 101 winners in 2012. He completed a deal, which involved paying off the creditors in full, days before the start of the season. The period of uncertainty stretching back to last summer had taken its toll on the playing squad, so heavy opening defeats by Wigan, Catalans and Leeds were wholly predictable. They somehow snatched a stirring and unlikely win against a hapless Hull KR. But when that was followed by a drubbing by the previously winless London Broncos, the new owner, who had been frustrated in his attempts to make a big-name signing, lashed out \u2013 and Phil Veivers, the popular Queenslander who had been coaching the team and played a key role in holding the squad together through the winter, was summarily dismissed. That prompted inevitable outrage from any other Super League coach whom Sky Sports News chose to ask, although in truth Veivers had only gained the position by default after years on the support staff at Wigan and Bradford. Koukash is happy to take the flak but he has surrounded himself with a coterie of experts who have clearly judged that a high-profile, cutting-edge coach is required if Salford are to confound the pessimists who say that rapid progress up the Super League is impossible. But he is not finished there. Ahead of Sunday&apos;s tricky trip to Wakefield Trinity he informed the diners at the Rugby Club of Manchester that Salford will be requesting a loosening of their salary cap from the current \u00a31.7m to at least \u00a32.1m for each of the next two seasons to allow them to make up for lost time. While unlikely to be granted, that request may provide encouragement to the handful of other club owners who believe the cap is promoting mediocrity and thwarting ambition.

Afterwards, these crowds of upmarket Indonesians and expats will head to any number of bars along the bustling artery of this once sleepy seaside village of Seminyak, a now vibrant town on the island of Bali that 10 years ago was lined by rice paddy fields and populated with farmers. All along Jalan Laksmana, Seminyak&apos;s main thoroughfare, glass-fronted stores sell high-end surfer-inspired chic, such as \u00a3125 bikinis and organic wheatgrass shots, while restaurants cater to the many bule \u2013 foreigners \u2013 by offering Japanese, Italian and fusion Indonesian cuisine at candlelit tables with Ibiza-like club music on the sound system. Firms with names like Exotiq Property and Elite Havens detail beachfront villas running at \u00a31.5m and higher, showcasing homes close to &quot;the action&quot; \u2013 Bali&apos;s famous hangouts like Ku De Ta and Potato Head, where languages overheard can range from French to Russian to Chinese. Bali has long been famous as a playground for both the rich and the not-so-rich, easily providing both villas and backpacker hostels so that visitors can enjoy its white sandy beaches and turquoise waters whatever their budget. But now this island of 4 million is finding another kind of fame \u2013 as a major investment opportunity for the luxury property market. Luxury property prices in 2012 jumped in Indonesia by more than anywhere else in the world, according to research by Knight Frank. The capital, Jakarta, saw an astonishing increase of 38% in luxury property prices from 2011, and Bali came in a respectable second at 20%, tying with Dubai. While Monaco may still be the world&apos;s most expensive place to buy a residential property\u2013 homes there can cost up to $5,920 (\u00a33,960) per square foot \u2013 if Indonesia keeps up this pace, that could soon change. There are now more millionaires in Asia than anywhere else in the world, and in Indonesia, whose booming economy could surpass the UK&apos;s to become the world&apos;s seventh-largest by 2030, individuals&apos; net worth has shot up 7% year on year. What does that mean? In simple terms, says Zoe Rice of property firm Elite Havens&apos; flagship Seminyak office \u2013 a low-slung, white-and-blue, beachhouse-themed property that looks as though it should be facing the Indian ocean rather than the village&apos;s busy square \u2013 property investment in Indonesia is simply &quot;better value than keeping money in the bank&quot;. Much of the growth underpinning Bali&apos;s healthy property market comes from domestic buyers, notably the wealthy players of Surabaya and Jakarta, says Rice. But there is also a steady stream of buyers from Australia, France and the UK, and Asian expats from Singapore and Hong Kong, who are keeping the market afloat. And they&apos;re not just purchasing second or third holiday homes: vacant land is the number-one choice for Indonesians, followed by hotels, condo-hotels and private villas. For foreign buyers, purchases are of homes and villas for full-time residential use; a market report to be released this week by Elite Havens cites Bali&apos;s high tourist arrivals, healthy economy and shifting of government debt to investment grade as reasons why the island is &quot;resilien[t] and [a] safe haven for investors in these globally turbulent times&quot;. &quot;Capital appreciation has been substantial [in Bali] in the past decade,&quot; says Rice. &quot;There&apos;s been a dramatic increase in Seminyak, where land prices have almost tripled in the last two years because demand is so high and supply so low.&quot; All this has not been lost on local people, many of whom have taken to nicknaming the island kampung bule \u2013 &quot;whitey town&quot; \u2013 because of the sea of foreigners swarming Bali&apos;s streets and beaches. &quot;Housing in Bali is expensive now because many bule live in their own private villas, and they buy with dollars and pay dollar prices,&quot; says 31-year-old Budi Susila, a taxi driver who spends his days transporting foreigners around the island. &quot;That makes locals want to sell their land to bule, which makes more bule interested in moving here, which means that every year we lose more rice paddies and more greenery. The government gives permits very easily for new construction because they get money in their pocket.&quot; Expat hotspot Seminyak has just lost its last rice paddy, says Rice, who claims that the central road that cuts through Legian and up to Seminyak was &quot;lined left and right&quot; with them a decade ago. Now the roads are choked with taxis, 4x4s and motorbikes manned by tanned blonds with surfboards in tow, who snake along many of the busiest areas in southern Bali in traffic so heavy that a 30-minute drive can easily turn into a two-hour one. Non-beachfront land around the most sought-after areas, including Seminyak and Petitenget, is now worth 2.5bn rupiah per 100 square metres \u2013 \u00a3171,000 \u2013 with prices decreasing the further north and inland one travels, Rice says. But much of the attraction of buying land or property in Bali is being close to the action: Seminyak serves as the de facto centre of Bali&apos;s expat beachfront scene, as it is home to world-class restaurants, clubs and bars, where the rich and beautiful can chill out with bottles of champagne over views of Bali&apos;s famous sunsets. But even in Ubud, where organic markets and yoga studios rub shoulders with art galleries in what is deemed Bali&apos;s northern &quot;cultural centre&quot;, land prices increased some 55% in 2012, according to research by Elite Havens. In Jakarta, which saw a 38% jump in its residential luxury market prices last year, the story is a little different. There, buyers are investing primarily in flats in the central business district in projects that developers are calling &quot;critical housing&quot; \u2013 prime property in an overcrowded metropolis of 12 million, says Knight Frank&apos;s Hasan Pamudji. &quot;The economy in Indonesia has been growing roughly 6% every year for the last few years, so there are more rich people in Indonesia now than ever,&quot; he says. &quot;But middle and lower incomes have increased as well, which has increased the demand for property.&quot; Although the city is home to extravagant, multimillion-dollar mansions lined by barbed-wire fences, it is flats, rather than houses, that are the new property of choice for those buying property in Jakarta because &quot;they offer security, safety and easy transportation&quot;, says Pamudji. &quot;Traffic congestion in Jakarta is very bad, so some buy condos close to their work or business, which saves them having to commute every day from the suburbs or further away.&quot; Often these condos are the first investment for young couples or upcoming wealthy individuals, he adds, with the average price in downtown&apos;s &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; retailing at 30m rupiah \u2013 \u00a32,050 \u2013 per square metre. Back in Bali, development can be seen pretty much everywhere along the southern coast, with old buildings bulldozed to make way for new commercial properties, among them glittering cafes and restaurant ventures to cater to the ever-burgeoning market of wealthy clientele. In the upmarket beachfront Canggu area, Echo Beach is now home to an InterContinental hotel and the Sea Sentosa project, a resort that calls itself &quot;the benchmark for unparalleled luxury&quot;, while a Sunset Road extension is planned to link the capital, Denpasar, with Bali&apos;s more western beaches. But there has been so much development that the local government has recently placed a moratorium along the most congested beachfront areas and is encouraging growth in the island&apos;s more remote locations instead. Even there, however, investment can prove tricky, says Australian investment banker Richard Jenkins, who moved to Bali three years ago from northern Australia with his wife and two young children. Having bought a clifftop plot of land in Uluwatu, a windswept, still undeveloped area on the island&apos;s most southern tip, the Jenkinses planned to build their own house \u2013 but the permits were never forthcoming. The family now want to move to a \u00a31m property in Seminyak with three villas that they plan to renovate, turning two into holiday rentals. &quot;This is a good place to invest, definitely,&quot; says Jenkins. &quot;There aren&apos;t that many places to say that about in the western world. But while it is a positive real estate market, I do get the impression of a looming glut: there&apos;s just so much building here going on, and it&apos;s all for the tourist market.&quot;", "title": "In Bali, rich foreigners are sparking a property frenzy, but who benefits?", "sentences": ["The capital, Jakarta, saw an astonishing increase of 38% in luxury property prices from 2011, and Bali came in a respectable second at 20%, tying with Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-09T20:02:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2013/mar/09/alex-ferguson-wayne-rooney-manchester-united", "tags": ["Sir Alex Ferguson", "Wayne Rooney", "Manchester United", "Football", "Sport"], "article": " A quick story about Harry Redknapp going back to his days as West Ham&apos;s manager and a press conference at the club&apos;s training ground. There are reports of him taking Marco Negri on trial from Rangers but Redknapp looks bewildered. He is striking a pose that Robert De Niro would be proud of. &quot;Negri?&quot; he wants to know. &quot;Who? No, don&apos;t know what you are talking about.&quot; That&apos;s the moment someone points out that if you look through the window you can see Negri outside, getting some stuff out of his car. &quot;Oh,&quot; he says. &quot;Oh, that Marco Negri.&quot; Sometimes in this business the best policy is not to take everything at face value. At times, as every manager will tell you, there are newspaper stories that are plain wrong. On other occasions the denials have more spin than a waltzer and, no matter how cynical you become, it&apos;s not an easy thing knowing what should, or should not, set off what, in America, they call the BS meter. Roberto Mancini&apos;s public strategy until the night Mario Balotelli left Manchester City was to insist that they would not sell him no matter how many controversies he brought their way. Of course it was. If he had been honest, admitted that Balotelli was driving everyone round the twist and the club would be happy to send him on his way, it would have advertised the fact he was for sale and driven down the price. So Mancini went through the pretence when the message City were really sending out was that if Milan wanted to sign him they would have to come up with a pretty decent offer. Silvio Berlusconi, meanwhile, described Balotelli as a &quot;rotten apple&quot; and said there was no way, as Milan&apos;s president, he would want a player with that reputation. Now Balotelli is at San Siro, Berlusconi says it was just part of the transfer tactics. &quot;It was a strategy, the idea of [Milan&apos;s negotiator] Adriano\u00a0Galliani, to ensure the price did not go up.&quot; Both sides, in other words, were willing to say whatever was necessary. Each had a plan. Neither\u00a0told the truth. This is the way it works in football. The licence man turns up in The Young Ones and Vyvyan decides the best way to hide the evidence is to eat the television. A journalist asks a football manager about something he does not want out and the manager tries to hide the evidence another way. Just consider the ocean&apos;s worth of red herrings that routinely crop up in Sir Alex Ferguson&apos;s team news updates. &quot;Do ICI send an email to another biochemicals company telling them their new discoveries in drugs?&quot; Ferguson likes to ask. &quot;Does any major company tell its opponents what they are doing?&quot; It&apos;s a culture of deliberate misinformation and, frustrating as it is, Ferguson has a point. Even sitting this side of the fence, it&apos;s easy to understand why it happens. The problem, however, if you play by those rules is when the story is about something a bit more serious than a made-up hamstring strain or some out-of-luck striker from Rangers. Redknapp was almost trembling with rage when he responded to the Daily Mirror allegations last Saturday in which three unnamed players were quoted talking about a club trip to Dubai turning into a glorified stag party. It was, he said, a complete fabrication. Yet the chairman, Tony Fernandes, and the co-owner, Amit Bhatia, who frequently comment on club issues via Twitter have kept schtum about what is a particularly damaging story. The Mirror, you might imagine, would be facing legal action if the story were untrue. Yet there have been no solicitors involved and no other recriminations. So the question after that is whether we trust and believe Redknapp. It can all get very foggy. It&apos;s the same for Ferguson when he says there are &quot;no issues at all&quot; with Wayne Rooney. Ferguson certainly sounded like he meant it, but then you remember how aggrieved he has sounded in the past when similar questions have been about other players \u2013 David Beckham, Ruud van Nistelrooy and Juan Sebasti\u00e1n Ver\u00f3n, to name just three \u2013 and the Manchester United manager has gone into full cover-up mode. Ferguson famously talked of not selling Real Madrid, or &quot;that mob&quot; as he described them, &quot;a virus&quot; never mind Cristiano Ronaldo. The story eventually came out that an agreement was already pretty much in place and United rushed out a statement saying there was &quot;no substance&quot; to it. Since then all the various parties have talked about it being set up a year in advance. This is why it&apos;s probably worth being open\u2011minded when it comes to Rooney. Paddy Crerand, a member of the 1968 European Cup-winning side, is now the main pundit on MUTV and, by his own admission, as rabidly pro-United and pro-Ferguson as they come. Yet even he slipped off-message during an interview for News at Ten. Crerand was asked, very matter-of-factly, whether we could take Ferguson&apos;s word for it. &quot;No!&quot; he replied, laughing. &quot;No!&quot; There are, after all, a lot of people close to the subject who are saying very different things and some reliable information to give foundation to the stories about Rooney&apos;s fitness issues (for starters, turning up overweight at the start of the season) and the friction that has intermittently existed between manager and player. At the same time it does appear to have been exaggerated in some places. Ferguson&apos;s relationships with some players will always be up and down, as Rio Ferdinand, Nani, Anderson and probably several more of Rooney&apos;s colleagues can all testify. Being left out against Madrid was undoubtedly a bruising experience for Rooney and a reflection, perhaps, of how he has lost some of the old stardust, but it was always a leap of logic to think it automatically meant he would be off in the summer. As for Paris Saint-Germain, they might have the money but there is something about that particular kind of joie de vivre that doesn&apos;t sit quite right. Where Rooney is from, &quot;la&quot; is another word for mate. True, the French do tend to be a bit more tolerant about footballers having the occasional puff on a Gauloises. It still feels like an odd place, however, to imagine Wazza taking root. Rooney&apos;s camp, perhaps most tellingly, have not denied there are problems or taken issue with the stories that his future is uncertain. Other associates are talking openly about whether he might leave and it would be wrong to read too much into Ferguson wielding his banning stick again, expelling the Daily Mail and the Independent from Friday&apos;s press conference, other than him wanting to exert an uncommon form of control over the sports pages. Those newspapers have not been shut out for reporting that Rooney might be sold, or is not taking enough care of himself, or has an erratic relationship with his manager. Otherwise it would have been a lot more than two. Instead Ferguson&apos;s temper was pricked because some of the information was attributed to &quot;sources&quot; at Old Trafford when, this season more than ever, he has been trying to eliminate leaks. The Daily Telegraph discovered as much when it reported Ferdinand would miss the opening match of the season at Everton because of injury. It turned out players from both clubs had been gossiping and David Moyes knew anyway. Yet Ferguson banned the\u00a0newspaper for three months and singed the eyebrows of one if its\u00a0reporters with a blast of invective the next time he saw him. All of which\u00a0brings us back to the original point. Sometimes in football the simple\u00a0fact is they don&apos;t want you to know the truth. Players should wait until the end to choose their man of the season The Professional Footballers&apos; Association will hold their dinner on 28 April and, for Arsenal, it threatens to be a day of considerable indignities. Earlier, they play Manchester United when Robin van Persie could confirm his first Premier League winner&apos;s medal. Then a quick change into his dinner jacket and off to see if he has been voted player of the year. Van Persie&apos;s form has dipped recently but he is probably still the marginal favourite bearing in mind Sir Alex Ferguson and Roberto Mancini cite him as the player who has made all the difference in the title race. Luis Su\u00e1rez has more league goals, 21 to 19, but Van Persie&apos;s have won 19 points compared with eight for the Liverpool striker, whereas Gareth Bale has been the player of 2013 so far but was a notch or two behind until the turn of the year. It&apos;s difficult really to get a Rizla paper between the three of them and what a flawed system it is when the voting slips go out on Monday with two months and more than a quarter of the league programme still to go. If we are going to treat this award with such importance then surely it should be decided at the end of the season. Instead the votes are collected from 11 March to 2 April. It&apos;s an award, in other words, for roughly 80% of what happens. At least the Football Writers&apos; Association hold off until 2 May. In Germany, however, the Verband Deutscher Sportjournalisten is decided once the season is over and the winner announced before the following campaign. It&apos;s the same in Portugal. Marca declares the winner of the Trofeo Alfredo Di St\u00e9fano in June. The Oscars du Foot takes place in France a week or two before Ligue 1 closes for the summer but still a month on from what happens in England. Is it really too much to think Gordon Taylor and his chums could find a way to judge their own competition properly? Danes put FA code of conduct on alert That was some statement by the Danish football association, the DBU, to banish Nicklas Bendtner from the national team for six months after he was caught drink-driving. Denmark have two points from their first three World Cup qualifiers and are second-bottom of their group. They will now be without their best striker for at least five matches, but decided they had to take a stand. &quot;The DBU has asked the player to consider carefully whether in time he will again be able to live up to the expectations both the [DBU] and the public are entitled to have of him as a person and an international,&quot; a statement read. &quot;The DBU respects any player&apos;s right to privacy but also has rules and expectations. We invite Nicklas to spend the next six months considering his future.&quot; It&apos;s an admirable stance and tempting to wonder whether the FA will follow a similar route now every England player has a copy of their 16-page &quot;code of conduct&quot;, with its 33 dos and don&apos;ts. The new set of rules have not been really tested yet but that time could be approaching. Raheem Sterling has been charged with assaulting a woman and the trial is fixed for 20 May, just before Stuart Pearce&apos;s squad set off to Israel for the Under-21 European Championship. Sterling denies the offence and, if acquitted, he will be on the plane. It&apos;s the other scenario that could all become a bit messy.", "title": "Sir Alex Ferguson, Wayne Rooney and the search for truth | Daniel Taylor", "sentences": ["Redknapp was almost trembling with rage when he responded to the Daily Mirror allegations last Saturday in which three unnamed players were quoted talking about a club trip to Dubai turning into a glorified stag party."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-09T22:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/11/st-patricks-day-ireland-tourism", "tags": ["St Patrick's Day", "Ireland", "Europe", "World news", "The Duchess of Cambridge", "Monarchy", "UK news", "Life and style"], "article": "In case you didn&apos;t know, 2013 is the year of The Gathering, when Tourism Ireland hopes that throughout the year at least one million Americans and another 6.6 million people from the UK, Europe and elsewhere will arrive at airports and ferry ports to take part in a celebration of all things Irish. And the organisers are keen to let everyone know that you don&apos;t have to be of Irish descent to attend: anyone is welcome to come and join in the mother of all craics. Last year, Irish actor Gabriel Byrne threw a spanner in the works by claiming that The Gathering was less about the emotional authenticity of diaspora, and more about extracting much-needed foreign currency for a country that has been in trouble since the once much-lauded Celtic Tiger was shot and seriously wounded in 2008. &quot;How can we get these people here to boost our tourism, and how can we shake them down for a few quid?&quot; asked Byrne, who now resides in Manhattan. Thankfully, putting a positive spin on negative news and turning it around is part of the national skill set. Tim O&apos;Connor, chair of The Gathering 2013 and a former New York-based Irish consul general, went into damage limitation mode by welcoming Dublin-born Byrne&apos;s intervention, as it was &quot;starting a conversation&quot;. He went on to say that The Gathering could act &quot;as a catalyst for a better understanding of how Ireland can nurture real and meaningful relationships that go beyond tourism&quot;. However, today comes news that a former beauty queen finalist, Charlene Carbery, got the surprise of her life when, on retrieving her luggage at Dublin airport, she looked up and discovered that she was the face of The Gathering. Publicity photographs of her and three other young women involved in the beauty pageant from last year&apos;s Carlingford Oyster Pearl Festival had been used by organisers and plastered around the airport. She later found out that they were also to be found on the backs of buses. &quot;I thought the shots were for the local press and definitely didn&apos;t think they were for a big marketing campaign,&quot; said Carbery. &quot;I didn&apos;t get any invitation to any event, no recognition from Failte Ireland [Tourism Ireland] or The Gathering, and I think it&apos;s really bad form, especially when will want people to come to Ireland and have a positive experience. It has left a really bad taste in my mouth.&quot; The organisers of The Gathering have just issued a statement that they will no longer use the image of Carbery and her fellow contestants. Nevertheless, it&apos;s a sure bet that the controversies will soon be forgotten. Why? Well, in a few days&apos; time on 17 March, St Patrick&apos;s Day will be celebrated not only in Ireland and not only in the diaspora, but also around the world. So not only will there be huge street parties in the usual places such as Dublin, Boston, Chicago and New York, but there will also be festivities in Florence, Sydney and Buenos Aires. A number of international attractions will also be &quot;going green&quot; this year, through either lighting or dye. Among them are Berlin&apos;s TV Tower, Cape Town&apos;s Table Mountain, the Citadel in Jordan, Dubai&apos;s Burj al Arab, the Empire State Building, the Leaning Tower of Pisa, the Pyramids of Giza, the Sydney Opera House and Niagara Falls. There has even been a request to the Queen that Buckingham Palace should be turned green to mark the saint&apos;s day (the answer was no). That&apos;s quite a list \u2013 but there is something more. Tourism Ireland has recently discovered that royal bride and mother-to-be Kate Middleton has Irish ancestry: &quot;We have an authenticated connection, with all the certificates and everything,&quot; said Tourism Ireland&apos;s chief executive Niall Gibbons. He promises to reveal everything in the next few weeks.

The midfielder will miss Arsenal&apos;s Champions League last 16 second-leg tie at Bayern Munich on Wednesday night, his club&apos;s Premier League visit to Swansea City on Saturday and England&apos;s World Cup qualifiers away to San Marino and Montenegro. The midfielder returned in October from a 17-month absence because of a stress fracture to the right foot and Wenger said that the monthly scans on each foot had revealed bone bruising to the left. The manager said that it was the result of him over-compensating to protect the other foot and, although there was inflammation to the right one, it is not understood to be serious. Wilshere&apos;s injury nightmare began when he suffered bone bruising to the right foot only to play on through the pain and make the problem worse. Both player and manager have been scarred by the experience and the very mention of bone bruising has been sufficient to trigger alarm, even if it has been detected in the other foot. &quot;Normally, if he did not have the history, you should say: &apos;Maybe he can go on,&apos;&quot; Wenger said. &quot;But with the history we had last time ... [when] we said: &apos;OK, it&apos;s bone bruising, let him continue to play,&apos; and it transformed into a stress fracture. That&apos;s why [this time] the specialist said we cannot take this gamble.&quot; Wenger was asked whether Wilshere risked a stress fracture to the left foot if he continued to play without a rest. &quot;Nobody knows,&quot; he replied. &quot;It could. The other ankle transformed into [a fracture]. Would that happen on this side, we don&apos;t know.&quot; Wilshere is recuperating in Dubai, he did not travel to Munich with the Arsenal squad on Tuesday and he is not scheduled to return to London until Friday, with Wenger reporting that he would not go straight into training. Arsenal and the Football Association have had discussions about the situation, with the England manager, Roy Hodgson, forewarned and unlikely to include Wilshere in the squad that he announces on Thursday for the qualifiers. Hodgson is due to attend Arsenal&apos;s tie against Bayern, when they will attempt to make Champions League history by overturning a two-goal deficit in the away leg and he is disappointed to be deprived of Wilshere, with the Montenegro game appearing as pivotal to England&apos;s hopes of automatic qualification for the finals in Brazil next summer. But Hodgson has a good relationship with Wenger and there is no sense that he will seek to make an issue out of Wilshere&apos;s unavailability. Wenger is hopeful that the player will be fit to return for Arsenal in the home match against Reading on 30 March, which follows the international break. &quot;England can see him, he can report to them, we have nothing to hide,&quot; Wenger said. &quot;Jack is away now for a few days, he comes back on Friday and then, he still has no impact, no training. I cannot see him being available for England at all.&quot; Wenger has played Wilshere in 26 games since his comeback against Queens Park Rangers on 27 October while Hodgson has used him in two England friendlies. Wenger has always been keen to protect Wilshere but he conceded that he might have been guilty of overplaying him. &quot;Maybe,&quot; he said. &quot;I felt that in our last two games only [against Aston Villa and Tottenham Hotspur], he started to have to push. He&apos;s a winner. Once he&apos;s on the pitch, he keeps going but we are in a position as well where you need always your best players. It&apos;s difficult to say that you rest him when he feels [something] ... You ask him how do you feel? Perfect, he says. It&apos;s difficult. &quot;Maybe this is a good learning process for us ... maybe after 20 games, to give him a breather [of] one or two games and then he comes back. For us, it is not welcome but maybe for Jack, it is not too bad that he has a little breather.

Benteke caused Reading no shortage of problems in the 2-1 victory at the Madejski Stadium last Saturday, when he scored from close range and also hit the crossbar with a thumping header, but this looks like being the sort of battle that Samba will relish. At the other end of the pitch a resurgent QPR side \u2013 well, make that a team that has won their last two matches \u2013 will fancy their chances of scoring against a Villa defence that has failed to keep a clean sheet in 18 games. Whatever the result, expect Paul Lambert to say: &quot;We&apos;ll be fine,&quot; and Harry Redknapp to take his players off to Dubai during the international break. Stuart James 2) Torres intends to bloody West Ham It has become a frustrating sport to spot the potential touchstones for Fernando Torres&apos;s Chelsea career and even when one presented itself against Steaua Bucharest on Thursday, in the form of a lovely finish for the decisive goal on 71 minutes, it was swiftly followed by a missed penalty. Still, as Rafael Ben\u00edtez noted, it was encouraging to see Torres accept the responsibility from the spot and, as the striker also nursed a bloody nose, there was a spark and drive about the way he finished the tie. Will he play against West Ham, with Demba Ba available? If he does, Ben\u00edtez will hope to see him pick up where he left off against Steaua. David Hytner 3) Relax Woe! There are no English clubs in the last eight of the Champions League. Wah! What does it all mean? Answer: nothing. Manchester United and Arsenal were handed tricky draws, and even then, had things gone but slightly differently, both would be in the quarter-finals and the narrative would be different \u2013 yet they&apos;d be identical teams to those that they are. Before the season started, it would have been fair to speculate that all four English qualifiers were superior to Galatasaray, PSG and M\u00e1laga, and lunacy not to recognise that all were inferior to Real Madrid, Barcelona, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund \u2013 and no vagary of cup football was likely to alter that, in the same way that Chelsea winning the competition last season taught nothing beyond the bare facts of what happened. So, this weekend&apos;s games should be enjoyed in that context; the Premier League&apos;s best sides, though less good than the current elite, are still good and also getting better, failing because of specific individual shortcomings not some league-wide malaise. Daniel Harris 4) Was Arsenal&apos;s performance in Munich a one-off? Arsenal&apos;s game with Bayern Munich was a peculiar affair, an anodyne exercise in extreme tedium during which very little happened \u2013 despite what Olivier Giroud felt, it was not &quot;almost the perfect game&quot;, nor did his team &quot;deserve much better&quot;. Bayern were confident enough to play within themselves, Arsenal&apos;s win of equivalent value to Man United&apos;s against Real Madrid in 2003, the Vincent to its Julius. This isn&apos;t to say that Arsenal deserve no praise for their performance \u2013 they were, unusually, well-organised, composed and stout in defence, suggesting that perhaps, and at last, they&apos;ve found the correct combination of personnel. How they handle a Swansea team that picked them apart in December will be a good indication of whether this was a one-off. Daniel Harris 5) Wenger has a goalkeeping dilemma The Arsenal manager suggested he was worried about the pressure on Wojciech Szczesny and that the goalkeeper might benefit from a breather against Bayern Munich. But it is unclear whether Szczesny will feel emboldened by Wenger going public with his doubts about him and, if anything, the spotlight has come to burn even more brightly. Will Wenger recall Szczesny at Swansea City, particularly after Lukasz Fabianski&apos;s convincing performance in Munich? It will be one of those days when the release of the team-sheets is eagerly awaited, particularly as the captain, Thomas Vermaelen, is also champing at the bit to return after being overlooked against Bayern. David Hytner 6) All the best, Eamonn The last time Eamonn Dolan was managing at senior level was back in October 2004, when Barnet were the opponents and 3,589 turned up to watch his final game in charge of Exeter City end in a 3-0 defeat. Things will be a little different in his next match in the dugout, which is at Old Trafford and against a Manchester United team who are top of the table and have taken 52 points from a possible 57 at home this season. Not the sort of assignment too many would welcome in their first game, which means it is no surprise Reading have so far been unable to find a permanent replacement for Brian McDermott, who was sacked on Monday. Dolan, Reading&apos;s highly respected academy manager, is close to McDermott and has been in regular touch with him this week. On that basis it seems unlikely there will be too many changes to the Reading starting lineup. In fact, it is difficult to know what Reading have gained by dispensing with the services of McDermott this week, other than giving Dolan a chance to shake hands with Sir Alex Ferguson at the start of what could be a long evening. All the best, Eamonn. Stuart James 7) Cleverley should watch and learn from Carrick Manchester United&apos;s past two games have been characterised by the return of the disappearing midfield, with Tom Cleverley the particular culprit \u2013 something that should be giving Ferguson cause for concern. Cleverley has talent, and his ability to keep the ball moving, forwards and quickly, is a significant asset when his team are playing well. But when they are not he becomes almost useless, his poor anticipation at odds with such a sharp football brain and worrying in someone soon to turn 24. Sitting at the side, with express instructions to study the positioning of Michael Carrick and Ryan Giggs, would be the best use of his time this weekend. Daniel Harris 8) Pressure on the managers Everton v Manchester City could well be the most significant game of the weekend. If City fail to win and Manchester United beat Reading, the championship will surely be beyond salvage \u2013 and the same probably so of Robert Mancini&apos;s job. Similarly, should Everton fail to win and Liverpool beat Southampton, the prospect of European football at Goodison next season will seem remote \u2013 an eventuality that may cause the club to relieve David Moyes of the position he has been threatening to abandon. Although under Mancini City have won the Cup followed by the league, and although under Moyes Everton have bought and played well, the teams of both can be charged with similar competitive deficiencies that would render their sackings understandable. This season and last City have been largely unable to produce their best football at clutch moments, carelessly ceding points with apparent apathy until such time as the pressure alleviated \u2013 while throughout Moyes&apos;s tenure, Everton have contrived to lose derby matches, difficult away games and important cup ties. The problem for both men is that professional sport is unlike most other industries; success is measured not in achievement, but in expectation. Daniel Harris 9) Tottenham must rouse mind and body against Fulham Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas has repeatedly said that the Europa League ought not to be a drain on stamina for the Premier League but the theory faces its acid test at home to Fulham on Sunday. The Tottenham Hotspur manager knows that Thursday to Sunday is the tighter turnaround, as opposed to Sunday to Thursday, and his players must also recover from the physically and mentally sapping trip to Milan, where they needed extra time to squeak past Internazionale in the last-16 second leg. Some of Villas-Boas&apos;s players looked out on their feet towards the end. David Hytner 10) &quot;We always beat West Brom&quot; When it comes to looking through the fixture list, Stoke City supporters can always take comfort from the sight of West Bromwich Albion being up next. &quot;We always beat West Brom&quot; has become a familiar chant in recent years and could be heard at The Hawthorns in December, when Stoke, rather predictably, won 1-0. It was their ninth victory over Albion in the past 12 meetings. Stoke&apos;s direct approach seems to ruffle Albion feathers, although things have not been going to plan for Tony Pulis and his players of late, which suggests this could be a good time to visit the Britannia. Stoke have won only one out of their past 10 league games and there are signs that the fans are starting to lose faith with the manager&apos;s methods. The lack of entertainment \u2013 181 goals from 181 Premier League games under Pulis is not exactly edge-of-your-seat stuff \u2013 is overlooked when the team is winning, it seems, but not so easy to tolerate when results go pear-shaped. A defeat on Saturday and the discontent will get a little louder.

These events gave rising school and university players chances to cross pawns with the top grandmasters and international masters,\u00a0who themselves had the incentive of generous prize funds and subsidies. Now the Arc Young Masters, the Oakham invitations, and the Evening Standard/National Bank of Dubai Open are all distant memories. Funds have diminished, while few juniors look potential GMs. Currently the best equivalents of the eighties weekenders are staged in Ireland, where the traditional Bunratty and Kilkenny Opens usually have the English elite as top seeds vying for supremacy with the best Irish masters. Bunratty 2013 last month invited England&apos;s world finalists Michael Adams and Nigel Short, who duly finished at the top yet had to share the limelight with two other notable performances. IM Richard Bates drew with Adams in the final round and shared second prize with Short on 5/6, while the Bolton schoolboy Joseph McPhillips, still an under-16, produced a lifetime best result\u00a0by sharing fourth place on 4.5/6, beating GM Peter Wells, drawing with Short and performing far above his official rating. McPhillips was not included in the England squads at last year&apos;s world and European junior championships, for which he would be a high place contender on his Bunratty form.

Today, I wonder if the Ba&apos;athist culture of despotism, repression and violence can ever be expelled. I thought that the people of Iraq could leave the atrocities behind, that we would learn from our mistakes, and that no authority would again treat anyone like a second-class citizen. I wanted my children never to fear the experiences that their parents and grandparents and others went through. As a Kurd, I dreamed that no one would be oppressed merely for their ethnicity, and that none would again face chemical bombardment, genocide and exodus, or be denied their culture, language and history. I dreamed that the Kurds would no longer stay in the dark and unjust chapters of history. As a woman, I dreamed of justice and equality, though I knew that the Kurdish women of this generation would pay a heavy price for equality. I dreamed that Kurdish women, who have borne stigmas of inferiority twice over, and the consequences of war, too, would finally be recognized as equal. Everything I dreamed of seemed simple and normal \u2013 not much to ask for \u2013 but ten years later, all of it still seems far from coming true. The system in Iraq has gone from autocratic order to unpredictable disorder; a lack of trust and the pursuit of power have created a state without rules, just dangerous games. The new Iraqi constitution recognized Kurdistan as an autonomous region, with a degree of control over its own resources, but without a framework for co-ordination \u2013 leaving co-operation between the federal centre (Baghdad) and the federal region (Kurdistan) almost unrecognizable as such. Each side defines federalism according to its interests; each abides by a few articles of the constitution and disregards the rest as it sees fit. The Kurds tried to share power and rebuild with other groups, but misinterpretations of the constitution, misunderstandings, and bad intentions created serious disputes between the two sides of the federal arrangement. At first, Kurds attributed these troubles to the methods of the first prime minister, Ibrahim al-Jaafari; they started forming new alliances to force him to step down.  As time went on, however, it became clear that the problems stemmed not from individuals, but from the mentality of Iraqi-Arab elites, and how they saw the national demands of Kurds. Those with power have been unable to understand the heart of the Kurdish issue, or even the notion of sharing power at all. Corruption and a lack of transparency have become the norm in Iraq. The Corruption Index for 2010 places Iraq fifth place among most corrupt countries in the world. Sadly, Kurdistan is not exempt from this negative picture of the whole Middle East. Despite this, the federal region of Kurdistan has progressed in many ways over the last few years. Hopes of an oil boom have triggered construction in Erbil, the region&apos;s capital and a city that local officials regard as the next Dubai. Kurdistan&apos;s civil services have also progressed: in fact, this has become a safe haven for ethnic and religious minorities fleeing violence elsewhere in Iraq. Without constitutional protection for the federal region from Baghdad or the international community, though, these advances face real danger. Even foreign bodies interfere: neighboring countries such as Turkey and Iran cross the border illegally on an almost daily basis. Baghdad and the rest of the world watch without a word of condemnation, let alone intervention.  This is bad enough, but the condition of women has become a disaster in the postwar era. Violence towards women throughout Iraq covers a wide range of practices, including honor killings, family pressure to commit suicide, forced marriages and domestic violence. Strict gender roles make women (and above all, their bodies and sexuality) a repository of the &quot;honor&quot; of the family, community, nation and so on. This is used to prevent them from being able to make decisions for themselves and others. Deviations from gender roles are often punished by the victims&apos; own inner circles. There are no accurate statistics for violence against women in Iraq, making it difficult to deal with the problem. In spite of limited data, all agree that the violence is widespread. Some analysts claim, with reference to Unifem, that there are at least 400 honor killings a year; but most honor killings, suicides and other acts against women go unreported. In fact, after natural causes, honor killings are thought to be one of the leading causes of death for women in Kurdistan. These figures stand in sharp contrast to the relatively few fatalities by terrorism in Kurdistan, though the government dedicates considerable resources to preventing it. The government has failed, meanwhile, to institute civil protections for women or prosecute these sorts of crimes. All of this must be seen within the broader picture of women&apos;s exclusion from politics, in spite of the 30% quota introduced by Kurdish government. As Islamic authorities climb to power across the post-Arab spring&apos;s Middle East, there is a real fear that even the limited civil protections women hold will be swept away under the influence of strict religious laws, exacerbated by the culture of violence and the conservative religious and tribal structures that have grown stronger in the past decade. In Kurdistan, religious parties still don&apos;t have the majority support; instead, issues of national independence have long been at the heart of Kurdish issues. But the urgency of the national question has faded together with dissatisfaction with the ruling parties, and sympathy for religious groups is mounting. In this context, the future for women looks very dark indeed. If everyone in Iraq desired a common destiny based on respect for human rights and transparent justice, in place of a pattern of revenge, the nation would have immediately risen to the challenges of reconciling factions and building bridges: Baghdad and Kurdistan with each other, and Iraq and with its neighbors. Iraqis should have felt such weariness with their long legacy of suffering that we should have given up the path of conflict and violence.

Throughout his career he has been a gambler&apos;s dream, winning just over eight out of every 10 matches he plays, a phenomenal return in such a strong era. He is ahead of Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray among active players by a slim statistical margin yet, when he won his 17th match of 18 played this year to beat Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro in the final of the BNP Paribas Open at Indian Wells on Sunday, even the Spaniard&apos;s most ardent fans were stunned. Should they be so shocked? In the all-time list Nadal on .830 has a higher win/loss ration than Bj\u00f6rn Borg (.827), Jimmy Connors and Ivan Lendl (.818), then Federer and John McEnroe (.815). What his admirers wondered was: would his left knee collapse on him on this surface? This is his best-ever start to a season, yet many wondered as recently as last month whether he would make it back at all. The player denies he ever contemplated quitting, even after the first of two comeback tournaments in South America when the chronic pain in his knees refused to ebb. The suffering eased as his muscles and self-belief were re-engaged in the heat of competition. The nostrils flared again and the performance that convinced him he still had it was his blitzing David Ferrer 6-0, 6-2 in under an hour in Acapulco. &quot;Forget about if I was seven months away from tennis,&quot; he said at the time. &quot;I played much, much better than a lot of finals when I am competing at 100%. I played one of my best matches probably ever on clay in the final.&quot; Yet even he could not believe he would do what he did in Indian Wells. He was not supposed to win this tournament, the first of the nine ATP 1000 Masters, nor did he expect to. He had not won a hard-court event since October 2010; and this was Federer&apos;s domain, as well as Djokovic&apos;s, thousands of miles away from Nadal&apos;s European clay. Yet his growling surge after dropping the first set against Del Potro bore all the hallmarks of Nadal at his most imperious: the wicked top-spin, ratcheted through iron wrists on his forehand, the ability to hit deep, shot after shot, then fiercely on the angle, draining the tall Argentinian&apos;s legs to the point of impotence. At the end Del Potro, who has been in excellent form and put out Djokovic in the semi-finals, was a resigned wreck. Nadal is phenomenal \u2013 but not foolhardy \u2013 and will skip the Miami Masters this week, along with Federer, who will retreat to Switzerland for two months to rest his spirit and his back, which flared into pain over the past week, most noticeably when he succumbed quietly to Nadal in the quarter-finals. Nadal will turn 27 when he defends his French Open title at Roland Garros in May; Federer will be 32 when he heads for New York and the US Open in September. They have 28 grand slam titles between them, 129 titles in all, and are not old but, equally, not as young as the contenders chasing them through the rankings. So these are uncertain times. Nadal is 1,605 ranking points behind Murray, although the Scot can slip past Federer to No2 if he wins in Miami, which would give him a crucial edge at the start of the majors. As it stands, Murray might prefer to face Federer than Nadal in a semi-final \u2014 although players always deny they think about such equations. Can Nadal and Federer rule again, as they did together until Djokovic&apos;s dramatic arrival in their midst in 2011, then Murray&apos;s breakthrough at the Olympics and the US Open last year? Almost certainly not as a double act. And, if you had to back one of them to frighten their rivals this year, on the events of the past few weeks it would be difficult to pick Federer over Nadal. Federer has not been quite himself since Murray beat him in five sets in the semi-finals of the Australian Open. He went out in the quarters at Rotterdam to Julien Benneteau, lost to Tomas Berdych in the semis in Dubai and, after getting past Stanislas Wawrinka in Indian Wells, collapsed against Nadal. He no doubt will return refreshed and says he still has the hunger, although getting back to No1 in the world is no longer the obsession it used to be. Djokovic (4,565 points in front of Federer) will probably start favourite at each major bar the French, where Nadal beat him last year in the rain-interrupted final. Nadal&apos;s knees will always be problematic and the single most obvious cause for concern. But he could not have done much more to convince the doubters over the past four weeks. &quot;I can live without tennis,&quot; Nadal said after beating Ferrer in Acapulco. &quot;But when you cannot do what you want to do it is not easy. I am a competitor and I know this world is not forever, the tennis career.&quot; Within a fortnight he gave himself reasons to believe again.", "title": "Rafael Nadal quells fitness doubts to emerge as a genuine force again | Kevin Mitchell", "sentences": ["He went out in the quarters at Rotterdam to Julien Benneteau, lost to Tomas Berdych in the semis in Dubai and, after getting past Stanislas Wawrinka in Indian Wells, collapsed against Nadal."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-18T17:50:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/18/jt-mcnamara-remains-stable", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "The jockey JT McNamara, who suffered serious injuries to his neck in a fall at the Cheltenham Festival last week, remains in a stable condition in an induced coma at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, a statement issued on behalf of his family said on Monday. McNamara was put into an induced coma before being taken to the hospital from the racecourse on Thursday evening, after he suffered a fall from Galaxy Rock at the first fence in the Fulke Walwyn Kim Muir Handicap Chase. Surgeons operated on the jockey on Friday after he was found to have suffered fractures to his C3 and C4 vertebrae. Monday&apos;s statement, issued by Dr Adrian McGoldrick, the Irish Turf Club&apos;s senior medical officer, and Lisa Hancock, the chief executive officers of the Injured Jockeys Fund, on behalf of the McNamara family said: &quot;Further scans are planned and another statement will be issued as soon as there is more news. Whilst visits to JT at the moment are not appropriate, JT&apos;s family are extremely grateful for all the kind messages and support.&quot; Marco Botti, who will saddle Planteur in the Dubai World Cup at Meydan racecourse on Saturday week, said on Monday that his six-year-old could make the running if, as has been the case in the three previous renewals of the World Cup at Meydan, there is no early pace. Planteur was third in the Dubai World Cup last year, when he was hampered at the start and then caught against the rail for much of the race. This year&apos;s renewal, which is due to feature the top American performers Royal Delta and Animal Kingdom, looks a stronger contest, but Planteur looked exceptionally well at Botti&apos;s yard on Monday and the trainer is hopeful of a big run in the world&apos;s richest race. Planteur justified odds of 2-5 in his warm-up race for the $10m World Cup, the Winter Derby Trial at Lingfield in February, though he won by only a neck from a 20-1 chance. &quot;I was very pleased with him at Lingfield,&quot; Botti said on Monday. &quot;It was his first run since August, and he had never made the running in the past. The margin wasn&apos;t impressive, but he still had a lot left and he&apos;s never won by far. &quot;We made the running to give us an option. In the World Cup there&apos;s no pacemaker, so sometimes it can be a slow-run race, like when they crawled all the way [in 2011] and Mirco Demuro stole the race [on Victoire Pisa]. If we&apos;re not happy with the pace, he could make it. He&apos;s an old horse, and sometimes a change of tactics can be a good thing for their confidence.&quot; Botti is already planning Planteur&apos;s campaign for the remainder of the season, which could conclude with an attempt to win the Breeders&apos; Cup Classic on dirt at Santa Anita in California in November. &quot;I&apos;m glad that we gave him a prep here instead of going to Super Saturday in Dubai,&quot; Botti said. &quot;That only gives you three weeks to the World Cup and he&apos;s a horse that needs a bit longer than that between his races. &quot;We will manage him carefully this year. He&apos;s quite ground dependent as he does not like it too fast, and five or six races would be ideal. I think he would handle the dirt in the Classic as his dam was by [the dirt-bred] Giant&apos;s Causeway, and he would prefer that to fast ground on turf.&quot; Planteur is due to leave for Dubai on Saturday, when the first significant race of the new Flat season, the William Hill Lincoln Handicap, will be staged at Doncaster. Botti hopes to run Solar Deity, the winner of four of his five starts on the all-weather over the winter, in the big race, though only if the ground, which is currently soft, improves slightly before the weekend. The potential Classic horse in the yard is Moohaajim, the runner-up to Reckless Abandon in the Group One Middle Park Stakes last October. &quot;The plan is to run in the Greenham Stakes [at Newbury in April] and if all goes well, in the Guineas,&quot; Botti said. &quot;He&apos;s in the English and French Guineas, but priority would be for the English.&quot; &quot;He&apos;s a fast-ground horse, and in the Middle Park it was a bit loose on top and his jockey [Adam Kirby] said he didn&apos;t feel comfortable on it. He&apos;s really strengthened and grown over the winter.

In another David Miliband explained how the club planned to crack the untapped African commercial market and, just down the corridor, Craig Gardner talked of the team&apos;s new-found sense of optimism under Martin O&apos;Neill&apos;s management. It was a cool, cloudy, late-June morning by the river Wear. Sunderland had just announced a new partnership with Invest in Africa and the Texan financier, the former foreign secretary and the versatile midfielder could not have been more excited about the season ahead. Nine months on Short and Miliband, Sunderland&apos;s chairman and vice chairman respectively, have become well practised at wearing inscrutable expressions in the Stadium of Light&apos;s directors&apos; box. Miliband probably feels more comfortable talking about his brother Ed than the performances of the four players \u2013 Adam Johnson, Steven Fletcher, Danny Graham and Alfred N&apos;Diaye \u2013 Short has bought for more than \u00a330m during the last two transfer windows. Without a win in their last seven games, Sunderland are perched four points above the relegation zone with their next five fixtures pitting them against Manchester United, Chelsea, Newcastle United, Everton and Aston Villa. On Sunday they drew 1-1 at home against a Norwich City side reduced to 10 men for much of the game and, after equalising through a controversial penalty, they were booed off. It will not have been lost on Short that Norwich spent only \u00a39m during the last two transfer windows and have a significantly smaller wage bill but are three points better off. Tall, charming and commendably measured, Sunderland&apos;s owner remains creditably protective of the manager he appointed in December 2011. O&apos;Neill, for his part, is impressed by Short&apos;s loyalty and understated sense of humour but appreciates that, after a season punctuated by persistent under-achievement, the owner is entitled to ask some tough questions \u2013 particularly as Short recently bankrolled an expensive break in Dubai for Sunderland&apos;s squad and management. He may legitimately wonder why Danny Rose, the left-back O&apos;Neill recruited from Tottenham on a season-long loan, looks poised to be Sunderland&apos;s player of the season rather than the \u00a310m Johnson or the \u00a312m Fletcher. Short surely queries whether the absence of John Robertson from O&apos;Neill&apos;s backroom has been a bigger miss than originally envisaged when the coach who had worked with the Northern Irishman at Leicester, Celtic and Aston Villa opted not to relocate to Wearside. &quot;It&apos;s hard to accept we&apos;re in this situation,&quot; said David Vaughan, the Sunderland midfielder. &quot;When you look at the squad we have, we should not be in the position we&apos;re in. But we are and that is down to us players, coaching staff and everyone at the club. It is our fault, nobody else&apos;s and it&apos;s up to us to get ourselves out of this.&quot; If O&apos;Neill cannot be blamed for the lack of young players emerging through the Wearside ranks or inheriting a squad notably short on pace and creativity, Sunderland fans are concerned about his reluctance to rotate players (&quot;We don&apos;t rotate like Manchester United but we need to give players a bit of a rest occasionally,&quot; O&apos;Neill says), switch formations from his default 4-4-1-1 or drop under-achievers such as their former England winger, Johnson, who has started every league game when fit. There is a sense that the team lacks a coherent vision or philosophy. While the long-term knee injuries suffered by Wes Brown and Lee Cattermole have hardly helped matters, such setbacks afflict most teams. Then there is the question of whether O&apos;Neill is sufficiently receptive to experimentation. For instance, maybe James McClean, the Republic of Ireland left-winger who has regressed alarmingly during a season beset by off-field troubles, could benefit from working with a sports psychologist. Vaughan believes the players need to look at themselves. &quot;We badly let ourselves down with our passing in the final third against Norwich,&quot; he said. &quot;We rushed it and the quality just wasn&apos;t there. That&apos;s our own fault and something we need to work on. &quot;There is pressure on us. You do feel it before games. It&apos;s difficult to keep confidence high. We put in massive effort but run out of ideas. We need a bit more imagination, that&apos;s something we&apos;ve been missing.&quot; O&apos;Neill maintains that he is in charge of &quot;a top-six club&quot; currently disguised by deceptively dowdy clothes but acknowledges there is &quot;a lack of real, true ability&quot; in a squad which looks ill-suited to its magnificently appointed, 49,000-capacity home.

He was arrested in Dubai last August while in transit to South Africa after attending his son&apos;s wedding in Canada. There were fears for the frail 77-year-old&apos;s health in jail in Abu Dhabi until he was granted bail at the fifth attempt. But after 13 postponements of the case stretching over eight months, a medical review committee consisting of nine doctors met on Monday night to review the patient&apos;s file. Karabus&apos;s daughter Sarah, a paediatrician in Cape Town, told the Times of South Africa, &quot;\u2026 their conclusion was that there was no negligence, that my father&apos;s treatment was correct and they recommended that he be absolved. &quot;It is wonderful. We are absolutely ecstatic. Until he is on a plane it is not a done deal yet.&quot; A court is due consider the review committee&apos;s recommendation on Thursday. Sarah added: &quot;The judge will look at the report. He doesn&apos;t necessarily have to agree with the medical committee. We hope that he will.&quot; Karabus&apos;s arrest followed an operation he performed on a three-year-old leukaemia patient while he was a locum at Sheikh Khalifa medical centre in Abu Dhabi. The child died and Karabus was tried in absentia and found guilty of manslaughter and falsifying medical documents. He was unaware of this until his arrest. Interviewed by the radio station 567 Cape Talk on Wednesday, a relieved Karabus said he had been warned in Toronto that there were problems with his visa relating to the criminal charges against him in the UAE. &quot;When we queried it they said everything was fine and I should just carry on and next the next thing I knew I was being arrested in Dubai,&quot; he recalled. Missing medical files delayed his trial for months, the Times reported, adding that Karabus&apos;s legal team believe the files would exonerate him. The South African government, which has been pressing the UAE authorities to free Karabus, welcomed the &quot;strategic breakthrough&quot;.

The Bahrain-based finance firm stated in its 2012 accounts that it bought Leeds, as recently as 21 December, as an &quot;asset held for sale&quot;, which it planned to realise within six to 12 months. The accounts stated that the club had &quot;commenced negotiations relating to the sale of its stake&quot;. Following media reports of that detail, GFH issued a statement on the Leeds United website emphasising its previously publicly stated position that, having bought the club from the previous owner Ken Bates for \u00a322m, it is looking for &quot;strategic investors&quot; to buy a stake in the club, but is not selling it completely. &quot;To clarify and as previously stated, GFH Capital is looking for investment in part of its share in the club, not its entirety,&quot; the statement said. Pointedly, the statement referred throughout to GFH Capital, which is based in Dubai, the subsidiary of GFH that carried out the takeover from Bates, not to GFH itself, the parent company. However the statement did not explain why the stated strategy of GFH Capital, to invest in Leeds and look to rebuild the club&apos;s fortunes while selling a stake to strategic partners, was contradicted by the parent company&apos;s accounts. &quot;GFH Capital \u2026 is continuing to look for strategic investors in part of the club that can invest in Leeds United, alongside GFH Capital, to ensure a long-term, sustainable future,&quot; the statement said. Salem Patel, the chief investment officer of GFH, the parent company, who was centrally involved in the takeover from Bates, told the Guardian last month that even in purely profit-motivated terms, the finance house would do better to rebuild Leeds and win promotion to the Premier League than sell the club immediately. Explaining it was interested in selling a 30% stake to a &quot;strategic investor&quot;, Patel said that if it sold a majority stake to a buyer without the funds capable of making Leeds successful, &quot;we become a minority shareholder in an investment not going anywhere&quot;. He added: &quot;We do not wish to make a short-term profit to miss out on the \u00a3150m-\u00a3200m which could be made if the club wins promotion to the Premier League.&quot; GFHC has put money into the club, which it said was partly to cope with cashflow problems inherited from Bates, under whose ownership the club mortgaged future season ticket income to finance work on the Elland Road east stand. The statement on the club website said the cash injected into the club by GFH now amounts to \u00a310m, &quot;to strengthen the squad and for other working capital purposes&quot;. GFHC also promised: &quot;Additional financial support will continue to be provided as required.&quot; The statement highlighted a price cut for 2013-14 season tickets in a bid to re-engage fans, many of whom complained of high costs under Bates. &quot;GFH Capital has fulfilled the plans pledged,&quot; it said. &quot;Its strategy for the club remains the same; to build a group of strategic investors to put Leeds United in the best position both on and off pitch for the long term.&quot;", "title": "Leeds United owner contradicts itself over plans to sell club", "sentences": ["Pointedly, the statement referred throughout to GFH Capital, which is based in Dubai, the subsidiary of GFH that carried out the takeover from Bates, not to GFH itself, the parent company."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-20T22:29:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/21/carlin-isles-usa-hong-kong-sevens", "tags": ["Rugby union", "USA rugby union team", "US sports", "Sport"], "article": "The Hong Kong Sevens, which takes place this weekend, has a long history of introducing new stars to the rugby world \u2013 Jonah Lomu shone there, as did Christian Cullen; the great Waisale Serevi made the event his own. This year, thanks in large part to a YouTube video that has gone viral, Carlin Isles is the man most people will be watching. The &quot;fastest man in world rugby&quot; is not, however, your average oval-ball phenomenon. For one thing, he&apos;s American and for another, until the summer of 2012, he hadn&apos;t picked up a rugby ball in his life. Asked how he finds his new-found fame, the preternaturally relaxed 23-year-old from Massillon, Ohio, who set records as a college running back and tried out for the 100m at the London Olympics, simply laughs. &quot;It feels good, it feels great,&quot; Isles, says. &quot;I like it. Who wouldn&apos;t? But you know, you have to stay humble with it and keep working hard. I have to be determined to learn my sport.&quot; Wherein lies the key to Isles&apos; story \u2013 though he says that &quot;sometimes, I feel like I was made for rugby&quot;, like many of his countrymen, he is rather new to the game. In the summer of 2012, knowing that as the 36th-fastest man in the US he would not reach London or Rio as a sprinter, Isles watched some sevens online. All he knew was that the sport had a tempting, newly-acquired Olympic status and that &quot;it was a little bit scary&quot;. He adds: &quot;I saw some people with teeth out, bandaged up \u2026 I knew it was a tenacious sport, that you had to be strong physically and mentally to play it.&quot; Showing admirable tenacity, Isles contacted the chief executive of USA Rugby and asked if he could have a game. Nigel Melville, being a former England captain, an elite coach and no fool, looked at Isles&apos;s 100m PB (10.13sec, enough for an Olympic semi-final) and his football CV (good enough to attract NFL scouting) and thought that would be a good idea. After a spot of preparation with the Gentlemen of Aspen rugby club and the Atlantis invitational team, Isles made his US Eagles debut against New Zealand at October&apos;s Gold Coast Sevens. After less than a minute on the pitch, the new boy tackled back, forced a turnover, took a pass and exploited the tiniest of spaces on the wide outside. In a flash, Isles had scored his first international try. He tried to give the referee the ball for the conversion, but such small misunderstandings were quickly ironed out. More fireworks followed in Dubai, Port Elizabeth, Wellington and Las Vegas, and a YouTube video of his tries, entitled &quot;Carlin Isles&apos; Olympic Dream&quot;, headed for 3m hits. &apos;I have to explain the game to my friends and family&apos;            Reading on mobile? See the Carlin Isles video here &quot;It&apos;s a little strange,&quot; Isles says, with another laugh, &quot;to be, or to become, famous in America for playing rugby. I have to explain the game to my friends and family sometimes, when I don&apos;t know it that well myself. We watch it and I try to explain about different teams and all that. A lot of people I know watched the tournament in Vegas who didn&apos;t ever watch rugby before, so perhaps they will now have a little more of a concept about the game. I don&apos;t know if that would come from me explaining it \u2013 I haven&apos;t got the visionary thing about it, but if they see it, they&apos;ll know.&quot; Isles, a stunning athlete who did not make it to the top in the NFL or on the track, might well be the harbinger of an exciting future for American rugby. If Melville and his coaches can find 30 or so more like him \u2013 tight ends or linebackers for back-five forwards \u2013 Haydn Smith, a second row, has recently gone the other way to join the New York Jets, wide receivers or running backs for centres and wings, a new rugby power might be born. Isles also proves the importance of sevens&apos; Olympic inclusion as a magnet for talent worldwide; furthermore, the growing competitiveness of the HSBC Sevens World Series, of which Hong Kong is a part and in which teams such as Kenya, Spain and indeed the USA now challenge strongly, is in part due to the sport&apos;s endorsement by the IOC. &quot;We just keep getting better,&quot; says Isles, when asked about the Eagles&apos; displays this season, which have included a draw with England and near misses against New Zealand and Fiji. &quot;We&apos;re getting closer to the bigger teams and beating the teams we should be beating. I think we&apos;re close to a breakthrough. We need one or two more balls to bounce our way and we need to take a few chances better and we&apos;ll be getting there.&quot; Isles sees his own progress as comparable to that of his team. &quot;I think I&apos;m coming on as a player real good,&quot; he says.  &quot;I&apos;m learning all the time. Now, in a way, I&apos;m going back to the drawing board and looking at a lot of things I&apos;ve learned in order to become better. It&apos;s a unique way to learn, I guess, by playing against Fiji and New Zealand and the best in the world.&quot;  Thirty-two American sevens players (16 men and 16 women) now work full-time at the US Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, near San Diego; Isles has thus been able to spend his time since the USA Sevens in February preparing for Hong Kong and the Tokyo tournament that follows. He&apos;ll do the same, all being well, before Glasgow and London in May and the World Cup Sevens in Moscow in June. The occasional longueurs of such a life aside \u2013 &quot;I don&apos;t enjoy those long sessions in the classroom,&quot; he says of video analysis meetings, given that he &quot;prefers to be out on the field&quot;, and he admits to missing family and friends \u2013 his game and his team can only benefit. That&apos;s just as well, as the Eagles have a tough draw at what will be the biggest Hong Kong Sevens ever \u2013 sharing Pool B with Kenya, France and New Zealand. &quot;I know that it&apos;s a big tournament and that a lot of people like Hong Kong, going there to watch as much as to play,&quot; Isles says, the easygoing generality of his answer betraying an understandably patchy knowledge of rugby and its culture. &quot;I&apos;m looking forward to experiencing it.&quot; It&apos;s safe to say, however, that he won&apos;t be sampling too much of the former colony&apos;s famously social side. &quot;I enjoy relaxing with the guys and chatting about the game and so on,&quot; he says, discussing his grateful acceptance into &quot;the rugby family&quot;, &quot;but I don&apos;t drink, so I can&apos;t have a few beers if they do. I&apos;ll have a glass of water.&quot; Expect, then, an enthralling new chapter in Isles&apos;s story \u2013 and, quite probably, many more. The man himself is as much amused as bemused by the stories linking him to teams in Europe that appeared when he burst on to the scene; he has, after all, never played a game of 15-a-side. But, he says, &quot;15s is on my radar and it&apos;s definitely something I&apos;m going to pursue. I&apos;ve never played a game yet, but I&apos;ve been watching it online, you know.&quot; The world knows, as the Hong Kong Sevens will most likely show, what happened the last time Carlin Isles watched some rugby online.", "title": "Carlin Isles sets out to be new star in Hong Kong rugby sevens heaven", "sentences": ["More fireworks followed in Dubai, Port Elizabeth, Wellington and Las Vegas, and a YouTube video of his tries, entitled &quot;Carlin Isles&apos; Olympic Dream&quot;, headed for 3m hits."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-21T12:45:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/21/chris-wright-rikki-clarke-ashes-england", "tags": ["Warwickshire", "Cricket", "Sport", "England cricket team"], "article": "Chris Wright and Rikki Clarke have an early chance to stake their claims for England places in the forthcoming Ashes summer in the unlikely surroundings of Abu Dhabi over the next few days, and Dougie Brown, who has taken over as Warwickshire&apos;s director of cricket following the promotion of Ashley Giles to the national set-up, believes they are both ready to hit the ground running. The county champions arrived in Dubai in the early hours of Thursday morning, ahead of the four-day fixture against MCC that will be staged at the Sheikh Zayed International Stadium from Sunday for the fourth consecutive spring, and again played with pink balls. Warwickshire have taken a 12-man squad and have been joined by Will Porterfield, the opener who has been playing in the Middle East in Ireland&apos;s bid to qualify for the next World Cup in 2015. But it is the performances of Wright and especially Clarke that will most interest Giles in his new role as England&apos;s one-day coach, as well as a member of the selection panel. Wright, a tall 27-year-old seamer from the Cotswolds, has bloomed since joining Warwickshire from Essex in late 2011, initially on loan, and was their leading wicket-taker in the championship last season with 62. He was promoted to the England Performance Programme and toured twice with the Lions during the winter, to India before Christmas and Australia earlier this year. &quot;He&apos;s certainly had a busy time,&quot; said Brown, the 43-year-old Scotsman who played in nine one-day internationals for England in 1997-98, and has been a part of the furniture at Edgbaston for the best part of two decades. &quot;He&apos;s been to India and Australia with the Lions, he came out to Barbados for our pre-season tour, and after a day back in the UK, we&apos;ve all travelled out here. But having said that, I&apos;m not sure how much cricket he&apos;s played because most of the Lions stuff has been one-dayers. &quot;Our main focus in Barbados was four-day cricket because after this MCC game it&apos;s straight into the championship. I think he&apos;s enjoying being back in four-day mode, and he knows that he&apos;s still got a couple of work-ons to realise his full potential. He&apos;s got to keep moving forward if he&apos;s going to bowl himself into contention properly, and he&apos;s a got a great chance to do that starting on Sunday.&quot; Clarke is 31, and made the last of 22 England appearances in September 2006, when he was still with Surrey. But he has also been reinvented and rejuvenated at Edgbaston, to such an extent that he was the surprise selection on the Lions tour of Australia \u2013 with Giles confirming that England saw him as a potential candidate for the Champions Trophy this summer. He was one of the few players to emerge from that unhappy trip, in which England failed to win a game, with credit. &quot;Rikki&apos;s just flipped his lifestyle on its head,&quot; added Brown. &quot;Out in Barbados, he was one of the first into the gym every morning, which is not the Rikki Clarke that people have known in the past. He&apos;s been absolutely outstanding and although he didn&apos;t get much opportunity with the bat with the Lions out in Australia, we can see that his white-ball bowling has really come on.&quot; MCC will be captained by Dale Benkenstein, who has given such outstanding service to Durham, and include a few other England hopefuls, such as Lancashire&apos;s highly rated left-arm spinner Simon Kerrigan. &quot;We&apos;re all really excited to be out here,&quot; said Brown, who is also relishing the opportunity to put his own stamp on the team after several years working with Giles. &quot;Fundamentally, our beliefs are very similar because of all the time we&apos;ve spent together,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s important I don&apos;t try to change too much, but I&apos;ve still got to be my own person. Ash is still a selector, so I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll be popping down to Edgbaston in that role from time to time, and he&apos;ll always be welcome in his old office \u2013 so long as he puts the kettle on.&quot; Warwickshire&apos;s title defence will be boosted by the availability of Ian Bell and Jonathan Trott for the games against Sussex and Middlesex in early May, allowing them to have some match practice before England&apos;s two home Tests against New Zealand after taking a month or so off when they return home from Auckland next week.

The pavilion, titled Welcome to Iraq, will for the first time showcase contemporary artists who live and work in the country. Iraq&apos;s first Venice pavilion, in 2011, showed work by members of the Iraqi diaspora, most of whom left in the 1970s before the outbreak of war with Iran. This year&apos;s pavilion is curated by Jonathan Watkins, director of the Ikon Gallery in Birmingham, who was commissioned by the Ruya Foundation for Contemporary Culture in Iraq. Watkins travelled around the country in an armoured car with soldiers visiting more than 100 artists in and around Baghdad, Basra, Babylon and Kurdistan, from whom he selected 11 for the Venice show. &quot;The artists in Iraq are isolated from the art world,&quot; he said at Art Dubai, the largest art fair in the Middle East. &quot;Most of them didn&apos;t know where Venice was. There&apos;s not much of a local audience because people are just concerned with surviving. A lot of them said it was the first time anyone had ever asked to see their work.&quot; The cartoonist Abdul Raheem Yassir uses deadpan humour to address the social and political chaos and corruption in the country. Among his cartoons to be shown in Venice is one of a man glued to a TV news report showing the gun turret of a tank bulldozing into a building while the same gun is breaking through the wall behind him. Another shows an artist painting a bomb that is falling from the sky and about to strike him.     A cartoon by Abdul Raheem Yassir, part of the Iraqi pavilion at the Venice Biennale. Photograph: Ruya Foundation    Watkins said: &quot;It&apos;s a real threat. This is the situation for artists in Baghdad. We met an artist who was worried about being photographed in the street because there&apos;s been a spate of shootings with silencers. It requires a great deal of resilience and humour to get by.&quot; He said artists had more stability and freedom in Kurdistan, which escaped the devastation of the US-led 2003 invasion. Many Kurdish artists remain concerned about the legacy of Saddam Hussein&apos;s genocide of their people. Jamal Penjweny, from Sulaymaniyah, is showing a series of photographs called Saddam is Here that feature Iraqis in everyday places, in the street, in hotels, in shops, holding a portrait of the former dictator over their own faces, evoking the lasting impact of his brutal regime. Several artists address the devastation of Iraq&apos;s infrastructure and environment caused by years of conflict and western sanctions. Akeel Khreef creates sculptures from the discarded objects that litter the streets of Baghdad \u2013 for example, bits of a generator and a bicycle recycled into chairs \u2013 raising awareness of the shortages of everyday materials. The pavilion will be held at Ca&apos; Dandolo on the Grand Canal, the 16th-century residence of an aristocratic family, which will be refurbished with Kurdish rugs. Visitors will be offered Iraqi tea and biscuits . Watkins said the grand venue was incongruous given the devastation of Iraq&apos;s cultural heritage, and the show would play with that contrast.

She is showing a sculpture of a suspended honeycomb frame that drips its contents into an antique broken pot, which reflects her sadness about her homeland but also the possibility of healing. &quot;It&apos;s playing with the sense of what&apos;s been lost and broken in Iraq and its history as the Garden of Eden, the land of milk and honey,&quot; Watkins said.

The bombings on 12 March 1993 were engineered by a silver smuggler and gangster, Mushtaq &quot;Tiger&quot; Memon, widely seen as revenge for the destruction of the Mughal-era Babri Masjid, a hallowed Islamic site, by Hindu fanatics three months earlier. But the real mastermind behind the attacks was said to be the Muslim underworld kingpin Dawood Ibrahim. Dutt had been out on parole since 2007, when he appealed against the original sentence by a lower court of six years imprisonment \u2013 not for the bomb conspiracy but for the lesser charge of possessing illegal weapons (an AK-56 rifle and a 9mm pistol) supplied by the same Mumbai gangsters who carried out the devastating serial bombings, which killed 257 people and injured 713. Dutt&apos;s defence was that he knew nothing about the bomb plot and that he asked for the guns to protect his family after receiving threats during sectarian riots in Mumbai. At the time, the bombings were the worst terrorist attack the world had seen, with 13 bombs set off over a two-hour period across Mumbai. The supreme court reduced the sentence for Dutt on Thursday to five years. Having already spent 18 months in jail, he will serve only the remainder of his sentence. He has been asked to surrender to prison authorities in a month. Amid a frenzy of support and sympathy for Dutt from Bollywood, the actor told NDTV: &quot;I&apos;m okay. I can&apos;t think straight now. I&apos;m trying to come to terms with the verdict. I&apos;m just trying to gather my thoughts.&quot;     Sanjay Dutt in the 2011 film Double Dhamaal, with Kangana Ranaut (l) and Mallika Sherawat. Photograph: Everett Collection/Rex Features    During the drawn-out trial in a special anti-terrorism court, which finally led to the sentencing of 100 men and women in 2007, there were accusations that Dutt was getting preferential treatment thanks to his high-profile status and his political connections. Dutt is the son of two legendary Bollywood stars, one a Muslim and the other a Hindu, who fell in love on the sets of the 1957 blockbuster Mother India. His mother, Nargis, was close to India&apos;s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. His father, Sunil Dutt, was an elected Congress party MP and the national sports minister. His sister Priya succeeded their father in parliament. Dutt himself has flirted with an opposition party, and also with Mumbai&apos;s militant Hindu radical Bal Thackeray. After the trial court sentenced him in 2007, Dutt went to the supreme court and secured bail, since when he has re-established his successful film career, especially with the hit Munnabhai film trilogy, propagating &quot;Gandhian values&quot;, and many action roles. He also remarried in 2008 and fathered twins. The supreme court also showed leniency by commuting the death sentences of 10 bombers to imprisonment for life. Only one man will now go to the gallows \u2013 Yakub Memon, a chartered accountant who functioned as a financial manager in his brother Tiger&apos;s smuggling business. The court confirmed the death sentence against Yakub even though the accountant appeared to have only a peripheral involvement in the terror conspiracy. He provided the money for the vehicles that were later packed with explosives, and he arranged for plane tickets for Tiger&apos;s men to fly to Dubai \u2013 from where they were taken to Pakistan to be trained as bombers. But this was Yakub&apos;s normal role as the money manager in his brother&apos;s silver-smuggling business. Hours before his bombs ripped apart Mumbai, Tiger fled to Dubai and then Pakistan with three generations of his extended family. Dawood is also said to have taken refuge there, though Islamabad denied it all. Prosecutors said that Pakistan&apos;s ISI agency had supplied the explosive and trained the bombers, a charge accepted by the supreme court. But Yakub created a sensation in 1994 by suddenly deciding to return to India. After his return, this correspondent met Yakub while he was in police custody in Delhi. He remained silent, but the police were exultant \u2013 Yakub had come back with video and audio evidence that showed Pakistani officials had showered the Memons with extraordinary hospitality, including a 20-room mansion in Karachi. With Yakub&apos;s help, the Indian police also succeeded in bringing back several other Memons \u2013 his parents, three brothers, their wives and children. But the Memons ran into a double-cross \u2013 on their return they were all thrown into jail. Finally, two brothers (one with a brain tumour and the other with a mental disability), have been sentenced to life, along with a sister-in-law who had moved away from Mumbai six months before the bombings. Mumbai mafia: Bollywood and the underworld Once upon a time, Bollywood and Mumbai&apos;s organised crime elements were locked in a deadly embrace. Gangsters not only financed producers but also had a finger in everything from screenplay writing and casting to the distribution of films. The crime for which actor Sanjay Dutt, 53, was sentenced to five years imprisonment \u2013 accepting a gift of illegal weapons from his producers in early 1993 \u2013 dates from the heyday of Bollywood&apos;s romance with mobsters. It was only after cinema was designated as an &quot;industry&quot; by the government in 2001 \u2013 making bank finance possible \u2013 that the stranglehold of the underworld began to loosen. More than 3bn rupees (\u00a335million) is said to be riding on Dutt&apos;s current film projects \u2013 a big chunk could be lost if he is jailed immediately. But the outpouring of support and sympathy from film celebrities for Dutt is not just a case of Bollywood putting its mouth where its money is. &quot;There&apos;s genuine sympathy for Dutt,&quot; said Bollywood analyst Rauf Ahmed. &quot;He is seen as a victim of the bad old days \u2013 he was foolish and immature, and could not resist the lure of an AK-56 rifle.&quot;", "title": "Sanjay Dutt ordered to finish jail sentence over 1993 Mumbai bombings", "sentences": ["He provided the money for the vehicles that were later packed with explosives, and he arranged for plane tickets for Tiger&apos;s men to fly to Dubai \u2013 from where they were taken to Pakistan to be trained as bombers.", "Hours before his bombs ripped apart Mumbai, Tiger fled to Dubai and then Pakistan with three generations of his extended family."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-21T17:43:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/22/heathrow-warns-davies-commission-flawed-forecasts", "tags": ["Transport policy", "Airline industry", "Heathrow third runway", "Business", "Travel and transport", "London", "Heathrow", "Air transport", "Environment", "UK news", "Transport", "Politics"], "article": "Heathrow has warned the Davies commission that government forecasts for aviation demand are flawed and that the case for a four-runway hub may never materialise.

Instead, Heathrow claims, much business will be lost to overseas hubs such as Dubai and Istanbul, which operate on a similar model for long-haul routes and transfer traffic. The airport states that the passenger demand case for a third runway is clear and present now \u2013 marking a slight change of tack for Heathrow.

Pervez Musharraf, the former army chief who grabbed power in a military coup in 1999, hopes to reclaim a role in national life by leading his party in historic elections in seven weeks&apos; time. But despite concerted efforts to generate excitement, including a smattering of tweets and photos showing the various stages of his journey from his home in Dubai on Sunday morning, he was greeted at the VIP terminal at Karachi airport by about 1,500 people \u2013 a small crowd by the standard of Pakistani politics. Many of his supporters claimed more police blocked people from coming to the airport, but there were no signs of any restrictions on the roads. It was a far cry from the return of Benazir Bhutto from exile in 2007 when vast crowds of her supporters flocked to the streets to watch her pass in a slow moving procession from the airport in Karachi, which was attacked by a suicide bomber. She survived the attack but was later killed at a rally in Rawalpindi Senior police officials say they have been inundated with security threats against Musharraf too. On Saturday, the Pakistani Taliban released a video in which Adnan Rashid, a former Pakistani air force officer who has previously attempted to assassinate Musharraf, boasted that the organisation had prepared a &quot;death squad for Musharraf&quot; including suicide bombers, snipers and a &quot;close combat team&quot;. Officials in Karachi refused to grant Musharraf permission to travel in a procession to the grand tomb of Muhammad Ali Jinnah, Pakistan&apos;s founding father. Hours after his regular commercial flight touched down in the southern port city he finally emerged on the steps of the VIP terminal at Karachi airport only after most of the crowd had been dispersed by police. Musharraf directed his waves and fist bumps towards a nearby bank of television cameras and journalists, a handful of whom were wearing body armour. With no equipment to amplify his voice, only the television microphones had any chance of picking up what he had to say. &quot;Where has the Pakistan I left five years ago gone?&quot; Musharraf asked. &quot;My heart cries tears of blood when I see the state of the country today. I have come back for you. I want to restore the Pakistan I left.&quot; Musharraf has a small but committed fanbase in Pakistan. &quot;He is an honest man, a risk-taker and a go-getter,&quot; said Farooq Dawood, a retired naval officer among the crowd to greet him. &quot;He could have continued enjoying a very good life in Dubai, but he would rather be here trying to serve his country.&quot; Despite Musharraf&apos;s willingness to take risks, he avoided coming back to Pakistan while the threat of arrest hung over him, preferring instead to bide his time in London and Dubai. He faces charges of failing to provide adequate security to Bhutto on her return, the alleged murder of Nawab Akbar Bugti, and treason in the case of his sacking of Pakistan&apos;s top judges in 2007. But last week Musharraf was granted protective bail by a judge, meaning there was no risk of his being arrested the moment he stepped off the plane. The decision prompted Human Rights Watch to warn that he should not be allowed &quot;to elude serious legal proceedings against him&quot;. His old political enemies also seem to have softened their line, apparently no longer seeing him as any great threat. The PML-N, the faction of the Pakistan Muslim League led by Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister deposed by Musharraf in 1999, has softened his tone against the former dictator, saying all Pakistani citizens have a right to live in their country. The return to democracy in 2008 has not impressed Musharraf&apos;s supporters who despair at the record of the Pakistan Peoples party (PPP), which swept to power at the head of a coalition government after Bhutto was assassinated on the campaign trail. &quot;Democracy is not working in Pakistan,&quot; said Moiz Iqbal, a 24-year-old accountancy student. &quot;People are poor in Pakistan, we just want peace and economic stability. &quot;It doesn&apos;t matter if we are a democracy or a dictatorship as long as we have peace, employment and a good economy.&quot; Despite persistent fears that democracy in Pakistan will once again be interrupted, the country continues to move remorselessly towards historic general elections on 11 May, which, if successful, will be the first time one democratically elected government has handed over power to another. In another important step, the election commission of Pakistan on Saturday announced that Mir Hazar Khan Khoso, an 84-year-old retired judge, would serve as interim prime minister in the runup to election day. Meanwhile, the country&apos;s two biggest parties, the PPP and the PML-N, continue to make preparations for what is set to be a tightly fought campaign. Imran Khan, a rising politician determined to challenge the established parties, has also been ramping up his campaign. On Saturday, he attracted crowds estimated to be in excess of 100,000 to a mass rally in Lahore held by his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI) party. Few analysts believe Musharraf&apos;s All Pakistan Muslim League (APML) will be anything more than a sideshow to the three-way tussle between the PPP, PML and PTI. Talat Masood, a retired general who knows Musharraf well, said the former president had greatly overestimated his importance in the country. &quot;He will create only a few ripples here and there but at the moment does not have a political constituency, does not have an organisation, and his support [is] very limited,&quot; he said. Raza Rumi, director of the Jinnah Institute thinktank, said the former army chief suffered from &quot;delusions of grandeur&quot;. &quot;He truly does not have much of a support base,&quot; he said. &quot;Some of the urban, middle-class people may like him who say his rule was good for the economy, but historically you have to have a real political party and supporters organised around a manifesto.&quot; Musharraf, who appears to partly gauge his support on Facebook followers (of which he claims he has more than Imran Khan), may even struggle to win a seat for himself. There is speculation he will contest a seat in the mountain region of Chitral and possibly in Karachi as well if he succeeds in winning support from the Muttahida Qaumi Movement, a party that dominates the port city. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 March to correct a sentence that stated that Benazir Bhutto was killed by a suicide bomber in Karachi.

Inside the auditorium, the audience was segregated into glittering stars in the seats down below and members of the public up top. Every so often a celebrity would take to the stage to collect their prize, and after thanking the director and their co-stars and dribbling on about their disgusting family for a bit, they&apos;d gaze up at the &quot;regular&quot; folk in the cheap seats and offer a profound thank you to them, because after all, dear public, you are the ones who ultimately blah blah blah let me pat you on the head blah blah blah God bless your plebby little faces blah blah blah. But instead of vomiting in protest, the audience applauded and cheered, as if they&apos;d each been singled out for individual praise, rather than being congratulated from a distance for being part of an anonymous blobby mass. It was like watching someone scatter a handful of sawdust before some geese, only for the geese to enthusiastically peck it all up while rubbing their bellies and smiling, like geese generally don&apos;t. You deserve each other, I thought \u2013 then immediately wondered whether thinking arrogant bullshit like that was part of the reason I wasn&apos;t going to be accepting any awards that evening. It&apos;s not misanthropy. I like the individual people in an audience. It&apos;s when they get together that they&apos;re a problem. A live audience is the weirdest creature on the planet, as anyone who&apos;s ever appeared in front of one can tell you. A live audience isn&apos;t cold and judgmental, but if anything the opposite: too warm and caring. If you&apos;re on a panel show, and you keep your mouth shut for a bit too long, the audience senses your nerves and feels anxious for you \u2013 so when you finally do open your mouth to speak, you&apos;ll generate a polite laugh at best, because too much weight has been cast on whatever you&apos;re saying. Similarly if you babble, interrupt other people&apos;s jokes and splutter your sentences, the audience will pity you. Either way, it won&apos;t trust you, which is death. A live audience will merely withstand you until it learns to trust you, and the quickest way to get it to trust you is to treat it as though it&apos;s one person; to trick yourself into believing all those eyeballs and nostrils and tufts of hair and shoes and backsides and elbows all belong to one person \u2013 one person who already likes you, so you\u00a0don&apos;t have to worry too much about impressing them. In other words, the most effective way to appeal to a roomful of humans is to mentally deny 99% of those humans exist. This explains why everyone in showbiz is fundamentally insane. A TV audience is subtly different. On the upside, it&apos;s far easier to pretend it isn&apos;t there, because you can&apos;t smell its sickly flesh or make a snap judgment about its haircut. On the downside, without the in-the-room dynamic of a shared live experience, the TV audience is infinitely more dismissive and expectant. It doesn&apos;t see you as a human being, but a shape on an appliance. Furthermore, the TV audience expects unending delight. Anything less than 100% fulfilment and it&apos;ll resent you for a moment before switching over. When I try to envisage the TV audience, I picture a huge, gaping, dispassionate, eyeless maw quietly moaning for food. Hence my cheery onscreen persona. And now the TV audience has an offshoot: the extended online TV audience, which is quicker to judge and infinitely more vocal. The Twitter audience for every TV show consists of people actively willing themselves to be comically unimpressed. Which is absolutely disgraceful, because that used to be my job. Actually, on reflection, even at my most try-hard I doubt I could be as unforgiving as the Twitter audience, which ultimately doesn&apos;t give a shit about anything except its own constant thirst for satisfying distraction. If 9/11 happened again they&apos;d criticise the outfits. I&apos;m generalising. But there&apos;s definitely a higher base level of expectation exhibited online. I experienced an interesting first the other day when a viewer from Dubai tweeted me to complain that he&apos;d downloaded the sixth episode of a series I&apos;d done only to discover it was a &quot;best of&quot; compilation edition which, he explained, was precisely the sort of laziness I should be criticising rather than engaging in. Now if a licence payer complains about something they&apos;ve coughed up for, that&apos;s fair enough. And if someone living overseas has to torrent my show in order to watch it, I don&apos;t mind. But torrenting it, then telling me off directly because you didn&apos;t like it? Come on. That&apos;s like getting a text from a burglar complaining that your fridge is empty. Awful. But I&apos;m talking about someone else there, of course. Not you, precious readers, not you \u2013 after all you are the ones who ultimately blah blah blah let me pat you on the head blah blah blah.

The start of the race has already been moved forward 90 yards further away from the grandstands in an attempt to keep the horses as calm as possible. It was announced on Tuesday that horses will be sorted into number order in the paddock before they go out on the course and not on the track so that the parade can be shortened. The problem of the early pace is among new guidelines issued to riders by Aintree and the Professional Jockeys&apos; Association, as a response to last year&apos;s race when there were two false starts and two fatalities, including the death of Gold Cup winner Synchronised. But weighing-room veteran Andrew Thornton believes trying to get the field to watch their speed in the early stages is easier said than done. Gold Cup-winning jockey Thornton is a PJA safety officer and has ridden regularly in the National since 1996. He said: &quot;They say, &apos;Slow down&apos;, from the start but when you get 40 horses together, it&apos;s not quite that easy. Personally, I don&apos;t think there as been much of a problem at the start. The only reason there was a problem last year was because of what happened to poor old Synchronised. The previous two years we didn&apos;t have a problem with the start. A lot of horses were getting buzzed up because they had been down there a long time. It was circumstances. However, Thornton does feel that the latest alterations to the fences are a good thing. &quot;The safety measures they are putting in place regarding the cores of the fences can only be good,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s making progress, but as long as they don&apos;t lower them anymore. If you make the fences lower they will be going faster.&quot; The RSPCA told the Guardian on Monday they wanted Becher&apos;s Brook to be axed, should it cause more injuries. That iconic fence has to stay, according to Thornton. &quot;The race wouldn&apos;t be the same without Becher&apos;s and some people would like it to be a flat race, but that&apos;s never going to happen,&quot; he said. &quot;There are a lot more tricky fences around the country than Becher&apos;s. It was unfortunate what happened last year. A horse fell at Becher&apos;s and brought something else down. That can happen at any fence anywhere, whether it be Cheltenham or Plumpton.&quot; 3.15pm Cue Card on course to face Sprinter Sacre at Aintree Tony Paley: Colin Tizzard was definitely considering sidestepping a clash with Sprinter Sacre at Aintree next week but confirmed on Tuesday that Cue Card on course for the John Smith&apos;s Melling Chase at Aintree on Friday week. Sprinter Sacre is officially the top-rated horse in training following his brilliant display in the Queen Mother Champion Chase, but connections are now stepping him up to two and a half miles for his next test. Cue Card heads for Aintree following an impressive display in the Ryanair Chase and both will face major Irish hope Flemenstar. Tizzard said: &quot;Cue Card is on course for the Melling Chase. He did some fast work today and he couldn&apos;t be in better form. &quot;I&apos;d say it was one of his best performances at Cheltenham but he was very good at Ascot and his win in the Haldon Gold Cup was right up there. &quot;He has had one blip all season and that was in the King George but I don&apos;t think he was quite right myself. Horses aren&apos;t machines and you need everything to be 100 per cent in these championship races and I don&apos;t think he was on song that day. He has been top class in his three other performances this season and has been as good as nearly everything else racing. &quot;I think the Melling Chase is shaping up to be a very, very good race if all three of them turn up. We have avoided Sprinter Sacre once already this year but this is over two and a half miles, which is Cue Card&apos;s trip. After his last two performances, we are entitled to think we have the best two and a half miler but I have no reason to doubt that Sprinter Sacre will get the trip. &quot;We got within seven lengths of him last year in the Arkle but I feel we are a much better horse this year whereas Sprinter Sacre hasn&apos;t had a hard race since then. We don&apos;t know if he is better compared to last season because he hasn&apos;t been tested.&quot; 12.15pm Rogers facing ban for attempt to switch urine samples Apprentice James Rogers faces a British Horseracing Authority hearing after testing positive for alcohol and attempting to switch his urine sample with someone else&apos;s. The incident took place before his booked ride in the 2.50 race at Nottingham on October 3. A date has yet to be fixed for the hearing at which Rogers could face a lengthy ban if found guilty. A suspension from 28 to 60 days is the punishment range for taking a banned substance. Refusal or failure to provide a urine sample could result in a ban of between six and nine months, while the range of suspension if found guilty of engaging in conduct prejudicial to the integrity, proper conduct or good reputation of racing is from one month to three years or a fine between \u00a31,000 and \u00a315,000. PA 12.10pm Planteur poised for World Cup bid Tony Paley: The 16-1 shot Planteur has settled in well at Meydan as he bids to improve on last year&apos;s third place in this Saturday&apos;s Dubai World Cup. The six-year-old ran well for trainer Marco Botti in 2012 in the world&apos;s richest race and impressed in his build-up with a comfortable success at in a Listed event at Lingfield last month. With Botti remaining at home to supervise Solar Deity&apos;s bid for the rearranged Lincoln at Doncaster on Saturday, his wife Lucia expressed her delight in the way Planteur moved in some light work on the track on Tuesday morning. She said: &quot;Whatever happens with him, we think he&apos;s in better form than last year when he ran a fine race to finish third. Obviously we are now hoping that he gets the luck of the draw.&quot; Many of the top names competing on Saturday have yet to make it to the track, but a significantly enhanced number of horses on view on Tuesday served notice that things are beginning to hot up with the big meeting a matter of 96 hours away. Trainer Michael Bell, who arrived in Dubai on Monday night, was on hand to supervise his globetrotter Wigmore Hall ahead of the Dubai Duty Free. Also engaging in light work were David Simcock&apos;s pair of I&apos;m A Dreamer and Trade Storm. The latter is proving profitably comfortable on the Meydan track, having won two of three starts at the Carnival including the Zabeel Mile, in which he beat Musir a length and a half last time. John Oxx&apos;s Saddler&apos;s Rock worked well under Jim O&apos;Neill on Monday ahead of the two-mile Dubai Gold Cup while the Hong Kong trio of Eagle Regiment, Frederick Engels and Joy And Fun attracted plenty of press attention when they worked. Today&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook Fontwell gives us some jump racing today, the track having passed an early inspection, and I&apos;m going to celebrate by having a swing at an outsider in the opening novice hurdle. The Informant (2.10) is available at 16-1 as I type but has the notable plus, in this field of lightly raced types, of having won at this unusual track on heavy going, as it will be today. That success came in a bumper on Boxing Day and the form may amount to little but he showed willingness, at least, on his rules debut. He started over hurdles at Lingfield last month, running a distant third of seven behind two much more fancied runners, looking as though he would know more next time and any improvement ought to give him a chance here, as the opposition does not inspire. Seamus Mullins, his trainer, is having a decent year and spring is often a good time to catch his runners. He&apos;s three from 10 in the past fortnight. At 9-2, Un Bleu A&apos;Laam (5.10) is of interest in the bumper, having been fourth in such a race at Kempton last month when good going was probably not what he wanted. He&apos;s the fourth foal of a dam who has produced three jumps winners so far, including Si C&apos;Etait Vrai, who was beaten only by Hidden Universe in his bumper. Gabrial The Duke is hotly fancied for Lingfield&apos;s opener and he remains at least fairly treated on the mark from which he was beaten less than a length last time. But Brick Rising (2.20) has scope to do a lot better than he has shown so far, stepping up in trip for his handicap debut, his first run as a three-year-old and his first since being gelded. Andrew Balding has already won 10 races this year and Brick Rising may be overpriced at 9-1. Later, Avertis (4.20) has been running well for Amy Scott this winter but, with respect to her, George Baker would normally be thought of as an upgrade. The horse is only 3lb higher than when winning over course and distance in January, so 9-1 looks wrong. Tipping competition, day two The newcomer trossiter and Lindsey6677 were perfect on opening day, picking Irene Kennet (5-1), Hidden Link (7-4) and Red Larkspur (4-5). JahLion, chiefhk and Beeftodd each managed two of those three. Today, we&apos;d like your tips, please, for these races: 3.40 Fontwell, 4.20 Lingfield, 5.00 Southwell. This week&apos;s prize is a copy of Racing &amp; Football Outlook&apos;s Flat Guide 2013, your handy guide to the season which sort-of started on Friday.

The manner of Prior&apos;s match-saving performance in Auckland, which could hardly have been less Gilchristian, underlined why. &quot;Gilchrist was an unbelievable cricketer and he moved the goalposts for a wicketkeeper in terms of the way he batted and took games away from the opposition,&quot; said Moores after following Prior&apos;s heroics from Dubai, where Lancashire are playing on their pre-season tour. &quot;What marks Matt out as special, certainly since he came back into the England team in India in 2008, is the ability to do whatever is required. That might be scoring quick runs to help win a game, or as we&apos;ve just seen in New Zealand, it might be batting with other people to save a game. That&apos;s a pretty special quality. England are lucky to have him.&quot; Neither is Moores, himself a former wicketkeeper, prepared to rank Prior in the pantheon of England glovemen. &quot;I just don&apos;t think that&apos;s fair to the people who have gone before,&quot; he added. &quot;Everybody has their time, and now it&apos;s Matt&apos;s time. From Jack Russell to Bob Taylor to Alan Knott and other guys like Bruce French \u2013 and obviously plenty more when you go further back in history \u2013 he is continuing a line of great English keepers. And he&apos;s doing that in his own style. From behind the stumps he can be the driver of the team.&quot; Prior himself has refused to entertain comparisons either with Gilchrist or England&apos;s most successful wicketkeeper-batsmen \u2013 Knott, Alec Stewart and the great Les Ames. &quot;I&apos;ve got a long way to go before I can be compared to those names,&quot; he said this winter. &quot;Those guys are legends and I&apos;ve got a lot to do before I can class myself alongside them.&quot; But his statistics now stack up very favourably indeed. With seven Test centuries, he is now only one behind Ames, who was described in his Wisden obituary in 1990 as &quot;without a doubt the greatest wicketkeeper-batsman the game has so far produced&quot;. Ames&apos;s eight came from only 72 innings in 47 Tests, 25 innings fewer than Prior has taken to make his seven. At that time Knott, another Kent great, was second on England&apos;s list with five centuries, although his total of 4,389 runs from 149 innings in 95 Tests made him a more prolific wicketkeeper-batsman than Ames, who ended his eight-year international career with 2,434. But the Wisden obituary was written before Stewart came along to muddy the waters. He made 15 centuries in his record 133 Tests for England \u2013 but only six of them came in the 82 matches in which he was selected as wicketkeeper. Then there is Gilchrist, whose records of 5,570 Test runs, and 17 centuries, remain well out of reach. So too does his strike rate of 81.95, compared to Prior&apos;s 62.98 which would be regarded as healthily aggressive when judged against anybody else \u2013 higher than MS Dhoni&apos;s 60.04, for example, with Prior&apos;s latest century nudging him one above India&apos;s wicketkeeper-batsman-captain. But that is Moores&apos;s point. Eden Park was merely the latest example of Prior&apos;s ability to tailor his batting style to England&apos;s demands \u2013 and his average of 45.46 is now tantalisingly close to Gilchrist&apos;s 47.6, and significantly higher than Dhoni&apos;s 39.7. Luke Sutton, who witnessed Prior&apos;s development from afar as a rival wicketkeeper with Derbyshire and Lancashire \u2013 and now declares an interest as his agent \u2013 believes that it is the improvement in his keeping since he started working with French that has underpinned the increased reliability of his client&apos;s batting. &quot;It might sound a bit weird, but as a keeper you can be a bit exposed and open to criticism, and that can take its toll on your batting,&quot; said Sutton. &quot;When Matt was dropped by England in 2007 he went away and worked so hard on improving all aspects of his game. Bruce French has had a massive influence on that, and I do think that extra confidence in his keeping has been a big factor in his recent batting form.&quot; Whatever the reasons, it is England who will have the substantial reassurance of going into the forthcoming Ashes series with a world-class batsman \u2013 Prior was rated in the ICC&apos;s official top 10 even before his outstanding third Test performance, with Alastair Cook the only other England player ranked above him \u2013 coming in at No7. In that respect at least, as even Moores concedes, he now provides England with the edge that Gilchrist once gave Australia.", "title": "Matt Prior: Heroic wicketkeeper-batsman who can tailor his batting | Andy Wilson", "sentences": ["&quot;Gilchrist was an unbelievable cricketer and he moved the goalposts for a wicketkeeper in terms of the way he batted and took games away from the opposition,&quot; said Moores after following Prior&apos;s heroics from Dubai, where Lancashire are playing on their pre-season tour."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-26T15:57:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/mar/26/jace-clayton-dj-rapture", "tags": ["World music", "Electronic music", "Culture", "Music"], "article": "Julius Eastman died alone of a heart attack in 1990, aged 49, following years of homelessness and crack addiction. It was a sad end to a broad, creative life: Eastman was once the leather-clad, gay provocateur of New York classical minimalism, who sang for composer Peter Maxwell Davies, and aggravated John Cage by undressing a man on stage while interpreting a piece of his. Eastman&apos;s own compositions for multiple piano, with titles such as Evil Nigger and Gay Guerrilla, convey Wagnerian grandeur with a handful of repeated notes. Eastman is now being resurrected by artist Jace Clayton, who as DJ /rupture has spent years creating, renovating and repurposing music, most famously with his noughties mixes: Afghan funk and jungle; Aaliyah given splattering glitches. Clayton has fed Eastman&apos;s work through various digital effects, and has been touring these mixes as part of a wider theatrical piece called The Julius Eastman Memorial Dinner. &quot;Each night he&apos;s evicted from his house, and goes to Tompkins Square Park, and dies alone, in this really tacky dinner theatre piece,&quot; explains Clayton, who plays an impoverished actor auditioning for the part of Eastman. &quot;It\u00a0lets us circle around all these issues: how he&apos;s being framed, what it means to [reinterpret] music, and also the desperation of someone who&apos;s working in Starbucks and wants a decent job.&quot; He wants to avoid bland hagiography, instead reanimating Eastman&apos;s iconoclastic spirit. &quot;I had a huge disagreement with a friend of mine, a well-known jazz pianist. He said Julius was in the classical tradition for a reason. I should respect these scores, and I should present his music exactly as he wanted to. He saw what I was doing as very disrespectful. But this is what I do. When I DJ, I&apos;m playing other people&apos;s music, but I&apos;m giving it my voice, my stamp, my ideas of combination. He was so irreverent with his titles, and with his whole way of being; my homage to him is using that spirit in a form he might not have approved of.&quot; Eastman&apos;s ambiguous attitude to his race, poking at the word &quot;nigger&quot; and seeing how it bites, chimes with Clayton, who likes to skewer expectations. &quot;Many music critics still believe in magical black people: &apos;Oh, they&apos;re making crazy, avant-garde music in Chicago, and it&apos;s called juke&apos;,&quot; he says. &quot;But at the same time, the privilege of being a black man with a middle-class background at the start of the 21st century is that I can do whatever I want: it doesn&apos;t have to feel representative. I was nerdier than people wanted DJ /rupture to be.&quot; They wanted a thug? &quot;Yeah, which is the holy grail: &apos;It&apos;s avant-garde but it&apos;s scary at the same time!&apos;&quot;      Reading this on mobile?

You wanted to buy reggae, you had to take three buses to go to Dorchester. You wanted to hear house, you would only go to the house club. My style wasn&apos;t going to be the same all night long.&quot; Instead he drew on music from around the world: cumbia and baile funk from South America, dancehall from Jamaica, polyrhythmic ballads from Africa. You can hear the spirit of these genre-blind sets in subsequent generations of DJs, from Diplo and Erol Alkan, to Oneman and Jackmaster. In 2000, Clayton moved to Barcelona with his Spanish wife, became fascinated with Moroccan culture and formed a band called Nettle with violinist Abdel Rahal, cellist Jenny Jones and Khalid Bennaji on the lute-like guembri. &quot;I was interested in acoustic instruments and having that beautiful sound, but pulling that into the computer for processing,&quot; he says. &quot;And I\u00a0wanted to create a space where the musicians were all equally uncomfortable. I&apos;m interested in collaboration, but I&apos;m interested in moments where the translation breaks down. You don&apos;t need &apos;fusion&apos; \u2013 you can make it as old and friction-laden as you want.&quot;      Nettle&apos;s 2011 album El Resplandor reimagined The Shining in a Dubai hotel, its pristine strings and Arabic melodies haunted by Clayton&apos;s electronic manipulations. &quot;Dubai&apos;s not about anything authentic at all, which becomes really interesting \u2013 because ghost stories are about precisely this line between the living and the dead, the tangible and the intangible. It feels like there is no history. There&apos;s a desert, and then suddenly there&apos;s a skyscraper, with very little intermediary development. And so I&apos;m thinking: can a place with no history be haunted? Can the internet be haunted?&quot; He curated a series of workshops in Morocco, exploring digital culture with local musicians, and became entranced by the use of Auto-Tune on traditional songs by Berber tribespeople. &quot;People there place an enormous value on the ability of the human voice to flutter around the melody \u2013 it really makes the\u00a0Auto-Tune fluoresce,&quot; he says. &quot;There are all these ideas about what it means to be a good Berber woman \u2013 the mountain woman with a clear, loud voice. The Auto-Tune amplifies that piercing sound; weirdly enough, it&apos;s tapping into these long-standing ideas of what a Berber woman should sound like.&quot; He created some audio software called Sufi Plugins, written in obscure Berber script, with a second volume out soon. &quot;I made some instructional videos, but instead of showing some guy mumbling about how they made the Skrillex bass sound, it was lots of pictures of Casablanca by the sea in the fog. It&apos;s leading someone into a space where they trust their ears more.&quot; One plugin, Devotion, automatically lowers the volume on your computer during the Muslim call to prayer. It&apos;s all part of fighting against what Clayton calls &quot;the great literalism of our time, that is really strong and can be deadening. &apos;Likes&apos; on Facebook, for example. This idea of the quantification of personal interest \u2013 there&apos;s something deeply unspiritual about it.&quot; He now lives back in New York, where his next project will be Gbadu and the Moirai Index, a work for four female singers to be performed near the New York stock exchange. Clayton will create software patches relating to each day&apos;s trading data for the vocals to be fed through, their sound altered by market performance. &quot;It&apos;s about the stock market, mythological figures, ideas of individual agency versus algorithmic control, Occupy ... If you want to dig further, we are standing on a blood ground: Lower Manhattan was an African and black burial ground for ages. Maybe that&apos;s informing all these other things happening here.&quot; Along with hedonism, technology and history, spirituality remains at the heart of his work. &quot;Without a spiritual belief, nobody&apos;s worlds get changed. At\u00a0the most basic level it&apos;s about believing in something much bigger and broader than oneself, and in another way it&apos;s valuing the unseen.&quot; He laughs guiltily. &quot;Though when it comes to my musical practise, the brain and the body are probably winning out over the soul.&quot;", "title": "DJ /rupture: how to sing like a sufi", "sentences": ["You don&apos;t need &apos;fusion&apos; \u2013 you can make it as old and friction-laden as you want.&quot;      Nettle&apos;s 2011 album El Resplandor reimagined The Shining in a Dubai hotel, its pristine strings and Arabic melodies haunted by Clayton&apos;s electronic manipulations.", "&quot;Dubai&apos;s not about anything authentic at all, which becomes really interesting \u2013 because ghost stories are about precisely this line between the living and the dead, the tangible and the intangible."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-26T18:59:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/mar/27/qantas-emirates-deal-approved", "tags": ["Airline industry", "Air transport", "Business", "Australia news", "New Zealand", "United Arab Emirates", "World news", "Qantas"], "article": "Australia&apos;s competition regulator has given the airlines Qantas and Emirates final approval to form a five-year global alliance, while requiring that they continue to compete with each other on flights between Australian and New Zealand. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission also said there would only be slight benefits to the public from the partnership. &quot;The ACCC is satisfied that the alliance is likely to result in material, but not substantial, public benefits,&quot; the ACCC chairman Rod Sims said in a statement. The ACCC had already granted interim approval, allowing the Australian and Dubai-based carriers to share flights between Australia and Europe, North Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Wednesday&apos;s final ruling, which lasts for five years, requires each airline to maintain its existing capacity on four overlapping routes to New Zealand: Sydney-Auckland, Melbourne-Auckland, Brisbane-Auckland and Sydney-Christchurch. &quot;On these routes the ACCC is concerned that Qantas and Emirates will have the ability and incentive to reduce or limit growth in capacity in order to raise airfares,&quot; Sims said. The requirement to maintain capacity on these four routes, which account for about 65% of all seats between Australia and New Zealand, would be subject to a review to consider whether increases in the minimum capacity were warranted. &quot;With this condition the ACCC is satisfied that the relevant net public benefit tests are met,&quot; the ACCC said. Qantas and Emirates also plan to co-operate on sales, marketing and pricing. The alliance was a key plank in Qantas chief executive Alan Joyce&apos;s bid to return the company&apos;s international operations to profitability.

The jockey was second on the Dessie Hughes-trained Black Apalachi to Don&apos;t Push It in 2010 and George believes O&apos;Regan and Big Fella Thanks will make a good combination. &quot;He&apos;s not ridden him before, but he&apos;s a good rider and I think he&apos;ll suit the horse,&quot; said George. Big Fella Thanks has finished fourth, sixth and seventh in the National, and was also third in the Becher Chase over the famous fences in December. The 11-year-old also holds an entry in the Topham Chase at the three-day meeting next week, but the National is the favoured target. &quot;It&apos;s looking more likely he&apos;ll go for the National. Obviously if it did get very soft, we&apos;d have a discussion about it, but the target is the National,&quot; said the trainer. &quot;We&apos;ll leave him in the Topham as well, just in case. He&apos;s on a career-high mark of 154. If the handicapper is right, he&apos;s better than he&apos;s ever been. &quot;He&apos;s finished fourth in a National, he&apos;s had a good preparation and we hope everything goes his way. He enjoys the place and we know anything can happen round there.&quot; Both Coral and Betfred have cut On His Own to 7-1 favourite following the news that Prince De Beauchene will not run. Seabass and Cappa Bleu, second and third in the market, have also been shortened in the betting along with several others. 11.50am Middleham Open Day on Good Friday Chris Cook: It&apos;s a great pity that the Lambourn open day has been lost to the weather this year but anyone in the area of Middleham can attend the northern equivalent in a couple of days&apos; time. Details are here and Mark Johnston&apos;s stable is among the 16 that will be open from 9.30am. Last year&apos;s Grand National winner, Neptune Collonges, will be on display at Elaine and Karl Burke&apos;s yard; apparently, you have to check the programme on the day to find out what time he&apos;ll be available to see. Today&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook Following last night&apos;s news about Prince De Beauchene being out of the Grand National, it&apos;s time to focus a bit more on the Aintree race and I&apos;m especially interested in which horses might sneak in at the bottom of the weights. There aren&apos;t going to be many horses eliminated at the final entry stage a week tomorrow, because 40 can run and there are only 57 still entered. Of that 57, these now seem unlikely to run: Prince De Beauchene (stress fracture, trainer says he&apos;s definitely out) Beshabar (ankle injury, trainer says he&apos;s definitely out) Magnanimity (being aimed at Irish National, though still an Aintree possible) Tofino Bay (being aimed at a Limerick race) That means Tarquinius, one of the more interesting outsiders, needs just two more to be withdrawn in the next eight days to get a run in the race. Fingers crossed. There&apos;s quite a bit of marking time between Cheltenham and Aintree, for jumps followers, anyway, and I can&apos;t work up much enthusiasm for today&apos;s sole jumps card at Wetherby. So I&apos;m looking at Southwell, where Jo Hughes might get a double with Caledonia Prince (3.10) and Luv U Whatever (4.55). Quite a few horses in the mile handicap have good records at this specialist&apos;s track but Caledonia Prince is five from 10 and won in two of his three visits this year. He couldn&apos;t cope with the admirable Dubai Hills last time but is still fairly treated in the absence of a beast like that. The favourite, Caldercruix, could be vulnerable at this mile trip. Luv U Whatever is unpenalised for landing an apprentice race here last week, his second win from two runs at Southwell. The runner-up, Ivy Port, won by five lengths at the same track yesterday. Joe Fanning has the ride today, having won twice from three rides at Southwell yesterday. Tipping competition, day three Sportingchad and Joehow had the best of it on day two, pairing Calculating (20-1) with Brocklebank (6-1). Chiefhk, tanias and carl31 also had that 20-1 winner.

Representatives of the 13 runners took turns to pick stalls for their horses and steadily worked their way out from the middle, and while Hunter&apos;s Light and Royal Delta, two of the favourites, were placed in stalls four and eight respectively, Animal Kingdom, the 2011 Kentucky Derby winner, started to drift in the betting after Barry Irwin, his owner, was left with a choice between 12 and 13. Irwin opted to start one from the outside in 12, but having attracted support earlier in the week, Animal Kingdom is back out to 11-2 with most bookmakers having been a point shorter with many before the draw. &quot;It&apos;s not ideal, but if we had got one, two or three, that would have been bad,&quot; Irwin said. &quot;This horse is not a speed horse, he&apos;ll be in the middle and we wanted him on the outside. This mile-and-a-quarter, that&apos;s his distance, and this Tapeta [the racing surface at Meydan], he&apos;s a freak on it. He&apos;s a very versatile horse, he had his first workout on dirt [before winning the Kentucky Derby] in the week of the race, he can run from a mile to a mile and a half on all three surfaces [turf, dirt and artificial] and we think we&apos;re in good shape.&quot; Animal Kingdom is one of three challengers from the United States, along with Royal Delta, last season&apos;s Breeders&apos; Cup Ladies&apos; Classic winner, and Dullahan, third home in the 2012 Kentucky Derby and a subsequent Grade One winner at this World Cup distance of 10 furlongs. American-trained horses have won eight of the 17 runnings of the Dubai World Cup, and while the US has yet to record a victory since the contest moved here in 2010, both Royal Delta and Dullahan represent trainers with a previous success in the race. Bill Mott helped to establish the World Cup on the international stage when the great Cigar took the inaugural running of the race in 1996, and hopes for more luck in running for Royal Delta this year following her ninth place in a 14-runner field 12 months ago. &quot;She was very well last year, we felt like we came into it in good order and she just had a disappointing trip and got banged around a bit. You always need that racing luck when the gates open [but] she wasn&apos;t even back in the barn after last year&apos;s race before we decided that we wanted to come back and give it another chance. &quot;I think [the American runners] would all be close together in terms of a betting situation. Royal Delta and Animal Kingdom are coming off the strongest races and if you go back in Dullahan&apos;s form he was very strong in the Pacific Classic last year, when he beat older horses.&quot; Saeed bin Suroor and Mahmood al-Zarooni, Godolphin&apos;s principal trainers, have five runners in the race between them, including Hunter&apos;s Light, from Suroor&apos;s stable, who took a Grade One event over the World Cup course and distance last month. The remainder of an international field comprises three horses from Britain \u2013 Red Cadeaux (Ed Dunlop), Side Glance (Andrew Balding) and Planteur (Marco Botti), as well as Andre Fabre&apos;s Group One Grand Prix de Paris winner Meandre and Treasure Beach, the 2011 Irish Derby winner for Aidan O&apos;Brien, who now races for Mike de Kock. Win or lose on Saturday, British racegoers may well get a close look at Animal Kingdom later in the season as Irwin hopes to run him at Royal Ascot in June on the way to a new career as a stallion in Australia. He would be only the second winner of the Run For the Roses to compete at the Royal meeting. &quot;We sold 75% of the horse to Arrowfield Stud,&quot; Irwin said, &quot;and part of the deal is that he has to go to England. He has to go there anyway just for quarantine before going to Australia, so we will keep training him and point him towards a race at Ascot. If they want to run, we&apos;ll run him. &quot;Stud-wise, [it would be good] if he could win at a mile, but I don&apos;t know, we&apos;ll see when we get there.&quot;", "title": "Animal Kingdom drifts in betting after poor draw in Dubai World Cup", "sentences": ["No one wanted to go high or low when the draw was made here on Wednesday for this Saturday&apos;s $10m Dubai World Cup, the world&apos;s most valuable race.", "American-trained horses have won eight of the 17 runnings of the Dubai World Cup, and while the US has yet to record a victory since the contest moved here in 2010, both Royal Delta and Dullahan represent trainers with a previous success in the race."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-27T14:33:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/mar/27/seven-reasons-pope-francis-hard-humble", "tags": ["Pope Francis", "The papacy", "Catholicism", "Religion", "World news", "Vatican"], "article": "Catholicism is big on symbols and Pope Francis has certainly been hammering home the message of humility in his brief pontificate with his (hitherto unheard of) habit of making his own phone calls, his rejection of much of the pomp and ceremony that surrounds his 2,000-year-old office, and now his decision to ditch the grand papal apartments in favour of more modest quarters. But can a pope really be humble? Faith moves mountains, as my Christian Brother teachers used to like to remark, but here are seven peaks that &quot;Father Jorge&quot; is going to have to conquer. (1) His name His full title is &quot;bishop of Rome, vicar of Jesus Christ, successor of St Peter, prince of the apostles, supreme pontiff of the universal church, patriarch of the west, primate of Italy, archbishop and metropolitan of the Roman province, sovereign of the state of Vatican City&quot;. It&apos;s quite a moniker to carry round when you are busy telling people you are at their service. Humility hitch: * (2) He&apos;s infallible Humility and infallibility are not natural bedfellows, and since 1870 the Roman pontiff is infallible in some matters of faith and morals. It is often assumed that the successors of St Peter were infallible from the start (though the favoured apostle did make his own howlers, as we recall in Holy Week, denying Jesus three times before the cock crowed), but this particular trapping of office was a late addition. Subsequent popes have only pressed the infallible button on one occasion \u2013 in 1950 to declare the Virgin Mary&apos;s assumption, body and soul, into heaven something that all the faithful must believe. Humility hitch: ** (3) He&apos;s virtually a monarch The head of the Catholic church is virtually the world&apos;s last absolute monarch \u2013 ruling over his flock of 1.2 billion without the slightest nod at democracy, and governing the 109 acres of the secretive Vatican City state as a dictator. Humility hitch: *** (4) He has his own bank Though some have tried unconvincingly in recent years to present a chastened face to the world, bankers don&apos;t tend to be big on humility, and the pope is de facto chair and chief shareholder of the Vatican bank, which trades under the misleading brand of the Institute for Religious Works. It has been a embroiled in scandal in the past, and is said once again to be in an almighty financial muddle to rival its Cypriot equivalents. Humility hitch: *** (5) His &apos;office&apos; Only the pope can say mass at the high altar of St Peter&apos;s basilica, a vast palace of marble, gold and priceless artworks. He even has his own canopy \u2013 or baldachin \u2013 to stand under, designed by Gianlorenzo Bernini. The &quot;I&apos;m down with the poor&quot; message that Francis is so keen to promote may just ring a bit hollow if he preaches it from such an opulent platform, but he can hardly turn his back on the mother church of world Catholicism. Humility hitch: **** (6) He won&apos;t sell off the Vatican&apos;s possessions A burst of selling off of the Vatican&apos;s treasures may sound very tempting indeed to demonstrate in deeds as well as words that the papacy is now a humbler institution. But chipping the frescoes of the Sistine chapel off the wall in order to flog them to a private collector in Beijing, Dubai or Moscow may prove tricky technically as well as emotionally, and if the storehouse of the Vatican museums is emptied, the revenues generated by visitors will tail off too. Humility hitch: **** (7) He has his own guard Does a humble pope really need his own honour guard? His namesake, Francis of Assisi, made do with birds and beasts. But to disband the colourfully dressed Swiss Guards, who have watched over every holder of the papacy since Julius II (1503\u201313), would throw the incumbents on the unemployment scrapheap (there are not many vacancies requiring familiarity with medieval weapons).

The sale follows quickly the revelation that there are contradictory intentions stated for Leeds between Gulf Finance House and its subsidiary, GFH Capital, based in Dubai, which concluded the takeover of Leeds in December. GFH Capital, not GFH, was repeatedly cited in the announcement as the owner of Leeds and as the entity which agreed this 10% sale, of which it said: &quot;IIB is the first strategic investor to come into the club in line with GFH Capital&apos;s long-stated plans to strengthen the club&apos;s overall shareholder base. Others are expected to join as GFH Capital creates the ownership structure which will provide the club with sound long term finance.&quot; That sought to clarify last week&apos;s divergence between GFH Capital&apos;s insistence that it wants only to sell &quot;strategic&quot; stakes in the club, and statements in GFH&apos;s annual accounts that the parent fund intends to sell the whole club immediately. So far, according to Bloomberg, the Bahraini stock exchange, on which GFH is listed, has received no formal clarification about which investment policy is the true one. Leeds supporters now having to acclimatise to another institution previously unknown to them becoming a significant shareholder at Elland Road were given almost no detail about IIB in the announcement. Nor was the price paid for the 10% stake disclosed; GFH stated in their accounts that they bought the club, principally from the former major shareholder Ken Bates, for \u00a322m. On its website IIB is revealed as another finance house in Bahrain, like GFH, which has suffered financially in the global economic downturn and the political turmoil in Bahrain during and since the Arab spring. In 2010-11 the fund&apos;s total income was only $3m (\u00a31.98m), and IIB made a loss of \u00a39m. That followed a \u00a328m loss in 2009 and a \u00a321m loss in 2010. The accounts state that IIB decided not to acquire any assets during 2011 due to the economic slump: &quot;Bahrain was not immune to the Arab Spring, and in fact experienced a significant amount of social and political unrest \u2026 which severely disrupted the local economy \u2026 As expected, investors&apos; confidence, which had already depleted to low levels, took a further serious hit due to the unrest, as did bank financing.&quot; The accounts suggested that since 2011, the economic position had begun slowly to improve, but no explanation has yet been given about the reasons for investing in Leeds. Aabed Al-Zeera, the chief executive of IIB, will join the board of the Leeds parent company, Leeds City Holdings Limited, and said: &quot;We are delighted to become investors in Leeds United and would like to thank GFH Capital for facilitating this for us.&quot; David Haigh, the deputy chief executive of GFH Capital, said that the plan, contrary to GFH&apos;s stated intention of immediately selling the club for a profit, is to sell strategic stakes to a number of investors and for GFHC to keep a stake itself. &quot;We believe that a consortium of like-minded investors provides the best ownership model for a club which belongs among the elite of English football clubs and global sporting brands,&quot; Haigh said.", "title": "Leeds United owners sell 10% stake in club to Bahraini investment fund", "sentences": ["The sale follows quickly the revelation that there are contradictory intentions stated for Leeds between Gulf Finance House and its subsidiary, GFH Capital, based in Dubai, which concluded the takeover of Leeds in December."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-28T11:57:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/28/black-caviar-royal-ascot-gary-stevens-dubai", "tags": ["Black Caviar", "Royal Ascot", "Dubai World Cup", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Black Caviar is odds-on at 1-2 to win any race at Royal Ascot in June following reports from Australia that the brilliant mare will return to the meeting where she won the Diamond Jubilee Stakes last summer prior to being mated with Frankel, another unbeaten champion, in July. In early January, Coral offered 16-1 against Black Caviar returning to win at Royal Ascot, but the odds have shortened steadily in recent days after it became clear that a second visit to Britain would depend on a subsequent visit to Frankel at a suitable point in the southern hemisphere breeding cycle. Banstead Manor Stud in Suffolk, where Frankel is standing in his first season as a stallion, confirmed earlier this week that a mating could be arranged. The Group One King&apos;s Stand Stakes over five furlongs, the second race on the first day of Royal Ascot, is expected to be Black Caviar&apos;s main target. Four Australian-trained sprinters have won the King&apos;s Stand in the last decade, and Black Caviar, who started at 1-6 when she beat Moonlight Cloud by a neck last summer, would be expected to start at cramped odds again if she lines up on 18 June. The Diamond Jubilee was the 22nd victory of her unblemished career, a winning streak that has now extended to 24 races following two recent successes. A King&apos;s Stand Stakes with Black Caviar in the field would also be the highlight of the international Flat racing season, which opens here on Saturday with the Dubai World Cup meeting at Meydan. There are contenders from America, Europe, Asia and Africa on the eight-race card, five of which are Group One events. Many of the world&apos;s top jockeys are also in attendance, including Gary Stevens, the hall of fame rider from America who returned to race-riding less than three months ago after seven years in retirement. Stevens said here that he hopes to continue his second career as a jockey for another five years. He will hope to add at least one more Grade One victory to his record on Saturday evening when he partners Little Mike in the Dubai Duty Free on turf and Dullahan in the $10m Dubai World Cup on the synthetic main track. &quot;Physically, I think I now feel better on a horse&apos;s back than I did in the five years prior to my retirement,&quot; Stevens said. &quot;I was dealing with a lot of pain in my knees. To go out and ride a race, and also through the pre-race warm-up, and not have pain [means that] mentally I feel a lot more clear than I did for the last five years when I was riding competitively. &quot;When I go into the stalls, my mind is very clear and focused on what I need to do. I&apos;m definitely at a higher fitness level than I was when I retired. I&apos;m in the gym on a regular basis, and probably taking better care of myself than at any point in my life. &quot;It&apos;s essential at 50 that I do that. I knew that I would be under the microscope, that there would be a lot of cynics and critics, and it was my job to prove those people otherwise. I didn&apos;t want to come back and be just a shadow of what Gary Stevens once was. I knew that I had to be what he was, if not better.&quot; Little Mike is top-priced at 8-1, while Dullahan is a 12-1 chance to give Stevens his second victory in the World Cup, following his success on Silver Charm in 1998. &quot;I&apos;ve studied both horses up close and personal over the last couple of years,&quot; said Stevens, who was working as a television pundit before his return to riding. &quot;I think watching races worldwide on a regular basis has not only helped me be prepared for a night like Saturday night, but also helps me to know the tendencies of other riders. &quot;People ask me all the time, are jockeys now different? Of course they are, they&apos;re younger, and a lot of them don&apos;t even know who I was. Oddly enough, I know what their tendencies are, but they don&apos;t know what my tendencies are.&quot; Stevens is clearly enjoying his return to the front line, though it carries risks as well as rewards. &quot;My mother has two sons who ride, and she can&apos;t watch a race on television,&quot; Stevens said. &quot;She listens to the race and my dad watches and gives a commentary. &quot;I knew it was going to be difficult on her and on my wife as well. She was relieved when I retired but she also knows that there was something lacking in my life. She&apos;s on board 100%, or I wouldn&apos;t be back right now. &quot;I know that a fall is going to happen. If you&apos;re a jockey, it&apos;s not a question of if you&apos;re going to fall, but when you&apos;re going to fall and how bad it&apos;s going to be. I&apos;ve known that since the first day I took out my jockeys licence at 16 years old, and it&apos;s going to happen again. But to me, the risk is worth the reward I get in riding day in and day out.&quot; Five years is Stevens&apos;s current estimate of his time back in the saddle, but he knows that other jockeys have ridden well beyond the age of 55. &quot;I said to my agent, it&apos;s your job to manage me like a trainer manages a boxer,&quot; Stevens said. &quot;I&apos;d love to have five more years. &quot;I hope I can be a flag-bearer. On Twitter, there are so many people who are 40 and up saying they are rooting for me and that I give them hope. &quot;Bill Shoemaker rode into his 60s. Laffit Pincay, to me if not the greatest American-based jockey ever then one of the best, he&apos;s approaching 70. I had dinner with him last week, and if he walked in right know, you would just say, why is he not riding? &quot;He can&apos;t because the doctors will not let him ride because of a neck injury, but he said, if the doctors would allow me to ride, I&apos;d be doing it. I talked to a lot of people, like Pat Day and Chris McCarron, people who were my idols when I was growing up, and they all said: if you can do it, do it, because we miss it.&quot;", "title": "Black Caviar at short odds to be a 2013 Royal Ascot delicacy", "sentences": ["A King&apos;s Stand Stakes with Black Caviar in the field would also be the highlight of the international Flat racing season, which opens here on Saturday with the Dubai World Cup meeting at Meydan.", "He will hope to add at least one more Grade One victory to his record on Saturday evening when he partners Little Mike in the Dubai Duty Free on turf and Dullahan in the $10m Dubai World Cup on the synthetic main track."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-28T16:55:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/29/shoe-hurled-pervez-musharraf-pakistan", "tags": ["Pervez Musharraf", "Pakistan", "World news"], "article": "Pakistan&apos;s former dictator Pervez Musharraf has suffered yet another indignity when an irate lawyer lobbed a shoe at him as he attempted to enter a court in the southern city of Karachi. The incident was the latest misfortune to befall a man who led Pakistan for nine years but is now struggling to revive his political career after returning last Sunday from more than four years in self-imposed exile. Musharraf was not hit by the flying footwear, which is believed to have been thrown as the former president was walking through the court building surrounded by security guards, supporters and journalists. Pakistan&apos;s lawyers, some of whom chanted slogans against him as he entered the building, particularly dislike Musharraf because of his suspension of the country&apos;s top judges during his final months in power in 2008. Shoe throwing is considered a major insult in the Islamic world, where the soles of shoes are considered unclean. Musharraf is camped out in a five-star hotel in Karachi after flying into Pakistan from Dubai and promising to &quot;save&quot; the country by leading his party, the All Pakistan Muslim League (APML), in historic elections due on 11 May.     Sole searching \u2013 protesters shout slogans outside the court. Photograph: EPA    But the former commando was not greeted by the throngs of wellwishers he had predicted, with just 1,500 or so turning up to greet him at the airport. The man who came to power on the back of military coup in 1999 was in court to deal with one of three cases against him, one of which involves the 2007 assassination of the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. In one piece of good news for the former president, judges granted him an extension of pre-emptive bail, meaning he cannot be immediately arrested. The granting of bail appeared to have been key to his decision to return from Dubai to Pakistan last Sunday. But the chances of him re-remerging as a political force in the land remain slight. Politicians from parties that might be able to provide the organisational muscle his own APML lacks have kept their distance. Analysts say Musharraf has grossly exaggerated his political pulling power. Before the shoe incident, he had attracted a flicker of interest on social media after posting a picture of himself on Twitter exercising in the gym of his hotel. Meanwhile, the focus of national attention remains fixed on preparations by the leading political parties for the election battle ahead. The country also continues to be rocked by violence.

Over the last three years, seven-figure sums have found their way to Europe, South Africa and Asia as a result, but one major racing nation has yet to feel the warmth of Dubai&apos;s megabucks: the one where the buck starts its journey. American-trained runners won eight of the 14 World Cups staged at Nad Al Sheba, where the racing surface suited horses used to racing on dirt. Since the switch to Medyan and its synthetic Tapeta main track, however, seven US-trained horses have lined up for the World Cup and it has required a posse to find them. It may be mere chance, of course, but if the three-strong US challenge for this year&apos;s World Cup capitulates tamely, too, it will start to look and feel like a trend. Some will blame the Tapeta, but there will be another obvious question, too, about whether States horses can show their best form at Meydan without the anti-bleeding medication Lasix in their system. Victory for either Animal Kingdom, Royal Delta or Dullahan would therefore have added significance, in demonstrating that &quot;clean&quot; horses from the US can still win the world&apos;s richest race. And it would come at a time when what had seemed to many to be a slow but inevitable move away from the use of raceday medication in the States has been thrown into reverse. The most recent setback for those who want to remove the raceday drugs from US racing came earlier this month, when the Breeders&apos; Cup decided to reverse an earlier decision to stage all its races drug-free from this season. Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s representative on the Cup&apos;s ruling committee promptly resigned and exasperation at the climbdown spread around the world. &quot;They&apos;d done the difficult bit,&quot; one senior British administrator complained to me this week. &quot;All they had to do was hold their nerve.&quot; Those who share that view may well be supporting Animal Kingdom. The 2012 Kentucky Derby winner races for Team Valor, which is run by Barry Irwin, one of the strongest and most persistent critics of current raceday medication practices in US racing. &quot;I&apos;m totally disgusted [by the Breeders&apos; Cup decision],&quot; Irwin said this week. &quot;We&apos;re out there alone, our people don&apos;t understand what&apos;s out here in the rest of the world and frankly they don&apos;t give a shit. Most Americans have that sort of John Wayne mentality, we own the world and run the world and you guys just live in the world. &quot;It&apos;s about insecurity. Most trainers, like most actors and writers, they live in the fear that they&apos;re going to be found out one day as frauds. That&apos;s their problem, they don&apos;t want their insurance taken away from them.&quot; On Saturday, the insurance will indeed be removed, for one race at least, and, though it will be merely a symbolic victory for drug-free racing if Animal Kingdom prevails, it would still be a positive outcome. It is a plausible outcome, too, as Animal Kingdom (6.05) is the most talented and versatile horse in the race, with top-class form on turf, dirt and synthetics. His performance in last year&apos;s Breeders&apos; Cup Mile, when he was second to Wise Dan after being boxed in all the way down the straight, was a match for his Derby-winning form and, while his wide draw is a concern, a price of around 11-2 is more than adequate compensation. The Dubai Duty Free is worth \u00a31.8m to the winner, which is three times as much as the Derby and approximately the amount that David Simcock&apos;s horses have earned in Britain over the last three seasons. It will be a year to remember for Simcock&apos;s yard whatever happens over the next nine months if his Trade Storm (4.40) can follow up two excellent wins at the Carnival with a victory tonight. Gentildonna (5.20), the Japan Cup winner, took the Japanese Triple Crown for fillies earlier in her career and can add the Sheema Classic to an outstanding career record, while, elsewhere on the card, Secret Number (2.25) has strong claims in the UAE Derby and Gordon Lord Byron (3.45) can overcome Mental in the Golden Shaheen.", "title": "Animal Kingdom can restore dented American pride in Dubai World Cup", "sentences": ["There will be nearly $30m in the prize fund on World Cup night in Dubai on Saturday, as there has been since the meeting moved into its splendid new home at Meydan in 2010.", "Over the last three years, seven-figure sums have found their way to Europe, South Africa and Asia as a result, but one major racing nation has yet to feel the warmth of Dubai&apos;s megabucks: the one where the buck starts its journey.", "The Dubai Duty Free is worth \u00a31.8m to the winner, which is three times as much as the Derby and approximately the amount that David Simcock&apos;s horses have earned in Britain over the last three seasons."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-29T15:06:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/mar/30/maasai-game-hunting-tanzania", "tags": ["Indigenous peoples", "Tanzania", "Wildlife", "Environment", "Africa", "World news"], "article": "A battle has erupted in Tanzania over the future of 30,000 Maasai people who claim the expansion of a big-game hunting reserve for foreigners will lead to their eviction from ancestral lands. Tanzania&apos;s ministry of tourism announced this week that it will set aside 1,500 square kilometres bordering the Serengeti national park for a &quot;wildlife corridor&quot;. The Maasai will as a result be prevented from getting to their pasture land in the corridor, destroying their traditional nomadic cattle-herding lifestyle. Access will however be granted to a Dubai-based luxury hunting and safari company. Daniel Ngoitiko, a Maasai politician representing part of the corridor, said the announcement amounted to an existential threat for thousands of Maasai tribespeople. &quot;My people&apos;s livelihood depends on livestock totally,&quot; he said. &quot;We will die if we don&apos;t have land to graze.&quot; NGOs say nearly all of the Maasai living in Loliondo district, where the proposed corridor will be, rely on cattle herding for food and to raise money for expenses such as school fees. Fifty-five Maasai leaders have petitioned the government against the corridor, which would place out of bounds savannah that is lush and grassy in the wet season and dusty scrubland in the dry. They have vowed to resign their posts as local administrators at a mass rally and protest in the Loliondo town of Wasso on Tuesday. Ngoitiko, who wraps himself in the traditional bright red cloth of the Maasai, will march 20km with his constituents to the demonstration. Ngoitiko said violence could not be ruled out if the government were to proceed. &quot;We will fight against it until the last person is gone,&quot; he said. Despite the passionate resistance to the proposals, the Tanzanian government appears determined to push ahead with the proposed corridor. The minister for natural resources and tourism, Khamis Kagasheki, told one newspaper this week: &quot;If the civic leaders want to resign, they can go ahead. There is no government in the world that can just let an area so important to conservation to be wasted away by overgrazing.&quot; Samwel Nangiria, government programme manager for a group of local NGOs, told the Observer that the Maasai lifestyle, which forbids eating wild game, is harmonious with nature. &quot;The government does not appreciate the way that the Maasai are living with wildlife,&quot; he said. &quot;They&apos;ve been using it for centuries, living with wildlife all over.&quot; The Maasai have followed seasonal rains with their cattle across what is now northern Tanzania and southern Kenya since pre-colonial times. But they have been gradually squeezed out of their territory. The process began in 1959 when the colonial British evicted the tribe from the Serengeti. &quot;My grandfather was born in the Serengeti where the national park is,&quot; Ngoitiko said, arguing that the idea of further relocation was unacceptable. &quot;The land we are claiming is ours because we inherited it from our parents.&quot; Today, of the million-plus Tanzanian Maasai population, at least 66,000 live in the 4,000sq km Loliondo district. The proposed corridor will reduce their land by nearly 40%. The Loliondo highlands are nestled between two jewels of Tanzania&apos;s tourist industry \u2013 the Serengeti national park to the west and the Ngorongoro conservation area (NCA) to the south. To the east lie the salt flats of Lake Natron, while to the north is the Kenyan border. Crucially, the reduction in land access would come at a time when climate change is already placing the tribe&apos;s lifestyle under pres sure. Jill Nicholson, programme director for local NGO the Women&apos;s Pastoralist Council, said: &quot;The rainy seasons are coming later and that&apos;s putting stress on water sources.&quot; The highlands are crucial for the June to November dry season. &quot;The area which is being established in the corridor is used in the dry season grazing,&quot; said Nangiria. &quot;This is the time they need it most so they can have a fallback. Another reason is the wildebeest are coming to calve in Loliondo, so the Maasai have to have access to the highland to keep their cattle away from possible diseases brought by the migrating wildebeest.&quot; The principal hunting outfit which will be able to exploit the corridor is the Ortello Business Corporation of United Arab Emirates. The OBC has operated in Loliondo for 20 years, flying over high-profile clients such as Prince Andrew and the United Arab Emirates royal family on 747s which land on a private airstrip. But their clients&apos; wealth has not filtered down to the Maasai. Ngoitiko said the hunting lodges did not employ local people, and skirmishes had broken out between herders and OBC security. In 2009, Maasai and national police clashed after the government tried to force evictions, allegedly to allow the OBC to hunt. Ngoitiko&apos;s younger brother Paul said he lost 50 cattle because they could not reach pasture. Paul remembers how losing livestock, a source of identity for Maasai men, broke his father&apos;s will. &quot;During the morning he would ask, &apos;how many livestock have died today?&apos; When you mentioned the number he didn&apos;t even speak.&quot; Paul also claims that police burnt down his family&apos;s bomas \u2013 homes made of mud, thatch, and cow dung. After protests, the government has allowed the people to return, but a court case is still in progress to decide their future. The government tried to evict Maasai from Loliondo again last year, but backed down after an outcry led by international advocacy group Avaaz. According to campaign director Ian Bassin &quot;nearly a million people called on [Tanzanian president Jakaya] Kikwete to stop the evictions of the Maasai. The government is responsiveto global opinion.&quot; Kikwete has a record of dismissing the Maasai lifestyle. This month, he told a group of pastoralists that &quot;living a nomadic life is not productive&quot;. Paul Ngoitiko disagrees, and on Tuesday he will march with his people in protest. &quot;We have our way of living,&quot; he said. &quot;Without land we cannot keep livestock, and without livestock it is a kind of death.&quot;", "title": "Maasai fury as plan to lure Arabian Gulf tourists threatens their ancestral land", "sentences": ["Access will however be granted to a Dubai-based luxury hunting and safari company."], "publicationDate": "2013-03-30T14:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/mar/30/animal-kingdom-dubai-world-cup", "tags": ["Dubai World Cup", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "A horse trained in the United States took the Dubai World Cup for the first time since it moved into the sport&apos;s grandest venue on Saturday as Animal Kingdom, the 2011 Kentucky Derby winner, came home two\u00a0lengths in front of British-trained contenders Red Cadeaux and Planteur. This was a polished performance by Animal Kingdom, far removed from the disappointing efforts of American challengers in the past three seasons. Joel Rosario, the five-year-old&apos;s jockey, soon had him settled close behind his compatriot Royal Delta, who set the pace until the top of the home stretch. At that point, Rosario sent Animal Kingdom into the lead and, from there, they floated away down the straight, ghosting over the Tapeta surface that had proved such a problem for American horses in the past. Red Cadeaux, a former Melbourne Cup runner-up from Ed Dunlop&apos;s Newmarket stable, set off in pursuit, but the\u00a0gulf in class was too wide to bridge. Planteur, trained by Marco Botti, emerged from the pack to finish third. This was a hugely significant success, a demonstration that the best American 10-furlong performers can win the world&apos;s most valuable race on a synthetic surface and without the benefit of raceday medications. &quot;[When he went clear in the straight] I thought, I hope this horse doesn&apos;t bleed\u00a0like every American told me he would do without Lasix,&quot; Barry Irwin, Animal Kingdom&apos;s owner and a vociferous opponent of raceday drugs, said. &quot;I am thrilled to death to win a race like\u00a0this without medication. It means a lot to me, and to the horse and to the breeding industry. &quot;He&apos;s a very unique, unusual horse, and I hope that breeders embrace him and appreciate him. He&apos;s one of the few horses good enough to win any race, including a race at a mile, and a mile and a quarter here, and I don&apos;t think a mile and a half would bother him.&quot; Animal Kingdom has been sold to stand at stud in Australia and is unlikely to return to the United States, but Royal Ascot in the middle of June could well be the next stop on his route towards the breeding shed. &quot;He will ship to England on Saturday,&quot; Graham Motion, his Nottingham-born trainer, said. &quot;We will talk about it [his target] in the morning. I&apos;m not a big believer in getting too far ahead and, when pointing for this race, it was hard to think about England.&quot; The obvious races which Animal Kingdom could contest are the one-mile Queen Anne Stakes, the first race of the meeting, which was won last year by Frankel, and the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes over 10 furlongs the following afternoon. He is 5-1 with Coral to win any race at the royal meeting. St Nicholas Abbey&apos;s Classic season was a bitter disappointment but he has been making up for it ever since and took his career earnings to nearly \u00a35m with victory in the Dubai Sheema Classic under an assured ride by Joseph O&apos;Brien, the son of his trainer, Aidan. &quot;On paper there wasn&apos;t much pace in the race, and [the owners] thought I should ride him a bit more forward,&quot; O&apos;Brien said. &quot;He&apos;s tough, he tries, he relaxes and you couldn&apos;t have a more willing partner. I was able to dictate my own fractions and have a lead at the same time, so it worked out perfectly in the end. I knew he&apos;d put his head down and gallop all the way to the line, he&apos;s a joy to ride.&quot; Aidan O&apos;Brien was completing a double on the card after the UAE Derby victory of Lines Of Battle, who is now a likely runner in the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in May. Mike de Kock, South Africa&apos;s leading trainer, also had a double, and both Shea\u00a0Shea, who took the Al Quoz Sprint, and Soft Falling Rain, the Godolphin Mile winner, are probable runners at Royal Ascot.

The economic and social transformations that took developed countries a few centuries, occurred within the Gulf in only a few decades. But these countries&apos; enormous wealth, thanks to the oil and gas industry, comes at a high cost for children. Pollution soils the environment, dependence on the automobile has had an impact on health, from obesity to a high rate of car fatalities, and the abundant oil and gas reserves are finite resources, the depletion of which could have a huge impact on children&apos;s future way of life. Businesses, often partnering with charities, have stepped in and established youth-oriented programmes as part of their corporate social responsibility agendas but the challenges are daunting. Regional leadership has focused on economic growth at the expense of the environment. Expatriates who work for multinationals in the region do not have a long term stake in the Gulf, and the demanding nature of expatriate work does not lend itself to volunteering. Nevertheless companies large and small have found opportunities to engage in community programmes geared to children and have built co-operation, inspired employees and entrenched themselves as important stakeholders in this region. Preparing students for jobs is one way to start. The non-profit INJAZ in Qatar partners with local and multinationals on programmes helping Qatari students prepare for the ever-changing 21st century economy. INJAZ recruits volunteers from the corporate sector to devise strategies to help high school students prepare for work and teach entrepreneurship and financial literacy. According to INJAZ&apos;s Layla Saad, one of Qatar&apos;s long-term challenges is preparing youth for the country&apos;s future economic growth and social change. Currently 88% of the Qatari workforce is in the public sector, and a PWC study revealed 65% of students would prefer to work within the government. At the same time, there is a keen interest in entrepreneurship and half the students surveyed said they were considering starting their own business. Students who participate in INJAZ&apos;s mentorship programme learn practical business lessons via workshops that teach them about the life cycle of typical companies, helping them understand the challenges and opportunities of running a business. INJAZ&apos;s biggest challenge, according to Saad, is recruiting volunteers. Multinational employees are often reticent to volunteer during the day, and community work is not yet part of local corporate culture. Nevertheless, INJAZ has managed to recruit 350 volunteers from companies in the past six years, and its supportive board has included professionals from Deloitte, Citi, ExxonMobil and Qatar Petroleum. Health also offers opportunity for companies who wish to expand their CSR programmes. In Saudi Arabia, the household and personal goods company Henkel partnered with the hypermarket chain Carrefour to launch a sustainability drive for local grocery shoppers. During a six-month project, Henkel and Carrefour employees worked together to develop a two-week plan to educate Carrefour&apos;s customers about environmental and health issues. Henkel representatives chose 40 children to participate as ambassadors for the programme. Children learned about sustainability concepts, which at Henkel cover four over-arching topics: water, energy, plastic and phosphates. Children then spent an average of about five hours in Carrefour stores explaining environmental protection to consumers, and learned professional life skills as well as environmental conservation. Customers in turn were open to learning about environmental issues from a fellow citizen rather than from an expatriate worker. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) has one of the highest carbon footprints per capita on Earth. HSBC worked with local schools to launch the Eco-Schools Climate Initiative within the UAE. The goal was to raise awareness at 20 UAE schools and teach students from the ages of five to 18 about climate change&apos;s consequences. HSBC volunteers worked closely with teachers at these schools to develop an action plan at each of the campuses participating in the program. These Eco-schools in turn not only saved money through reduced energy, water and waste generation, but also provided a fresh perspective for students and taught them new ways in which to approach sustainability issues. Opportunities to work with children and instil a spirit of sustainability and community are not just limited to large enterprises. Gaina Dunsire, an expatriate history teacher in Dubai, decided to work with a friend and build a &quot;food forest&quot; at the school to expand students&apos; knowledge about local food supplies and agriculture. What was once a sand pit in the middle of an amphitheatre has become a thriving garden with nine date palms towering overhead. A local landscaping company designed the garden&apos;s space at cost. Dunsire searched for corporate employees to sponsor each date palm but her efforts to convince companies fell short, and donors with ties to her school fronted the costs of the palms instead. Dunsire suspects many US and UK based companies manage their CSR programmes from abroad, and projects in the Gulf region are often overlooked. But for companies interested in becoming a long term stakeholder in the Gulf, working with the region&apos;s youth is one way to build trust and establish a reputation as a reliable partner on children&apos;s education, health and future employment.

Warnock&apos;s difficult 13-month reign at Elland Road ended on Monday night following a 2-1 defeat to Derby County. The former Sheffield United and Queens Park Rangers manager had maintained he would leave should Leeds fail to win promotion to the Premier League this season and the club, currently 12th in the Championship, insist they had a shortlist of candidates prior to confirmation of Warnock&apos;s exit. The former Reading manager McDermott is understood to be on the list and interested in the vacancy and another out-of-work candidate, Mark Hughes, was linked with the job ahead of the Derby game. Gus Poyet is also under consideration by the Leeds hierarchy and has previously spoken of his desire to return to the club he served as assistant manager to Dennis Wise in 2006-07. Poyet, however, would be difficult to lure from Brighton while the club pursue promotion via the Championship play-offs. Leeds&apos; academy manager Neil Redfearn and technical director Gwyn Williams have been placed in temporary charge following Warnock&apos;s departure and, according to the former manager, could remain in place for the final seven games of the season, while GFH considers its options. Redfearn managed Leeds for four matches last season following the departure of Simon Grayson. Warnock said: &quot;I think Neil Redfearn coming in with Gwyn Williams until the end [of the season], it gives them a little bit of breathing space to appoint the right one as I don&apos;t think they have anyone definite they want to appoint.&quot; McDermott&apos;s record in taking Reading to the Premier League on a limited budget would appeal to GFH, which only took control from Ken Bates in December but has already had doubt cast on its long-term involvement at Elland Road. The Dubai-based company took seven months to complete its purchase from Bates and Warnock believes the protracted deal, plus the sale of Robert Snodgrass to Norwich, who was followed in January by Luciano Becchio, undermined his attempt to win anotherpromotion. Warnock explained: &quot;I am always confident in myself and I feel it was very difficult. I relied on having Snodgrass at the club and we had to sell him to Norwich, and losing him was a major blow, and at a crucial time in pre-season. We never really replaced him.

Tremlett, 31 and a member of the pace attack in England&apos;s last Ashes triumph in Australia, is the only one of the squad who has not been selected at some stage of the winter, his last international involvement having come early last year when he played in the first Test against Pakistan in Dubai, only to be ruled out of the second in Abu Dhabi by a back problem that required surgery. His comeback last summer was then cut short after a single County Championship match against Lancashire at Guildford in July, and he had another operation in September. But England remained sufficiently keen to invite him to their fast-bowling performance programme in South Africa in January and wanted him to join the one-day squad in India so that they could monitor him more closely. Surrey were able to reject that approach because Tremlett&apos;s central contract had not been renewed by England, whereas they had offered him a new one-year deal. So he has played a full part in the county&apos;s pre-season preparations and is expected to make his latest comeback in their opening Championship match against Somerset which starts at The Oval on 17 April. Tremlett was also a member of the 27-man Performance Squad for 2012 that was announced this time last year. Other than Andrew Strauss, who has retired, three members of that 27 have been omitted this time \u2013 James Taylor, Ben Stokes and Steve Davies. Taylor would seem to have fallen well down the pecking order since he played in the home series against South Africa last year. Joe Root has leapfrogged the Nottinghamshire batsman in all forms of the game, although Taylor also suffers from a greater emphasis on one-day players in this year&apos;s list. His Nottinghamshire team-mates Alex Hales and Michael Lumb, both of whom would be regarded as 50-over or Twenty20 specialists, are among the seven &quot;new&quot; faces, as is the Sussex all-rounder Luke Wright. But Stokes&apos;s omission reflects the poor attitude that led to Durham&apos;s New Zealand born all-rounder being sent home from the Lions tour of Australia during the winter, with the Kent seamer Matt Coles. Nick Compton is another newcomer to the Performance Squad, having already replaced Strauss in the Test team, and the seamers James Harris \u2013 now of Middlesex after a winter move from Glamorgan \u2013 and Warwickshire&apos;s Chris Woakes are also added after being called into various squads through the winter. But perhaps the most surprising inclusion is Craig Kieswetter, the wicketkeeper who was overtaken by his Somerset team-mate Jos Buttler during the winter \u2013 but has clearly not been discarded completely by the selectors. They will name another 30-man squad later this week, specifically for the ICC Champions Trophy in England this summer, as required by the tournament organisers. That could include Rikki Clarke, the former Surrey all-rounder who has reinvented himself so effectively in the last three seasons with Warwickshire. Australia have been given permission not to make their 30 public, but they will announce their latest list of contracted players this week \u2013 with Fairfax newspapers reporting that Mitchell Starc will be rewarded for his impressive form in all forms of the game by promotion into the top five earners, whereas the Nottinghamshire regular David Hussey is set to miss out ).

Throw in the added topicality sparked by the Arab spring and the organisers of Birds Eye felt it only right for the annual festival dedicated to women and film to give itself over for one year to Arab women film-makers.

Click here to watch the video  Many of the films \u2013 from Wadjda, the first feature film to be filmed entirely in Saudi Arabia (shown ahead of the main schedule, which starts on April 3) \u2013 to Yema, are laden with awards and most are UK premieres. But all, the organisers say, counteract the stereotypes of Arab women so often perpetuated by news stories. One of these assumptions, says director Annemarie Jacir \u2013 whose lyrical film When I Saw You, is based around a Palestinian refugee camp in 1960s Jordan \u2013 is that female directors must face tougher challenges in the Arab world. Actually, she says: &quot;It feels like there are more female film-makers in Iran and the Arab world, comparatively, than in Hollywood.&quot; Thanks to the film industries in countries such as Jordan and Palestine being relatively young, women are not &quot;shut out&quot; of already-established systems, but feel they are helping to build something new. This, she says, is reflected in the awards ceremonies in the region, which act as a riposte to the male-dominated European and North American festivals. &quot;If you go to film festivals in the Middle East half the programmes are women but when you go to Sundance and Cannes there are hardly any women.&quot; Yet Jacir admits that not everything is rosy. While sexism is not a problem during filming, funding is traditionally harder to find for women directors across the world. But the fact that organisations such as the Doha Film Institute seem happy to fund women (47% of the institute&apos;s grants last year were made to women, says Gerova), may be one reason for what Young calls the &quot;sudden emergence of these extraordinary women film-makers&quot;.

Click here to watch the video The festival programme is certainly varied: from El Gusto, a film about musicians, which has been dubbed the Algerian Buena Vista social club, to A Tale of Two Syrias, charting the lives of a monk and a fashion designer, none of its offerings fit into easy stereotypes. Instead, says Gerova, it provides cinema-goers with a chance to discover new film-makers and a different slant on events in the Arab world. As Jacir adds, it also helps women in the Arab world to speak directly to an audience. &quot;People have a lot of cliches about life in the Arab world and Arab women in particular,&quot; she points out, &quot;and traditionally the stories that come out are not by women and not by Arab women.&quot;", "title": "Birds Eye View: a festival of female Arabian film-makers", "sentences": ["&quot;The best feature in the Dubai international film festival in 2011 and 2012 was won by a woman \u2026 We knew there was something going on.&quot; The &quot;something&quot;, says the event&apos;s creative director Kate Gerova, was &quot;an explosion of creative talent&quot; among female directors from the Middle East with Lara Saba&apos;s Blind Intersections opening the Beirut international film festival and Djamila Sahraoui&apos;s Yema winning the Algerian international film festival last year."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-03T12:58:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/03/gary-stevens-jockey-kentucky-derby", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Dubai World Cup", "US sports", "Sport", "Kentucky Derby"], "article": "&quot;Are you ready?&quot; asks Gary Stevens, one hand on the front door of his home, before he unleashes two large blubbery and eager labradors: Bella and Ollie. While they barge around his legs, he scrolls to a picture on his iPhone: of himself, sitting on his sofa with Bella and Ollie either side, like a pup buried beneath two elephant seals. &quot;They&apos;re my lapdogs,&quot; Stevens says, wryly. It&apos;s a balmy March afternoon. There is no racing at the Santa Anita racetrack, barely a stone&apos;s throw from his Sierra Madre home in Los Angeles, and the three-time winner of the Kentucky Derby appears in a jocular mood. Which he should be. Almost three months into his return to race-riding after a hiatus of seven years, the Hall-of-Famer is enjoying a Sinatra-esque comeback at 50. A graded stakes double a month into his return showed that he has lost none of his ability to deliver the goods at the highest level. Fancied mounts last Saturday on Dubai World Cup night, including in the $10m feature race, showed that he has lost none of his appeal with the horsemen who possess the big-race firepower. His sleek, horizontal finish shows that what he has managed to rid himself of are the debilitating pains that blighted the end of his riding career first go around. &quot;I&apos;m enjoying this right now,&quot; Stevens says, contrasting the pain of crippling injuries \u2013 predominantly in his knees \u2013 that he endured in his last five years of riding first time round with the relative painlessness of his renaissance. Having broken free from Ollie and Bella, he is sitting in the middle of his small rose garden, his villa style home, a brilliant shade of mango, immediately behind and sunlight spearing through the trees and on to a face crisscrossed with deep lines, like a carpenter&apos;s worktable. &quot;I&apos;m enjoying every day that I&apos;m out there and it doesn&apos;t have to be a million-dollar race. I&apos;m just enjoying every race that I&apos;m riding and the people I&apos;m riding for and the education that I&apos;m maybe able to give the horses.&quot;  &apos;I&apos;d rather do what I do than play golf&apos; For a jockey of Stevens&apos; stature \u2013 he has three Kentucky Derbys and eight Breeder&apos;s Cup wins among a treasure trove of major trophies won worldwide \u2013 it was inevitable that his comeback would be accompanied by backstage whispers of skepticism. Was it just a publicity stunt? Was it a last-ditch effort to reclaim the big-race spotlight? What did he have left to prove? Those doubts were largely dispelled when he rode the talented but truculent Slim Shady to win the Grade II San Marcos at Santa Anita 9 February. The following week, he steered Great Hot to a wire-to-wire victory in the Grade II Santa Maria \u2013 both races illustrating how, after seven years, the circuitry of his big-race control room was still firing just fine. &quot;I&apos;d rather do what I do than play golf,&quot; he says, &quot;and I love to play golf. But it&apos;s the competition and being in the weighing room and the feel when I won on Slim Shady of my first grade race [win] coming back. It was good winning my races before that but coming down the straight on Slim I was like, &apos;This is what I miss. This-is-what-I-miss.&apos; I hadn&apos;t felt that feeling for over seven years and it was so exhilarating, the speed and the power and the feeling of being thrown back into the saddle of a good horse. Wow. Especially because, you know, he&apos;s a bit tricky.&quot; Among the hoopla that surrounded his win in the San Marcos, it&apos;s easy to overlook the significance of Stevens&apos; performance from another crucial angle: Stevens the jockey and Stevens the horseman had both returned, in equal measure. A rider known for a trenchant competitiveness \u2013 a must-have trait among top jockeys \u2013 it was Stevens&apos; rare horsemanship, his ability to coax that little extra from horses not especially receptive to coaxing, that propelled his rise to the uppermost echelons. His win on Slim Shady exemplified that potent combination.  &quot;It&apos;s kinda catch 22 because nearly all good horses are difficult,&quot; he says.  They&apos;re like the kid athlete that&apos;s cocky and has so much talent. They&apos;re not easy to get to the start. They&apos;re not easy to ride in a race. There&apos;s a lot of finesse involved. I have a reputation for getting along with fillies that can be difficult. Trainers are like, &apos;We&apos;ll put you on this one, she&apos;s a bit mental,&apos; and you&apos;re like, &apos;Oh great \u2013 thank you!&apos; But you get on them and you figure out a way to get along with them. But the end result can be so gratifying and can make you forget about the defeats along the way.&quot;  Anyone who suspected Stevens&apos; commitment or motives needn&apos;t have waited until 9 February for an answer. Rewind a few months and Stevens was in the midst of a grueling two-month fitness program that only someone fully invested in the outcome could have endured. &apos;He made me throw up so many times during workouts&apos; Washington State, cold and winter-bruised, was the scene of much of the donkey work that went into Stevens&apos; comeback. As part of the PRO sports club&apos;s 20/20 weight-loss program \u2013 designed primarily for obese people, it was modified to accommodate Steven&apos;s specific needs \u2013 his regime included intense gym workouts, hours of walking with a tripometer strapped to his hip to measure pace and distance, an overhaul of his diet and afternoon golfing sessions in the frigid cold. He worked on the musculature to support his knees by building up the thigh and calf muscles on his right leg that had atrophied through over-compensating on the left. Overseeing his efforts was personal trainer, Clark Masterson \u2013 a man who can make Full Metal Jacket&apos;s Gunnery Sergeant Hartman look like Disney&apos;s Princess Jasmine. &quot;The last person Clark had trained himself was one of the American Olympians in taekwondo,&quot; Stevens says. &quot;The guy is badass. He looks like a Navy Seal, Special Forces kind of guy and that&apos;s how he trained me. And I love that. I need somebody to push me. He was trying to make me say uncle everyday but I wouldn&apos;t do it. He made me throw up so many times during workouts. He&apos;d tell me to get a drink of water to hydrate myself and I&apos;d say, &apos;I don&apos;t need a drink of water, I&apos;m gonna puke.&apos; His response would be, &apos;Well, there&apos;s a garbage can right by the water fountain.&apos; So I&apos;d go get a couple of gulps of water and throw up in the trash can. He&apos;d just laugh. If you think about it, that&apos;s what makes great racehorses: the horses that can handle what&apos;s thrown in front of them. They enjoy it and they move forward everyday.&quot; After three weeks, Stevens felt physically able to get back on a racehorse for the first time in seven years \u2013 discounting, of course, nominal scenes in his various ventures in front of the camera that included the film Seabiscut and the TV series Luck. Rising before dawn each morning, before his daily workouts with Masterson, Stevens exercised racehorses at the Pegasus Training and Equine Rehabilitation Center that is run by his close friends Mike Puhich and Jason Ormon.  &quot;I worked five horses [in] serious workouts my first day back. There I was, I hadn&apos;t done any serious work for seven years and I get on five horses that dragged me to the pole. I thought to myself, &apos;I&apos;m gonna be sore the next morning.&apos; But I got up and I wasn&apos;t. There&apos;s nothing worse than not being fit and jumping on a fit thoroughbred and having them take a hold. But I haven&apos;t had a day&apos;s soreness. Not one. I also rode the yearlings, soon to be two [years olds], that were going out in sets of six, and it&apos;s raining and it&apos;s snowing and they were wild. I got up at 5.30 in the morning, got on six, seven horses before going to the gym, so it was like a two day workout.&quot; Perhaps as necessary as the physical rigors, if not more so, was the distance from Los Angeles that the Washington facility afforded him: a distance that brought about a period of quiet introspection \u2013 an opportunity for personal change. Publicly vocal about his penchant for alcohol, Stevens used the time to nix the problem, cold-turkey, in an environment as free of temptation as possible. Isolated from his wife, Angie, and his youngest daughter, Madison \u2013 though they made a fleeting Thanksgiving visit \u2013 Stevens leaned on a sports psychologist, his friends Puhich and Ormon and classes for support. That his punishing workout regime came with the added burden of abstinence was as much a step towards personal salvation as it was an aid to his comeback.  &quot;Everybody knows that I&apos;ve enjoyed my beers over the years,&quot; he says, without an inflection in his voice or even a hint of irony. &quot;I&apos;m not afraid to go out and have a good time but I&apos;m not 30 years old or 38 where I could just go out and rock and roll. So it was a big change in my personal life as far as my daily routines that I did. That&apos;s why the sports psychologist was there to help me through some of my problems \u2013 basically a shrink, someone to talk to [about] how I thought I could handle this transition at 50 years old.  &quot;I was ready to say &apos;Screw it&apos; a couple of times. The whole thing wore my butt out but I think that when I was able to get on horses it was like Christmastime for me every day. I was back with what I felt when I was 16 years old. Getting on horses. No pain. The freedom of getting on a horse&apos;s back with no one else in charge, just me and the horse, was a real good feeling.&quot;  &apos;I get tunnel vision&apos;     Gary Stevens celebrates winning the 1995 Kentucky Derby, on Thunder Gulch.  Photograph: Andy Lyons/Allsport    There&apos;s a measuredness to Stevens, a steeliness behind his eyes as they look around the garden, a monotone that underscores his voice. It is that hint of two things: someone careful of how he&apos;s perceived, of how his actions and words feed into his public persona; and someone preoccupied with a variety of ideas, thoughts and perceptions \u2013 someone weighing a lot with their mind.  The former could easily be attributed to his TV work as a racing analyst for NBC and horseracing channel HRTV. And as a seasoned jockey, years of being in the spotlight have hardened him to the game of image-making. The latter is a little more complex. A sign of someone grappling with the specter of alcohol? Perhaps. Though it is quite definitely the trait of a very focused character \u2013 someone hungry in pursuit of lofty goals.  &quot;I get tunnel vision. I don&apos;t want a lot of distractions. I like to have fun but I like to have private time,&quot; he says. Nor is he apologetic about this focus \u2013 to the exclusion of almost all else. He is both self-aware and accepting of a mercurial nature that can bring about light-switch mood changes:   The good thing is, I know myself well enough when these changes are occurring. I know that I&apos;m gonna become a little more difficult to be around and my family know I&apos;m gonna get testy. I&apos;ve got a fiery temper. I wear my heart on my sleeve.  The pressure-cooker environment of big races is one of the things guaranteed to sharpen his focus to needle point. A week before a big event, Stevens will gradually reduce the amount of time he affords the media, before he closes himself off from interviews altogether. &quot;I always have a cut off period, no interviews, no nothing. I&apos;m like, &apos;I&apos;m going back down under.&apos; You wouldn&apos;t talk to a footballer right before he&apos;s about to go out to play for a championship and the coach wouldn&apos;t allow it either. I understand that positive publicity for the sport is important, and we need that, but at the end of the day, if I don&apos;t get the job done that I&apos;ve been paid to do then it&apos;s all a failure anyway and I&apos;ll never get another opportunity at it.&quot; Stevens can expect to receive the most intense media scrutiny in the lead-up to the Kentucky Derby, a race he has won on three occasions: on Winning Colors in 1988, Thunder Gulch in 1995 and Silver Charm in 1997.  &quot;The build-up started the end of February and with the social media it&apos;s amplified,&quot; he says, before pointing out the juggling acts jockeys face as they jostle for the prime Derby mounts. &quot;I&apos;ve got about four very strong contenders. I&apos;m happy where I am at right now. With the new points system it&apos;s a little more difficult to read. I&apos;m aligned with the right trainers who can get them there, and if I get in that starting gate then I&apos;ll be in a good spot. It&apos;s still a long way away from the first Saturday in May and we&apos;re pressing these horses hard right now to get them to the Derby and anything can happen. You better have your hand in the cookie jar ready to pounce on another when the wheels come off one of them.&quot; Among Stevens&apos; possible Derby mounts are Oxbow for Wayne Lukas, the trainer of Thunder Gulch and Winning Colors, and Tiz the Truth for Bob Baffert, Silver Charm&apos;s handler. Stevens is coy about singling one out, keen not to play favorites. He&apos;s saved from further elaboration by the intervention of his Madison (married twice before, Stevens has four children from his first marriage). &quot;Yeah baby. You getting in the Jacuzzi? It&apos;ll heat up,&quot; he calls over to Madison as she emerges from the house, towel in hand. His demeanor softens for a fraction before his attention is returned to the interview. &quot;It&apos;s America&apos;s race and everybody knows what the Kentucky Derby is. They may not know what the Breeder&apos;s Cup is but they know what the Derby is,&quot; he says, diplomatically evading the original question. Stevens&apos; entire triple-crown record stands at eight, including two Preakness and three Belmont Stakes wins. He remains the youngest rider to have surpassed $100m in earnings, which he accomplished in 1993. His international record weathers the closest scrutiny, with stints riding in France and England bearing a basket of Group race fruits. A self confessed itinerant, he has proven especially adaptive to new environments, chameleonic in his ability to quickly employ his talents to new tracks.  An innate intellectual curiosity has also been sated by his travels. &quot;I&apos;ve always loved to travel,&quot; he says, &quot;and for my lack of education, I&apos;m pretty well educated because of thoroughbred racehorses and my travels around the world. I didn&apos;t go to college but [my travels] are all learning experiences. All you can do is further your horsemanship and advance your knowledge. I&apos;m educated. I can read, I can write, I can speak a bit of a few different languages, all because of racing. It&apos;s provided a life I never dreamed possible.&quot; &apos;Any good athlete is able to block out the pain&apos; Disregarding a short-lived retirement in 2000, after knee surgery, chapter one of his riding career was brought to a close in November 2005, when he announced what he believed would be his retirement proper. This was due almost entirely to the chronic pain that he had endured during those tail-end years. Stevens freely admits that not since the late 90s has he felt as comfortable riding as he does now. Asked whether he felt the pain had somehow impaired his capabilities, he baulks. &quot;You&apos;re asking me questions that I might regret answering,&quot; he says, somewhere between offense and discomfort, before he carefully settles again, pauses, and measures his response.   Any good athlete is able to block out the pain, but you&apos;re not able to block it out 24/7 and as a jockey you&apos;re asked to do that and it does wear you out. I just know the toll it takes on you mentally and physically.   &quot;When you&apos;ve got that throbbing toothache that&apos;s not going away and the dentist can&apos;t help you, you&apos;re not a happy camper. When you&apos;ve got that pain, that throbbing toothache in your knee that won&apos;t go away, you&apos;re expected to go out there and ride with it throbbing. It&apos;s like going to a dental appointment every day when you&apos;re driving to the racetrack. You&apos;re like, &apos;Oh man, this is gonna be four hours of hell. But maybe I&apos;ll be lucky and win a couple races.&apos;&quot;     Gary Stevens arrives for the UK charity premiere of Seabiscuit. Photograph: Ian West/PA    As with any successful sportsman, retiring from a world around which a whole life has been forged entailed profound adjustments and raised a host of difficult questions \u2013 not least the question of what to do next. For Stevens, it looked as though he had passed seamlessly from one career to the next without extracting too much of a personal toll. Before his retirement, his feet were under the table at NBC. He snagged the role of jockey George Woolf in the Oscar-nominated movie Seabiscuit and he worked alongside the likes of Dustin Hoffman and Nick Nolte on the HBO series Luck. He was a trainer and a jockey&apos;s agent. He was a consultant and a racing manager.  But he was restless. Nothing equaled the thrill of race-riding. In the evenings, at 10, 11 o&apos;clock at night, he retreated to his garage, where he rode his vintage and a little threadbare equicizer \u2013 a mechanical horse that allows jockeys to hone their techniques in a finish \u2013 and relived the halcyon years. Next to him were nine cases full of his riding equipment.  &quot;I think in the back of my mind I knew I was coming back,&quot; he says, &quot;I just didn&apos;t know when it would be. The day I hung my boots up, there were people with over and under bets of how long I&apos;d be out and everybody lost them because they gave it at most three months. And here we are, seven years later. It&apos;s not that I wasn&apos;t enjoying what I was doing, so much. I didn&apos;t want to be 70 years old and thinking, &apos;Man, I thought about that at 50. But never did it.&apos;&quot; Now that he has done it, he&apos;s found that his role as a jockey has changed slightly \u2013 in the jockey&apos;s room especially, where he has had to find his niche among a room full of grizzled friends and fresh-faced upstarts.  &quot;The riders that I&apos;ve ridden with I have a rapport with and they were like, &apos;What&apos;s he doing? Is this a publicity stunt?&apos; Then there were the young riders that were 13, 14 years old when I retired, and half of them had never seen me ride before. Some of them were like, &apos;Who&apos;s this old geezer?&apos; Within the first week they were like, &apos;Oh geez, no wonder he&apos;s in the Hall of Fame. And no wonder he&apos;s respected in the way that he is.&apos;  &quot;They&apos;ve been very respectful and they ask a lot of questions. There&apos;s definitely a respect, and I think it&apos;s good because I think the young athletes today aren&apos;t always real appreciative of the guys who&apos;ve built the sport and built the luxuries that they&apos;re afforded now.&quot; As one of the elder statesman of the jock&apos;s room, it seems only fitting that there should be something about the generation beneath that irks Stevens. True to form, there is: the overindulgence of certain young riders in the aftermath of victory \u2013 of jockeys standing up in their irons to wave their whip in jubilation as they pass the wire. It&apos;s seen as a kidney punch to the vanquished. But it&apos;s more than simply the ethics and aesthetics of sportsmanship that trouble him, for underlying the celebrations are the risks to horse and rider.   They&apos;re gonna hurt the horse and somebody else one day. My whole job is to look after the horse and make sure he gets back safe. I want to bring back a horse as safely and as sound as the horse I was sent out on. That&apos;s my job. I&apos;m not just talking about horseracing, I&apos;m talking about basketball and football too. Celebrate when you get back. Have a glass of champagne and celebrate with the lads and talk your stuff in the quiet of the weighing room. Handle it with class.  As Stevens&apos; renaissance continues to gain traction, and as he sifts through the big-race mounts that are tossed his way, there is a certain tension between what he desires and what he is physically capable of that he will have to negotiate if he is to remain competitive at the top level. Despite his exemplary resum\u00e9, there are races he has yet to win but wants badly \u2013 the Breeder&apos;s Cup Classic chief among them. And he is eager to make room for another Kentucky Derby trophy on his mantelpiece. But at 50, and despite his knees holding up well thus far to the rigors, he realizes that he will have to be careful about how much his body can take if he hopes to fill-in the few remaining holes.  &quot;I know I&apos;m gonna run into some issues with these knees because they&apos;re not perfect. So I&apos;m gonna take time off when I need to.

Newcastle United&apos;s manager particularly enjoys watching the eagle which sits on the roof, then circles the stands just before kick-off at every home game. &quot;It&apos;s a fantastic spectacle,&quot; he enthused. &quot;And this ground is a terrific place to watch football.&quot; Standing in the technical area as his team play Jorge Jesus&apos;s side in Thursday night&apos;s Europa League quarter-final will be a rather different proposition from simply admiring the magnificent statue of Eus\u00e9bio outside the ground before enjoying the view from the posh seats, though. After winning 20 and drawing four of their Portuguese League fixtures, Benfica sit comfortably, formidably on top of their domestic table. Happily for Newcastle fans, Pardew is not the type to be easily daunted by their compelling brand of tiki-taka. &quot;There&apos;s never a mission impossible in football,&quot; he said. &quot;We can get a good result here. And at St James&apos; Park we can beat anybody. It will be difficult but we have no doubt we can beat Benfica at St James&apos;. We overcame a very good Anzhi side, who are just as good as Benfica, in the last round.&quot; Not that Pardew wants to be kicking off the return from a losing position \u2013 or even a goalless draw, which would mean the Portuguese side would require only a scoring draw to progress to the semi-final on away goals. &quot;Benfica&apos;s attacking options are varied,&quot; he said. &quot;They have a lot of flair and their two full-backs are very progressive. They are difficult to contain. Keeping possession is going to be a key element for us but I would prefer us to score tomorrow night because, otherwise, we are going to have to defend very, very well.&quot; As passengers being bussed to the Tynesiders&apos; charter flight to Lisbon prepared to cross Newcastle airport&apos;s main runway en route to the plane, an urgent message to apply the brakes came over the radio. Within seconds a fast-accelerating Dubai-bound Emirates Boeing 777 hurtled past before taking off. &quot;Wow, you wouldn&apos;t want to be hit by that,&quot; said someone as it disappeared into the sky. Pardew fears that unless Newcastle can keep hold of the ball they will be confronted by similarly high velocity pace and power in the shape of Jesus&apos;s players. &quot;We need more ambition than we had against Manchester City [where Newcastle lost 4-0 last Saturday] and we can&apos;t keep losing the ball,&quot; he acknowledged. &quot;It&apos;s a big, difficult test. Benfica have great momentum and confidence. That breeds its own success. Tomorrow we need to be sure that we leave ourselves a chance of winning the tie at St James&apos; Park.&quot; Pardew has been briefed about Jesus&apos;s team by Neil Lennon, whose Celtic side faced them in the Champions League earlier this season as well as his friend Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas, Tottenham&apos;s Portuguese manager. &quot;I know this city quite well and I&apos;ve got some contacts here too, so we&apos;re well briefed,&quot; he said. Although Newcastle will again be without the injured Hatem Ben Arfa, Fabricio Coloccini and Cheik Tiot\u00e9, Tim Krul, who turned 25 on Wednesday, has recovered from an ankle injury and will return in goal.

The leak of 2m emails and other documents, mainly from the offshore haven of the British Virgin Islands (BVI), has the potential to cause a seismic shock worldwide to the booming offshore trade, with a former chief economist at McKinsey estimating that wealthy individuals may have as much as $32tn (\u00a321tn) stashed in overseas havens. In France, Jean-Jacques Augier, President Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&apos;s campaign co-treasurer and close friend, has been forced to publicly identify his Chinese business partner. It emerges as Hollande is mired in financial scandal because his former budget minister concealed a Swiss bank account for 20 years and repeatedly lied about it. In Mongolia, the country&apos;s former finance minister and deputy speaker of its parliament says he may have to resign from politics as a result of this investigation. But the two can now be named for the first time because of their use of companies in offshore havens, particularly in the British Virgin Islands, where owners&apos; identities normally remain secret. The names have been unearthed in a novel project by the Washington-based International Consortium of Investigative Journalists [ICIJ], in collaboration with the Guardian and other international media, who are jointly publishing their research results this week. The naming project may be extremely damaging for confidence among the world&apos;s wealthiest people, no longer certain that the size of their fortunes remains hidden from governments and from their neighbours. BVI&apos;s clients include Scot Young, a millionaire associate of deceased oligarch Boris Berezovsky. Dundee-born Young is in jail for contempt of court for concealing assets from his ex-wife. Young&apos;s lawyer, to whom he signed over power of attorney, appears to control interests in a BVI company that owns a potentially lucrative Moscow development with a value estimated at $100m. Another is jailed fraudster Achilleas Kallakis. He used fake BVI companies to obtain a record-breaking \u00a3750m in property loans from reckless British and Irish banks. As well as Britons hiding wealth offshore, an extraordinary array of government officials and rich families across the world are identified, from Canada, the US, India, Pakistan, Indonesia, Iran, China, Thailand and former communist states. The data seen by the Guardian shows that their secret companies are based mainly in the British Virgin Islands. Sample offshore owners named in the leaked files include: \u2022 Jean-Jacques Augier, Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&apos;s 2012 election campaign co-treasurer, launched a Caymans-based distributor in China with a 25% partner in a BVI company. Augier says his partner was Xi Shu, a Chinese businessman. \u2022 Mongolia&apos;s former finance minister. Bayartsogt Sangajav set up &quot;Legend Plus Capital Ltd&quot; with a Swiss bank account, while he served as finance minister of the impoverished state from 2008 to 2012. He says it was &quot;a mistake&quot; not to declare it, and says &quot;I probably should consider resigning from my position&quot;. \u2022 The president of Azerbaijan and his family. A local construction magnate, Hassan Gozal, controls entities set up in the names of President Ilham Aliyev&apos;s two daughters. \u2022 The wife of Russia&apos;s deputy prime minister. Olga Shuvalova&apos;s husband, businessman and politician Igor Shuvalov, has denied allegations of wrongdoing about her offshore interests. \u2022A senator&apos;s husband in Canada. Lawyer Tony Merchant deposited more than US$800,000 into an offshore trust. He paid fees in cash and ordered written communication to be &quot;kept to a minimum&quot;. \u2022 A dictator&apos;s child in the Philippines: Maria Imelda Marcos Manotoc, a provincial governor, is the eldest daughter of former President Ferdinand Marcos, notorious for corruption. \u2022 Spain&apos;s wealthiest art collector, Baroness Carmen Thyssen-Bornemisza, a former beauty queen and widow of a Thyssen steel billionaire, who uses offshore entities to buy pictures. \u2022 US: Offshore clients include Denise Rich, ex-wife of notorious oil trader Marc Rich, who was controversially pardoned by President Clinton on tax evasion charges. She put $144m into the Dry Trust, set up in the Cook Islands. It is estimated that more than $20tn acquired by wealthy individuals could lie in offshore accounts. The UK-controlled BVI has been the most successful among the mushrooming secrecy havens that cater for them. The Caribbean micro-state has incorporated more than a million such offshore entities since it began marketing itself worldwide in the 1980s. Owners&apos; true identities are never revealed. Even the island&apos;s official financial regulators normally have no idea who is behind them. The British Foreign Office depends on the BVI&apos;s company licensing revenue to subsidise this residual outpost of empire, while lawyers and accountants in the City of London benefit from a lucrative trade as intermediaries. They claim the tax-free offshore companies provide legitimate privacy. Neil Smith, the financial secretary of the autonomous local administration in the BVI&apos;s capital Tortola, told the Guardian it was very inaccurate to claim the island &quot;harbours the ethically challenged&quot;. He said: &quot;Our legislation provides a more hostile environment for illegality than most jurisdictions&quot;. Smith added that in &quot;rare instances \u2026where the BVI was implicated in illegal activity by association or otherwise, we responded swiftly and decisively&quot;. The Guardian and ICIJ&apos;s Offshore Secrets series last year exposed how UK property empires have been built up by, among others, Russian oligarchs, fraudsters and tax avoiders, using BVI companies behind a screen of sham directors. Such so-called &quot;nominees&quot;, Britons giving far-flung addresses on Nevis in the Caribbean, Dubai or the Seychelles, are simply renting out their names for the real owners to hide behind. The whistleblowing group WikiLeaks caused a storm of controversy in 2010 when it was able to download almost two gigabytes of leaked US military and diplomatic files. The new BVI data, by contrast, contains more than 200 gigabytes, covering more than a decade of financial information about the global transactions of BVI private incorporation agencies. It also includes data on their offshoots in Singapore, Hong Kong and the Cook Islands in the Pacific.", "title": "Leaks reveal secrets of the rich who hide cash offshore", "sentences": ["Such so-called &quot;nominees&quot;, Britons giving far-flung addresses on Nevis in the Caribbean, Dubai or the Seychelles, are simply renting out their names for the real owners to hide behind."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-03T22:59:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/apr/04/best-practice-efficiency-babes-with-babies-london", "tags": ["Best practice: Efficiency", "Best practice exchange"], "article": "Name: Babes with Babies London Area: London Website: www.babeswithbabies.com/  Babes with Babies London was created with a mission to make maternity and motherhood feel good.

This raises fresh concerns about the scale of Britain&apos;s involvement in offshore secrecy arrangements. Data obtained from the corporate information service Duedil reveals 177,020 companies have listed directors in jurisdictions such as the Channel Islands, British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, Dubai and the Seychelles. More than 60,000 of those companies are listed as currently active on Companies House, the official register of UK businesses. Having directors in offshore jurisdictions does not indicate a company is doing anything illegal, or that a director is necessarily a sham. British expats who retain directorships of their business would feature in this data, as do &quot;personal services companies&quot; based in the Isle of Man, which help self-employed people incorporate themselves as a limited company. However, the figures do reveal the huge scale of company registration relative to some of the islands&apos; tiny populations: 47,161 companies have listed directors from the Isle of Man \u2013 representing one British company for every 1.8 residents of the island. The figure is even more stark for the secrecy haven of the British Virgin Islands, where there is one director listed for every 1.3 residents of the islands, for a total of 17,959 UK businesses, past and present. On the tiny Channel Island of Sark, there have been 24 current and former UK company directors for every resident of the island. Many of the key figures involved in the &quot;Sark Lark&quot;, as it was known, emigrated when the island&apos;s controversial practices came under scrutiny a decade ago. Most of those companies are now defunct, with only around 209 active directorships. A Guardian/ICIJ investigation, published last November, documented the activities of more than two dozen &quot;sham directors&quot; \u2013 Britons each listed as directors of hundreds, and sometimes thousands, of companies registered across the world, allowing the real people behind them to stay in the shadows. These sham directors held directorships not only in offshore companies but also in more than 8,900 British-registered companies \u2013 meaning UK authorities were left in the dark as to who was really in charge of supposedly British businesses. These new findings suggest the numbers of such less-than-genuine directors on British company registers may be much greater than the 28 so far identified. The Offshore Secrets investigation identified groups of nominee directors working out of territories scattered across the world. Atlas Corporate Services operated from Dubai and the Seychelles with six sham directors purportedly controlling more than 5,400 international companies. Another pair of British expats, Sarah and Edward Petre-Mears, appeared to have a global empire of more than 2,250 directorships between them \u2013 run, initially, from their home in Sark, and then from a collection of addresses on the tiny Caribbean island of Nevis. Writing in the Guardian in the wake of the initial findings, and before the latest figures came to light, the business secretary, Vince Cable, warned against the practice of using sham directors based in offshore territories. &quot;[We] must identify and stop the minority who sail too close to the wind in order to protect the UK&apos;s reputation as a trusted place to do business,&quot; he said. &quot;Becoming a company director carries with it legal responsibilities which, if breached, can result in disqualification, fines and prison. &quot;Some people think that putting up a straw man as a director makes them immune from the consequences. This is not the case: if you are acting as a director, you are liable.&quot;", "title": "More than 175,000 UK companies have offshore directors", "sentences": ["Data obtained from the corporate information service Duedil reveals 177,020 companies have listed directors in jurisdictions such as the Channel Islands, British Virgin Islands, Cyprus, Dubai and the Seychelles.", "Atlas Corporate Services operated from Dubai and the Seychelles with six sham directors purportedly controlling more than 5,400 international companies."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-04T15:18:21Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/apr/04/paolo-di-canio-sunderland", "tags": ["Paolo Di Canio", "Sunderland", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Not content with renouncing fascism, Paolo Di Canio is continuing to turn preconceptions on their heads as he gets to grips with the task of trying to preserve Sunderland&apos;s Premier League status. In his previous job, at Swindon Town, Di Canio adopted a dictatorial approach to management but since succeeding Martin O&apos;Neill at the Stadium of Light on Sunday evening, he seems to have embraced a few democratic principles. Indeed, on Thursday Sunderland&apos;s new manager extolled the virtues of communicating with his squad. &quot;You obviously need to sit down and have a chat with your players,&quot; he said. &quot;We have done that. I have had a look at the players, the experienced ones, the young ones, the ones who look confident and the ones who maybe are not confident. We have done tests on them and we have asked them what they feel about what has happened in recent weeks. &quot;We have carried out intelligence on them and I have listened to the opinions of people like John O&apos;Shea [the former Manchester United defender, currently captaining Sunderland in the absence of the injured Lee Cattermole] and others. I have to have my own ideas but it&apos;s important to communicate with players. Sometimes you can do it in a quiet chat, sometimes you need a confrontation, but the players here have been very helpful. They understand the need is for belief and confidence at the moment.&quot; Sunderland, with seven games remaining, have failed to win any of their last eight fixtures and stand a point above the relegation zone ahead of Sunday&apos;s trip to Chelsea, and such an approach seems eminently sensible. Di Canio, though, has not entirely discarded the stick in favour of the carrot. At the Academy of Light his charges have become used to running for at least an hour a day without the ball, working on positioning and team pattern. They have also been told there will be few, if any, days off between now and the end of the season, while shopping and golf in their spare time is frowned on as a waste of time. Meanwhile, new dietary restrictions have been introduced. Such developments probably come as no surprise to Trevor Sinclair, whose relationship with Di Canio was cited as evidence that the Italian is not racist. Sinclair, who is black, said the Italian&apos;s past claim that he was a fascist \u2013 an ideology Di Canio finally distanced himself from via a statement on Sunderland&apos;s website on Wednesday when he said &quot;I am not a racist and I do not support the ideology of fascism.

There was also rain and sleet and a wind which felt like an iced scalpel. There was everything, in fact, apart from a small tent and the flag of Norway to inform us that Roald Amundsen, Scott&apos;s old adversary, had beaten us to it. Even on sunny days the Eaton Road ground slopes sharply towards the sea, making it look a little like the deck of a doomed liner; on Friday it was very possible to imagine the iceberg that had done the damage. This was John Kettley&apos;s big day out. There was an awful lot of weather, as the Irish say, and from that point of view Sussex County Cricket club&apos;s new ground sponsors, BrightonandHoveJobs.com, got full value for money. But there was no play between Sussex and Loughborough MCCU on what was the coldest cricket ground in the country on the first day of the first-class season. There were no spectators either, apart from a preposterously cheerful couple. It felt like one of those bleak and frozen totalitarian states where gatherings were outlawed. The Sussex players, eager to play, looked frustrated. In the old days the county pro embraced bad weather and a break from the slog of playing 32 three-day games in a season. He would put his feet up with a cuppa and a fag and see if anyone had any intelligence concerning the 3.30 at Thirsk. In these more professional days playing is preferred to yet more practice in the indoor school or pumping iron in the gym. Besides, easy runs and wickets off the fresh-faced freshmen in early season swell the averages. and make you look better than you really are when form falters and injury and fatigue sets in later in the summer &quot;The good news is that we&apos;ve had a good pre-season,&quot; said the county&apos;s multi-trophy winning coach, Mark Robinson, philosophically. &quot;We have a really good arrangement to go to Dubai. Working in the warm means there is less chance of getting injured. And then we had two days against Hampshire in a friendly.&quot; Against Hampshire recently players wore gloves and hats and snoods. The bad news for the players is that gloves are not allowed in first-class cricket, unless you are a wicketkeeper, so on Friday they would not have been allowed. Outside the pavilion another snow shower gusted past. &quot;It reminds me of the coldest day I ever played cricket,&quot; says the former player Neil Lenham. &quot;It was against Derbyshire in the 90s and it was snowing but the umpire wouldn&apos;t let us come off because it wasn&apos;t snowing heavily enough.&quot; The Hove groundsman, Andy Mackay, who is largely succeeding in his ambition to get rid of the low, slow pitches and bring back the pace and bounce of the 1980s,shook his head with dismay. &quot;We are still suffering a loss of soil structure following last year&apos;s wet summer,&quot; he said. &quot;This feels like trying to prepare a ground in January. The grass doesn&apos;t grow at these temperatures. It&apos;s a miasma out there.&quot; It is not meant to be like this at Hove, where the sun has shone more often than at most grounds \u2013 and upon some of the game&apos;s most exotic players from the subcontinent, Ranjitsinhji, Duleepsinhji and Imran Khan as well as England&apos;s own CB Fry and Ted Dexter. The late writer and poet Alan Ross, who was a regular here, associated the ground with &quot;an odour of empire, of curry powder and whisky, retired colonels and actresses&quot;. On Friday, though, the odour was of Siberia and the best drink was brandy or steaming tea. A short time before more rain persuaded the umpires to mercy-kill the day, the committee room door opened and Jim Parks emerged. It is difficult to count the ways Parks, 81, has served Sussex cricket: glorious batsman, leg-spinner, outstanding cover fieldsman, wicketkeeper, captain, the county&apos;s pride in 46 Test matches and its president when the championship was first won in 2003. He has been appointed president once more, to mark the 50th anniversary of Sussex winning the inaugural Gillette Cup in 1963. He was the smiling cricketer with smiling strokes to match. And now his berry-brown face broke open once more as he shook the few hands he could find.

How poetic it would prove if the Northern Irishman were to reannounce himself as the best golfer in the world at next week&apos;s Masters. McIlroy was reduced to tears after his back-nine meltdown on the final day in Georgia two years ago. And little wonder; it was difficult for anyone to watch as the youngster capitulated when seemingly within touching distance of adding a Green Jacket to his wardrobe. Having gone into the final day with a four-shot lead, a triple-bogey seven at the 10th set the tone for his collapse. He ended up in a tie for 15th after failing to break 80. &quot;I like to focus on the good things in my career,&quot; McIlroy says. &quot;I try and learn from mistakes, whenever you have a bad day like I did have there two years ago. &quot;I still think about the little putt I missed in Switzerland for my first win on the European Tour, back in 2008. I think about that in the sense of &apos;what was I doing&apos; more than anything else. You learn from your mistakes and move on, you try and put into practice what you have learnt and then forget about it.&quot; McIlroy offers an instant rebuke to the suggestion Augusta is somehow indebted to him after the 2011 collapse. &quot;I don&apos;t think this game owes you anything. You have to go out and earn it, earn everything. No one owes you anything in golf, it is all about you going out and doing it yourself.&quot; What is surely beyond question is that McIlroy will return to major-winning form at some point. It is just that the suggestion the rebirth will come at the 77th Masters is offset by McIlroy&apos;s struggles in 2013, though a second-round 67 at the Valero Texas Open on Friday was a promising sign. The player who surged to victory in the 2011 US Open at Congressional and 2012 US PGA Championship at Kiawah Island has, since a win in Dubai last November, faded into golf&apos;s shadows. His switch to Nike equipment at the beginning of this year may have been lucrative but it has also been problematic, prompting the kind of criticism which McIlroy, to his credit, does not ignore. The reason being that the 23-year-old has previously been at his unbeatable best when seeking to prove his doubters wrong. &quot;Yes, that&apos;s fair,&quot; he says. &quot;The last couple of times, I mean the only two times, I have won a major, it has come that way. I have come off a little bit of criticism and people questioning whatever it has been; from the Masters [in 2011] going into the US Open, &apos;Does he have the attitude, the mental toughness to finish it off?&apos; &quot;I had just come through a bit of a rough patch last year heading into the US PGA, through the summer, and got that sorted pretty quickly. Maybe it is a good sign, maybe it is a good omen. I just wouldn&apos;t like to go into every major struggling, that wouldn&apos;t be a good thing. &quot;This is going to be the second year in a row that I go to Augusta as a major champion, which is always a nice thing. For me, it is my favourite tournament of the year. I&apos;m looking forward to it, no matter what.&quot; McIlroy&apos;s youth is often forgotten, such has been his fairytale rise from relatively humble beginnings. There are glimpses of it as his face lights up at the prospect of his girlfriend, the tennis star Caroline Wozniacki, donning a boilersuit and acting as a caddie for McIlroy at the Masters par-three event on Wednesday. &quot;I am trying to persuade her,&quot; he says with a smile. &quot;We will see.&quot; There is an endearing memory, too, of how an even younger McIlroy dealt with the surroundings at Augusta. &quot;In the first couple of years I played the Masters, I was in awe of the golf course and in awe of the place,&quot; he admits. &quot;I was sometimes scared to take a divot because the place looked so good. &quot;Now you treat it as a golf course \u2013 you are playing against the same guys you play against week in week out. The only thing that changes is the place. It still has that aura about it, though.&quot; The &quot;a&quot; word also applies to Tiger Woods. McIlroy was once bedazzled by the man who has recently overtaken him to return to the top of the world rankings. Albeit McIlroy takes no pleasure from being dislodged, there are benefits to golf&apos;s spotlight once again being focused firmly on Woods. &quot;I am never going to go into a tournament under the radar but most of the talk will be about the other guy,&quot; McIlroy adds. &quot;There was obviously a lot of attention on me going into Congressional because Tiger wasn&apos;t playing and I was coming in after the Masters. &quot;Kiawah was the same sort of thing, people were wondering if Tiger could win his first major, how he was looking and whatever. It is nice, obviously you are still going to get the questions and there is going to be a lot of attention but not as much as it would be if I had won a couple of times beforehand.&quot; A late schedule change means that McIlroy was denied the opportunity to visit Haiti, where he continues to assist Unicef&apos;s efforts to aid those who had lives ruined by an earthquake three years ago. He will return there, though, and is extremely conscious of the lessons such work offers. &quot;They don&apos;t care who I am, they are just happy for people to come down and help,&quot; McIlroy says. &quot; It is a great dose of perspective when you do go to a place like that. That&apos;s not why I would go, obviously; I am going there to try and help, trying to raise awareness and money, but I guess a bonus for me is that it does give you that fresh dose of perspective. &quot;For a couple of days at the Houston Open I was kind of tentative on the golf course, kind of hanging on to the club a little bit. Then I think: &apos;What are you doing? Who cares if a golf ball doesn&apos;t go where I want it to?&apos;&quot; That said, from Thursday morning McIlroy, against the backdrop of golf&apos;s greatest individual show and with the world looking on, will inevitably care.

Great Ormond Street children&apos;s hospital has budgeted for an extra \u00a311m from treating private patients in the financial year ending in 2013 compared with 2010 \u2013 a 34% increase. The Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust is also expecting to boost revenues by \u00a39m over the same period \u2013 a 42% rise. The Royal Marsden is expecting an extra 28% increase on 2010 revenues, equating to about \u00a312.7m. Across all trusts an 8% increase in revenues from private patients is expected to be posted for 2012-13 compared with 2010-11. Of the country&apos;s 146 foundation trusts \u2013 each of which has a significant degree of financial autonomy \u2013 40 plan to open private patient units. Trusts are also involved in a range of spin-off businesses, from the Moorfields eye hospital&apos;s multimillion-pound Dubai eye hospital to Rotherham hospital&apos;s private hair-removal service, Careplus Skin, which it says will be provided by NHS professionals for those &quot;tired of messy creams, waxing and shaving&quot;. The increase in revenues follows the government&apos;s controversial decision to allow foundation trusts to earn 49% of their income from treating private patients. They were previously capped at earning about 2% from private sources. Ministers, who want trusts to act more like businesses, will celebrate the latest figures. However, critics fear that NHS resources are being disproportionately directed at patients with money and that a two-tier system is emerging. Gareth Thomas MP, who obtained the figures, said: &quot;The huge expected rise in income from private patients is a further sign of an underfunded NHS. These figures confirm that the NHS under David Cameron is increasingly offering a two-tier service: pay privately and you&apos;ll be seen quickly; don&apos;t pay privately and join an increasingly long waiting list.&quot; The government has protected the NHS budget from cuts and it is rising with inflation. However, hospitals are finding their budgets squeezed because of the increasing costs of an ageing population and the expense of medical advances. Beyond the centres of excellence, such as Great Ormond Street hospital, these trends have encouraged smaller trusts to seek extra funds. Ealing hospital in London \u2013 which is facing the closure of its A&amp;E department \u2013 has budgeted for a 231% increase in private patient income in 2012-13 m as against 2010-11, albeit from a low base. The Surrey and Sussex trust has budgeted for a 186% increase. Dr Peter Carter, the chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, said: &quot;The RCN has repeatedly raised concerns throughout the debates on the Health and Social Care Act regarding the removal of the private patient income cap and its potential impact on NHS patients. &quot;We remain concerned that NHS patients will lose out on vital care by being pushed to the back of the queue. &quot;The RCN is not ideologically opposed to the private sector being involved in healthcare, and there are centres of excellence which are able to bring in private work to benefit all their patients. However, they are a minority with specific expertise. &quot;There appears to be a real risk that foundation trusts will pursue private patient income rather than focusing on delivering high-quality care for all.&quot; All of the trusts say that they put the new revenue back into the NHS and believe that the extra funds benefit all their patients. Many of the private patients seeking to pay for their care are from overseas. A spokesperson for Surrey and Sussex Healthcare NHS Trust said that it was investing in 11 new private rooms with that aim in mind. She said: &quot;As with other trusts, many of our consultants run private practices outside of their NHS work. &quot;Many of these consultants prefer to operate in NHS hospitals where there is 24/7 backup of intensive care facilities, etc, so that they can operate on high-risk patients. These operations are carried out outside of NHS sessions, at weekends or out of hours.&quot; Lord Howe, the health minister, said the critics were &quot;scaremongering&quot;. The figures, from 131 trusts, included revenue from research, joint ventures, the sale of drugs and intellectual property to customers. &quot;The total private income from these hospitals represents less than 0.5% of the NHS budget for 2013-14,&quot; he said. &quot;We have always been absolutely clear that private income should be used to benefit NHS patients.&quot;", "title": "NHS hospitals in bid to treat far more private patients", "sentences": ["Trusts are also involved in a range of spin-off businesses, from the Moorfields eye hospital&apos;s multimillion-pound Dubai eye hospital to Rotherham hospital&apos;s private hair-removal service, Careplus Skin, which it says will be provided by NHS professionals for those &quot;tired of messy creams, waxing and shaving&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-06T11:27:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/apr/07/top-ten-sun-spots-escape", "tags": ["Travel", "Greece holidays", "Europe holidays", "Spain holidays", "Egypt holidays", "Africa holidays", "Morocco holidays", "Cyprus holidays", "Dubai holidays", "United Arab Emirates holidays", "Malta holidays", "Sicily holidays", "Italy holidays", "Canary Islands holidays"], "article": "We can&apos;t go out at the moment, obviously, what with this tantrum of a weather, so what we do is sit on the sofa under a blanket in our slipper socks and browse Whereisitsunny.com.

Less than a month after Rio Ferdinand withdrew from international duty due to a strict fitness regime and then travelled to Qatar while England played San Marino and Montenegro, Hodgson has condemned the attitude that he believes is undermining the national team&apos;s prospects. The England manager claimed clubs show a lack of commitment to international football at all age levels and that players at risk of &quot;burn-out&quot; should be rested during the domestic season. Hodgson, speaking at the Soccerex European Forum in Manchester, said: &quot;What worries me is that clubs need international football but the great pity is that we suggest international football should be relegated to a lesser stage because the clubs have the Champions League and championships to aim for. &quot;These breaks are being seen as the 10-day break that you don&apos;t always get during the season. It concerns me that we are guilty of accepting it&apos;s the international break so we can give the player 10 days off to go to Dubai. I would still like to see the international break being a time when players go to play for their international teams, and it is seen as an important time. &quot;If you&apos;re a club manager now you&apos;ve got no excuse. Uefa are putting an end to the friendly debate by putting them in clearly defined international dates so you can quite easily plan your time around these blocks. If your players need a rest it&apos;s not obligatory that it has to be during the international break. It can be done during the other 40-odd weeks of the year when they are with their clubs.&quot; Hodgson admitted the problem is not confined to the England senior team. He added: &quot;I grew up in a generation when playing for your national team at any level was vitally important. But even at under-20s level now you have a lot of withdrawals. These are not key figures for their clubs. I cannot understand what precludes a young player from helping England at any level.&quot; Gary Neville, the England coach, told the forum that England&apos;s prospects are being undermined by the number of foreign players in the Premier League, with a tipping point having been reached. &quot;Is talent not being produced or is the pathway being blocked? For me, it is because the pathway is blocked,&quot; said Neville. &quot;You&apos;re not telling me there isn&apos;t another Gary Neville out there in Manchester, another Nicky Butt, Darren Fletcher, Tom Cleverley or Danny Welbeck. We have to get more English players in the Premier League. I think the ratio is 35% now. In Spain it is 63% Spanish. That sounds about right. &quot;You have Cristiano Ronaldo at Real Madrid and [Lionel] Messi at Barcelona but in the Spanish league 63% of their players are still Spanish. We&apos;ve gone too far in England. We&apos;re maybe 20% off. We need to give chances to our own. We can&apos;t go back to having no foreign players, the league is better for them, but the tipping point in terms of the numbers of players, managers and coaches has gone too far and we are harming ourselves a little bit.&quot; David Bernstein, the outgoing chairman of the Football Association, has said his organisation may not implement Uefa&apos;s proposal of a 10-match minimum ban for players found guilty of racist abuse. The FA is in the process of reviewing its own disciplinary stance on racist abuse, with details to be announced this month, but will wait to receive Uefa&apos;s proposal before deciding on its response. Bernstein said: &quot;We wouldn&apos;t necessarily get to the same solution as Uefa. It&apos;s not a race to be first past the post; we&apos;ll do it at our own pace in our own way.

It looks bad, usually tastes worse and almost always causes heartburn. But Qantas airline&apos;s decision not to serve pork on six daily flights from Australia to Europe following its partnership with Emirates has evoked a sudden and deep-rooted passion for pork. A number of potential customers are voicing their dissatisfaction on social media. You see, they demand to be served pork: it is a meat that a vocal few believe no long-haul flight should take off without. Many seem to have read little beyond the headlines. Other Qantas international and domestic routes will remain unaffected: pork just won&apos;t be served on the flights that go through Dubai. Rival companies, including Virgin and Malaysian airlines, have quietly not served pork on flights through the Middle-East and Indonesia for some time now. Contrary to what some people suggest, this is not a Sharia-inspired move. It&apos;s about taking heed of cultural sensitivities which, if you&apos;re flying in and out of a foreign country, makes commercial sense. Qantas flights through east Asian countries, for example, have an Asian-inspired menu, which includes noodle-based dishes and stir fries. Yet these facts are not going to get in the way of those who feel &quot;outraged that their religion has been disrespected by the removal of pork products&quot;, or who feel Qantas is &quot;sleeping with the Islamic enemy&quot; \u2013 actual quotes by Facebook users, as highlighted in this Tumblr. Those criticising the decision should know that trans-global partnerships are now the only way for companies, big and small, to move forward. It&apos;s becoming increasingly common for people within the same company to work closely with colleagues around the world, resulting in us having to challenge our attitudes to cultural norms. Whether this means learning the socially acceptable way to greet a foreign colleague or what sort of place to take them for lunch, then so be it. The Qantas partnership with Emirates has been a lifeline and has allowed the airline to stay operational; if this means not serving pork on a few flights, then it&apos;s a no-brainer. Many of the enraged have vowed never to fly Qantas again and are encouraging others to boycott the airline. Sadly for these zealots, the move between Qantas and Emirates has been a savvy one \u2013 Qantas has sold significantly more tickets on flights to Europe this year than it did in the same period last year. But are the outraged expressing the true views of the underbelly of Australian society? I&apos;d like to think not. Narrow-minded attitudes previously communicated to a few confidants now gain worldwide exposure thanks to social media. The Australian press has given much coverage to the racists and bigots haranguing Qantas, thereby further convincing the rest of the world that, yes, perhaps Australia really is full of racists. This view is not helped of course by the woman on a bus in Victoria recently filmed racially harassing a fellow passenger, or the TV newsreader who subjected to a &quot;Rosa Parks&quot; moment on a Sydney bus. These widely reported events do little to help Australia&apos;s ambitions to appear as a forward-thinking country, proud of its multicultural populace. But these few, ugly, vocal critics shouldn&apos;t taint the majority who don&apos;t hold such bigoted views. Travelling is a wonderful thing. It broadens the mind and allows us to become more accepting of different races and cultures. This makes me question whether any of those kicking up this fuss actually own passports.

In a small artisan quarter, a thriving mini-economy has popped up in the shadows of the city of high-end conferencing suites and executive meal vouchers. There mini-sausage rolls, tiny tandoori titbits and pleasant salmon thingamys are crafted by specialists who have rightly realised that, with the Big Cup and Big Vase draws on hand to tempt the bouffant hair of Big Cup&apos;s Big Suits several times a year, there&apos;s good money to be had in laying on the pre-match trough at which they can freely graze. But at precisely 12.02 pm CET, that trough was removed and the Big Suits were wheeled into the ceremonial Big Draw room and chained to their seats lest, with full bellys, they slid from them in slumber. Because rather than serve up the Big Cup and Big Vase semi-final draws in a prompt and timely manner, Uefa grand gruyere Gianni Infantino decided that he would ramble on for several hours first \u2013 rather in the style of this Fiver \u2013 with an extended drop intro that added nothing to nothing. Like preceding a nail-biting contest with a nose-picking one, Gianni interminably shot the breeze with sidekick and ball-plucker-in-chief Ruud van Nistelrooy until finally the former Real Madrid striker plunged his hand into the sacred Big Ball Bowl. On doing so, he first drew Fenerbahce against Benfica then FC Basel/Basle/Barrrrrl against Chelsea in the Big Vase semis. Chelsea suit David Barnard was delighted with the draw, casting an eye ahead to the final already. &quot;If we play in the final of [Big Vase] we will still be holders of [Big Cup] so we could be holders of both trophies at the same time,&quot; he cheered putting some potent Shane Warne-esque spin onto the fact they can only achieve this because they are the first Big Cup holders ever to have been knocked into Big Vase the following year. What felt like several days later, and with considerably more ado, Gianni then teed up the Big Cup draw. With Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund in the Big Ball Bowl, there was a chance of an all-German and all-Spanish semi-final. However Barca will travel to Bayern and Madrid to Dortmund, giving rise to the prospect of a Super Duper El Clasico final or, indeed, a Big Cup Bundes-bonanza. Either way or neither way, the draw throws up romance-a-plenty. Barcelona could win it for manager Tito Vilanova, back at the club after his cancer treatment. Bayern could avenge their defeat to Chelsea last year, winning the title for the outgoing boss Jupp Heynckes. Freewheeling Borussia Dortmund might clinch a win for the underdogs, a victory for footballing hipsters everywhere. But the Fiver&apos;s money is on Real Madrid: a final game in charge in which the Special One may either beat his nemesis Barcelona or Pep Guardiola&apos;s future side?

Her trainer had intended to run his Moyglare Stakes first in Saturday&apos;s Dubai Duty Free Stakes at Newbury, with stablemate Maureen heading to Newmarket instead. However, the Hannon team believe the ground will be in Sky Lantern&apos;s favour, and have opted to shoulder a 3lb penalty rather than run her on unsuitable ground at Newbury. That leaves Maureen to head to the Berkshire track for her seasonal reappearance. Assistant trainer Richard Hannon jnr said: &quot;Maureen is going to Newbury now and Sky Lantern goes to Newmarket. &quot;She was primed for Newbury anyway so it makes no difference. We put them in both races so we could have the choice. &quot;The reason we preferred Newbury for Sky Lantern was that she wouldn&apos;t have a penalty there, but the ground is going to be soft and she does need good ground.&quot; Ed McMahon&apos;s Winning Express and the Mark Johnston-trained Baileys Jubilee finished second and third respectively in the Cheveley Park Stakes last term and are set to cross swords again, along with eighth-placed Jadanna. Sir Henry Cecil&apos;s Hot Snap, a half-sister to multiple Group One winner Midday, and William Haggas&apos; Lady Nouf are interesting contenders, having won their sole racecourse starts to date. Hannon also field Light Up My Life, while Luca Cumani&apos;s Nargys claimed second in the Rockfel Stakes on her final start of 2012. Coincidently, Exactement, Reyaadah, Sorella Bella, Sound Of Guns and Waterway Run complete the field. Monday&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook Watching the French Classic trials at Longchamp on Sunday, it strikes me that you&apos;d have to be pretty desperate to back the favourite in races like those. Unexposed horses racing steadily before a sprint for home, with most trainers and jockeys focused on some future target rather than winning today . . . these are not circumstances favourable to heroic betting. Yet both the Prix de la Grotte and the Prix de Fontainebleau featured odds-on favourites and there would presumably have been many a cry of &apos;Zut alors&apos; or some stronger variant as both were turned over. I seem to remember touching on this subject after the French Guineas last year; the betting market there seems to behave as if it is determined to get behind the best horse, even in races where the identity of same is by no means clear, even in races that are by no means certain to be won by the best horse. Tasaday, the 9-10 jolly in the fillies&apos; race, managed to get beaten after being allowed a soft lead. Topaze Blanche, a staying-on third, looked to me like the one to take from the race, if there was one. Gengis, fifth in the betting for the six-runner Fontainebleau, might not have been a fluke winner, since the eventual time was six seconds faster than for the Grotte and he managed to pass the entire field in the straight. He did that despite US Law setting a sustainable pace that allowed him to finish a close third, so it might be worth watching the race and keeping an eye out this season for Gengis, who is out of an unraced half-sister to Ashkalani. So far as I know, none of these horses are likely to turn up in Britain but that needn&apos;t preclude us from taking an interest. I quite enjoy the odd speculative punt in French Group Ones and yesterday&apos;s trials have often thrown up the French Guineas winners, though a good draw and luck in running is almost as important as raw ability in the first two Classics over there. And so to today&apos;s action at Newcastle, or Chateau Nouvel as it&apos;s known over the Channel. David O&apos;Meara&apos;s Dick Bos (5.30) is pretty short at 7-4 for a decent seven-furlong handicap but still worth a look. Were I a trainer, O&apos;Meara is just about the last person I should want to see taking over one of my former charges because he has a very happy knack of producing improvement. The Racing Post notes that he has run six new acquisitions this season and won with all three that started at shorter than 13-2. Dick Bos would be interesting even if he had stayed with Peter Chapple-Hyam, as he looks fairly treated on a mark of 80 for this handicap debut after winning a 16-runner Windsor maiden last backend. The runner-up, who trailled by four lengths, beat 15 rivals off 72 three weeks later. Earlier, Le Chat D&apos;Or (4.30) is attractive at 9-1 from a mark just 6lb higher than when he won over course and distance last June. He also won on his seasonal reappearance last year and there should hopefully be enough juice in the ground for him, despite drying conditions. Resuming the theme of horses with new trainers, Mean It (3.50) appeals at 11-2 at Windsor on his first run since joining David Simcock from Tom Tate. He was 16 lengths clear of the third when narrowly beaten on his debut last June and the winner has since won off 82. Mean It gets to race off 77 here, having won a Haydock maiden by three and a half lengths on his only subsequent start. Simcock has started the year well, with 20 winners at a 26% strike-rate. Tipping competition - a new week Congratulations to SmokingGun1, who nicked last week&apos;s competition at the last gasp.

English-born, American-based trainer Graham Motion was in Lambourn on Monday where his horse is currently based and while the 10-furlong Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes is an obvious alternative, the trainer feels the stiffish finish at the Berkshire track makes the one-mile Queen Anne the better option. &quot;Your mile at Ascot is much more gruelling and a mile and a quarter to us in the States is like a mile and a half and may just be too much,&quot; Motion told Racing UK. &quot;It is a relief that there is no Frankel. The Queen Anne is an interesting option and it is something that I think he can adapt to.&quot;That&apos;s the remarkable thing about this horse is that he can do a bit of everything. Motion had not seen Animal Kingdom since two days after the Dubai World Cup, but believes his charge is ready to step up a gear after fortnight off. &quot;I&apos;m very pleased with him,&quot; said the trainer. &quot;He has had an easy two weeks. I wouldn&apos;t say he has put all his condition back on but I&apos;m pleased with how healthy he looks and how bright he is. We&apos;re going to press on but if there is any reason he shows us he is not up to it we are not going to force the issue. As long as he continues to work well and it all goes smoothly we will take a shot.&quot; Tuesday&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook From Richard Hannon&apos;s yard near Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire to Newmarket racecourse is 150 miles. Let&apos;s hope his horsebox makes the journey successfully on Thursday because, if it breaks down, there will be just two runners in the Craven Stakes. Four horses have been declared for what is supposed to be the best 2,000 Guineas trial and two of them, Toronado and Havana Gold, are trained by Hannon. They will travel all that way to face Roger Charlton&apos;s Dundonnell and Godolphin&apos;s Tawhid. You really would imagine that the town of Newmarket could do better than field a single contender for a Guineas trial on its own doorstep. At least the foursome are full of promise but the race may very well turn out to be unsatisfactory, with nothing else in the field to ensure a respectable pace. But away with nonsense Flat racing! There&apos;s two decent cards of jumping today and Kempton is especially interesting, with the ground drying out. I didn&apos;t expect Gee Hi (4.35) to be 7-1 for the 2m5f handicap hurdle but you can get almost 8-1 about Charlie Egerton&apos;s runner on Betfair. The winner of his only point, he has also won a Taunton bumper and a novice hurdle round Market Rasen, his sole defeat coming to Golden Hoof on heavy at Bangor. His opening handicap mark looks light to me, especially as his pedigree suggests he may improve for a decent racing surface. Egerton has done well with this type in the past and, though his operation is smaller now, his strike-rate remains respectable. At double-figure odds, I&apos;m prepared to take a flyer on Autumn Spirit (3.25), who has not been seen for a year but goes well fresh and should relish the drying ground. For those seeking something more reliable, I suggest Salmanazar (2.50) at 100-30 in the novice hurdle, Alan King&apos;s horse having won nicely over course and distance last time and I don&apos;t think he needs it as soft as it was that day. Tipping competition, day two Wiggy12 and the newcomer ghostquarter have made the best start, pairing Oddysey (8-1) with Zarosa (9-2). ToffeeDan1 had Zarosa and Significant Move (7-2). To kick things off, we&apos;d like your tips, please, for these races: 3.35 Exeter, 4.35 Kempton, 5.10 Kempton.

Every 10 years the literary magazine draws up a list of young British novelists (I say young; they have to be under 40, so they&apos;re young for novelists, ancient for footballers, and early middle-aged by most people&apos;s standards). The idea was cooked up in 1983 by the British Book Marketing Council \u2013 a distant cousin of\u00a0the milk and wool marketing boards, which has been long since consigned to the bonfire of the quangos. Since then a panel of literary editors, novelists, critics and publishers has been assembled every decade to come up with 20 bright young things. Now, 30 years after the first instalment, these selections look remarkably accurate. The 1983 list is the most famous: it included Martin Amis, Pat Barker, Julian Barnes, William Boyd, Maggie Gee, Kazuo Ishiguro, Adam Mars-Jones, Ian\u00a0McEwan, Shiva Naipaul, Salman Rushdie, Graham Swift, Rose Tremain and AN Wilson. But the 1993 sample was not much less convincing: the panel spotted Iain Banks, Louis de Berni\u00e8res, Tibor Fischer, Esther Freud, Alan Hollinghurst, AL Kennedy, Hanif Kureishi, Candia McWilliam, Lawrence Norfolk, Ben Okri, Caryl Phillips, Will Self, Helen Simpson and Jeanette Winterson. The 2003 list, though perhaps not so glorious, also hoovered up much of the talent that was around \u2013 including Monica Ali, Nicola Barker, Rachel Cusk, Philip Hensher, Hari Kunzru, David Mitchell, Andrew O&apos;Hagan, David Peace, Zadie Smith, Alan Warner and Sarah Waters. Some of these writers probably selected themselves: I shouldn&apos;t think that Amis took much spotting. By 1993,\u00a0Hollinghurst had published The\u00a0Swimming Pool Library, and Kureishi The Buddha of Suburbia. Arguably, you could design an algorithm to do much of the work \u2013 giving due weight to novels published, prestige of publishing house, critical reception, prizes won, shortlists occupied and so on (the Betty Trask and John Llewellyn Rhys prizes for first\u00a0novels have a good record of uncovering young talent). Even so, the\u00a0likes of Ishiguro, Ali, Peace and Mitchell were\u00a0picked out long before they were famous \u2013 or even, in Ali&apos;s case, before she was published. A few big names have slipped through the cracks because they got into print relatively late \u2013 Hilary Mantel, Jim Crace and Irvine Welsh, for instance (just as Mohsin Hamid and Tom McCarthy are too old for inclusion this time round). A few have simply been overlooked: Edward St Aubyn, say. Readers will have their own gripes about exclusions and inclusions but,\u00a0overall, it&apos;s been a remarkably successful experiment. So it is with trepidation that I say: I&apos;m only half-convinced by the class of 2013. It&apos;s hard to take a position with much confidence. Reviewing Best of\u00a0Young British Novelists 4 is an impossible job, since you&apos;re assessing not just the excerpts and short stories in it, but the complete works of all 20\u00a0authors (and I\u00a0know at most half of\u00a0them in any detail). You&apos;re also evaluating them against any number of\u00a0youngish novelists who were not included: 150\u00a0writers were submitted by their publishers to Granta. The seven-strong panel \u2013 which included three Granta staff, two novelists (AL\u00a0Kennedy and Romesh Gunesekera), a current and a\u00a0former literary editor \u2013 then examined 50 writers in detail. To a certain extent, the selection keeps pace with what a general book-world consensus algorithm would dictate. Of course there&apos;s Smith, the undisputed international heavyweight of the UK under-40 category, here represented by a short story set in Greenwich Village in the 1950s. Probably next in line is Adam Foulds, author of a much-admired narrative poem about the Mau Mau, and The\u00a0Quickening Maze, a Man Booker-shortlisted historical novel featuring Tennyson, John Clare and an asylum in\u00a0Epping Forest. His piece here, an excerpt from a novel about the second world war, is sensitive, capable and intelligent. Ross Raisin is also a shoo-in, with two impressive novels,\u00a0particularly his debut God&apos;s Own Country, already under his belt \u2013\u00a0though he&apos;s perhaps not particularly well represented, with a slightly feverish flood story. Sarah Hall&apos;s inclusion is also no surprise \u2013 she&apos;s a stylish and versatile storyteller, who has submitted an intriguing extract about the &quot;rewilding&quot; of a large tract of Cumbria. Then there&apos;s Adam Thirlwell, like Smith a veteran of the 2003 list. Personally I dislike his work, but he is undoubtedly an interesting, innovative writer. And if he hasn&apos;t exactly made good on the supposed promise of his debut, Politics, which saw him cast as London&apos;s answer to Milan Kundera \u2013 well, there&apos;s plenty of time yet. Thirlwell&apos;s successor in the wunderkind category is Ned Beauman, one of only two listed writers still in their 20s. Beauman, the author of the ingenious genre-bending historical confections Boxer, Beetle and The Teleportation Accident, is talented, funny, clever and \u2013 I think it&apos;s fair to say \u2013 a massive show-off. His piece in\u00a0Granta, about drug producers in Burma, shows him working well in a less flashy style. Great things are also expected from David Szalay, author of the terrific telesales novel London and the South-East, who has written one of the best pieces in the anthology \u2013 in which a Hungarian heavy escorts a prostitute around London&apos;s hotels. Helen Oyeyemi was probably an obvious choice; she&apos;s a precocious fabulist who wrote her first novel, The\u00a0Icarus Girl, while still at school, and is a veteran of four novels at the ripe old age of 28. Another well-deserved entry is Benjamin Markovits, an Anglo-American best known for his much-admired Byron trilogy; I suspect his next novel, a move away from Eng Lit to rust-belt America, with a story about yuppies attempting to resettle a\u00a0section of Detroit, will be big. Also uncontroversial, at least on aesthetic grounds, is the inclusion of Kamila Shamsie, the Pakistani author of Burnt Shadows \u2013 who, if not yet British, is in\u00a0the process of becoming so. The glaring omission is Jon McGregor; I&apos;d take 10 pages of his excellent Even the Dogs, a bleak, spooky novel about homelessness and addiction in an unnamed British city, over most of the work collected here. I\u00a0felt his omission particularly, given the relentlessly globalised nature of this anthology. It&apos;s well known that British literary fiction seeks out the exotic, avoiding middle England in favour of\u00a0immigrant communities, the more exciting past and urban Scotland. But\u00a0the collection, I think, takes the tendency too far: less than half the pieces are set in Britain, and two of those are in apocalyptic variations thereof. Otherwise, it&apos;s building sites in Dubai, army camps in\u00a0Somalia, a\u00a0sheep station in the Australian outback, the streets of Ghana. No disrespect to any of these pieces, by Tahmima Anam, Nadifa Mohamed, Evie Wyld and Taiye Selasi respectively, which are well written and interesting (I was particularly pleased to discover Wyld and her novel After the Fire, a Still Small Voice). But only five of the stories in this anthology are set in modern-day Britain. This would be more understandable if we were experiencing a particularly boring period in our history; but it&apos;s generally agreed that we live in\u00a0interesting times. So Sunjeev Sahota\u00a0\u2013 a writer I&apos;d\u00a0never heard of\u00a0before \u2013 was both a\u00a0relief and a revelation. His &quot;Arrivals&quot; is\u00a0an excerpt\u00a0from a forthcoming novel about illegal Indian workers living in\u00a0a\u00a0shared house\u00a0in Leeds, and it&apos;s fascinating, like a 21st-century Ragged-Trousered Philanthropists. The panel was probably right to include Joanna Kavenna, an intermittently brilliant writer. But I don&apos;t think Naomi Alderman, Jenni Fagan, Steven Hall, or Xiaolu Guo have made any particularly compelling case for their inclusion, especially on the basis of what has been published here. To use a possibly random point of comparison, I would have preferred Joe Dunthorne over them any day, on the strength of his very funny debut Submarine, if not\u00a0his second novel. (And it would have\u00a0been nice to have a bit of rainy Swansea,\u00a0as well as Lausanne, China, New York,\u00a0Harvard etc.) The Granta list is designed as a cheerleading exercise, part of the apparatus of support that younger writers need to thrive. So what I&apos;m going to say probably counts as a heinous act of party-pooping: but Best\u00a0of Young British Novelists 4 doesn&apos;t, as a\u00a0whole, inspire about the future of\u00a0the British novel. It offers some exceptional writing, but mostly solid, old-fashioned storytelling or hit-and-miss, boil-in-the-bag postmodernism. If you look at the selections from 1983\u00a0onwards, you see a gradual but unmistakable tailing off of talent as the\u00a0decades progress. I&apos;m afraid that this list continues that trend.", "title": "Best of Young British Novelists 4, edited by John Freeman \u2013 review", "sentences": ["Otherwise, it&apos;s building sites in Dubai, army camps in\u00a0Somalia, a\u00a0sheep station in the Australian outback, the streets of Ghana."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-16T14:14:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/16/pervez-musharraf-banned-pakistan-elections", "tags": ["Pervez Musharraf", "Pakistan", "World news"], "article": "Pakistan&apos;s election officials have banned Pervez Musharraf from standing in next month&apos;s general elections, dealing a fatal blow to the former military dictator&apos;s hopes of re-entering public life in the country. The ex-president was disqualified from running in four separate constituencies after failing to meet constitutional requirements to protect the independence of the country&apos;s judiciary. Election officials have also disqualified Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, the man who until just a few weeks ago was the country&apos;s prime minister, under articles ensuring candidates are, among many other things, &quot;sagacious, righteous and non-profligate&quot;. The rulings highlight the muscle and assertiveness of Pakistan&apos;s election officials as the country heads towards historic polls on 11 May. And they are a personal disaster for Musharraf, whose decision to return to Pakistan last month after four years of staying abroad, beyond the reach of the country&apos;s courts, increasingly looks like an extraordinarily ill-advised mistake. The former general, who seized power in a coup in 1999, had hyped his return saying he would &quot;save&quot; Pakistan and sweep back to power. However, he was met by a feeble-sized crowd of supporters when he travelled by commercial flight from his home in exile in Dubai to Karachi. He remained holed up in a luxury hotel in the Pakistani port city for a few days, only venturing out with a heavy personal security detail. The risk to Musharraf&apos;s life had been highlighted earlier when the Taliban released an elaborate video claiming a specialist hit team of suicide bombers had been gathered with the express aim of assassinating the former general. Although he was granted bail before even returning to Pakistan, Musharraf is banned from leaving the country. In another misstep that appeared unlikely to win him much-needed support in a country where US drone strikes are detested, he admitted for the first time in an interview that he had struck a secret deal with the CIA, giving the US spy agency permission to use the unmanned aircraft in Pakistani skies. &quot;It is just very unfortunate that he didn&apos;t foresee the problems he was going to face, or take the advice of his well-wishers who warned him to stay away from Pakistan,&quot; said Talat Masood, a retired general who knows Musharraf well. &quot;But he was misguided and living under his own delusion that he still had a political future in Pakistan.&quot; Pakistan&apos;s top politicians try to improve their chances by contesting multiple seats. But Musharraf was ruled ineligible for four separate constituencies. He was ruled out on the basis of the sweeping and controversial articles 62 and 63 of Pakistan&apos;s constitution, which can ban candidates for low moral standing, insufficient knowledge of Islam and even for disrespecting an amorphous concept known as &quot;the ideology of Pakistan&quot;. Musharraf&apos;s standing in the eyes of returning officers was weakened by the extremely serious cases against him. He is accused of being involved in the assassination of the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and the killing of a tribal rebel from the southern province of Baluchistan called Akbar Bugti. But perhaps most fatal to his cause was the sacking of all of the country&apos;s top judges as his hold on power weakened in 2007. Although his nomination had originally been accepted for Chitral, a mountainous constituency where Musharraf is credited for building a tunnel and other bits of important local infrastructure, it was rejected on Tuesday. Officials objected to discrepancies between Musharraf&apos;s signature on different parts of his nomination paper and also because it was submitted by someone who was not authorised to do so. Musharraf vowed to take his case to appeal. &quot;The selection bias and unwarranted activism shown by the election tribunal in rejecting my nomination papers from all four constituencies is not going to deter my resolve to help save Pakistan,&quot; a statement issued by Musharraf&apos;s All Pakistan Muslim League said. The former prime minister Ashraf has also been ruled ineligible by an election tribunal. The politician, who served as premier in the dying months of the last government, was rejected on various grounds, including his alleged involvement in a scandal involving contracts awarded to private power companies. Several candidates have, however, successfully appealed against some rulings by election officials which have been attacked by some critics as overzealous enforcement of constitutional articles originally brought in by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq, one of the country&apos;s former dictators, and which had been largely ignored until recently.", "title": "Pervez Musharraf banned from standing in Pakistani elections", "sentences": ["However, he was met by a feeble-sized crowd of supporters when he travelled by commercial flight from his home in exile in Dubai to Karachi."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-16T16:46:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/17/boris-johnson-regret-london-eigtth-emirate", "tags": ["Boris Johnson", "London", "UK news", "Politics", "Dubai", "World news", "United Arab Emirates", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "The London mayor Boris Johnson has been in the Gulf looking for that most valuable of commodities in these times of tough credit and public spending: hard cash. Development finance, as with domestic mortgages, has been hard to come by in the last few years, even on the biggest projects, and the oil and trading wealth of the city states of Dubai and Abu Dhabi promises a gush of otherwise unattainable finance. Hence Johnson was reported to have jokingly described himself as the &quot;mayor of the eighth emirate&quot;. Such obvious bending over backwards raises a question about how good a deal he can get for London. Projects so far have illustrated the range of usefulness of money from the Gulf. Dubai has invested in a \u00a31.5bn major new deep-water port at London Gateway which will allow the largest deep sea container ships to dock in London. On the other hand, just up the river is the Emirates Airline, a \u00a360m cross-Thames cable car sponsored with \u00a336m from Dubai&apos;s flag carrier, and while it makes a great billboard for the Gulf state, passenger numbers have been running at less than half of capacity. Big projects with Qatar, not part of the UAE, but next stop on Johnson&apos;s Gulf tour, have had patchy success. Qatar&apos;s overflowing investment funds inflated by the gas that bubbles up from under the desert of the Gulf peninsula, have set up shop in Mayfair and have poured billions of pounds into London, buying up the Shard, the Olympic Village, the Chelsea Barracks site and Harrods among other assets. The Shard would not have been built without their cash, but a \u00a31bn investment in Chelsea Barracks, including a promised 123 affordable homes, has so far failed to bear fruit. Saudi investment in the tallest tower in the City of London \u2013 the Pinnacle, also known as the Helter Skelter \u2013 has also stalled. Work was stopped when just eight storeys of the core 66-storey tower was complete, and has yet to restart. These are the difficult cases, and the deflation in property markets is a major contributing factor, but so too is the distinct way in which Gulf money operates. A large part of the fascination in investing in London is its status as a safe haven for money that flows out of the ground in one of the least stable parts of the world. Investing for a return is not the priority in many cases, advisers to the Gulf states say. Security is king. More investment is to come from the UAE, promises Johnson, and while the UAE maintains a discrete diplomatic presence in London, the state visit of Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed al-Nahyan, the emir of Abu Dhabi and president of the UAE, could be the moment for announcements. Sheikh Khalifa is a huge figure in the Gulf and the wealth of his home emirate of Abu Dhabi is such that Dubai&apos;s tallest building, originally called Burj Dubai, was renamed Burj Khalifa, after Dubai was bailed out by its neighbour. Not everyone will appreciate the eighth emirate line. It will raise eyebrows among voters in London who might think the mayor has enough to do representing their interests, never mind those of the sheikhs.

The vehicle raced towards his purpose-built Mediterranean-style home in the plush Chak Shahzad suburb of Islamabad, creating conditions for a potential standoff between Musharraf and the government, which must decide whether to obey the arrest order.

Others speculated that Musharraf&apos;s luxury home, which boasts a swimming pool and jogging track, could be reclassified as a jail. Musharraf faces a number of serious court cases relating to his time in office, including accusations that he conspired to murder former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. The court hearing was in connection with his efforts in 2007 to cling to power, which he first grabbed through a military coup, by putting many of the country&apos;s senior judges under house arrest.     Police stand guard outside Musharraf's villa after the arrest order is issued. Photograph: Aamir Qureshi/AFP/Getty    His lawyers had secured pre-arrest bail for Musharraf last month, allowing him to fly to Karachi on 24 March without fear of arrest in order to &quot;save&quot; Pakistan. It was the first time he had set foot in his homeland after four years living in Dubai and London. However, on Thursday the Islamabad high court refused to extend that bail and ordered his arrest. Police were quick to block access routes to Musharraf&apos;s home. About 20 riot police guarded a barrier on the main road approaching the compound but only a few dozen Musharraf supporters and Pakistani journalists had gathered there. &quot;We do not accept the ruling of the court, they are just doing it to interfere with Pervez Musharraf&apos;s election campaign,&quot; said Haider Zeb Akhtar, an 18-year old political science student. &quot;The courts allow the terrorist parties to contest election, but not General Musharraf. Why?&quot;     Soldiers guard the court amid protests after the hearing. Photograph: Farooq Naeem/AFP/Getty    Musharraf&apos;s return and attempt to run for parliament in next month&apos;s general election has turned into a debacle. He has received little support from the public or any leading political parties that might have allied with his All Pakistan Muslim League. This week the country&apos;s election commission snuffed out his dream of a return to politics by banning him from running in elections in any of the four constituencies he hoped to contest. With some analysts speculating that the country&apos;s powerful military establishment will step in to protect Musharraf, a former army chief of staff, Human Rights Watch issued a statement demanding he face justice. &quot;General Musharraf&apos;s act today underscores his disregard for due legal process and indicates his assumption that as a former army chief and military dictator he can evade accountability for abuses,&quot; said Ali Dayan Hasan, the Pakistan director of the US-based group.

This is the first time in the history of Pakistan that the bail of a person has been rejected in a bailable offence. &quot;By such rulings the courts are exposing themselves, sending wrong signals to the world.

The high court judge Shaukat Aziz Siddiqui had barely finished reading out his denunciation of Musharraf when the former general fled the court. Musharraf appeared visibly shocked as Siddiqui said Musharraf should be &quot;taken into custody and dealt with in accordance with the law&quot;. Amid chaotic scenes in the small room, packed with lawyers \u2013 many of whom were standing directly in front of the judge&apos;s bench \u2013 Pakistan&apos;s former president stalked out of the building and was whisked directly to his fortified mansion on the edge of the capital. With no one apparently primed to arrest a man who returned to his homeland in March after four years of self-imposed exile, his bodyguards easily pushed their way through the many policemen milling around the court. The extraordinary getaway left Pakistanis wondering whether authorities would dare fulfil the court&apos;s orders to arrest a man who is still presumed to enjoy some protection from the military, an institution that has been somewhat weakened since Musharraf was its chief. Siddiqui had been considering a bail application in a case in which Musharraf is accused of illegally suspending and holding under house arrest senior judges during his desperate attempt to cling to power in 2007. The incident has made Musharraf, a 69-year-old former commando, into a hate figure among Pakistan&apos;s feisty legal profession, some of whom had gathered in large numbers outside the court and shouted in jubilation: &quot;Look who is running, Musharraf is running!&quot; In his written judgment, Siddiqui said Musharraf&apos;s short-lived attempt to usurp the power of judges in 2007 had spread &quot;alarm in the lawyers&apos; community and terror throughout Pakistan&quot;. He added: &quot;Moreover, this shameful act lowered the honour, prestige and status of the country in the eyes of the nations spread over the entire global face.&quot; On Thursday Pakistani TV stations replayed again and again the moment when a man who once enjoyed absolute power was bundled into a waiting armoured vehicle by his security team, some of whom stood on the car&apos;s running boards as it edged into the morning traffic. He was taken to his &quot;farmhouse&quot;, a purpose-built mansion in the expensive neighbourhood of Chak Shahzad that was supposed to serve as his retirement home, but which may yet be designated a &quot;sub jail&quot; where he could be kept under house arrest. In the hours after the court ruling, Musharraf remained unseen behind tall walls crowned with razor wire. A team of riot police clad in body armour quickly sealed off the road leading to his compound \u2013 a Mediterranean-style estate that boasts a swimming pool and jogging track. A few dozen well-wishers, mostly volunteers for his All Pakistan Muslim League \u2013 a political party Musharraf founded in 2010 \u2013 gathered outside. &quot;We do not accept the ruling of the court, they are just doing it to interfere with Pervez Musharraf&apos;s election campaign,&quot; said Haider Zeb Akhtar, an 18-year-old politics student standing at the gate. Musharraf had successfully avoided his judicial tormentors for the last four years, living in London and Dubai. He flew into Pakistan last month and announced plans to &quot;save&quot; the country only after his lawyers won him &quot;pre-arrest bail&quot; in the cases against him, ensuring that he could campaign for elections to be held on 11 May without being arrested. But it was always a risk given the antipathy of Pakistan&apos;s lawyers and the many cases against him. As well as Thursday&apos;s case, there are other ongoing attempts to privately prosecute him for allegedly conspiring to assassinate the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto and for killing a tribal separatist leader. Some analysts believe the arrest order puts the military establishment, in particular the army chief, General Ashfaq Kayani, in an awkward position. The army has been anxious not to be seen to be meddling in civilian matters but is also thought to be concerned not to create any precedent for former high-ranking soldiers being tried in civilian courts. &quot;Musharraf is not happy with Kayani because Musharraf knows all too well how powerful the army chief is,&quot; said Asad Munir, a retired brigadier. &quot;He knows that Kayani could have quietly told the judges that Musharraf was not be humiliated and hounded.&quot; Munir said that although Musharraf had made a disastrous error in returning to Pakistan, he had been justified in fleeing the court, not least because of the risk from the country&apos;s &quot;rowdy and violent&quot; lawyers. &quot;These rascal, hooligan judges are pandering to popular opinion in Punjab who want to see Musharraf behind bars,&quot; he said. One way out of the predicament could be the supreme court. Yesterday Musharraf&apos;s judges attempted to lodge an appeal but their paper work was rejected. They will try again on Friday. Aasia Ishaque, a spokeswoman for the All Pakistan Muslim League, said Musharraf was prepared to answer to the law, but that the high court in Islamabad was clearly biased against him. &quot;The order for him to be arrested is illegal so it is right for him to avoid arrest and go and seek legal remedy at the supreme court,&quot; she said. &quot;The media reports that say he fled from the court is completely untrue, the police themselves opened the gates to let his cavalcade leave.&quot; Even if the order is overruled by the supreme court, the episode caps a disastrous few weeks for Musharraf. His hopes of winning a seat in parliament were wrecked when the election commission ruled him ineligible to contest any of the four constituencies he had applied for. He also admitted in a television interview to having authorised some CIA drone strikes against terrorists whilst he was leader, a remarkably casual reversal of his country&apos;s longstanding public denials of any involvement in the hugely unpopular secret air campaigning in the restless border areas. But most of all a politician who is widely thought to have become bored and even lonely living abroad where he was increasingly seen as a man of merely historical interest, he has been ignored by his fellow countrymen. The media&apos;s election coverage has barely mentioned Musharraf&apos;s campaign, focusing instead on politicians that have greatly eclipsed Musharraf in importance. After hyping his return and boasting of his large number of Facebook followers, fewer than 2,000 people came to greet him when he landed in Karachi \u2013 a feeble turnout by Pakistani standards.", "title": "Musharraf flees court as police told to arrest him over 2007 sacking of judges", "sentences": ["Musharraf had successfully avoided his judicial tormentors for the last four years, living in London and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-18T20:38:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/19/pervez-musharraf-house-arrest-pakistan", "tags": ["Pervez Musharraf", "Pakistan", "World news", "War crimes", "Law"], "article": "Pakistan&apos;s former military dictator has been put under house arrest after a day of uncertainty over whether authorities would dare follow a court order to apprehend him.

In contrast to previous Granta groupings, only Zadie Smith has claims to prior headline act status. It is, too, unfair to judge the choice, without going back to all the novels that produced it. Still, reading back to back the vividly crafted excerpts and stories, you are struck by a few things: first, the writers are defiantly, almost perversely, global in their reference points \u2013 stories are set in the military training camps of Mogadishu, Somalia (Nadifa Mohamed) and sheep stations of western Australia (Evie Wyld); on the building sites of Dubai (Tahmima Anam) and in a Chinese refugee centre in Lausanne, Switzerland (Xiaolu Guo) \u2013 so you search, mostly in vain, for any sense of what it might be like to be young and in Britain at the moment. Second, no one, gay or straight, seems to have much interest in writing about sex anymore; and third, comic intent or mischief is, as in most fiction chosen by diligent committee, in perilously short supply (with Naomi Alderman&apos;s likable story about the prophet Elijah in Hendon, London, an honourable exception). The dominant tone is of poignant uprootedness, anxious displacement. I guess one test of such a collection is, of the writers you&apos;d never read, which made you immediately click on to an Amazon page, anxious to get hold what else they had published.

Eleven horses from a sample of 45 at the yard just outside Newmarket where he trains at least 150 thoroughbreds for Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s Godolphin operation have tested positive for anabolic steroids. These include Certify, an unbeaten Group One winner at two and a 6-1 chance for the 1,000 Guineas on 5 May, who has been scratched from the classic as a result. This was, Zarooni says, the result of a &quot;catastrophic error&quot; on his part, since &quot;because the horses involved were not racing at the time, I did not realise that what I was doing was in breach of the rules of racing.&quot; Even now, the afternoon after the night before, reaction to the news that one of the most high-profile trainers in Flat racing thought it acceptable to give drugs including stanozolol \u2013 Ben Johnson&apos;s body-pumper of choice \u2013 to his racehorses has not progressed too far beyond wide-eyed, open-mouthed, head-shaking astonishment. Godolphin&apos;s damage-limitation exercise is already under way \u2013 Zarooni&apos;s biog page on their website has already been deleted \u2013 but then, they had a head start, because the British Horseracing Authority alerted Zarooni and his employers to the results of their &quot;testing in training&quot; visit to Moulton Paddocks on 9 April. Most of us are still trying to grasp the idea that a man who had spent his entire working life around horses could make such a hideous and calamitous mistake. Since Zarooni is not disputing the results of the tests, it will be for the BHA&apos;s disciplinary committee to decide whether he is indeed guilty of the most dull-witted incompetence in turf history or whether he is willing to be damned for all time as the most inept trainer to hold a licence, because the alternative is even worse. The case against him, as so often, comes down to the question: cock-up or conspiracy? Is it, in essence, even faintly credible that anyone in charge of any training yard could be unaware that anabolic steroids, the most dangerous and insidious performance-enhancing drugs of them all \u2013 are banned under all circumstances? Zarooni had, after all, been found in breach of the anti-doping rules last year when two horses tested positive for the painkiller propoxyphene. Did it not occur to him that his yard might be under additional scrutiny as a result? But there are so many other questions too, crowding in from all sides, and some at least are the ones that may remain even when the disciplinary process is complete. Here are just a few. Assuming that Zarooni was not creeping around the yard after midnight with a rucksack full of syringes, who was helping him? Was a vet \u2013 who would fall outside the licensing authority of the BHA \u2013 involved, as was the case with Nicky Henderson and the Moonlit Path affair in 2009? And who was supplying the steroids for what was, even if it was inadvertent, such a significant doping programme? Where were the drugs stored and who knew that they were there? How many other horses have been given steroids at Moulton Paddocks since Zarooni took charge in 2010? Eleven from 45 implies perhaps two dozen more may have had a dose this year alone. And that is only the start. What about Encke, for instance, who denied Camelot the Triple Crown at Doncaster last September when tens of thousands of spectators and millions of TV viewers were aching for history to be made? Were they all duped by a doper too? Any Classic winner will be tested, so Encke must have been clean after the Leger. Yet anabolic steroids are such insidious substances that there is now a cloud of doubt over the entirety of Zarooni&apos;s relatively brief but very lucrative training career. What about Blue Bunting, surprise winner of the 2011 1,000 Guineas ? And what about Monterosso, another outsider, who won last year&apos;s Dubai World Cup? Was he even subject to a post-race test? Beyond this particular case, there are obvious questions for British racing too. If Zarooni was injecting horses with steroids, either in the belief that it was not against the rules or, alternatively, that he would not get caught, how many other trainers have, or are, labouring under the same misapprehension? Are there trainers, both in Newmarket and elsewhere, who are suspending their own &quot;medication&quot; programmes this morning, at least until the Zarooni case blows over? If there is a morsel of positivity to be drawn from this scandal, it is that the BHA has caught and charged Zarooni without any regard to his status in the sport or that of his employer, Sheikh Mohammed. The sheikh is the most significant racehorse owner that the sport has ever seen. His horses, and those of his family, have kept British racing on the road for decades and he is a long-standing member of the Jockey Club. Yet there has been no attempt to cover anything up, no: &quot;I say, old boy, had some rum results from that yard of yours in Newmarket, if you know what I mean. Might be time to move that Zarooni fella on.&quot; That, at least, suggests that any trainer with something to hide is now aware, too, that they are treading a fine line. And it is, of course, another crumb of relief that Certify tested positive for steroids a few weeks before the 1,000 Guineas, and not 24 hours after winning it. For now, the disciplinary process must be allowed to run its course, while Godolphin, which is estimated to have at least 300 horses stabled in Newmarket alone, will try to dampen the flames of scandal as best it can. But whatever the disciplinary panel decides when it hears Zarooni&apos;s case, whether it comes down in favour of conspiracy or cock-up, there is one more question to which we already know the answer: who on earth hired him in the first place? For Sheikh Mohammed, the news that some of his beloved racehorses, his sporting ambassadors to the rest of the world, have been receiving powerful performance-enhancing drugs is not just deeply embarrassing, it is also destabilising. He is the ruler of Dubai, born to lead, and absolute power demands absolute authority. Losing face, and with it respect, is the worst thing that can happen to an unelected ruler in a volatile part of the world, even a benign, successful and long-established one like the sheikh. Zarooni has lost the best job he will ever have and terminated his own career in racing, which will probably cost him millions in lost earnings from salary and prize money alone. His name will not appear again on the sport&apos;s roll of honour, and many will place a mental asterisk against M al-Zarooni where it appears already. But his disgrace has also betrayed the trust and support of Sheikh Mohammed, and let loose the idea that, maybe, the man who employed him might just be starting to lose his grip. That, in the final reckoning, may be the mistake that Mahmood al-Zarooni comes to regret most of all. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 April 2013 because the original described Sheikh Mohammed as the crown prince of Dubai.", "title": "So many questions for Godolphin to answer over steroids discovery", "sentences": ["And what about Monterosso, another outsider, who won last year&apos;s Dubai World Cup?", "He is the ruler of Dubai, born to lead, and absolute power demands absolute authority.", "\u2022 This article was amended on 25 April 2013 because the original described Sheikh Mohammed as the crown prince of Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-23T13:52:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/apr/23/influx-chinese-goldminers-tensions-ghana", "tags": ["Global development", "Ghana", "Mining", "Gold", "Migration and development", "China", "Mining", "Environment", "Business", "Africa", "Asia Pacific", "Natural resources and development"], "article": "     Huang Ren Zhong&apos;s striped parasol stands out against the muddy cliff of excavated earth. The horizon is fringed with the tall trees of the Ghanaian rainforest, but for Huang, this dilapidated shelter is his only shade from the sweltering tropical sun. He and his Chinese colleagues take turns to sit under it, overseeing the digging and churning of the murky water beneath them, where they are mining a huge pit for gold. Two years ago, Huang, 40, left his tea farm in China&apos;s Guangdong province to seek riches here in west Africa. Since then his work has been hot and arduous, and at times dangerous but, by his standards, the rewards are great. Huang says he makes about 4,000 yuan \u2013 \u00a3420 \u2013 a month. His salary is paid straight to his family in China, after the money he needs to live has been deducted. &quot;The work is difficult. [But] I came here to make money,&quot; said Huang. &quot;In China, I was average or poor. To have the opportunity to travel abroad [and] make more money is fantastic.&quot; Huang works in one of many illegal small-scale goldmines in Ghana, Africa&apos;s second largest gold producer. Ghana&apos;s minerals commission, which provides permits for small mines, has not authorised the site. Foreigners are banned from working in Ghana&apos;s small-scale mining industry, which was formalised in the 1980s to bring much-needed income to poor, rural communities. Figures for the scale of illegal mining are non-existent because the Ghanaian authorities struggle to address the problem. But 23% of Ghana&apos;s gold production is from small-scale mining. Some estimates calculate that 95% of all small-scale mining in Ghana is illegal. The authorities admit that the influx of Chinese miners and their wealthy backers is causing environmental destruction and social conflict on an unprecedented scale. The Chinese have invested millions of dollars in excavators and industrial equipment. &quot;The scale [of illegal mining in Ghana] is so vast it is difficult to actually quantify,&quot; said Brigadier General Daniel Mishio, chairman of Ghana&apos;s national security commission for lands and natural resources. &quot;Apart from the security threat that is posed by the weapons that [illegal miners] wield, we even also have issues of human security,&quot; he said. &quot;In certain areas, people don&apos;t even get clean drinking water, and in some areas you can see that most of the forest cover has been destroyed. This poses a very big danger to our future.&quot; The work is also risky: last week 17 people were killed at a mine in Kyekyiwere in central Ghana. Mishio leads a taskforce conducting raids on illegal mines. Last month 120 Chinese miners were arrested . Tensions in Ghana towards immigrants from China \u2013 Ghana&apos;s biggest trading partner \u2013 have led the president to reassure Chinese investors that the west African country remains keen to encourage economic co-operation. Both Beijing and Accra insist that there is no connection between the countries&apos; bilateral agreements, including a recent $3bn China Development Bank loan to Ghana, and the activities of illegal Chinese immigrants. But many blame Accra for failing to prevent the destruction of large swaths of land for illegal mining. &quot;In Ghana and elsewhere in Africa, small-scale mining is a strategic livelihood alternative for rural communities, and it contributes tremendously to the local economy,&quot; said Wilbert Brentum, from Solidaridad, which works to improve safety standards and ethical practices in goldmining. &quot;But we have a situation in Ghana now where there is more illegal small-scale mining than there is legal. This has magnified the environmental degradation and polluted so many of our water bodies. Because it has attracted more people into the small-scale mining sector, without protective equipment, fatalities are also on the increase.&quot; Research by one Ghanaian NGO found that 250 rivers in mining communities had been polluted by cyanide and heavy metals. This month the government expressed its concern about the rate at which water bodies were being contaminated. &quot;[This illegal mining] doesn&apos;t help us at all,&quot; said Kweku Gyaminah, 29, a witchdoctor in Manso Abodom, who makes over \u00a31,000 a week from trading gold mined by villagers \u2013 many of them children \u2013 on the fringes of the illegal Chinese-run mine where Huang works. &quot;Now all our drinking water is all polluted, the farms [are] all gone and we haven&apos;t had any benefit from that.&quot; Resentment towards foreigners is widespread. There are frequent attacks by Ghanaians against increasingly heavily armed Chinese miners. The Chinese are also accused of assaulting Ghanaians, whom they employ to operate their machinery. On the site where Huang and his colleagues work, the ground is littered with spent shotgun cartridges. &quot;We have the guns to defend ourselves from the locals,&quot; said Huang. Many of the Chinese guns are said to come from the police, a practice which one senior officer said was indicative of the widespread corruption fuelled by the influx of foreigners propped up by cash from illegally mining gold. &quot;The Chinese are armed [and] most of the time the guns are sold by policemen,&quot; said a senior police officer, speaking on condition of anonymity. There have been several high-profile cases of police corruption in relation to Chinese illegal mining recently. In early April five policemen were arrested for robbing a Chinese miner at gunpoint, after the incident was captured on CCTV. &quot;It is standard practice for small-scale miners who work illegally with foreigners to pay off the police,&quot; one Ghanaian mine owner said. &quot;We have a budget for the police and for the immigration authorities, and every month we pay them to leave us alone.&quot; &quot;Mining has corrupted the people,&quot; said the senior officer. &quot;Certain policemen take advantage and profit from these activities. Some prominent men in Ghana, too, are benefiting [and] some traditional rulers.&quot; There have been calls for the whole gold industry to be cleaned up. The government&apos;s precious minerals and marketing commission (PMMC), which buys gold produced in Ghana, told the Guardian it did not buy illegally mined gold. &quot;The PMMC only buys gold from small-scale miners who are Ghanaian nationals, which is in accordance with the mandate setting up the company,&quot; it said. But the Guardian filmed dozens of Chinese miners entering a PMMC-licensed agent in Dunkwa, a gold-producing centre in Ghana&apos;s central region, each leaving with plastic bags full of what looked like cash. Inside the shop, called &quot;IndoGhana Gold Agents&quot;, the Chinese handed over pieces of gold, which were weighed by staff and placed in a safe. The manager, Govinda Gupta, said he was unaware it was illegal for his company to buy gold from the Chinese, and that the company buys at least 5kg of gold every week, which it exports to India via Dubai. &quot;There should be more traceability in gold,&quot; said Brentum, who is part of a worldwide initiative to produce gold certified &quot;Fairtrade&quot; and &quot;Fairmined&quot; , and which aims to make 5% of all gold responsibly mined by 2025. While trade in precious minerals such as diamonds has undergone reforms in recent years to make their origins more transparent, the gold industry remains highly opaque. During refining, gold from different sources is mixed together so that it is impossible to trace. &quot;There is a growing market for ethical gold, and we foresee a time when all gold will have to be responsibly mined, which would ensure protection for the environment and people who work in mines,&quot; said Brentum. &quot;But if you look at the large-scale industrial mines, they are well aware of their environmental and health and safety obligations, and will have no problem catering to this market. Our concern is that the small-scale and artisanal miners will be left behind. &quot;Illegal mining is a blot on the image of all small-scale mining. It is the people working in rural communities in Ghana \u2013 the very people who were supposed to benefit from the legalisation of small-scale mining \u2013 who will suffer the most.&quot; Gold in Ghana Once named the Gold Coast, Ghana is famous for its gold production, which has been carried out by local people using artisanal techniques since at least the 15th century. Small-scale mining was legalised in 1989 under the military regime of Jerry John Rawlings to &quot;indigenise&quot; the industry for the benefit of Ghanaians. The law forbids non-citizens from engaging in small-scale mining. Ghana is the 10th largest gold producer in the world and the second largest in Africa, after South Africa. It produced 4.2m ounces last year, worth $1,668 per ounce. 23% of Ghana&apos;s gold exports come from small-scale mining. As many as 95% of small-scale mines in Ghana are believed to be illegal, many operated by Chinese nationals. \u2022 This article was amended on 23 April 2013.

The horses, trained by Zarooni at Moulton Paddocks just outside Newmarket, Suffolk, have been banned from competition after testing positive for anabolic steroids during an inspection of the stable by BHA investigators on 9 April. They include Certify, an unbeaten three-year-old filly, who would have been a leading contender for the 1,000 Guineas, one of Britain&apos;s five Classics, on 5 May but will now be forced to miss the race. Formal charges against Zarooni are due to be made Wednesday. Leading bookmakers including Ladbrokes, Coral and William Hill have agreed to refund bets placed on Certify prior to her ban from competition. Zarooni, 37, trains about 150 horses at Moulton Paddocks, all of which are owned by Godolphin, part of the bloodstock operation of Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai. The sheikh, whose passion for racing dates back to visits to Newmarket while studying at Cambridge in the 1960s, has invested hundreds of millions of pounds in Godolphin since its foundation in 1994, and seen its colours carried to success in dozens of significant races. Zarooni, who joined Godolphin as one of its two principal trainers in March 2010, has sent out the winners of two British Classics. Blue Bunting, a 16-1 chance, took the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket in May 2011, while Encke, another outsider at 25-1, won the St Leger at Doncaster in September 2012. He also trained Monterosso to win the Dubai World Cup, the most valuable event in the sport with a first prize of $6m (\u00a34m), in March 2012. Zarooni is all but certain to be banned from racing for several years when he appears before the BHA&apos;s disciplinary committee, probably within the next two weeks. The authority is keen to resolve the case quickly to remove uncertainty from betting markets, and Zarooni has admitted the administration of performance-enhancing drugs, saying it was a &quot;catastrophic error&quot; on his part. While punishment may be swift for Zarooni, however, the sense of astonishment, and even betrayal, that his actions have caused will persist in racing for many months to come. Positive tests for anabolic steroids after a horse has run in a race are all but unknown, although Howard Johnson, a leading National Hunt trainer, was banned from the sport in 2010 after evidence that steroids had been used in his stable emerged in paperwork found in his office. Steroids are still viewed as a constant and significant threat to racing&apos;s integrity, however, because the effects of their use, such as an increase in lean muscle mass, can persist after the substance has left the horse&apos;s system. In a sport in which results can be decided by a nose \u2013 about 1cm \u2013 the unfair advantage that a horse might gain could be worth many thousands of pounds. &quot;It is, without doubt, a performance-enhancing drug,&quot; said James Given, a vet who runs a racing yard in Yorkshire. &quot;It&apos;s not just active while the drug is in the body, and certainly many of these drugs will persist in the body for several months, but it&apos;s the effect on the muscle development beyond its natural capacity.&quot; In Newmarket, the centre of British Flat racing since King Charles II instituted regular race meetings in the 1660s, the anger at Zarooni&apos;s actions runs deep in the tight-knit racing community. &quot;It&apos;s just hideously disappointing,&quot; one resident of the town with close ties to a racing stable said on Tuesday. &quot;We&apos;ve just finished defending the Grand National, and now we&apos;ve got to defend ourselves against this. &quot;It&apos;s bad for the sport, it&apos;s bad for the horses and bad for those who play by the rules. It&apos;s cheating, but it&apos;s also sickening from the horse welfare perspective. We know what these things do to humans, and it&apos;s just not right, full stop.&quot; Zarooni&apos;s sole entry in a race in Britain on Tuesday was declared a non-runner a few hours before the race, but he has two horses entered to race at Wolverhampton and six possible runners \u2013 including a filly called Controversy \u2013 on Friday.", "title": "Horse-doping scandal rocks racing as trainer admits 'catastrophic error'", "sentences": ["Zarooni, 37, trains about 150 horses at Moulton Paddocks, all of which are owned by Godolphin, part of the bloodstock operation of Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai.", "He also trained Monterosso to win the Dubai World Cup, the most valuable event in the sport with a first prize of $6m (\u00a34m), in March 2012."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-23T19:18:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/apr/24/boston-terrorism-motives-us-violence", "tags": ["World news"], "article": "(updated below - Update II - Update III) News reports purporting to describe what Dzhokhar Tsarnaev told US interrogators should, for several reasons, be taken with a huge grain of salt. The sources for this information are anonymous, they work for the US government, the statements were obtained with no lawyer present and no Miranda warnings given, and Tsarnaev is &quot;grievously wounded&quot;, presumably quite medicated, and barely able to speak. That the motives for these attacks are still unclear has been acknowledged even by Alan Dershowitz last week (&quot;It&apos;s not even clear under the federal terrorism statute that this qualifies as an act of terrorism&quot;) and Jeffrey Goldberg on Friday (&quot;it is not yet clear, despite preliminary indications, that these men were, in fact, motivated by radical Islam&quot;).  Those caveats to the side, the reports about what motivated the Boston suspects are entirely unsurprising and, by now, quite familiar:  &quot;The two suspects in the Boston bombing that killed three and injured more than 260 were motivated by the US wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, officials told the Washington Post. &quot;Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, &apos;the 19-year-old suspect in the Boston Marathon bombings, has told interrogators that the American wars in Iraq and Afghanistan motivated him and his brother to carry out the attack,&apos; the Post writes, citing &apos;US officials familiar with the interviews.&apos;&quot;  In the last several years, there have been four other serious attempted or successful attacks on US soil by Muslims, and in every case, they emphatically all say the same thing: that they were motivated by the continuous, horrific violence brought by the US and its allies to the Muslim world - violence which routinely kills and oppresses innocent men, women and children: Attempted &quot;underwear bomber&quot; Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab upon pleading guilty:  &quot;I had an agreement with at least one person to attack the United States in retaliation for US support of Israel and in retaliation of the killing of innocent and civilian Muslim populations in Palestine, especially in the blockade of Gaza, and in retaliation for the killing of innocent and civilian Muslim populations in Yemen, Iraq, Somalia, Afghanistan and beyond, most of them women, children, and noncombatants.&quot;  Attempted Times Square bomber Faisal Shahzad, the first Pakistani-American involved in such a plot, upon pleading guilty:  &quot;If the United States does not get out of Iraq, Afghanistan and other countries controlled by Muslims, he said, &apos;we will be attacking US&apos;, adding that Americans &apos;only care about their people, but they don&apos;t care about the people elsewhere in the world when they die&apos; . . . . &quot;As soon as he was taken into custody May 3 at John F. Kennedy International Airport, onboard a flight to Dubai, the Pakistani-born Shahzad told agents that he was motivated by opposition to US policy in the Muslim world, officials said.&quot;  When he was asked by the federal judge presiding over his case how he could possibly have been willing to detonate bombs that would kill innocent children, he replied:  &quot;Well, the drone hits in Afghanistan and Iraq, they don&apos;t see children, they don&apos;t see anybody. They kill women, children, they kill everybody. It&apos;s a war, and in war, they kill people. They&apos;re killing all Muslims. . . . &quot;I am part of the answer to the US terrorizing the Muslim nations and the Muslim people. And, on behalf of that, I&apos;m avenging the attack. Living in the United States, Americans only care about their own people, but they don&apos;t care about the people elsewhere in the world when they die.&quot;  Emails and other communications obtained by the US document how Shahzad transformed from law-abiding, middle-class naturalized American into someone who felt compelled to engage in violence as a result of the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, drone attacks, Israeli violence against Palestinians and Muslims generally, Guantanamo and torture, at one point asking a friend: &quot;Can you tell me a way to save the oppressed? And a way to fight back when rockets are fired at us and Muslim blood flows?&quot; Attempted NYC subway bomber Najibullah Zazi, the first Afghan-American involved in such a plot, upon pleading guilty:  &quot;Your Honor, during the spring and summer of 2008, I conspired with others to travel to Afghanistan to join the Taliban and fight against the U.S. military and its allies. . . . During the training, Al Qaeda leaders asked us to return to the United States and conduct martyrdom operation. We agreed to this plan. I did so because of my feelings about what the United States was doing in Afghanistan.&quot;  Fort Hood shooter Nidal Hasan:  &quot;Part of his disenchantment was his deep and public opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, a stance shared by some medical colleagues but shaped for him by a growing religious fervor. The strands of religion and antiwar sentiment seemed to weave together in a PowerPoint presentation he made at Walter Reed in June 2007. . . . For a master&apos;s program in public health, Major Hasan gave another presentation to his environmental health class titled &apos;Why The War on Terror is a War on Islam.&apos;&quot;  Meanwhile, the American-Yemeni preacher accused (with no due process) of inspiring both Abdulmutallab and Hasan - Anwar al-Awalaki - was once considered such a moderate American Muslim imam that the Pentagon included him in post-9/11 events and the Washington Post invited him to write a column on Islam. But, by all accounts, he became increasingly radicalized in anti-American sentiment by the attack on Iraq and continuous killing of innocent Muslims by the US, including in Yemen. And, of course, Osama bin Laden, when justifying violence against Americans, cited US military bases in Saudi Arabia, US support for Israeli aggression against its neighbors, and the 1990s US sanctions regime that killed hundreds of thousands of Iraqi children, while Iranians who took over the US embassy in 1979 cited decades of brutal tyranny from the US-implanted-and-enabled Shah. It should go without saying that the issue here is causation, not justification or even fault. It is inherently unjustifiable to target innocent civilians with violence, no matter the cause (just as it is unjustifiable to recklessly kill civilians with violence). But it is nonetheless vital to understand why there are so many people who want to attack the US as opposed to, say, Peru, or South Africa, or Brazil, or Mexico, or Japan, or Portugal. It&apos;s vital for two separate reasons. First, some leading American opinion-makers love to delude themselves and mislead others into believing that the US is attacked despite the fact that it is peaceful, peace-loving, freedom-giving and innocent. As these myth-makers would have it, we don&apos;t bother anyone; we just mind our own business (except when we&apos;re helping and liberating everyone), so why would anyone possibly want to attack us?  With that deceitful premise in place, so many Americans, westerners, Christians and Jews love to run around insisting that the only real cause for Muslim attacks on the US is that the attackers have this primitive, brutal, savage, uncivilized religion (Islam) that makes them do it. Yesterday, Andrew Sullivan favorably cited Sam Harris as saying that &quot;Islamic doctrines ... still present huge problems for the emergence of a global civil society&quot; and then himself added: &quot;All religions contain elements of this kind of fanaticism. But Islam&apos;s fanatical side \u2013 from the Taliban to the Tsarnaevs \u2013 is more murderous than most.&quot;  These same people often love to accuse Muslims of being tribal without realizing the irony that what they are saying - Our Side is Superior and They are Inferior - is the ultimate expression of rank tribalism. They also don&apos;t seem ever to acknowledge the irony of Americans and westerners of all people accusing others of being uniquely prone to violence, militarism and aggression (Juan Cole yesterday, using indisputable statistics, utterly destroyed the claim that Muslims are uniquely violent, including by noting the massive body count piled up by predominantly Christian nations and the fact that &quot;murder rates in most of the Muslim world are very low compared to the United States&quot;).  As the attackers themselves make as clear as they can, it&apos;s not religious fanaticism but rather political grievance that motivates these attacks. Religious conviction may make them more willing to fight (as it does for many in the west), but the motive is anger over what is being done by the US and its allies to Muslims. Those who claim otherwise are essentially saying: gosh, these Muslims sure do have this strange, primitive, inscrutable religion whereby they seem to get angry when they&apos;re invaded, occupied, bombed, killed, and have dictators externally imposed on them. It&apos;s vital to understand this causal relationship simply in order to prevent patent, tribalistic, self-glorifying falsehoods from taking hold. Second, it&apos;s crucial to understand this causation because it&apos;s often asked &quot;what can we do to stop Terrorism?&quot; The answer is right in front of our faces: we could stop embracing the polices in that part of the world which fuel anti-American hatred and trigger the desire for vengeance and return violence. Yesterday at a Senate hearing on drones, a young Yemeni citizen whose village was bombed by US drones last week (despite the fact that the targets could easily have been arrested), Farea Al-Muslimi, testified. Al-Muslimi has always been pro-American in the extreme, having spent a year in the US due to a State Department award, but he was brilliant in explaining these key points:  &quot;Just six days ago, my village was struck by a drone, in an attack that terrified thousands of simple, poor farmers. The drone strike and its impact tore my heart, much as the tragic bombings in Boston last week tore your hearts and also mine. &quot;What radicals had previously failed to achieve in my village one drone strike accomplished in an instant: there is now an intense anger and growing hatred of America.&quot;  He added that anti-American hatred is now so high as a result of this drone strike that &quot;I personally don&apos;t even know if it is safe for me to go back to Wessab because I am someone who people in my village associate with America and its values.&quot; And he said that whereas he never knew any Yemenis who were sympathetic to al-Qaida before the drone attacks, now:  &quot;AQAP&apos;s power and influence has never been based on the number of members in its ranks. AQAP recruits and retains power through its ideology, which relies in large part on the Yemeni people believing that America is at war with them&quot; . . .  &quot;I have to say that the drone strikes and the targeted killing program have made my passion and mission in support of America almost impossible in Yemen. In some areas of Yemen, the anger against America that results from the strikes makes it dangerous for me to even acknowledge having visited America, much less testify how much my life changed thanks to the State Department scholarships. It&apos;s sometimes too dangerous to even admit that I have American friends.&quot;  He added that drone strikes in Yemen &quot;make people fear the US more than al-Qaida&quot;. There seems to be this pervasive belief in the US that we can invade, bomb, drone, kill, occupy, and tyrannize whomever we want, and that they will never respond. That isn&apos;t how human affairs function and it never has been. If you believe all that militarism and aggression are justified, then fine: make that argument. But don&apos;t walk around acting surprised and bewildered and confounded (why do they hate us??) when violence is brought to US soil as well. It&apos;s the inevitable outcome of these choices, and that&apos;s not because Islam is some sort of bizarre or intrinsically violent and uncivilized religion. It&apos;s because no group in the world is willing to sit by and be targeted with violence and aggression of that sort without also engaging in it (just look at the massive and ongoing violence unleashed by the US in response to a single one-day attack on its soil 12 years ago: imagine how Americans would react to a series of relentless attacks on US soil over the course of more than a decade, to say nothing of having their children put in prison indefinitely with no charges, tortured, kidnapped, and otherwise brutalized by a foreign power).  Being targeted with violence is a major cost of war and aggression. It&apos;s a reason not do it. If one consciously decides to incur that cost, then that&apos;s one thing. But pretending that this is all due to some primitive and irrational religious response and not our own actions is dangerously self-flattering and self-delusional. Just listen to what the people who are doing these attacks are saying about why they are doing them. Or listen to the people who live in the places devastated by US violence about the results. None of it is unclear, and it&apos;s long past time that we stop pretending that all this evidence does not exist. Dirty Wars Several weeks ago, I wrote about the soon-to-be-released film, &quot;Dirty Wars&quot;, that chronicles journalist Jeremy Scahill&apos;s investigation of US violence under President Obama in Yemen, Afghanistan, Somalia and elsewhere. That film makes many of the same points here (including the fact that many Yemenis never knew of any fellow citizens who were sympathetic to al-Qaida until the US began drone-bombing them with regularity). Scahill&apos;s book by the same title was just released yesterday and it is truly stunning and vital: easily the best account of covert US militarism under Obama. I highly recommend it. See Scahill here on Democracy Now yesterday discussing it, with a focus on Obama&apos;s killing of both Anwar Awlaki and, separately, his 16-year-son Abdulrahman in Yemen. He also discussed his book this week with MSNBC&apos;s Chris Hayes and Morning Joe (where he argued that Obama has made assassinations standard US policy).

Mahmood al-Zarooni, the trainer who was in charge of Moulton Paddocks, where a total of 15 horses are now known to have been given anabolic steroids to improve their strength and condition, is expected to be banned from the sport by the British Horseracing Authority&apos;s disciplinary panel on Thursday afternoon. There will be no runners from his former stable, however, until Sheikh Mohammed is satisfied that the yard is &quot;completely clean&quot;. Zarooni was employed by the Sheikh&apos;s Godolphin operation, the standard-bearer for his global bloodstock empire, to train about 150 horses at Moulton Paddocks. Another 150 Godolphin-owned horses are trained by Saeed bin Suroor at Godolphin Stables in the centre of Newmarket, about a mile from Moulton Paddocks. On Godolphin&apos;s website, Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai, said that he had been &quot;appalled and angered to learn that one of our stables in Newmarket has violated Godolphin&apos;s ethical standards and the rules of British racing&quot;. The Sheikh&apos;s statement continued: &quot;I have been involved in British horse racing for 30 years and have deep respect for its traditions and rules. I built my country based on the same solid principles. There can be no excuse for any deliberate violation. &quot;Godolphin is fully co-operating with the British Horseracing Authority to get to the bottom of this matter and take any appropriate disciplinary action. I have ordered the Godolphin management to undertake an immediate review of our internal procedures and controls to ensure to prevent any reoccurrence of this type of activity in any stables of mine. &quot;We will be locking down the Moulton Paddocks stables with immediate effect, and I have instructed that I want a full round of blood samples, and dope testing done on every single horse on that premises.&quot; It is unclear from the Sheikh&apos;s statement whether the results of the tests will be published, but it included a promise to the racing public &quot;that no horse will run from that yard this season until I have been absolutely assured by my team that the entire yard is completely clean&quot;, adding that Sheikh Mohammed had &quot;reiterated to all Godolphin employees that I will not tolerate this type of behaviour&quot;. Horses stabled at Moulton Paddocks include Certify, one of the favourites for the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket next month until she was banned from racing by the BHA following its discovery of the doping when 45 horses at the yard were tested on 9 April. Eleven tested positive for anabolic steroids, while Zarooni has since admitted that four other horses were receiving the same drugs. \u2022 This article was amended on 25 April 2013 because the original described Sheikh Mohammed as the crown prince of Dubai, and the caption misspelled sheikh as sheik.", "title": "Sheikh Mohammed 'locks down' Moulton Paddocks stable for doping tests", "sentences": ["On Godolphin&apos;s website, Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai, said that he had been &quot;appalled and angered to learn that one of our stables in Newmarket has violated Godolphin&apos;s ethical standards and the rules of British racing&quot;.", "\u2022 This article was amended on 25 April 2013 because the original described Sheikh Mohammed as the crown prince of Dubai, and the caption misspelled sheikh as sheik."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-24T19:56:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2013/apr/25/corrections-and-clarifications", "tags": [], "article": "\u2022 In an article exploring the facts behind popular misconceptions (10 myths debunked, 25 April, page 6, G2), a section that examined \u2013 and dismissed \u2013 the commonly made claim that the entire population of the world could fit on the Isle of Wight was correct in its conclusions.

Zarooni&apos;s defence at a disciplinary panel hearing into a total of 15 cases of doping his horses with anabolic steroids was that he had been unaware that the practice was banned. When asked if they believed him, however, Paul Bittar, the chief executive of the BHA, and Simon Crisford, the racing manager for the Godolphin bloodstock operation which employed him, simply replied: &quot;No.&quot; Zarooni also lied to a vet&apos;s assistant employed by Godolphin, according to Crisford, who said that the employee had injected substances into the horses because he had been ordered to do so by the trainer, without being told what was in the syringe. Two more Godolphin employees have also been named by Zarooni as parties to the doping, according to Crisford. Zarooni was the prime mover in the conspiracy, however, according to the BHA and Godolphin, and was described by Crisford as &quot;a reckless person who has shown no respect for racing&quot;. &quot;It&apos;s going to be a lengthy process [to restore faith in Godolphin],&quot; Crisford added, &quot;but all of our winners have been tested and they have all been tested clean. This is an isolated incident.&quot; Events have unfolded at dizzying speed since the BHA announced on Monday evening that 11 of Zarooni&apos;s horses had tested positive for one of two banned steroids, ethylestrenol and stanozolol. Zarooni is now a pariah in the sport that gave him a good living until less than a week ago, despite having trained two Classic winners and a winner of the Dubai World Cup in his three seasons with Godolphin. There was a distinct sense of a line being drawn under the affair on Thursday, as Crisford, who recommended Zarooni as a potential employee in March 2010, and three of the most senior executives at the BHA sat side by side. Bittar, though, insisted that the Authority&apos;s investigation of the case is not over and that inquiries will continue. &quot;All of the evidence suggests that what the trainer has told us is true and correct,&quot; Bittar said. &quot;We are clear that there are further steps for us to take in terms of Godolphin&apos;s procedures, processes and controls, but as far as charges and liability go, that liability is with the licence holder. &quot;I&apos;m certainly not saying it&apos;s the end of it \u2013 I would term it the end of the beginning in a way. It deals with the issues at hand and the 11 positive tests we had and where the liability sits, and it sits with the trainer. It&apos;s not fair to say end of it, far from it.&quot; One issue that the Zarooni case has laid bare is the significant differences between the doping rules in major racing jurisdictions, and that Britain&apos;s zero-tolerance approach is far from being the global standard. In Australia, for instance, steroids are routinely used to improve a horse&apos;s strength and general health, and are illegal only if they are still present in the system when it starts a race. Since the withdrawal time for ethylestrenol, for instance, is a few days at most, that means that horses can be administered with steroids until close to a race, and Zarooni&apos;s offence, which has seen him banned until 2021, would not even have merited a disciplinary inquiry in Australia. In Dubai, meanwhile, steroids can also be given to horses before they go into training but Crisford said that it was not felt necessary to stress to Zarooni that the use of such substances was not acceptable in Godolphin&apos;s British operation. &quot;I didn&apos;t tell him not to do it,&quot; Crisford said, &quot;because I didn&apos;t think for one minute that he would be doing it. It&apos;s his duty as a licensed trainer to take care of the horses under his care. You don&apos;t have to be a racehorse trainer in this country to know that anabolic steroids are completely outlawed; you don&apos;t need a trainers&apos; licence to know that.&quot; Crisford added that the unnamed vet&apos;s assistant who injected the steroids into Zarooni&apos;s horses was also one of the victims in the case, as he was forced to follow the trainer&apos;s orders even though he was unaware of what was being administered. The steroids, meanwhile, and in considerable quantity, had been imported from Dubai, which is of itself illegal. Godolphin will now continue the process of testing every horse at Zarooni&apos;s former yard, and will extend the testing to the yard in the centre of Newmarket where Saeed bin Suroor trains the other half of its string should the BHA request it. For the world&apos;s biggest bloodstock operation, the process of recovering from the worst scandal in its 20-year existence starts now, but the shadow of Mahmood al-Zarooni will be a difficult one to escape.", "title": "Paul Bittar pledges to get to bottom of the Godolphin steroids case", "sentences": ["Zarooni is now a pariah in the sport that gave him a good living until less than a week ago, despite having trained two Classic winners and a winner of the Dubai World Cup in his three seasons with Godolphin.", "In Dubai, meanwhile, steroids can also be given to horses before they go into training but Crisford said that it was not felt necessary to stress to Zarooni that the use of such substances was not acceptable in Godolphin&apos;s British operation.", "The steroids, meanwhile, and in considerable quantity, had been imported from Dubai, which is of itself illegal."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-25T20:11:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/25/mahmood-al-zarooni-trainer-questions", "tags": ["Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Horse racing", "Drugs in sport", "Godolphin", "British Horseracing Authority", "Sport"], "article": "As Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s spokesman, fielded questions about Mahmood al-Zarooni on Thursday, he found himself answering queries about another trainer banned for the use of anabolic steroids with whom Zarooni had a strong association. Before being hired as Godolphin&apos;s second trainer in Newmarket, Zarooni served as assistant in Dubai to Mubarak bin Shafya, who was banned from the separate sport of endurance racing in 2011 over the use of stanozolol, one of the steroids that Zarooni has admitted using. Crisford played down the significance of Shafya in Zarooni&apos;s racing education, saying that the latter had served 10 years under another trainer, Ali al-Raihe, compared with just one under Shafya. He pointed out that Shafya&apos;s case came after Zarooni had been hired, adding of Shafya: &quot;He didn&apos;t get banned from thoroughbred racing. I wouldn&apos;t have been aware of that.&quot; Pressed as to whether Shafya&apos;s case raised any concerns for Godolphin over Zarooni, Crisford said: &quot;What are you trying to imply? We didn&apos;t take it into consideration.&quot; Shafya was banned for two years by the International Equestrian Federation (FEI), the governing body for Olympic equestrian events as well as endurance racing after Castlebar Kadeen, a horse he trained, tested positive for stanozolol at an event in Abu Dhabi in November 2010. That suspension expired three months ago, though Shafya has still been able to train racehorses during the ban. Shafya&apos;s defence was that his vet had administered the steroid without his knowledge but the FEI held that he had taken inadequate steps to prevent such a thing happening. The FEI&apos;s tribunal also noted four previous cases in which Shafya&apos;s horses had tested positive for banned substances, which it described as &quot;alarming&quot; and indicative of &quot;a minimum of bad stable management&quot;, even while accepting that he could not be held responsible because of a difference in their rules at the time. Shafya is still best known in thoroughbred racing for his training feats at the Dubai Carnival of 2009, when he enjoyed a double-figure number of successes, crowned by two major victories for horses he trained on the night of the Dubai World Cup itself. Eastern Anthem scrambled home by a nose in the Dubai Sheema Classic, while Gladiatorus was rather more impressive in taking the Dubai Duty Free by three lengths, having made almost all the running. Both prizes were worth more than \u00a32m but neither horse was able to reproduce the form they showed that night. Both returned to Newmarket to be trained by Saeed bin Suroor, Godolphin&apos;s sole trainer in England at the time, but Eastern Anthem never won again, while Gladiatorus managed a single success in an Italian Group One from five subsequent starts. Neither horse has ever returned a positive test for any banned substance and nor has any Godolphin-owned racehorse to have passed through his hands. Two months after Shafya&apos;s memorable double on World Cup night, it was reported by the Daily Mail that he would &quot;shortly be arriving in Newmarket to train [endurance horses] for Sheikh Mohammed&quot;. The report said that Shafya would &quot;take over part of Godolphin&apos;s Moulton Paddocks estate&quot; for the purpose. Zarooni was appointed to take over those same stables at Moulton Paddocks the following year, for purely thoroughbred racing purposes. It is not known whether Shafya was still in residence at the time. Three years after Shafya&apos;s biggest night, Zarooni topped his achievements by landing the Dubai World Cup with Monterosso, who came home three lengths clear of a dozen rivals to land the \u00a33.8m prize. The horse plainly had problems thereafter, as he has run only twice since and been soundly beaten each time. Even so, he would count, at his peak, as among the best horses to have been trained by Zarooni during his brief career. Another would be Rewilding, who won the Sheema Classic in 2011 before outbattling So You Think in a thrilling Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes at Royal Ascot. The horse lost his life the following month when breaking a leg during Ascot&apos;s King George. Blue Bunting gave Zarooni an early high by landing the 1,000 Guineas in 2011 at odds of 16-1, flying home under Frankie Dettori to beat Together by three parts of a length. Only fourth in the Oaks under a moderate ride, Blue Bunting proved her Classic success was no fluke by following up in the Irish Oaks and the Yorkshire Oaks, closing her career with sixth place in the St Leger. Zarooni managed another Classic victory with Encke in last year&apos;s St Leger, this time at 25-1. The significance of that success was that it denied the runner-up, Camelot, the chance to be a rare Triple Crown winner, he having won the 2,000 Guineas and the Derby.

The ban means that he will not be able to enter a racecourse or training stable in any major racing country until April 2021. Zarooni left the hearing without comment shortly after the result had been announced. He had admitted administering anabolic steroids to a total of 15 horses at Moulton Paddocks, his stable just outside Newmarket, which he has run since being hired by Sheikh Mohammed of Dubai, the world&apos;s most significant racehorse owner, in March 2010. The eight-year ban effectively ends Zarooni&apos;s career in racing, after three seasons as one of the Godolphin operation&apos;s two principal trainers. In that time, he won two British Classics, the 1,000 Guineas and the St Leger, and had been expected to saddle Certify, one of the favourites for this year&apos;s 1,000 Guineas, at Newmarket on Sunday week. Certify was banned from racing by the BHA following the discovery that she had been doped with steroids. Zarooni&apos;s ban from the sport comes less than a week after the BHA published the results of its &quot;testing in training&quot; visit to the famous Moulton Paddocks stable. The authority&apos;s investigators tested 45 of Zarooni&apos;s horses, finding 11 which returned positive tests for either ethylestrenol or stanozolol, both banned anabolic steroids. Zarooni subsequently admitted to the authority that four more horses had also been administered with one of the two drugs. Paul Bittar, the chief executive of the BHA, said after the result of the hearing had been announced that it had been &quot;in the public interest, as well as that of the BHA and Godolphin, to progress the disciplinary procedures as quickly as possible&quot;. In a prepared statement, Bittar also acknowledged that &quot;it is recognised by all who follow our sport that the circumstances in this particular case are exceptional, not only on account of the profile of the owner in question, but also the number and calibre of the horses involved. However, we also believe the outcome is an endorsement for the effectiveness of British Racing&apos;s dope-testing programme. &quot;We believe that the eight-year disqualification issued to Mahmood al-Zarooni by the disciplinary panel, together with the six-month racing restriction placed on the horses in question by the BHA, will serve to reassure the public, and the sport&apos;s participants, that use of performance-enhancing substances in British racing will not be tolerated and that the sport has in place a robust and effective anti-doping and medication control programme.&quot; Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, read a statement on behalf of Zarooni following the conclusion of the case. &quot;First and foremost,&quot; the statement said: &quot;I would like to apologise to His Highness Sheikh Mohammed as well as all those involved at Godolphin and the public which follows British racing. &quot;I accept that it was my responsibility to know the rules regarding the use of prohibited substances in Britain. I can only apologise and repeat what I said in my statement earlier in the week.

Crisford&apos;s first interview since Zarooni was banned from the sport for eight years by the British Horseracing Authority on Thursday, which was recorded that evening, was broadcast by Channel 4 Racing on Friday afternoon. In the course of the interview, Crisford was directly asked by Nick Luck, the anchorman of the day&apos;s coverage, whether he was &quot;satisfied that Mahmood al-Zarooni was the only person within the Godolphin operation who set out to achieve performance enhancement through nefarious means, he was the only person with full knowledge of what he was doing?&quot; Crisford answered: &quot;We are in the process of undertaking a complete internal inquiry, and obviously we&apos;re having the external inquiry from the BHA as well and working alongside them. We will not have any more horses racing from that stable until we are completely satisfied that we have got to the bottom of this and that if there is anything else that we&apos;re not aware of at the present time that we flush out any, any bit of corruption from the core. It has to go, we have to know the truth and we will get to the bottom of it.&quot; Crisford is believed to have travelled to Dubai shortly after the conclusion of Thursday&apos;s hearing to discuss Godolphin&apos;s plans for discussions with Sheikh Mohammed, the operation&apos;s founder, on how the damage caused by the doping scandal can be repaired. The question of whether anyone else at Moulton Paddocks knew that Mahmood al-Zarooni was doping Godolphin&apos;s horses with steroids is one of many that still require an answer, even now that Zarooni himself has been tried and sentenced by the authorities. Some answers can be expected early next week, when the BHA is expected to publish the disciplinary panel&apos;s written reasons for its findings and penalty, which will reveal much of what the Authority itself knows about how and why Zarooni set out to cheat. Paul Bittar, the chief executive of the BHA, said at Sandown that the steroids had been used for a variety of reasons. &quot;He explained that, as is done in other jurisdictions, for some of the horses it was to overcome slight niggles or injuries,&quot; Bittar said, &quot;and with other horses, he just felt that they needed that type of boost. Based on his evidence, it was similar reasons to the reasons that he used it [steroids] in Dubai. He used it in a way that it&apos;s used in other jurisdictions.&quot; Sheikh Mohammed has stated that no horse will run from Moulton Paddocks until every animal in the yard has been tested clean, and the BHA has already started the process. &quot;We have our chief vet, Jenny Hall, and an assistant at Moulton Paddocks today, doing an inventory effectively,&quot; Bittar said. &quot;I&apos;ve spoken to the lab overnight to see the turnaround time on such a significant number of horses. We will need to do it in batches and will start those early next week.&quot; The testing is unlikely to provide any positives for ethylestrenol as the substance takes only a few days to leave a horse&apos;s system, but stanozolol can remain in the bloodstream for several weeks. Pending the results, Bittar is satisfied that the 15 horses named in the hearing are the only ones to have received steroids. Eleven of those tested positive from a sample of 45 horses when the BHA&apos;s investigators visited Moulton Paddocks on 9 April, while Zarooni himself told the ruling body that four more had also been administered with one of the two banned substances. The chance that 11 out of 15 doped horses could be found in such a relatively small sample is extremely remote. As a result, it seems likely that the BHA had at least some idea of which horses to test when they arrived at the yard. &quot;I take the point that we tested roughly 20% of the stable and it was roughly 25% of those [which proved positive],&quot; Bittar said. &quot;What I would say is that the evidence given to us by al-Zarooni was pretty clear in that he had a handwritten list of all the horses that he had treated with the drugs within the 45, and there were four additionals, as you know. &quot;We have quizzed him very extensively about whether there were any others treated with anything else, and he&apos;s given us a categorical undertaking that no is the answer to that.&quot;", "title": "Simon Crisford is interviewed over Godolphin doping scandal", "sentences": ["It has to go, we have to know the truth and we will get to the bottom of it.&quot; Crisford is believed to have travelled to Dubai shortly after the conclusion of Thursday&apos;s hearing to discuss Godolphin&apos;s plans for discussions with Sheikh Mohammed, the operation&apos;s founder, on how the damage caused by the doping scandal can be repaired.", "Based on his evidence, it was similar reasons to the reasons that he used it [steroids] in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-26T17:58:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/26/bha-drug-tests-goldolphin", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Godolphin", "Drugs in sport", "Paul Bittar"], "article": "The British Horseracing Authority has refused to divulge how many Godolphin horses have been tested for banned substances in the past two years, despite this week banning 15 of the stable&apos;s horses for six months and effectively casting the shamed trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni from the sport. While the BHA publishes figures showing how many raceday tests have been carried out in each calendar year, it said it would not break down the figures any further despite the shadow hanging over the world&apos;s biggest bloodstock operation. It is understood that Certify, the winter favourite for the 1,000 Guineas who was one of 15 horses banned, after being given anabolic steroids by Zarooni, was tested twice last year and was clean both times. The BHA also confirmed that both Godolphin yards in Newmarket \u2013 one under the aegis of Zarooni and the other under Saeed Bin Suroor \u2013 had been visited for &quot;in training&quot; testing in the past &quot;few years&quot; and no horses had tested positive. The sport&apos;s governing body also said it was unrealistic to expect the winner of every race to be tested \u2013 hence it was inevitable that not every Godolphin winner would have been tested during the past two years. &quot;We test horses from every race but not always the winner,&quot; said a BHA spokesman. &quot;What I can say is that the winner of every major race almost certainly would have been tested.&quot; The BHA&apos;s figures show that of 90,174 runners in 2012, it conducted 7,182 raceday tests \u2013 14 of which were positive. It has pointed to those figures as evidence that racing does not have an endemic problem. Yet only 600-700 out-of-competition tests were carried out in 2012 as part of the BHA&apos;s &quot;testing in training&quot; sampling programme. Again, it would not break down where these tests were targeted. &quot;There could be a number of reasons why a yard could be idenitified for testing in training but we do not disclose the strategy for this,&quot; said the BHA. In non-equine sport the direction of travel has been towards increased out-of-competition testing at short notice, leading to the development of the World Anti-Doping Agency&apos;s &quot;wherebouts&quot; programme. The BHA said it was too early to say whether or not its out-of-competition testing regime would be improved as a result of the scandal, pointing instead to the statement by Paul Bittar, its chief executive, in the wake of the ruling on Thursday that it would &quot;identify further areas for consideration&quot; to be incorporated into its sampling strategy. The BHA is now testing the remaining horses (around 150 in number) at Zarooni&apos;s Moulton Paddocks yard. However, the horses in Bin Suroor&apos;s stable, where the rest of Godolphin&apos;s 300-plus horses are trained, will not be tested. The case has highlighted the inconsistencies in the approach to drugs taken by the various racing jurisdictions around the world with the BHA&apos;s so-called &quot;zero tolerance&quot; stance, which bans the use of steroids in races and training, far from standard. As racing becomes more international, those inconsistencies are likely to be thrown into sharper relief and, unlike other sports, there is no global harmonised code. In Australia it is legal to use steroids in training and in Dubai it is legal to administer steroids before a horse goes into training. In the US steroids have been routinely used since the 1960s and they remain legal for use in training in most states. While Bittar&apos;s statement on Thursday said that the BHA would raise the issue again with its international counterparts, on Friday he said it was unlikely that Australia would change its rules and admitted that Britain was unlikely to do anything that would force it to do so. &quot;It&apos;s unlikely that will happen but even though the rules in Australia are different from Britain, and we might take a view that we&apos;re comfortable with our rules and they&apos;re the best in world, we have to respect that the way horses are trained and the way they are treated in their home jurisdictions is under the auspices of those rules,&quot; he said. &quot;If those horses come here, they will be drug-tested, either post-race or in the lead-up to the race, and the drugs may well have cleared the system. In that case it seems a slight anomaly but I don&apos;t think it would ever shift us to a position where we stop overseas horses coming in.&quot; A spokesman for Ascot, at the forefront of trying to encourage big-name horses from overseas to race in the UK over recent years, said it was &quot;becoming a massive issue&quot; and something the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities should put &quot;as a No1 priority for discussion&quot;. But he said the course would continue to try to attract horses from abroad. &quot;As long as everyone is operating within the rules, there is no reason not to encourage horses to travel,&quot; he said.", "title": "BHA will not break down 2012 drug test figures for Godolphin", "sentences": ["In Australia it is legal to use steroids in training and in Dubai it is legal to administer steroids before a horse goes into training."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-26T18:46:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/apr/27/talking-horses", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Horse racing tips", "Sport"], "article": "The feature handicap on the final day of the jumps season may come down to a match between the champion trainers of Britain and Ireland. Nicky Henderson, who is about to recover the crown he lost 25 years ago, has a fine chance with Hadrian&apos;s Approach but may be foiled by his Irish counterpart, Willie Mullins, who fields Away We Go (3.50). Hadrian&apos;s Approach has been a consistent force in the best company as a novice chaser this season and probably has more to offer at this marathon trip. But he is just 2lb below top weight, whereas Away We Go has rather more scope to be ahead of the handicapper with 13lb less to carry. Mullins has never won this race but Jack High and Church Island have given the Irish a couple of successes in the past decade from a handful of raiders. Like Jack High, Away We Go comes here in search of compensation after a narrow defeat in the Irish National and the chestnut gets to race off the same mark this time. His trainer is closing out the season in good form, having landed the Punchestown Gold Cup with Sir Des Champs this week while Blackstairmountain won him a huge pot in Japan a fortnight ago. Away We Go does not need soft going, as some of his rivals do. Balthazar King will appreciate the surface but had a very hard race in the Grand National, when he helped force a strong pace before fading into 15th. Saint Are and Becauseicouldntsee are others who are likely to be feeling the effect of their exertions in the National, though The Rainbow Hunter unseated at an early stage and may still have enough in him to have a cut at this prize. 2.05 Sandown A 9lb rise for his impressive Aintree win should not be enough to stop Minella Forfitness. 2.20 Ripon Dubai Dynamo returned to form at Thirsk last time and, even with an extra 4lb, he is still below his highest winning mark. 2.40 Sandown Finian&apos;s Rainbow is really tempting on a surface that should suit, unlike the bogs he faced in his first two starts this term. But he should have showed a little more last time and has a bit to prove now, whereas Oiseau De Nuit, a handicap winner at Aintree, comes here in the form of his life, the tongue tie appearing to have made a difference to him. 2.55 Ripon Mashaari is the winner of his only handicap so far, when he beat Cape Tribulation at York last October. Second in a Southwell bumper last month, he is still well treated. 3.15 Sandown Al Kazeem has shown most ability but comes from the Roger Charlton yard which has yet to hit its stride, so preference is for Sir Michael Stoute&apos;s Eagles Peak.

The poetry would be in the form of man-made islands, constructed by thousands of the indentured migrant workers who form the bulk of Dubai&apos;s population, and on which Premier League footballers and the like might be encouraged to buy ocean-front real estate. It was imagined that the lines, written in Arabic in concrete and sand, would be large enough to be read from space. In devising such a plan, you imagine that most world-class self-mythologisers might have been content with a single line of verse. It gives you a measure of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s exaggerated sense of Xanadu that he decided on a whole stanza. &quot;Take wisdom from the wise,&quot; the script would run. &quot;It takes a man of vision to write on water/ Not everyone who rides a horse is a jockey/ Great men rise to greater challenges.&quot; In the end, despite property on the planned islands being sold out in advance, this was one of the few wild schemes that was never realised in Dubai&apos;s decade of outrageous construction. Other ocean-and-desert-defying projects were made \u2013 the Palm Resort of frond peninsulas, the World, a mini globe of islands out at sea \u2013 not to mention the Burj Khalifa, the world&apos;s tallest building, and mile upon mile of gravity-mocking condos, hotels and office blocks. In that time, the joke has gone that only three words have been required to make overnight building miracles a steel and glass reality: &quot;Sheikh Mohammed says\u2026&quot; This development programme was just one aspect of the diminutive 63-year-old&apos;s singular drive toward world domination. At the same time as he was impressing the soaring power of the Maktoum bloodline on the Gulf skyline, he was taking an autocrat&apos;s obsession with hereditary principles to extremes in the world of thoroughbred racing, pursued with trademark determination on five continents. Every man needs a hobby. Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s has involved the creation of the largest and most expensive stable of fast horses in human history. In his own mind, the twin aspects of his brand, joint expression of his familial riches and power, have been intertwined. In his vision, Dubai, a place that now features the world&apos;s most opulent racecourse, the Meydan, built at a cost of $1.25bn in two years, has itself been sold as the ultimate winners&apos; enclosure for newly globalised wealth. Sooner or later, though, every myth-making dictator is met with a dose of reality. For Sheikh Mohammed, this came first with Dubai&apos;s post-credit crunch bust, which saw a collapse in property prices, a great many unfinished ego developments and the humiliating need for an up to $20bn bailout from &quot;Uncle Abu Dhabi&quot; in 2010, a debt still to be repaid. At the time, an authorised biography of the sheikh was due; the rumour goes that his refusal to countenance an epilogue detailing the lessons of his emirate&apos;s recession meant that the book never happened. And if the property slump marked the outer limit of his civic ambition, then the events of the last two weeks at the headquarters of his racing operation, Godolphin, in Newmarket, have been a defining moment in his private obsession, another line in the sand. The random dope testing of horses under control of his joint head trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni, which identified the widescale use of banned anabolic steroids, most notably in the sample of the top-rated two-year-old filly in Europe, Certify, has been a personal humiliation for Sheikh Mohammed. It was a measure of his shame at this exposure that he took the highly unusual step of including his apologetic statement about the events that led to al-Zarooni&apos;s ban from British racing for eight years on his official website, which generally is a spotless expression of his distinctive personality cult: poet, statesman, sportsman, visionary. In the statement, he once again explicitly linked his vision for Godolphin with his vision for Dubai: &quot;I was appalled and angered to learn that one of our stables has violated [the] ethical standards and the rules of British racing. I have been involved in British horse racing for 30 years and have deep respect for its traditions and rules. I built my country based on the same solid principles.&quot; The determined conviction behind that dubious latter assertion \u2013 Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s formidably stubborn personality has helped him to prevail as a sometime champion in gruelling horse endurance races over 10 or more hours \u2013 seems to have been derived in his own mind from twin formative influences. The first was that of his father, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al Maktoum, the shrewd initiator of modern Dubai, who saw that the comparatively limited oil wealth that drove development would quickly dry up and that the future had to be made from tourism and commerce. Rashid was, as he frequently said, only one generation removed from the camel-driving roots of his family and he inculcated his sons with those values: they grew up in a compound with no electricity or running water and were encouraged to be hardened horsemen and hunters. The contrasting pillar of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s wisdom was gained at what his website grandly terms &quot;the Bell School of Languages at Cambridge University&quot;, actually just an international language college, at which he gained his still slightly awkward grasp of English. It is claimed that his gift for literature arose in his years in the university town, but any reader of his poetry might guess that he spent much more of his time at Newmarket up the road; he saw his first 2,000 Guineas race in 1967 and was immediately hooked. In the years since, he has not so much sought to reconcile these influences as to pursue both avidly. At home, he is his father&apos;s son. He has 23 &quot;acknowledged&quot; children, mostly with his &quot;senior wife&quot;, Sheikha Hind bint Maktoum bin Juma al Maktoum, who lives in Jameel Palace and is never pictured in public. Despite the supreme decadence of his gold-plated, air-conditioned ambition for Dubai, built by armies of wretchedly paid workers from the Indian subcontinent, he likes to project himself as a simple soul: &quot;I need little from my world. My prayer mat and water bottle are in my car wherever I go, together with my work documents and my vision.&quot; He is haphazardly generous \u2013 the lifestyles of all United Arab Emiratis are richly subsidised; they pay no taxes and are awarded a share of the principality&apos;s wealth. Despite this, he argues with more complacent branches of the family for the virtues of meritocracy, education and hard work. His development plan was largely one of divide and rule; desert land was parcelled up for cousins and acolytes, with the implicit instruction to &quot;do something to make Sheikh Mohammed proud&quot;. Predictable insanity ensued. The other half of his life, his summers at the Godolphin operation he runs with his brother Hamdan in Newmarket and at the comparable facility in Lexington, Kentucky, or at the Darley stud with its outposts in Australia, Japan and Ireland, is on different terms. He spends most of it with his &quot;racing wife&quot;, Princess Haya, Oxford-educated daughter of the King of Jordan, with whom he has two young children, and who, as an Olympic show-jumper, shares his love of horses. That love runs deep. Racing broadcaster Brough Scott, a long-time acquaintance who helped the sheikh establish the Racing Post, believes he has been a fundamentally good thing for racing and hopes the current scandal will at least lead to established international standards of anti-doping legislation. Scott suggests the embarrassment was all the greater for Sheikh Mohammed since his trainer, al-Zarooni, was very much promoted as his protege. Even so, &quot;the benefits of his involvement in British racing outweigh any negatives enormously&quot;, Scott suggests. &quot;They have supported racing in a huge way, in terms of its employment, its economy.&quot; Thousands of residents of Lexington, Kentucky, whose mortgages have indirectly been paid, and children educated through the sheikh&apos;s largesse, would no doubt concur. Despite some suggestions that the scandal might tempt Sheikh Mohammed to retreat from the UK, off-the-record insiders suggest the opposite will be the case. He is nothing if not persistent. Anyone who believes otherwise might try the endurance test of his poetry, in which the race is always hard, as those verses that might have been written in the sea went on to suggest: &quot;At times even the wise and experienced\u00a0are tormented with bewilderment, fear and delusions/ Determined we moved along unwaveringly buoyant, riding the earth&apos;s saddle and steering its reins.&quot;", "title": "Sheikh Mohammed: the ruler with real horsepower | Observer profile", "sentences": ["A couple of years before he succeeded his brother as ruler of Dubai in 2006, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, never a man plagued by self-doubt, developed an idea to have some of his own poetry written on the sea of the Persian Gulf.", "The poetry would be in the form of man-made islands, constructed by thousands of the indentured migrant workers who form the bulk of Dubai&apos;s population, and on which Premier League footballers and the like might be encouraged to buy ocean-front real estate.", "&quot;It takes a man of vision to write on water/ Not everyone who rides a horse is a jockey/ Great men rise to greater challenges.&quot; In the end, despite property on the planned islands being sold out in advance, this was one of the few wild schemes that was never realised in Dubai&apos;s decade of outrageous construction.", "In his vision, Dubai, a place that now features the world&apos;s most opulent racecourse, the Meydan, built at a cost of $1.25bn in two years, has itself been sold as the ultimate winners&apos; enclosure for newly globalised wealth.", "For Sheikh Mohammed, this came first with Dubai&apos;s post-credit crunch bust, which saw a collapse in property prices, a great many unfinished ego developments and the humiliating need for an up to $20bn bailout from &quot;Uncle Abu Dhabi&quot; in 2010, a debt still to be repaid.", "In the statement, he once again explicitly linked his vision for Godolphin with his vision for Dubai: &quot;I was appalled and angered to learn that one of our stables has violated [the] ethical standards and the rules of British racing.", "The first was that of his father, Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed al Maktoum, the shrewd initiator of modern Dubai, who saw that the comparatively limited oil wealth that drove development would quickly dry up and that the future had to be made from tourism and commerce.", "Despite the supreme decadence of his gold-plated, air-conditioned ambition for Dubai, built by armies of wretchedly paid workers from the Indian subcontinent, he likes to project himself as a simple soul: &quot;I need little from my world."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-27T23:06:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/28/sajjhaa-saeed-bin-suroor-godolphin-horse-racing", "tags": ["Godolphin", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "     The Saeed bin Suroor trained Sajjhaa set out to lift a little of the gloom surrounding Godolphin when, in Sunday&apos;s \u00a31.2m Audemars Piguet Queen Elizabeth Cup in Hong Kong, she became the organisation&apos;s first runner in a major race since the Al Zarooni scandal broke.

The pace has slowed a little over the weekend, before the next significant event in the scandal \u2013 in terms of the official response to the scandal, at least \u2013 when the British Horseracing Authority publishes the reasons for its disciplinary panel&apos;s finding in the case, which is expected early this week. This will probably be as close as we get to a full, official account of what has happened at Moulton Paddocks over the last few weeks. The extraordinary speed with which the authority has moved against Zarooni suggests there may still be many gaps in the narrative and no end of questions to be answered but, until we have seen it, it seems unfair to follow one rush to judgment with another. One point that has already been well advertised, however, is the fact that Mahmood al-Zarooni&apos;s life is in ruins because of an offence which would not even merit a quiet word of warning in several parts of the racing world. America, Australia and even Dubai allow trainers to use anabolic steroids on racehorses so long as no trace of the drugs remains in a post-race test. As Paul Bittar, the BHA&apos;s Australian chief executive, put it on Friday: &quot;It&apos;s anomalous to me that in my own home country people take such a dim view of athletes using steroids but seem to think that it&apos;s OK for horses to be treated with them.&quot; American runners are a considerable rarity in this country but Australians have become a feature at Ascot in recent years. Mostly sprinters, the majority have been big, muscular sorts with powerful rear-ends, who look, and run, almost like a different breed from the European competition. Australia&apos;s tolerance of anabolic steroids in training is not news but the fact of it reaching the outside world certainly is, along with the willingness of top trainers such as Peter Moody not so much to defend what they do as to preach its benefits. As a result, it was not long before Ascot&apos;s formidable PR machine stirred into life. Nick Smith, the track&apos;s head of international racing, told Saturday&apos;s Racing Post that the last thing racing needed was a &quot;witch-hunt against prior champions who have come here or horses who come here in the future&quot;. Describing the Zarooni case as &quot;unfortunate&quot;, Smith almost acknowledged the elephant in the room, the one in the space-age Lycra travelling suit to keep her in condition when travelling. &quot;We&apos;ve just seen Black Caviar retire in a sea of adoration from around the world, not least from the media in this country,&quot; Smith said. &quot;Nothing has changed between all those horses winning and now. It would be disingenuous to try to link the two issues.&quot; It would also, of course, be dreadful PR for Ascot, the Queen&apos;s very own racecourse, which has spent a lot of money wooing the connections of top Australian horses in recent years with financial assistance and incentives to get them to Berkshire in June. If it is &quot;disingenuous&quot; to link Australian horses to anabolic steroids as a result of the Zarooni case, then attempting to carry on as if nothing has happened is worse. Royal Ascot is marketed as the most prestigious and competitive stage that Flat racing can offer \u2013 which is one reason why the Australians are so keen to take part \u2013 and the public buys tickets, and bets, on that basis. Now that the genie is out of the bottle, the very least that Ascot needs to do is to reassure the racing public that its competing horses are clean \u2013 if not from birth, then certainly from the moment they set foot on European soil and better still for a good six months before their race, which is the length of the BHA&apos;s ban on the 15 horses which Zarooni is known to have treated with steroids. Contenders for this year&apos;s Royal meeting from jurisdictions which do not follow Britain&apos;s zero-tolerance approach to anabolics should be tested \u2013 at Ascot&apos;s expense \u2013 as soon as the wheels on their plane hit the tarmac, and once a week after that until they set off for home. The gate revenue alone at Royal Ascot amounts to many millions of pounds. To continue to take money from racegoers when the track is well aware that some horses could have an unfair advantage is not just disingenuous; it is one step removed from fraud.", "title": "Ascot must reassure the public in wake of Mahmood al-Zarooni affair | Greg Wood", "sentences": ["America, Australia and even Dubai allow trainers to use anabolic steroids on racehorses so long as no trace of the drugs remains in a post-race test."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-28T21:45:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/29/pm-concern-torture-dubai-police", "tags": ["Dubai", "World news", "David Cameron", "Politics", "UK news", "United Arab Emirates", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "David Cameron has expressed concern over allegations that three British men were tortured by police in Dubai after their arrest on drugs charges and has pledged to raise their case during a visit to the UK this week by the president of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).

I can readily understand the need to polish the family silver to impress the visitors. The UAE is recognised as a valued investor in the UK, with Boris Johnson recently referring to himself as the &quot;mayor of the eighth emirate&quot;. After all, Dubai has invested in a \u00a31.5bn new deepwater port at London Gateway, while up the river, the \u00a336m Emirates Airline cable car carries Londoners across the Thames. The UAE is also a purchaser of expensive military hardware. In November last year, David Cameron led a delegation to the UAE to, among other things, persuade the Emiratis to purchase 60 British Typhoon aircraft. Human rights were to be discussed, the prime minister said. &quot;On human rights, there are no no-go areas in this relationship.&quot; Coincidentally, a trial going to the heart of the UAE&apos;s human rights record resumes in the Abu Dhabi on the very day of Sheikh Khalifa&apos;s visit. The 94 defendants face allegations of &quot;attempting to overthrow the government and undermine the establishment&quot;, an offence carrying a maximum sentence of 15 years&apos; imprisonment. They include royalty, judges, academics and, most worryingly, lawyers who have represented other dissidents in similar trials. On 4 March this year, I attempted to observe the first hearing of the trial. My delegation, led by Geoffrey Robertson QC, a human rights expert and former UN judge, was instructed by the Emirates Centre for Human Rights, an NGO in London. A report of our findings can be found here. Arrests began last summer. Suspects were detained in secret without access to their lawyers and families. Alarmingly, consistent accounts have emerged from the defendants of torture by beating, sleep deprivation and threats of sexual violence. A forced confession of one of the detainees was dramatically retracted in court. Some of the defendants belong to Al-Islah, a non-violent, Islamic organisation set up in 1974. They protest that their arrests were simply reprisals for petitioning Sheikh Khalifa in 2011 to introduce democratic elections and to grant parliament legislative powers. Critics of the president suggest that the trial is part of a purge against Al-Islah, whose requests for democratic change have become intolerable to an absolute monarch nervous about the pace of political change in a post-Arab spring Middle East. Lawyers in the case complain of the denial of proper access to both the defendants and the prosecution evidence they face. They allege the state is deliberately hampering the preparation of the defence of the detainees. The authorities do not seem keen to have the proceedings exposed to public scrutiny. The day before the trial, observers from Amnesty International were refused entry to the country without explanation. Abdullah Al-Haddidi, the son of one of the detainees was arrested on 22 March 2013 for tweeting about the proceedings; he has since been sentenced to 10 months&apos; imprisonment. My own attempt to observe the trial was unsuccessful. Our taxi was turned away at police roadblocks, and a subsequent attempt to approach the area on foot was stopped by armed police and state security officers. After a number of meetings with state officials from the ministry of justice and the supreme court, a formal procedure was set out for authorisation of international observers to attend the next hearing on 11 March 2013. I made an application and attended the supreme court on the morning of the hearing, to be informed that my application was refused; no further explanation was offered. To date, no foreign observers or press have been granted access to the trial. Sheikh Khalifa will meet David Cameron at Downing Street. In those discussions, it is to be hoped that the trial of the 94 detainees is not a &quot;no-go area&quot;.", "title": "The UAE's human rights record must be questioned on president's UK visit | Graeme Irvine", "sentences": ["After all, Dubai has invested in a \u00a31.5bn new deepwater port at London Gateway, while up the river, the \u00a336m Emirates Airline cable car carries Londoners across the Thames."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-29T09:52:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/29/dubai-jails-uk-trio-torture", "tags": ["Dubai", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "     Three British men in Dubai who claimed they were tortured in custody have been found guilty of possessing drugs and each sentenced to four years in prison.

It also remains essential that the UAE conduct an impartial investigation into these men&apos;s torture, and ensure it is never allowed to happen again.&quot; The Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) said the UAE had made a partial response to its own call for a full, independent and impartial inquiry into the torture allegations but concerns remained about the UAE approach. An FCO official said: &quot;The sentence is a matter for the UAE judicial system. We remain concerned by the allegations of mistreatment on arrest and continue to raise these with the UAE authorities. The FCO takes all allegations of mistreatment and torture extremely seriously, and acts with a sense of urgency in all cases.

The visit comes at a time when the government appears to be deepening the UK&apos;s special relationship with authoritarian Gulf states with poor human rights records but on which it relies for much of its energy supplies and more of its arms sales. Sheikh Khalifa will be welcomed at Windsor Castle days after three Britons in Dubai, part of the UAE, were found guilty of possessing drugs and sentenced to four years each in prison after, they say, they were tortured by police following their arrest, given electric shocks, and had guns held to their heads. The three Londoners said they signed documents in Arabic \u2013 a language none of them understands \u2013 following their arrests because they were forced to at the point of a gun. The visit also comes amid a warning that Britain could &quot;find itself very much on the fault line of searing sectarianism, between the Sunni and Shia worlds of Islam, that is increasingly defining the geopolitical landscape of Gulf and Middle Eastern security&quot;. The warning comes in a report, A Return to East of Suez?, published on Monday by the Royal United Services Institute, Rusi. The &quot;unintended consequences and outcomes of the UK&apos;s strategic embrace of Arab Gulf states should not be underestimated&quot;, it says. Britain&apos;s deepening military presence in the Gulf was signaled by General Sir David Richards, the chief of defence staff, in December last year when he spoke of British troops and strike aircraft based in the Gulf. Philip Hammond, the defence secretary, had recently signed a defence cooperation agreement with Bahrain which is already used as a UK naval base. A month before Richards spoke, in November 2012, David Cameron agreed &quot;a long-term defence partnership&quot; within the UAE and visited the Al-Minhad air base in Dubai with Emirati officials to inspect RAF Typhoon aircraft. The Rusi report notes that the RAF was using the air base as a &quot;logistics hub for the mission in Afghanistan&quot; and a place from British military assets &quot;could easily be redeployed to areas prone to conflict in the Middle East, Asia and Africa&quot;. The government, meanwhile, is trying to sell 60 Typhoon strike aircraft to the UAE, in a deal valued at some \u00a33bn (and sell a 40 more Typhoons to Saudi Arabia and Oman in a deal which could be worth a further \u00a33bn). The Rusi paper also points out that as the US is turning its attention towards Asia and the Pacific, Washington will welcome the British government&apos;s apparent decision to beef up its military presence in the Gulf. Further, it would enable Britain &quot;to play a more substantial role in India and Pakistan, and possibly also to intervene in the current situation in Syria, in any post-2014 crises in Afghanistan, or even in Iraq.&quot; But potential dangers lie ahead. After referring to Britain finding itself on the &quot;fault line of searing sectarianism&quot; the Rusi report adds: &quot;With Saudi Arabia, Bahrain and (to a lesser extent) Kuwait all contending with significant sectarian challenges to their internal security, and with Iran and Saudi Arabia engaged in what is so far a sectarian cold war in which the temperature could quite easily rise, the unintended consequences and outcomes of the UK&apos;s strategic embrace of Arab Gulf states should not be underestimated.&quot; Does the government know the potential pitfalls ahead? Monday&apos;s report warns there is a danger that the deployment of UK forces in the Gulf would be large enough to &quot;get us into trouble&quot; but too small to get us out of trouble once it starts. So what is the strategic purpose of the return to &quot;east of Suez&quot;? If it is to deter Iran, then it had to be &quot;underpinned by the ready availability of a credible and significant military force&quot;, the report says. If it is only to strengthen Britain&apos;s ties to the Arab Gulf states for a range of reasons including defence sales, trade and investment, then that should be admitted publicly. The British government should explain what its strategy is, and the motives behind it.", "title": "UK cuddles up to Gulf states - hidden dangers ahead", "sentences": ["Sheikh Khalifa will be welcomed at Windsor Castle days after three Britons in Dubai, part of the UAE, were found guilty of possessing drugs and sentenced to four years each in prison after, they say, they were tortured by police following their arrest, given electric shocks, and had guns held to their heads.", "A month before Richards spoke, in November 2012, David Cameron agreed &quot;a long-term defence partnership&quot; within the UAE and visited the Al-Minhad air base in Dubai with Emirati officials to inspect RAF Typhoon aircraft."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-29T16:19:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/29/assad-syrian-hackers-cyber-attacks", "tags": ["Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Cybercrime", "Internet", "Technology", "Hacking", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "The Guardian", "Newspapers & magazines", "National newspapers", "Newspapers", "Media", "UK news"], "article": "The Guardian has come under a cyber-attack from Syrian hackers who have targeted a series of western media organisations in an apparent effort to cause disruption and spread support for President Bashar al-Assad&apos;s regime. The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) claimed responsibility for the weekend Twitter attack on the Guardian, having previously targeted the BBC, France 24 TV, and National Public Radio in the United States. Other recent victims have included the broadcaster al-Jazeera, the government of Qatar, and Sepp Blatter, the president of football&apos;s governing body Fifa, whose Twitter account was hacked. Last week the SEA successfully attacked the Associated Press news agency, whose Twitter account was temporarily breached, allowing the group to send bogus messages which wreaked havoc on stock exchanges. The hackers tweeted that President Obama had been injured in a bomb attack at the White House, causing a temporary 143-point drop on the Dow Jones industrial average. Cybersecurity experts say the SEA attacks are designed to disrupt and embarrass, and the group will likely target any site that might give it an opportunity to spread propaganda for Assad. Analysts and western intelligence agencies are increasingly sure the SEA, which emerged two years ago, is essentially a proxy for an administration that has been widely condemned over its brutal efforts to quell an internal uprising. Though many of the SEA&apos;s victims appear to have been chosen randomly, the group appears to have prioritised western media organisations in recent weeks. &quot;The aim of the SEA is to generate publicity,&quot; said one analyst. Last month the SEA hacked into the Twitter accounts associated with BBC weather, BBC Arabic Online and BBC Radio Ulster accounts. Nine bogus tweets were broadcast in an hour, including some with anti-Israeli sentiments, and others saying &quot;Long Live Syria&quot;, and the &quot;Syrian Electronic Army Was Here&quot;. Guardian journalists have reported from inside Syria over the last two years, highlighting the terrible toll the civil war has had on the country&apos;s people, and atrocities blamed on the regime as it attempts to quell a rebellion. It also published a number of leaked emails from the Assads and their inner circle. Hours after the cyber-attack began, the SEA said it has targeted the Guardian for spreading &quot;lies and slander about Syria&quot; and said it was in a &quot;state of war with the security team of Twitter&quot;. The Guardian first recognised it was being targeted over the weekend when spoof emails were sent to staff encouraging them to click on links that could compromise some of the company&apos;s email and social media accounts. Later, several of the Guardian&apos;s Twitter feeds \u2013 including GuardianBooks, GuardianTravel and guardianfilm \u2013 were broken into. The technique is regarded as a classic, if crude, &quot;phishing&quot; attack \u2013 where individuals are tricked into giving away details that might allow hackers to gain access to sensitive information or allow them to control systems such as Twitter feeds. The attack was quickly identified and is in the process of being dealt with. The Guardian has since discovered the attack originated from Internet Protocol (IP) addresses within Syria. Syrian opposition activists say Assad&apos;s cousin Rami Makhlouf bankrolls the SEA, which recently moved from Syria to a secret office in Dubai. Makhlouf pays the pro-regime hackers for their activities, and they typically earn $500-$1,000 for a successful attack. They also get free accommodation and food. Sometimes Syrian government officials tell the SEA which western sites to hack; on other occasions the SEA selects its own targets. A Guardian News &amp; Media spokesperson said on Monday: &quot;We are aware that a number of Guardian Twitter accounts have been compromised and we are working actively to resolve this.&quot;", "title": "Pro-Assad Syrian hackers launching cyber-attacks on western media", "sentences": ["Syrian opposition activists say Assad&apos;s cousin Rami Makhlouf bankrolls the SEA, which recently moved from Syria to a secret office in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-29T18:18:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/apr/29/dubai-torture-claims-relatives-pardon", "tags": ["Dubai", "United Arab Emirates", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Torture", "Law", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "UK news"], "article": "The parents of one of the three British men jailed in Dubai on Monday for possession of synthetic cannabis after they said they had been tortured are confident the trio will be pardoned by the president of the United Arab Emirates, who begins a state visit to the UK on Tuesday.

David Cameron has promised to raise the case with Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan when they meet on Wednesday. The men, sentenced to four years each, say they also had guns held to their heads before signing documents in Arabic that they did not understand. Williams described having a towel put on his face by police and having electric shocks on his testicles, according to Reprieve, the human rights charity.

A Foreign Office spokesman said diplomats had received &quot;some details of a UAE investigation&quot; and were &quot;concerned about aspects of this and were formally raising these with the Emirati authorities&quot;. The UAE denies torturing the trio. Local lawyers for the convicted men, who were on holiday in Dubai in July last year when police found the drug in their car, have begun the process of requesting a pardon or commutation of sentence through the ruler&apos;s court. &quot;The sheikh won&apos;t want to be seen to cave in immediately to pressure but I am sure a deal will be done at some point,&quot; said a diplomatic source in the Emirates. In a country where possession of drugs can result in 25-year jail terms, the sentencing was considered relatively lenient by some observers, amid speculation it was modified in the light of the state visit. The UK government has made boosting inward investment from the UAE a strategic priority and last week the London mayor, Boris Johnson, described himself as &quot;mayor of the eighth emirate&quot; while on a trade mission to Dubai. &quot;I am very positive that all three boys will receive a pardon,&quot; Grant&apos;s mother, Tracey Cameron, told BBC Radio 5 Live. &quot;Each Ramadan, the UAE president does pardon detainees and we are very hopeful the three boys will be part of that pardon.

I feel there needs to be a full investigation. This is probably one case out of many and the government needs to be aware of the extremes of torture that goes on.&quot; Kate Higham, Reprieve&apos;s investigator, said: &quot;The central fact of this case remains that these men were tortured by police, but there has been no proper investigation into their abuse. The only reasonable course of action for the UAE authorities now is to grant them clemency.&quot; There is growing concern in the international legal community at how courts in the United Arab Emirates are allowing evidence obtained under torture. Rori Donaghy, campaign manager at the Emirates Centre for Human Rights, which operates from London, claimed torture was &quot;systematic in state security facilities&quot;, although it was rare for western prisoners to claim they had been tortured. He questioned how far the UK government would be willing to push the UAE over the issue given the desire to boost trade with the wealthy emirates. &quot;The UAE uses deals to protect themselves from challenges,&quot; he said. &quot;If Cameron was bold he would say to them that the path taken by other leaders overthrown in the Arab spring is the path they are taking now.&quot; Leading lawyers have also been highly critical of a trial of 94 defendants, including judges, lawyers, academics and student leaders, accused of plotting to overthrow the government. Ketil Lund, a commissioner of the International Commission of Jurists and a former supreme court judge in Norway, said the defendants had been subject to &quot;severe beatings, prolonged solitary confinement, sleep deprivation, exposure to extreme cold, the denial of necessary medical treatment, administration of hallucinogenic drugs, and prolonged interrogation (of up to five days)&quot;. He said: &quot;Instead of investigating these allegations, the UAE authorities are using coerced &apos;confessions&apos;, which result from such practices, as evidence against the defendants in court, and are going ahead with a trial that blatantly violates numerous international standards.&quot; Geoffrey Robertson QC led a delegation to observe the case last month but they were blocked from entering the court. &quot;The UAE authorities, if they are to avoid breaching universal human rights standards, must immediately open this trial up to international observation so justice can be seen to be done and it can be determined whether the long-detained defendants are dangerous, or whether they are being silenced merely for seeking political reforms in an undemocratic state,&quot; Robertson said.", "title": "Dubai torture claims: relatives hope for pardon of jailed Britons", "sentences": ["The parents of one of the three British men jailed in Dubai on Monday for possession of synthetic cannabis after they said they had been tortured are confident the trio will be pardoned by the president of the United Arab Emirates, who begins a state visit to the UK on Tuesday.", "Local lawyers for the convicted men, who were on holiday in Dubai in July last year when police found the drug in their car, have begun the process of requesting a pardon or commutation of sentence through the ruler&apos;s court.", "The UK government has made boosting inward investment from the UAE a strategic priority and last week the London mayor, Boris Johnson, described himself as &quot;mayor of the eighth emirate&quot; while on a trade mission to Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-29T18:46:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/apr/29/hacking-guardian-syria-background", "tags": ["Hacking", "Syria", "The Guardian", "Bashar al-Assad", "Technology", "Newspapers & magazines", "National newspapers", "Newspapers", "Media", "Middle East and North Africa", "UK news", "World news"], "article": "In recent weeks, the self-styled Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) has launched hacking attacks on the BBC, the Associated Press (AP) and most recently the Guardian. Last week the group succeeded in hijacking AP&apos;s main Twitter account, with 1.9 million followers. It falsely claimed that President Obama had been injured in an explosion. AP corrected the message, but not before $130bn had been briefly wiped off the value of stocks. Online pro-revolution activists have been one of the defining features of the ongoing Arab Spring. In Syria, opposition activists have played a crucial role in the struggle against President Bashar al-Assad. Over the past two years they have uploaded numerous videos of anti-Assad demonstrations to YouTube, posted gruesome footage of victims killed by government forces, and helped shape political perceptions in the west, as EU leaders inch towards arming Syria&apos;s moderate opposition. But unlike Tunisia, Egypt and Libya \u2013 whose former regimes were caught badly off guard \u2013 Assad&apos;s government has been fighting back. It has created an increasingly rambunctious group of counter-revolutionary hackers. These hackers have a twin function: to punish western news organisations seen as critical of Syria&apos;s regime, and to spread Damascus&apos;s alternative narrative.This says that the war in Syria isn&apos;t a popular uprising against a brutal, despotic family-military dynasty but rather an attempt by Islamist terrorists to turn Syria into a crazy al-Qaida fiefdom. The Syrian Electronic Army (SEA) sprang up in 2011 at the beginning of the anti-Assad revolution. According to defectors from inside its ranks, the group moved last year from Damascus to a secret base in Dubai. (Some pro-regime volunteers remain inside Syria, but they are at greater risk there of being unmasked and killed.) The Syrian government is widely believed to be behind the SEA&apos;s activities. In a speech to Damascus universityin 2011, Assad likened these anonymous online warriors to his frontline troops: &quot;The army consists of the brothers of every Syrian citizen \u2026 Young people have an important role to play at this stage, because they have proven themselves to be an active power. There is the electronic army, which has been a real army in virtual reality.&quot; Opposition activists claim Assad&apos;s billionaire cousin, Rami Makhlouf, bankrolls the SEA and masterminded its move out of Syria. The SEA now operates out of one of Makhlouf&apos;s shadowy Dubai companies, they add, citing information from a former SEA activist, who defected and is now in hiding. Makhlouf pays for food and accommodation. Pro-Assad activists earn around $500-$1,000 for high-profile attacks on western targets \u2013 a huge sum for most Syrians. The SEA mainly comprises Alawites from Assad&apos;s embattled minority Shia sect, but also includes Sunnis \u2013 most of whom back the opposition \u2013 and Christians. It receives sporadic technical assistance from Russia, Assad&apos;s key backer, opposition sources allege.Like their Syrian counterparts, Kremlin bloggers actively target Vladimir Putin&apos;s critics, with Russian hackers among the best in the world. &quot;There are a lot of [pro-regime] Syrian hackers inside Syria and outside Syria,&quot; Tareq al-Jaza&apos;eere, an opposition cyber-activist, said. &quot;The Syrian government gives them money to fight an electronic war against the rebels. They are doing hacks. They are doing social media. Their message is there is no revolution. They say there is a terrorist gang fighting the government.&quot; Al-Jaza&apos;eere added: &quot;The SEA sometimes works according to orders from Damascus. Sometimes they work on their own. They attack websites like the Guardian or the BBC because they don&apos;t want them to tell the truth.&quot; Asked which side was winning this noisy cyber-battle, he said: &quot;We are. The SEA are making fools of themselves.&quot; Analysts say the SEA&apos;s hacking attacks are crude but effective. The outfit&apos;s official website, hosted in Syria, boasts of its numerous successes and shows activists in military fatigues sitting in front of a bank of computers. Their faces are cropped out. It says that its hackers are organised into battalions, with names such as Wolf, the Pro and the Shadow. The site features two &quot;martyrs&quot;: young men in T-shirts and mirrored sunglasses who are said to have died for the regime&apos;s cause. It also links to pro-Assad Facebook pages. All the SEA attacks have been carried out via &quot;phishing&quot; emails which lure recipients into thinking that they are at the login site for their email, so that the hackers can capture email addresses and passwords. The phishing sites used against the Guardian were registered in Cyprus, though they pointed to a site in the US which &quot;hosts a whole load of malware&quot;, according to Rik Ferguson of the security company Trend Micro. Ferguson described the hackers&apos; work as &quot;&quot;very visible&quot; and commented: &quot;They aren&apos;t terrible at what they do, but you&apos;d have to say from their choice of targets \u2013 the GuardianBooks Twitter account, the BBC Weather account \u2013 that the hacks aren&apos;t serving any great purpose.&quot; Other accounts hacked include BBC Arabic Online, Deutsche Welle, France 24 and Human Rights Watch. The attacks differ sharply from those on the Washington Post and New York Times, where Chinese state-sponsored hackers silently broke into the systems in 2012 and monitored activities and connections within them for up to four months before being discovered. That is believed to have been done through documents carrying malware which infected specific users&apos; computers when clicked on. The SEA site says it fights &quot;fabricated news&quot; spread by the Arab and western media about what is happening in Syria. One member of the SEA told the website vice.com: &quot;We&apos;re all Syrian youths who each have our specialised computer skills, such as hacking and graphic design. Our mission is to defend our proud and beloved country Syria against a bloody media war that has been waged against her. The controlled media of certain countries continues to publish lies and fabricated news about Syria.&quot;", "title": "Syrian Electronic Army: Assad's cyber warriors", "sentences": ["According to defectors from inside its ranks, the group moved last year from Damascus to a secret base in Dubai.", "The SEA now operates out of one of Makhlouf&apos;s shadowy Dubai companies, they add, citing information from a former SEA activist, who defected and is now in hiding."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-30T11:12:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/30/women-sailors-oman-olympic-muscat", "tags": ["Sailing", "Tokyo Olympic Games 2020", "Oman", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Women", "Equality", "Gender", "Olympic Games"], "article": "Wave-Muscat, a property development in the northern quarters of the capital of Oman, sprawls over several kilometres, dotted with cranes, empty lots and housing estates. But on a wall near the entrance, someone has bravely painted: &quot;Open now&quot;. Oman Sail, a government organisation launched in 2008 to develop the sport in the sultanate, has its headquarters in the new marina adjoining this development. The venture is headed by Briton David Graham, assisted by 190 employees, mainly Omanis. Their objective is to attract women to a sport largely dominated by men. In February an all-women crew took part in Sailing Arabia The Tour 2013, the third edition of a race in the Arabian Gulf. The crew of six is led by the UK&apos;s Dee Caffari, a seasoned skipper. &quot;We all took part in the same scheme,&quot; says Raya al\u2011Habsi, 24, a business school graduate and one of the team. &quot;Before September 2011 we had never tried this sport, indeed barely even heard of it. To begin with my brothers used to come along to see what the training sessions involved. When they realised I was having fun and was physically up to the challenge, they became much more encouraging.&quot; It was the same for fellow crew member Tahira al-Yahyai, 21, an engineering student specialising in petrochemicals. &quot;It&apos;s a dangerous sport, not recommended for girls, my women friends warned me,&quot; she says. &quot;But, thanks to Allah, I made the right decision and didn&apos;t listen to them. Now they say: &apos;It&apos;s great, you mustn&apos;t stop now!&apos;. I like the competitive spirit at regattas, but above all I like battling against the men,&quot; she adds, adjusting her headscarf, then her make-up. For Caffari too, it has been an adventure. &quot;It&apos;s been an extraordinary experience with the girls, all starting in late 2011,&quot; she says. &quot;We are very different \u2013 background, religion, outlook \u2013 but we learn so much from one another. It&apos;s much more than just me being skipper: I&apos;m alternately their coach, their mother and their chaperone.&quot; Each member of the crew had to find their proper place on the 9.5-metre yacht. The headscarf worn by most of the young Muslim women soon proved a handicap. At the request of Oman Sail, clothing supplier Marinepool designed waterproofs with a built-in scarf. Nor was it particularly convenient on long races on the open sea to make a break for prayers. &quot;It has been an exciting adventure, but it&apos;s not all plain sailing,&quot; says the French skipper Sidney Gavignet, who has been involved in ocean racing at Oman Sail for the past three years. He trains men on monohull vessels and the MOD 70, a 21-metre trimaran, and like Caffari he has to cope with some unusual situations. &quot;One of my crew has two wives and eight children, which makes for a very busy family life. It doesn&apos;t leave much time for sailing,&quot; Gavignet admits. &quot;But even so the sultanate has made amazing progress over the past three years.&quot; In a country where more than 40% of the population is under 15, Oman Sail is proud to have already introduced 10,000 young people to sailing. The organisation, which operates from three marinas \u2013 Bandar al-Rowdha, Wave-Muscat and Mussanah \u2013 is now supervising the construction of a fourth centre at Sur. The new amenity, costing around $1.5m, is scheduled to open in December. Other locations feature in the strategic plan Graham has framed for 2016-20: Khasab and Sohar, in the north of Oman, Duqm and Salalah in the south. Preparing for a gradual decline in oil revenue, which currently accounts for two-thirds of the sultanate&apos;s GDP, the authorities are keen to develop tourism, capitalising on two key assets: an almost untouched coastline 1,700km long; and a good climate from October to April (after which the temperature can touch 50C). The choice of 2020 as a deadline is a deliberate one. If the government&apos;s Vision 2020 plan achieves its goals, 12 million tourists a year (compared with 2 million now) will visit this peaceful state, ruled for the past 43 years by Sultan Qaboos Bin Said. It will also be an Olympic year, after 2016 in Rio de Janeiro, and Oman hopes its crews will qualify for the dinghy and wind-surfing events, a stepping stone on the way to its first medals in 2024. &quot;Many Omani men and women are training hard to become tomorrow&apos;s Olympic champions. We want to restore the tradition of Sinbad the sailor,&quot; says an enthusiastic undersecretary for tourism, Maitha Bint Saif al-Mahrouqi. A nice idea, but the motivation of Muscat youth can hardly compare with the determination of the legendary character who set out to make his fortune on the high seas between Asia and Africa. &quot;I want to win prizes, bring honour to my country and family, even if I know I still have a lot to learn,&quot; says Yahyai. &quot;We want to accomplish something, tell the women of the sultanate and neighbouring countries: &apos;You too can succeed in sport if you have the will to do so&apos;,&quot; says Intisar al-Toobi, 23, a PE graduate. To meet its medals target, Oman is counting on a core group of budding women sailors, but also on a very thorough talent-spotting system. Bandar al-Rowdha is a sort of testbench for this process. Set in a bay south of Muscat, hemmed in by ochre cliffs, the marina is an ideal site for the &quot;happy sailing&quot; that the head of the youth and women&apos;s sailing department, Marina Psichogiou, favours. &quot;It&apos;s never cold, there&apos;s always a breeze, though maybe not a steady wind, and the coastline is splendid,&quot; she says. Nobody minds if the premises \u2013 four containers protected from the sun by a large tarpaulin \u2013 look a bit shoddy compared with the British ambassador&apos;s official residence nearby. What counts is what happens on the water. All Muscat&apos;s schoolchildren will be treated to two hours&apos; sailing a week, spread over five weeks, enough to pick up the basics. After an introduction to the theory, boys and girls over eight grapple with dinghies supervised by Omani instructors. At the end of this community programme, the keenest cadets can join the youth club free of charge and carry on training. Those who do best are then urged to move on to the third stage of the process, at the marina&apos;s racing club, taking part in weekly competitions to bring out future talent. &quot;The youth club is already operating here, and in September another one will open at the Wave. We are allowing seven years to get the whole scheme operational,&quot; Psichogiou says. &quot;One day a week the club will be reserved for young women, so they&apos;re not over-intimidated and to reassure their families.&quot; &quot;In Athens it would have taken me about 10 years to find the funds for this project. Here, you just have to ask,&quot; she adds, looking back on 15 years with the Greek Olympic sailing squad. The government covers 70% of Oman Sail&apos;s budget, with the rest coming from sponsorship. But the organisation needs time to complete the &quot;cultural revolution&quot; it started two years ago. &quot;What I see of the mindset here reminds me of what my grandmother told me after the war,&quot; Psichogiou asserts. But the sultanate&apos;s plan for women&apos;s sailing seems almost certain to upset the image of a pious, devoted wife spending much of her time at home. &quot;Oman is more open-minded than its neighbours on the issue of male-female equality,&quot; says Oman Sail&apos;s head of marketing, Salma al-Hashmi. &quot;It was the first country in the region to appoint a woman prime minister [...] We have a visionary leader who has no qualms about giving ministerial portfolios \u2013 tourism, secondary and higher education \u2013 to women,&quot; she adds. &quot;Our links with India and Zanzibar no doubt explain this openness. I can walk around the town without my scarf, drive a car on my own, dine in a restaurant without my husband and no one ticks me off.&quot; Over and above the targets set for the programme itself, allowing women to take part in sailing sends a powerful signal to young Omanis longing for greater freedom. The effects of the Arab spring have been felt even here. More than 5,000 demonstrators took to the streets of Muscat and Salalah in 2011, an impressive turnout for a country with a population of only 2.7 million. It is also sending a signal to other countries in the Middle East. &quot;In a region where Dubai and Abu Dhabi put the emphasis on the marketing side of sport Oman has a more political message,&quot; suggests Betrand Pac\u00e9, winner of Sailing Arabia The Tour 2013 at the helm of a Dubai yacht. &quot;We aren&apos;t aiming to become a model for neighbouring countries,&quot; Graham says. &quot;But if we want to achieve an international level in the coming years the whole of the Middle East will need to get involved.&quot; Graham is reluctant to draw any hasty conclusions about women&apos;s sailing: &quot;The women we&apos;re talking about now represent a tiny proportion of the Omani community. It&apos;s all very tentative.&quot; But Yahyai, Habsi, Toobi and the rest of the crew are too busy for such concerns. In March they competed in the Spi Ouest France regatta in Brittany, France. The future of sailing in Oman is wide open, subject to the uncertainty that weighs on any seafaring venture, as Sinbad found out. \u2022 This article appeared in Guardian Weekly, which incorporates material from Le Monde", "title": "Oman's women set sail for Olympics", "sentences": ["&quot;In a region where Dubai and Abu Dhabi put the emphasis on the marketing side of sport Oman has a more political message,&quot; suggests Betrand Pac\u00e9, winner of Sailing Arabia The Tour 2013 at the helm of a Dubai yacht."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-30T13:01:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/30/mahmood-al-zarooni-steroids-godolphin", "tags": ["Godolphin", "British Horseracing Authority", "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Drugs in sport", "Sport"], "article": "Mahmood al-Zarooni, who was banned from racing for eight years after giving 15 horses in his Godolphin stable anabolic steroids, brought the drugs to his Newmarket yard in his luggage when returning from Dubai in March. The information is contained in a report on the full results and reasons of the case published on Tuesday by the British Horseracing Authority. Zarooni informed the BHA at a disciplinary hearing held last week that he gave five unmarked syringes which contained Stanasol to an unqualified veterinary assistant, Sharif Mahboob, and asked him to give the drugs to five horses. The report records: &quot;[Al-Zarooni] then drove to Moulton Paddocks Stables and passed the syringes out of his car window to an unqualified veterinary assistant, Sharif Mahboob, and asked him to give the drugs to [the] horses which he listed on a piece of paper.&quot; The five horses named were under veterinary care with regards to musculoskeletal problems or, in one case, colic at the time they were given the banned substances. Zarooni told the disciplinary panel that he thought the drugs &quot;would help improve the horses&apos; conditions&quot;. Zarooni said the other horses involved had Ethylestrenol administered via a paste in their daily feed to stimulate their appetite. The ex-trainer, whose long ban began last Thursday, told the panel that in Dubai, where he had been an assistant trainer before being recruited by Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s Godolphin operation, anabolic steroids are given to horses in training but that they are not allowed to race for 28 days after the drug is administered. Zarooni stated the drugs had been given during a period dated from 14 March to 7 April. The BHA arrived for their unannounced testing visit on 9 April. Zarooni and Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, Simon Crisford, subsequently attended a meeting with the BHA on 16 April following the initial 11 positive tests. At that interview, Zarooni produced the box of Nitrotain which was the source of the Ethylestrenol he had used and handed it over. He told the panel he had no more stock of Stanasol left. The BHA report states: &quot;Al-Zarooni explained at [the] interview that his knowledge of the drug came from working in Dubai where use of anabolic steroids in training is permitted. He told the investigating officer that he thought the drug could be used if the horse was not racing. Al-Zarooni confirmed that he had not recorded the administration of any of the anabolic steroids in the stable&apos;s medication books. He could offer no explanation for this omission.&quot; The authors of the report conclude: &quot;The conduct of high profile trainers is keenly watched by all stakeholders in the sport. al-Zarooni administered anabolic steroids to a significant number of horses in training. This is a very serious departure from the proper governance standards expected in horse racing. The panel consider that al-Zarooni&apos;s actions have damaged the reputation of British racing. The gravity of al-Zarooni&apos;s breach means that the appropriate penalty must be at the upper end of the range.&quot;", "title": "Mahmood al-Zarooni brought steroids in Godolphin case back from Dubai", "sentences": ["Mahmood al-Zarooni, who was banned from racing for eight years after giving 15 horses in his Godolphin stable anabolic steroids, brought the drugs to his Newmarket yard in his luggage when returning from Dubai in March.", "The ex-trainer, whose long ban began last Thursday, told the panel that in Dubai, where he had been an assistant trainer before being recruited by Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s Godolphin operation, anabolic steroids are given to horses in training but that they are not allowed to race for 28 days after the drug is administered.", "The BHA report states: &quot;Al-Zarooni explained at [the] interview that his knowledge of the drug came from working in Dubai where use of anabolic steroids in training is permitted."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-30T13:07:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/apr/30/mahmood-al-zarooni-steroids-doping-case", "tags": ["Godolphin", "British Horseracing Authority", "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Drugs in sport", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Thursday 14 March must now be regarded as one of the blackest days in the history of British horse racing. As we already knew, that was the day when J T McNamara broke his neck and was paralysed at the Cheltenham Festival; now we are told it was also the day when, 120 miles to the east, Mahmood al-Zarooni, below, began using anabolic steroids at his Newmarket stables, a disastrous moment that has done much to undermine the sport&apos;s credibility and popular appeal. The infamous occasion is described in a document issued on Tuesday by the British Horseracing Authority, which contains the full reasons of its disciplinary panel for the eight-year worldwide training ban which it gave to Zarooni last week. By the trainer&apos;s account, he had brought the steroids to Britain in his luggage on a flight from Dubai, where it is permissible to use them on racehorses in training. The panel report that, on 14 March, Zarooni made up five unmarked syringes with 4ml of Stanasol, which contains stanozolol, and then drove to Moulton Paddocks, the stable on Newmarket&apos;s eastern edge where he has trained for Godolphin since 2010. There, he &quot;passed the syringes out of his car window to an unqualified veterinary assistant, Sharif Mahboob, and asked him to give the drugs to five horses which he listed on a piece of paper&quot;. It is a dismal scene to imagine, the internationally famous and successful trainer of racehorses prevailing on a junior staff member to do his dirty work. No further detail is offered on the involvement of the previously unknown and seemingly unfortunate Mahboob but the BHA&apos;s investigation continues. Followers of the sport will cringe at the idea that stable staff are so biddable as to jab their charges with unidentified chemicals at a moment&apos;s notice, just because the boss-man has rolled up in his Mercedes and given the order. It is the kind of detail which, if it appeared in a Dick Francis novel, might be criticised for stretching the reader&apos;s credulity to breaking point. But racing is a very hierarchical society, staff are easily replaced and Godolphin are famously the best payers in the business. While questions must be asked of those others who were implicated, responsibility for what happened rests with the man who has already been banished. No detail was offered by the panel about the involvement of the two foremen who, it emerged last week, were also named by Zarooni as having assisted. Zarooni&apos;s defence, that he thought it was acceptable to treat horses with steroids so long as they were clear of it by raceday, was waved away by the panel. While he could point to the regime in Dubai, where such steroid use would indeed be allowed, the BHA takes the view that it has done much to publicise the issue, which became prominent through the case of Howard Johnson, a trainer banned in 2011. More damningly for Zarooni is the fact that he never discussed the steroid use with any of his qualified vets or made any entry relating to them in the yard&apos;s medication registers, as he would surely have done if the treatment was honestly given. Challenged on this point, the panel say: &quot;He did not have a credible explanation.&quot; His self-destructive actions seem almost tragic in light of comments by the BHA&apos;s veterinary advisor in the case, Dr Lynn Hillyer, who supervised the original round of tests on 9 April. The panel report her as advising that &quot;it is scientifically unproven whether anabolic steroids do in fact enhance equine performance; the research simply has not been done&quot;. Hillyer could say only that it is &quot;likely&quot; that steroids will enhance performance, on the basis that they improve body weight and muscle mass. But, as John Berry, another Newmarket trainer, pointed out last week, those things can come at a cost in horses, whose legs are barely built to cope with the weight they already support. Hillyer&apos;s colleagues were still working on Tuesday at Moulton Paddocks, rounding up tests from all those horses not tested on 9 April. That comes to more than 150 animals. The results of the original tests were sent to the BHA by its laboratory after one week but, with three times as many samples to get through, this second batch may take longer to process. The BHA reports that it is already advising Godolphin on how to improve its procedures and controls so that the chances of a repeat scandal are minimised. Meanwhile, they continue to interview staff members and contractors. Even with Zarooni banned and out of the country, Godolphin are under an unprecedented cloud in the week of the 2,000 Guineas. Their famous blue colours may well be carried to victory in Saturday&apos;s Classic by the Irish-based favourite, Dawn Approach, but there is rather more doubt about whether the colt&apos;s ultimate owner, Sheikh Mohammed, will be present to see it. The Sheikh, said to be furious about Zarooni&apos;s sins, is currently in Dubai. Asked on Tuesday whether Sheikh Mohammed planned to be in Newmarket this weekend, Simon Crisford, spokesman for Godolphin, admitted he had &quot;no idea&quot;.", "title": "Key findings delivered in Mahmood al-Zarooni steroids doping case", "sentences": ["By the trainer&apos;s account, he had brought the steroids to Britain in his luggage on a flight from Dubai, where it is permissible to use them on racehorses in training.", "While he could point to the regime in Dubai, where such steroid use would indeed be allowed, the BHA takes the view that it has done much to publicise the issue, which became prominent through the case of Howard Johnson, a trainer banned in 2011.", "The Sheikh, said to be furious about Zarooni&apos;s sins, is currently in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-04-30T20:51:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/01/godolphin-steroids-australians-royal-ascot", "tags": ["Royal Ascot", "Godolphin", "Ascot", "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "British Horseracing Authority", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Senior executives here on Wednesday said that the course will continue to subsidise the travelling costs of horses from around the world to enable them to race at the track, regardless of the drugs policies in operation in their native jurisdictions. &quot;It&apos;s a rule thing,&quot; Nick Smith, Ascot&apos;s head of international racing said. &quot;We don&apos;t make the rules, we couldn&apos;t stop them coming and as long as they are complying with the rules of racing, that&apos;s fine.&quot; At least two runners are expected to travel to next month&apos;s Royal meeting at Ascot from Australia, where anabolic steroids can be used to improve the condition of racehorses as long as the drug clears their system by the time of a race. All Too Hard, a half-brother to the brilliant Black Caviar, the winner of the Golden Jubilee Stakes at last year&apos;s Royal meeting, is expected to contest the Queen Anne Stakes, and Shamexpress is entered in the King&apos;s Stand Stakes. &quot;My guess would be that if we weren&apos;t, for instance, paying a travel allowance, they would come anyway,&quot; Smith said. &quot;It&apos;s now an established fact in international racing that that happens. No one comes because of the travel allowance, it doesn&apos;t even cover the trip, or half the trip. It&apos;s not it&apos;s all of a sudden that it&apos;s been found out that steroids are sometimes used in Australia \u2013 it&apos;s common knowledge. I understand that it&apos;s in the public eye now, but nothing has changed, our policies haven&apos;t changed. &quot;We carry on as normal, business as usual. This is the international racecourse for Europe and if they co-operate and run within the British rules of racing, they will be welcome.&quot; International rules on the use of anabolic steroids in racing have come under intense scrutiny since it emerged last week that Mahmood al-Zarooni, the former trainer in charge of Godolphin&apos;s Moulton Paddocks stable in Newmarket, had administered the performance-enhancing drugs to 15 of his horses. Zarooni, who claimed to be unaware of Britain&apos;s zero-tolerance policy on steroids, was banned from racing for eight years by the British Horseracing Authority&apos;s disciplinary panel last Thursday but would not have faced any sanctions in Australia, the United States or his native Dubai, where steroids can be used outside competition. Paul Bittar, the chief executive of the BHA, has expressed hope that the fallout from the Zarooni scandal will persuade international racing authorities that the variance in doping rules must be addressed. The chance that there will be any imminent standardisation of the regulations appears remote, however. &quot;It&apos;s not up to us what the rules are, that&apos;s a matter for the BHA,&quot; Charles Barnett, Ascot&apos;s chief executive, said. &quot;They do the rules, we try to get horses here because they want to run and punters want to see them, and we do the promotion.&quot; The track also remains confident that an Australian winner at next month&apos;s Royal meeting would be warmly received by the spectators in the immense grandstand. &quot;We&apos;re not worried at all,&quot; Smith said. &quot;On the day, it will be absolutely fine.&quot; Ascot&apos;s commitment to international competition came on the same day as a statement from Peter Moody, the former trainer of Black Caviar, that she had never been given steroids. &quot;Nil,&quot; Moody said when asked if Black Caviar had ever received such a drug. &quot;Steroids increase bulk. Black Caviar was a huge mare, from the day she was born. It would have been absolutely counterproductive.&quot; Moody added that Black Caviar had been dope-tested shortly after arriving in Britain on 7 June last year, and again a few days before her victory at Ascot on 23 June, returning a clean test on both occasions. The Queen&apos;s colours could be aboard one of the favourites for the Gold Cup at next month&apos;s Royal meeting, following the victory of Estimate in the Group Three Sagaro Stakes, the feature race on Wednesday&apos;s card. The four-year-old filly, who took the two-mile Queen&apos;s Vase at the 2012 Royal meeting, started favourite and readily went clear of her field in the closing stages. &quot;That was great, very exciting,&quot; John Warren, the Queen&apos;s bloodstock adviser, said after the race. &quot;I asked Ryan Moore [Estimate&apos;s jockey] whether she would stay another half mile and he said: &apos;We won&apos;t know until we try.&apos; Whatever runs in the Gold Cup, they are not bred to do it but she has got every chance as her pedigree is all stamina.&quot;", "title": "Godolphin steroids fallout will not stop Australians at Royal Ascot", "sentences": ["Zarooni, who claimed to be unaware of Britain&apos;s zero-tolerance policy on steroids, was banned from racing for eight years by the British Horseracing Authority&apos;s disciplinary panel last Thursday but would not have faced any sanctions in Australia, the United States or his native Dubai, where steroids can be used outside competition."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-01T17:32:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2013/may/02/one-world-trade-centre-tallest-building", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "New York", "World news", "Culture"], "article": "800 tonnes of steel was set to be hauled into place at the top of One World Trade Center on Monday, eventually crowning the glassy shaft with a 125m spire, making this the tallest building in the western hemisphere. It will rise to the symbolic height of 1,776ft (541m), the year of America&apos;s independence \u2013 a touch of PR genius dreamt up by the building&apos;s original architect, Daniel Libeskind, which he announced to assembled gasps on the Oprah Winfrey show in 2003. Ten years on, Libeskind&apos;s splintered vortex of shards has been replaced by a blandly corporate obelisk by SOM, predicted to be the most expensive office building in the world, at $3.8bn. But it retains the all-important numerology of 1776. Monday&apos;s weather didn&apos;t co-operate, the steely spire was not raised, and the building still stands at around 415m \u2013 already New York&apos;s tallest building, but less than half that of the tallest in the world, Dubai&apos;s Burj Khalifa. The lift will be attempted again today, but the spire will not be assembled for some time \u2013 and even then, doubts remain as to whether this shiny needle actually counts as a part of the building&apos;s total height: the crucial definition being whether it is an antenna or a spire. This strange debate flared up last May, when the design of the mast was changed, removing the cladding of the &quot;radome&quot; (short for radar dome), and saving around $20m. SOM had originally designed a decorative sheath of interlocking triangles of fibreglass and steel, 7m at its widest point. Without the cladding, the mast is left exposed as a straightforward pole of steel trusses, about 2m wide and intersected by wider maintenance platforms.     Aspiring ambition \u2026 Will the mast count without its cladding? Image: One World Trade Center    &quot;This definitely raises questions,&quot; said Kevin Brass, the public affairs manager for the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, the body that passes official judgment on such things as whether your erection is tall, supertall or megatall. &quot;Our criteria are very specific. We include spires and not antennas. If this is an antenna, it won&apos;t be part of the height measurement. The cladding was an integral part of the design and made the extension part of the permanent look and feel of the building.&quot; You might think that measuring the height of a building is a fairly straightforward task. Not so for the Council on Tall Buildings. The non-profit agency has three different methods for determining how high a tower actually is, from the Height to the Architectural Top, to the Highest Occupied Floor, to the Height to Tip. The first is the yardstick it uses to compile its World&apos;s Tallest Buildings List \u2013 and will determine if One World Trade Center truly meets its claim. The Council has yet to reach a decision, as it has not received the final construction drawings of the project. Once the papers are sent, a &quot;height committee&quot; will be convened to make the final judgment as to whether the spire does indeed count as a piece of architecture or not. If not, One World Trade Center will only be the third tallest building in America, trumped by both the Willis (formerly Sears) Tower in Chicago, which stands at 527m, and (somewhat appropriately) by the Trump International Hotel and Tower, also in Chicago. Even with its spire, it will not reach the height of Mecca&apos;s 600m clock-tower in Saudi Arabia, where the 1km Kingdom Tower is also being planned in Jeddah to overshadow them all. Such details are of little concern to the developer: &quot;If truth be told, this discussion is irrelevant,&quot; said Steve Coleman, spokesman for the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. &quot;One WTC will be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere.&quot; But for how long remains to be seen.

The ultimate recyclable product, it never corrodes and can be used and reused for everything from currency to jewellery to medical treatments. Mined and traded properly, gold can contribute to the wealth of individuals, companies and nations. But, like other highly desirable natural resources, it can also be used to fund conflict \u2013 which is why a range of measures to prevent this happening has been established in recent years. The World Gold Council released its Conflict-Free Gold Standard in October 2012 to raise industry standards and set best practice for others to follow. The standard aim to stop gold mining from funding wars in conflict states encompasses the entire supply chain. So to what extent is the standard achieving what it set out to do? And what else could be done to increase the benefits of gold mining to some of the world&apos;s poorest countries? Representatives from organisations involved in the mining sector \u2013 from industry bodies to mining companies and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) with interests in mining areas \u2013 recently attended a roundtable organised by the Guardian to discuss the Conflict-Free Gold Standard&apos;s progress so far. The event was held in association with the World Gold Council. Terry Heymann, from the World Gold Council, kicked off the discussion by running through the reactions to the standard. What does responsible mining in conflict-affected areas look like? &quot;Customers are looking at provenance \u2013 where are their goods coming from? There&apos;s a lot of work ongoing across and along the supply chain, reaching out geographically and\u00a0embedding the effects [of the standard] in\u00a0different countries.&quot; Edward Bickham said the fact that the standard is\u00a0trying to address something very specific \u2013 conflict \u2013 means it is more likely to\u00a0succeed. &quot;It doesn&apos;t deal with social conflict or environmental issues, it isn&apos;t the abolition of &apos;sin&apos; stuff. It is focused and fit for purpose.&quot; Benchmarks The roundtable heard a range of other regulations had already taken effect, some of which worked in tandem with the Conflict-Free Gold Standard. Tyler Gillard, from the Organisation for Economic Coordination and Development (OECD), pointed out that the OECD&apos;s Due Diligence Guidance and Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises were seen as benchmarks. &quot;There is a lot of buy-in for the OECD guidance, politically as well as from industry and civil society. The heads of state of 11 African countries have endorsed the guidance, and the DRC [Democratic Republic of the Congo] and Rwanda have integrated it into their national laws,&quot; said Gillard. This buy-in came about because all parties were involved in the development process from the beginning. Sophia Pickles, from campaign group Global Witness, had seen for herself that the OECD due diligence was beginning to be understood by\u00a0the private sector in the areas of\u00a0the DRC, Burundi and Rwanda that she\u00a0had visited. The &quot;three Ts&quot; (tin, tungsten and tantalum, which are used in consumer electronics products) were starting to be mined and traded responsibly. &quot;Traders understood what due diligence is and why the international market wants proof that mining is not funding conflict,&quot; she said. At the same time, there was still military involvement at various points of the supply chain, Pickles added: &quot;People were saying there is still a man pointing a gun at us and making us export minerals at night.&quot; One of the themes that ran throughout the discussion was the way in which a voluntary agreement (or soft law) could have a wider impact than legislation (or hard law). Some participants, such as Heymann, believed that voluntary agreements allow companies to have higher ambitions than would be the case with law. &quot;[The standard] isn&apos;t a simple tick box and you&apos;re there,&quot; Heymann said. Yedwa Simelane, from mining company Anglogold Ashanti, was pleased that the Conflict-Free Gold Standard meant it was not necessary to have to adhere to 10 different and possibly divergent standards. As a result, she said, when it comes to large responsible mines &quot;you can tick absolutely that their gold is responsible.&quot; However, for laws to work there had to be functioning institutions to apply them. In some countries, this was not the case. Diana Klein, from NGO International Alert, was on the side of voluntary initiatives as distinct from legislation. &quot;Law doesn&apos;t allow space for dialogue,&quot; she said. However, Louise Arimatsu, an international lawyer, put forward a strong case for legislation. &quot;The good guys are concerned about reputations. They are already complying.&quot; But resistance from some to meet standards threatened the progress of all, added Arimatsu. Vuyelwa Kuuya, a research fellow at the Centre for International Sustainable Development Law, was appreciative of the standard, believing laws often simply laid down a basic minimum. &quot;So many codes of conduct basically say &apos;respect human rights&apos;, but this [the standard] tells you what to do and who should do what. It gives more content and has practical approaches.&quot; However, she was also wary about whether this kind of soft law would ever develop into legislation. Questions remained about the ease of implementing the standard in all parts of the supply chain. Heymann pointed out that tracing gold to its mine of origin wasn&apos;t possible because it could be melted down and reused. According to Gillard, every individual in the supply chain has a responsibility to work together to achieve responsible sourcing. &quot;Otherwise it&apos;s not going to work. With a clear demand coming in from the consumers or the jewellery companies, pressure can then be applied up the supply chain, to eventually engage with the gold producers or mining company appropriately. This type of constructive engagement with producers is particularly relevant for artisanal mining because of the informality involved.&quot; Informal mining A point stressed by many participants was the difference between large-scale industrial mining and artisanal miners, who mine informally using hand tools or pan for gold in rivers. Anthony Hodge, from the International Council on Mining and Metals, said that while there are around 35 members of the Gold Council and ICMM combined, there are around 6,000 mining companies in the world. &quot;These don&apos;t include artisanal operators who range \u2013 depending on the price of gold \u2013 from 15 million to 40 million.&quot; Ruth Crowell, deputy chief executive of the London Bullion Market Association, believed tackling the informal mining sector should come next. &quot;We have raised the standard, now we need to look at the development side and close that gap,&quot; she said. Some informal miners or mining companies, though small, might nevertheless be legitimate and benefit from support. However, Klein warned: &quot;No amount of legal structures will have the mining industry proactively contributing to development in certain countries. That requires an active collaboration with host governments and changing the perception of the mining industry as a cash cow to an active partner in development.&quot; Hodge and Pickles both mentioned the importance of accountability in ensuring that progress is made. &quot;Whistleblowing is built into the standard, so there are tools for accountability for all to see what is going on in the supply chain. Governments need to take responsibility, but so do companies, civil society and investors,&quot; said Pickles. There is also the issue of how to reach out to companies who mine and trade informally to the benefit of armed groups, perhaps taking their gold from DRC to markets in Dubai. &quot;We are looking at a formal market where people are trying to do the right thing in many respects,&quot; said Pickles. &quot;But there is an informal or less responsible market where people who are not members of the World Gold Council and party to the standard are not asking any questions at all. We should try to get them to the table and people should use their influence to influence that market.&quot; The possibility of some companies using the standard to gain a competitive advantage, for instance by implying their responsible mining practices were in stark contrast to the inadequacies of their competitors, was also discussed by participants. But Simelane said this should not happen. &quot;We are all in the same boat and have to rethink our models. We can&apos;t create enclaves [of responsible mines] and think we want to be better than the next person.&quot; Companies do, however, have to come to see that it is good business to mine responsibly, roundtable participants agreed. So how can responsible mining have a truly beneficial impact on countries still in dire need of development? Could more involved and committed investors be the answer? Some participants argued that the next step is to get them taking part in the discussion. &quot;Diverse economies have been built on the back of gold,&quot; said Heymann. &quot;There is a responsibility for everyone to move forward, but that can be very hard in a world of immediate results and quarterly earnings.&quot; \u2022 This article was amended on 3 May 2013.

He was just a face in the crowd on 3\u00a0May 1967, a teenager on a day off from his studies in Cambridge. Royal Palace, in the colours of the famous owner-breeder Jim Joel, won the Classic by a short head. Ten years later, the young Sheikh moved from spectator to player, when Hatta, at rough-and-ready Brighton, became the first of thousands of horses to carry his colours to success. Ten years after that, he was already in charge of a racing and breeding empire far in advance of anything that Joel and his fellow owner-breeders could ever have hoped \u2013 or wished \u2013 to achieve. No one seems to know whether Sheikh Mohammed will be at Newmarket once again on Saturday, 46 years after his first day at the races, to watch Dawn Approach carry the royal blue Godolphin colours in the 2,000 Guineas. Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, says only that he &quot;hopes&quot; his boss will be there for the first major race of the European Flat season. Two weeks ago, most punters would have put money on it. Dawn Approach was last year&apos;s champion two-year-old, and victory in the first colts&apos; Classic of the season would immediately guarantee him a post-racing career among the headline acts on the stallion roster at the Sheikh&apos;s Darley Stud breeding operation. For Dawn Approach&apos;s owner, without a winner in the 2,000 Guineas since 1999, the chance to lead him in would have seemed all but impossible to resist. But that was two weeks ago, and so much has changed, in Godolphin and in racing, since it was revealed on 22 April that Mahmood al-Zarooni, one of Godolphin&apos;s two principal trainers, had doped at least 15 of their horses with anabolic steroids. All 15, including Certify, who had been a leading contender for Sunday&apos;s 1,000 Guineas, are now banned from racing until October, while Moulton Paddocks, Zarooni&apos;s former yard, remains under &quot;lockdown&quot;, imposed by the Sheikh, pending the results of drugs tests on the rest of the string. There is as yet no indication as to when, or if, any of the remaining horses at Moulton Paddocks will race again this season. On Thursday, meanwhile, a drug-testing team from the British Horseracing Authority started taking samples from horses at Godolphin&apos;s other base in Newmarket, run by Saeed bin Suroor. This, according to the BHA, was merely for &quot;the sake of completeness&quot;, but another slew of global headlines has inevitably linked &quot;steroids&quot; to &quot;Godolphin&quot;, which was conceived by Sheikh Mohammed to project a positive image of Dubai around the world. It is still possible that Zarooni himself will extend the initial trauma of the steroids scandal by deciding to appeal against an eight-year ban from the sport, which was imposed by the BHA just three days after it announced the results of its tests at Moulton Paddocks. Both Godolphin and the BHA, meanwhile, continue to investigate the most significant doping scandal that British racing has seen. The damage that it has caused to Godolphin&apos;s image and reputation, and by extension to that of Dubai, may never be repaired, and certainly not in the time it will take Dawn Approach to run down the Rowley Mile on Saturdayafternoon. Godolphin, too, is keen to play down the Classic&apos;s importance in the wider story. &quot;It is a significant race,&quot; Crisford said on Friday, &quot;but no more so than it would have been because of what has happened over the last two weeks.&quot; But any recovery needs to start somewhere, and Godolphin is desperate for a little bit of normality, a chance to focus on a top-class racehorse and map out its route through the season. As a result, Saturday&apos;s Classic could yet prove to be the most important 100 seconds in Godolphin&apos;s 20-year history. It is hard to believe that Sheikh Mohammed will not be there to see it. Newmarket is familiar territory, a friendly environment in which to make his first appearance on a racecourse since the scandal broke. This is a course for purists and professionals, many of whom will feel indebted to the Sheikh, if not directly then in terms of the outstanding horses he has bought, bred and raced in Britain over the course of nearly 40 years. If he is not well-received at Newmarket, the game is up. But he has always been one for the long term too, and there is probably a five-year plan to restore Godolphin&apos;s credibility already taking shape in Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s mind. What will happen to the horses at Moulton Paddocks, and to the stable itself? Will a new trainer take over, will Suroor take charge of both Godolphin&apos;s main yards, or might it be time to spread the horses around a little bit more? Dawn Approach, almost uniquely, remained with Jim Bolger when Godolphin bought him last year. If he were to be Godolphin&apos;s first 2,000 Guineas winner for 14 years, at their hour of greatest need, that would at least give pause for thought. These are just a few of the questions that may be on Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s mind if, or when, he pays his latest visit to Newmarket on Saturday, nearly half a century after his first.

But there are a couple of cautionary notes to be struck, starting with the fact that Bolger has never won the Newmarket Classic, despite training five Dewhurst winners in the past seven years. The Dewhurst is often the best two-year-old race in Britain but it is plainly not an infallible guide to the next year&apos;s Guineas, especially when going conditions differ, which brings us to the second cautionary note. Dawn Approach has nearly always had some cut in the ground so far and came closest to defeat on good going at Royal Ascot, the fastest he has so far encountered. Newmarket has been watered this week but is still likely to race on the fast side and Dawn Approach is no certainty to enjoy that. His sire, New Approach, was no fan of quick ground and seems to be passing on that tendency to his progeny. Toronado, an impressive Craven winner on good to firm here last month, is likely to take a hand in the finish but is almost as short a price as Dawn Approach. Punters have hardly taken an interest in the others but there is a fair spread of talent here. George Vancouver (3.50) seems surprisingly unloved at 16-1, considering he won a Breeders&apos; Cup race at this distance on fast ground when last seen. He has three lengths to make up on Dawn Approach from the Dewhurst but a sounder surface and an extra furlong could help him do that. By jockey bookings, he looks like Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s third string but this trainer has won Classics with apparent &apos;backup&apos; horses before. George Vancouver may not be the most likely winner in the field but he is the wrong price if the going description is accurate. 2.05 Newmarket After three runs for Jeremy Noseda, Whispering Warrior landed on a very reasonable handicap mark, it seems. He is unbeaten in three for David Simcock and is only 7lb higher than for his easy success last time. 2.20 Goodwood This was the scene for Coquet&apos;s only win last year, in an Oaks trial. Everything went wrong for her after that but she has the talent to win this after a winter break. 2.35 Newmarket Narrowly beaten in this race two years ago, Sole Power was in good form in Dubai and gets the decent ground that he needs. 2.55 Goodwood Never worse than third in four starts here, The Confessor runs off the same mark as when beaten less than a length here in August in a race worth three times as much. 3.10 Newmarket The main aims for Dandino this year are six months off but he likes decent ground and has a good record fresh.", "title": "Talking Horses | Chris Cook", "sentences": ["2.35 Newmarket Narrowly beaten in this race two years ago, Sole Power was in good form in Dubai and gets the decent ground that he needs."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-03T23:01:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/04/sheikh-mohammed-2000-guineas-dawn-approach1", "tags": ["2,000 Guineas", "Godolphin", "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Dawn Approach is an excellent name for a horse whose victory may herald brighter times for his owner. The only better name for Saturday&apos;s 2,000 Guineas winner here would have been Pathetic Fallacy, since the sheeting rain that greeted Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s arrival in the paddock gave way to sudden sunshine as his chestnut colt shot past the stands, a thoroughly impressive Classic winner. Given that Dawn Approach has long been the hot favourite for this race, you would expect those associated with Godolphin to have been poised to use his success, if it came, to push such a narrative: that there have been dark times but better lies ahead. Instead, they still seemed on edge, plainly rattled by the recent astonishing discovery of covert steroid use by one of their trainers, Mahmood al-Zarooni, now banished from the sport for eight years by the British Horseracing Authority. As the ruler of Dubai and the prime minister of the UAE, it would have been easy enough for Sheikh Mohammed to have invented some undeniably important reason for being elsewhere when this race was run, less than a fortnight after the steroid story broke and just a couple of miles from Moulton Paddocks, the stable where Zarooni was based. But he showed up in the paddock for the race before the Guineas and spent much of the next hour in the public gaze, admiring expensive horseflesh. The next question became whether any members of the media would be allowed through his protective entourage, which at times seemed to number about 30. The initial answer from his advisers was no, he would not be talking today. Sheikh Mohammed himself turned away a request from Channel 4&apos;s presenter, Clare Balding, as he watched Dawn Approach being saddled. &quot;Maybe next time,&quot; he said, relaxed at that stage, despite heavy rain and blackening skies. The softening effects of watching your horse win a Classic can be readily imagined, even if they have not been experienced by many, and Balding clearly expected a better result when the Sheikh arrived in the winner&apos;s enclosure. Having thanked her for her congratulations off-camera, he raised a hand and turned away when she first asked for an interview but she persisted: &quot;No, no, we&apos;ve got to talk.&quot; And so it was that the Sheikh found himself giving a live interview that he had twice tried to evade. Initially happy to discuss the horse, he turned on his heel when asked about the BHA&apos;s investigation, with a curt: &quot;That&apos;s up to them.&quot; It was his third and final sentence to Balding. Shortly afterwards, he shared a brief exchange with a longserving bloodstock reporter: &quot;I am from the Arabian Peninsula; every day there is a challenge,&quot; he said. Godolphin&apos;s spokesman, Simon Crisford, was also unwilling to address the steroid issue head on. &quot;This is a big result and a big occasion for us,&quot; he said. It was left to Jim Bolger, trainer of Dawn Approach, to put some distance between the winning owner and Zarooni, who was described by the BHA as acting alone in a detailed statement this week. &quot;I don&apos;t think Sheikh Mohammed has as much to be concerned about as some people would think,&quot; Bolger said. &quot;Nobody can be responsible for what somebody else does. Even in the corporate world, the chairman isn&apos;t always responsible for the MD and I think it&apos;s the same in a racing stable. &quot;I don&apos;t think that the person at the top can be responsible for everything. I wouldn&apos;t like to hold myself responsible for everything that happens in my yard, even though it behoves the holder of the licence to concern himself with everything that happens in the yard. But I don&apos;t think that you can take all that responsibility on your own shoulders.&quot; Bolger, winning his first 2,000 Guineas, bred Dawn Approach and sold half of the horse to Sheikh Mohammed last June, with the proviso that it would remain in his County Carlow yard.

Instead, Dawn Approach is free to turn up for almost any Group One race this summer and expect to be favourite. The Derby is the race on everyone&apos;s lips, although his jockey, Kevin Manning, explicitly doubted whether the colt&apos;s stamina would stretch to the mile and a half of that race on the first Saturday in June. &quot;Sheikh Mohammed and myself, we said we&apos;d sleep on it and see from there,&quot; said Bolger.

The Sheikh made plain his discomfort on the subject by cutting short a live Channel 4 interview with Clare Balding when she asked him about the continuing investigation into one of his stables. Balding had had to be persistent to get an interview of any kind, as the Sheikh twice turned down her off-camera approaches. But, caught up in the euphoria of the winner&apos;s enclosure after his chestnut had won by an impressive five lengths, he consented. &quot;I&apos;m very, very happy to come and see a good horse winning the Guineas,&quot; said the Sheikh, who serves as ruler of Dubai and prime minister of the UAE. Asked if he had been tempted to stay away, he replied: &quot;I always face certain ... challenges. To me, it&apos;s normal.&quot; Balding then asked if the Sheikh was &quot;happy&quot; with the actions of the British Horseracing Authority, who recently banned one of his trainers, Mahmood al-Zarooni, for eight years for covert use of steroids. &quot;That&apos;s up to them,&quot; said the Sheikh, already turning away, melting into his supportive entourage. Later, he gave an interview to a Dubai TV channel, who asked no such awkward questions. &quot;He did a good job, that trainer,&quot; said the Sheikh, alluding to Jim Bolger, who also bred Dawn Approach and sold half of it to Sheikh Mohammed last summer. The significance of that line could not be missed. Sheikh Mohammed did not express his thoughts about Zarooni but his advisors have made clear that he is beside himself with fury. Zarooni was one of two trainers privately employed by Godolphin in the Newmarket area. A detailed statement published by the BHA on 26 April described him as acting alone in his application of anabolic steroids, instructing a junior member of stable staff to inject 15 of the Sheikh&apos;s horses with the contents of unmarked syringes. Zarooni was caught when BHA testers arrived unannounced at his stable on 9 April to take samples from 45 horses, 11 of which were positive for steroids. Zarooni admitted giving steroids to four others. The testers have since taken samples from 145 other horses at Zarooni&apos;s stable and also from the horses trained elsewhere in Newmarket by Godolphin&apos;s first trainer, Saeed bin Suroor, even though he is not thought to have been involved in the deception.

Thompson comes from an academic and theatre background and was invited there by Unicef, which had received a request from Jaffna community workers for someone experienced in developing theatre programmes for young people. &quot;It was during really chronic violence in the north and we had to take a mad route to get there to avoid it all,&quot; explains Thompson. &quot;I&apos;d read a piece on Sri Lankan theatre before I went, which basically said that there was nothing going on in the north, because of the war. But when I arrived I found a surprisingly active, interesting theatre community, plus musicians, poets and other artists. I found it intriguing that a) these people would still go to rehearsals and make art while shells were exploding, and b) people presumed all creativity and art would stop in war zones.&quot; The following year, after 9/11, Thompson noticed a huge increase in artists questioning how they should respond to terrorism or acts of war, which gave him the embryonic idea for the project. &quot;I thought if there are artists in Sri Lanka being shelled who continue to make art, I bet there are artists in war zones all over the world who could help people answer the question \u2013 how might artists respond to terrible events? So that became the premise of the project \u2013 to seek out and then to document such work.&quot; Thompson&apos;s idea developed into In Place of War, based at the University of Manchester, which researches and supports art and creativity in sites of armed conflict. &quot;In 2004, we got our first batch of funding from the Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council and we started visiting war zones, meeting artists and documenting their work.&quot; In the years since, they have travelled to meet artists in areas of conflict from Gaza to Northern Ireland, Bosnia to Banda Aceh in Indonesia. They work with both established and emerging artists; sometimes, there&apos;s little to separate the two. &quot;In some places, there&apos;s very little infrastructure for art, so, for instance, in Sri Lanka, the most famous poet was also the physics teacher in the local school.&quot; In Place of War chose to launch its new digital platform for war-zone creatives in Egypt, inspired by the role artists have played in the revolution and how they continue to respond to it. &quot;During the Arab spring, and in Egypt in particular, there was this incredible meeting of great unrest with social media and art, and that&apos;s very interesting, because suddenly artists have huge new audiences and people are communicating and sharing work in different ways. Egypt is really inspiring for people all around the world, but is also scary because it could still go very wrong.&quot; For more info on In Place of War, see inplaceofwar.net.

Graffiti was the most immediate and visible artistic response to the revolution on the streets of Cairo; prior to the uprising, graffiti wasn&apos;t much in evidence in the city. &quot;The wall was not for people; it wasn&apos;t a public space,&quot; explains Heba Helmi, painter, lecturer and political activist, who designed anti-Mubarak publications before the revolution. Even when Helmi asked her students to take pictures of the streets of Cairo for projects, &quot;always, always someone would approach them and say, &apos;You cannot take this photo&apos; and ask, &apos;Why you taking this photo? Who are you?&apos;&quot; The simple reclaiming of these public surfaces was an act of defiance in itself against the government. &quot;This public space wasn&apos;t public,&quot; continues Helmi, &quot;and that&apos;s why graffiti appeared so quickly after the revolution, because people wanted to occupy that space.&quot; Some of the early graffiti served to reflect and highlight the people&apos;s calls for freedom, the removal of Mubarak, but also more basic demands, for food, for bread. &quot;I don&apos;t think the artists knew in the beginning that they were documenting the revolution, but they reacted to everything and for me they became the voice of the revolution.&quot; Mohamed Mahmoud Street, off Tahrir Square, is where the densest concentrations of graffiti can be found. Some of the earliest revolutionary graffiti remains and it&apos;s possible to trace the story of the last two turbulent years, in broken fragments. Most fascinating are pieces where graffiti writers respond to each other, fleshing the bones out of the first artist&apos;s skeletal story or responding to their message. Helmi decided to produce a book documenting the graffiti of the revolution, after the Egyptian government produced an official book of street art, which she felt was sanitised and didn&apos;t tell the true story. Two years on, much of the graffiti remains and there seem to be more artists than ever. The Friday we are here, there is a graffiti jam called The Garage Walls to launch another two books on the graffiti of the revolution, reinforcing its pivotal role.     Musician Ramy Essam. Photograph: Giulia Marchi/Anzenberger    RAMY ESSAMThe songwriter who captured the spirit of Tahrir Square.   Ramy Essam is such a warm, gentle soul in person, you wouldn&apos;t think he was the voice of a revolution. But Essam, more than anyone,he became the public face of the role artists have played in supporting and responding to the Egyptian uprising. The first songs Essam wrote, as a young musician, were love songs. &quot;In Egypt, our culture is all about love songs,&quot; he says. But before the revolution, his writing became more politicised, prompted by Shady, his elder brother. &quot;Shady is my library and he gave me information about everything in my life when I was younger,&quot; he says. &quot;As I got older, he began to talk to me about the regime in Egypt, how bad the situation was, and suggested I write about it.&quot; Like most Egyptians, Essam had little idea that the demonstrations that started on 25\u00a0January 2011 would end up sending reverberations around the world, let alone that they would utterly change the direction of his life. Essam wasn&apos;t even in Cairo that day. He was in his hometown of Mansoura in the Nile Delta, but went to Tahrir Square as things developed. On 31\u00a0January, when President Mubarak made a televised address saying he would remain in power, Essam turned the crowd&apos;s response \u2013\u00a0&quot;Irhal!&quot; (&quot;leave&quot;) \u2013\u00a0into song. He worried he would be dismissed by the crowd for his ponytail, but he captured the moment perfectly. &quot;It was the best moment of my life, the spirit changed 100% for the positive\u2026 I was born in this moment in the square.&quot; Within a week, half a million people had watched him on YouTube. As Pete Seeger once asserted: &quot;The right song, at the right time, can change history.&quot; When Time Out compiled a list of &quot;100 songs that changed history&quot; late in 2011, Irhal was at No 3, just behind Band Aid&apos;s Do They Know It&apos;s Christmas?. Just ahead of Sam Cooke&apos;s A Change Is Gonna Come and John Lennon&apos;s Imagine. When soldiers cleared Tahrir Square on 9 March, they arrested Essam and tortured him for four hours, stripping him, beating him and cutting his long hair with broken glass. Essam has since recorded 45 tracks inspired by the revolution and subsequent events. But even though the language of protest has changed in Egypt, it&apos;s still not accepted to openly attack the Muslim Brotherhood. Gigs in Cairo have been cancelled because of threats of violence against Essam from their supporters. The week I&apos;m in Egypt, he plays a gig outside Cairo one night and stops by our hotel in the early hours, exhausted but emboldened, to recount how a supporter of the Muslim Brotherhood had pulled the plug on his show when he started singing one of his songs that rails against them. &quot;They are controlling the country now and I hate them, because they betrayed us. But we have already started the revolution against the Muslim Brotherhood,&quot; he says.     Film director Khaled el Hagar. Photograph: Giulia Marchi/Anzenberger    KHALED EL-HAGARThe film director who returned from the UK in time to film the revolution. The award-winning director Khaled el-Hagar is one of Egypt&apos;s most established and controversial directors. His first short film, You Are My Life (1985), won best film at the Oberhausen short film festival and he has since won 27 awards, including five for his 2001 drama Room to Rent. His most recent movie, El Shoq (Lust), won the Golden Pyramid award at Cairo&apos;s international film festival. El-Hagar lived in Birmingham during the 1990s, but is now back in Cairo, where he witnessed the revolution. &quot;The best aspects of the revolution, for me, were two things,&quot; he says. &quot;First, that young people learned that they have a voice and they can talk. Second, it opened the doors for young people to make art, especially with digital media. They are communicating to the world now. If you&apos;ve been living through a revolution for a while, you might not want to go and see a film about revolution; you might just want to watch a comedy. But in other countries they will definitely find an\u00a0audience.&quot;     Sculptor Rami El Fass. Photograph: Giulia Marchi/Anzenberger    RAMI EL-FASSThe sculptor who runs an artists&apos; collective. el-Fass is one of the main artists behind 15/3 Studios, a young, innovative collective of creatives, including video artists, cartoonists, photographers, graphic designers, writers and producers. They produce their own, as well as group work. Much of it supported and inspired the revolution, including video clips, political cartoons and caricatures that were displayed in Tahrir Square and elsewhere.El-Fass is an acclaimed sculptor, whose recent work includes an exhibit made with parts from vehicles abandoned in Tahrir Square. &quot;The revolution was very powerful,&quot; he says. &quot;It changed my life and made me want to be a better man in my work.&quot; 15/3 is an inspiring studio; most of the artists were involved with and have friends who died or were injured in the revolution. &quot;The people have come so far that I believe we will reach for a second revolution against the Muslim Brotherhood,&quot; he says. The work of el-Fass&apos;s fellow artist Munchy Ellithy was even closer to the revolution. Months before it started, Ellithy, a video artist, was working in Dubai. On 10 October 2010, he uploaded an anti-Mubarak video he had made to YouTube. It quickly gathered thousands, then millions of views. Ellithy was warned not to return to Egypt.Once the revolution started, Ellithy did return. In Tahrir Square, his video was shown on screens. &quot;They were saying, &apos;Because of this Mubarak, because of what we see in this video, we will make the revolution against you.&apos;&quot; The revolution may be televised. Sometimes. Just not through the official channels.     Documentary film-maker Amal Ramsis. Photograph: Giulia Marchi/Anzenberger    AMAL RAMSISThe documentary film-maker who chronicled the often absurd restrictions imposed on everyday life.  When Amal Ramsis started filming her award-winning documentary Mamnou (&quot;Forbidden&quot;), a year before the revolution, her starting point was the frustrating, almost rhetorical question under the rule of Mubarak: what isn&apos;t forbidden in Egypt? After living in Spain for a while, Ramsis returned to Egypt and saw the oppressive culture and regime with fresh eyes. &quot;When I came back, I noticed the repression much more. But people had got used to it, and thought it normal. You would do something on the street and people would come up and say, &apos;No, this is forbidden.&apos; It was, of course, forbidden to make this kind of film, so I didn&apos;t seek permission.&quot; The film follows Ramsis on encounters with friends, showing how absurd life could be under Mubarak, with countless diktats, from who you could associate with, even to where you could walk. She watched a final edit of her film on the day demonstrations started in 2011, but then friends rang her to tell her what was happening in Tahrir Square. She decided to rework the conclusion: &quot;When Mubarak left, it marked the end of the film, and I wanted the message to be: we changed the system.&quot;     Photographer Adel Wassily. Photograph: Giulia Marchi/Giulia Marchi/Anzenberger    ADEL WASSILY The photographer who had to smuggle his images out of Tahrir Square. Adel Wassily had worked as an engineer, but was drawn to photography in the late 80s, when he saw sections of Egyptian life that were going undocumented. His recurring subjects reflect a belief in the fair distribution of wealth, concentrating on the artistry in the minutiae of daily life, even when it is dominated by poverty. &quot;My work is about the situation of the poor people. But, even when the situation is ugly, you can find beauty in it.&quot; As a long time political activist, Wassily knew immediately that the protests that started in January 2011 were different. &quot;Before, all of us protesters knew each other, but on that day, many people appeared who you had never seen before.&quot; He spent days on end in Tahrir Square, and had to smuggle his pictures out, because it was surrounded by police who confiscated and broke cameras. &quot;I had to give my sim card to other people to take out.&quot; His book, Midan&apos;s Life, Tahrir 2011, consists of pictures taken during the revolution. One of the changes, as far as Wassily is concerned, is that the climate of fear has been punctured. &quot;It has gone,&quot; he says. &quot;We have broken the fear, and now that we have, no one can have that hold over us again.&quot;", "title": "In Place of War: Egypt's artists after the Arab Spring", "sentences": ["Months before it started, Ellithy, a video artist, was working in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-04T23:05:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/05/orb-kentucky-derby-winner-139th-mud", "tags": ["Kentucky Derby", "Horse racing", "US sports", "Sport"], "article": "Sodden, splattered, supreme, Orb sluiced through the muddy soup bowl of Churchill Downs to claim the 139th running of the Kentucky Derby. After a steady day of rainfall that saw the mud-lovers come in for last-minute support, Orb stormed to a two and a half length win over 50-1 outsider Golden Soul in a time of two minutes and two seconds. Revolutionary, the 6-1 co-favorite with Orb, was a further two and a half lengths back in third while Normandy Invasion was fourth. Rosie Napravnik was fifth on Mylute, the best finishing position by any female jockey in the history of the race.  It was a first Derby victory for the winner&apos;s trainer, owners and jockey. A win in America&apos;s biggest race had been a long time coming for Orb&apos;s venerated and veteran trainer Shug McGaughey, a Kentucky native. The Derby had proven an elusive dream too for owners, cousins, and long-time racing supporters Ogden Phipps and Stuart Janney III, descendants of a family as steeped in racing folklore as Churchill&apos;s iconic twin spires. And it was a first Derby win for jockey Joel Rosario, who was adding this $2 million trophy haul to the $10 million Dubai World cup picked up only a couple of months ago. &quot;This is awesome,&quot; Rosario said immediately after the race. &quot;To win the Dubai World Cup and then to win the Derby. This is a dream\u2026I&apos;m so happy for Shug right now.&quot; McGaughey, though characteristically phlegmatic, was still visibly moved: &quot;This means everything to me. I&apos;m just so thankful to the people who have put so much time into this horse. He has a tendency to pull himself up. But Joel did great.&quot; When asked at what point he thought Orb could win the Derby, McGaughey replied: &quot;After the Florida Derby.&quot; Because of Orb&apos;s previously fractious disposition before races, concern had surrounded his ability to handle the cauldron of Derby day. Those concerns proved unfounded. To the reverberating echoes of &quot;My Old Kentucky Home,&quot; he took in the preliminaries as one would expect a seven-year-old handicapper. And in the race, he was a model of composure. Belying any worries about the prevailing conditions, Palace Malice, one of Todd Pletcher&apos;s quintet of runners, set a blistering pace under jockey Mike Smith. By the time he hit the half-mile mark in a little over 45 seconds, the field was strung out like a school cross-country run. Rosario was content to let Orb sit at the rear of the pack, less than a handful behind him. There he remained until Rosario began to make his move along the back-stretch. Angling wide around the final turn and on the heels of the leaders, Rosario hoisted the mainsail and blew home through the slop, reeling in the valiant Normandy Invasion about a furlong out before stretching clear to record what was, in the end, a comfortable victory. Normandy Invasion tired into fourth. The Nascar pace set by Palace Malice up front meant that the first five finishers all came from way back. Golden Soul, trained by Dallas Stewart, enjoyed an uninterrupted trip up the rail. As did third home Revolutionary \u2013 a move that had been widely touted before hand given jockey Calvin Borel&apos;s previously successful rail trips on Derby winners Mine That Bird and Super Saver. Revolutionary recorded the best finishing position by any of Pletcher&apos;s runners. Verrazano, the horse that had been widely regarded as Pletcher&apos;s vanguard hope leading up to the race paid the price for sitting too close to the pace. He finished a tired 14th. In finishing fifth on Mylute, jockey Rosie Napravnik recorded the best finishing position of any female jockey in the history of the race. While Lines of Battle, Aiden O&apos;Brien&apos;s runner, ran an admirable race to finish seventh \u2013 all the more commendable considering the air-miles he&apos;s clocked up recently. In a rare postscript for the Kentucky Derby, there don&apos;t appear to be any glaring hard-luck stories \u2013 the strung out nature of the field eliminating major traffic worries. As a result, Orb&apos;s vanquished foes will have to rethink their game-plan extensively if they hope to reverse the form with McGaughey&apos;s colt. In the immediate aftermath of the race, the cacophony soon turned to the question of Orb&apos;s chances of becoming the first horse to win the Triple Crown since Affirmed in 1978. There&apos;s plenty of time to cogitate the whys and wherefores of that possibility, however. For today at least, let&apos;s savor and enjoy what truly was a fine performance. Wise Dan Earlier in the day, the Churchill card showcased another fine win from Wise Dan. Last year&apos;s US Horse of the Year produced an authoritative display in the Woodford Reserve Turf Classic. In a generously run race considering the rain-sodden turf, trainer Charles LoPresti&apos;s six-year-old gelding was sat with mid-field before being produced in the straight. He drew away from Optimizer for a comfortable win, jockey Jose Lezcano riding. Wise Dan has now strung together a six-long string of Grade I victories. The Stephen Foster Handicap back at Churchill Downs, the race he came second in last year, would fit well into his schedule. Further along, a repeat trip to Santa Anita for the Breeders&apos; Cup must surely be his ultimate destination.", "title": "Orb wins 139th Kentucky Derby", "sentences": ["And it was a first Derby win for jockey Joel Rosario, who was adding this $2 million trophy haul to the $10 million Dubai World cup picked up only a couple of months ago.", "&quot;To win the Dubai World Cup and then to win the Derby."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-05T04:24:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/may/05/godolphin-steroids-sheikh-mohammed", "tags": ["Godolphin", "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Drugs in sport", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "If Sheikh Mohammed was under any illusions about the attention, and the questions, he would attract when he made his first trip to a racecourse since the Godolphin doping scandal broke, all were dispelled on Saturday in the time it took Clare Balding to mention the British Horseracing Authority&apos;s inquiry into the case during a brief interview after the 2,000 Guineas. &quot;That&apos;s up to them,&quot; snapped the man who founded Godolphin, hired Mahmood al-Zarooni, and then paid the trainer&apos;s wages during three years in charge at Moulton Paddocks. As he turned away, the world&apos;s most powerful owner could not conceal his anger. Dawn Approach, a brilliant five-length winner, had just carried the royal blue Godolphin colours to victory in the 2,000 Guineas for the first time in 14 years, yet the glow had lasted scarcely a minute. And this was a colt that had, almost uniquely for Godolphin, spent the winter in Ireland, hundreds of miles from Moulton Paddocks and several thousand miles away from Dubai. Thanks to Zarooni, however, the first thing on many minds as the horse passed the post was the steroid-doping scandal. Zarooni has tainted the Godolphin brand, and all that is associated with it. It will remain tainted for the foreseeable future, until the Derby on 1 June, in which Dawn Approach could well become Godolphin&apos;s much-coveted first winner, and beyond. Sheikh Mohammed is not accustomed to being challenged, nor will he enjoy being part of a narrative over which he cannot exercise complete control, but a refusal to address the issue publicly can only make things worse. So many questions remain, both for Godolphin and the BHA, which published the written reasons for its disciplinary panel&apos;s decision to ban Zarooni for eight years early last week. As had always seemed likely, the remarkable haste with which Zarooni was charged, tried and then expelled from racing meant that the account of the case which emerged from the BHA, while plausible enough as far as it went, was hopelessly incomplete. The whiff of Dick Francis about Zarooni&apos;s habit of passing syringes of steroids to stable staff through a car window attracted much attention \u2013 though he was hardly going to walk around the boxes yelling &quot;juice time&quot; \u2013 but the gaps in the account were painfully obvious too. The most pressing question that no one seems to have had time to ask Zarooni is: why? An answer to that might then beg the supplementary question: how long? Because we are being asked to believe that, in effect, Zarooni woke up one morning, three years into his training career at one of the biggest yards in Newmarket, and decided to start doping his horses with steroids. It is possible, of course. Zarooni, like any trainer at the top of the game, was under immense pressure to succeed. He was familiar with steroids and their ability to boost a horse&apos;s condition and appetite for exercise, so perhaps, one day, the urge to tip the odds in his favour was suddenly more than he could resist. But it is also possible that he succumbed to the temptation much earlier, perhaps from the moment he took over at Moulton Paddocks in the spring of 2010. We just don&apos;t know and, as yet, neither the BHA nor Godolphin seems much closer to an answer either. Godolphin is still conducting its own investigation into the doping, though with no indication as to when, or if, the results will be publicised. But these are questions that it will be difficult for Godolphin itself to resolve, since the answers will determine whether Sheikh Mohammed himself can be held responsible for the actions of his staff. Anabolic steroids are powerful drugs which have significant, and rapid, effects. Nitrotain \u2013 the brand name of ethylestranol, the steroid used by Zarooni on 11 of the 15 horses he has admitted to doping \u2013 acts swiftly, clears the system in less than a week, and is normally administered daily. That is not far short of 100 administrations per week. So it is pushes credibility to breaking point to imagine that no one at Moulton Paddocks beyond Zarooni and three associates \u2013 who were, apparently, unaware of what was in the syringes \u2013 harboured any suspicions about what might be going on. And if there were staff at Moulton Paddocks with concerns about what Zarooni might be up to, why did no one blow the whistle to the senior management? Fear, perhaps? And what might that say about the management structure set up by Godolphin&apos;s founder, who is a famously hands-on boss?

The appeal, which is confined to the length of the ban and is not made against the conviction itself, came as a surprise to many, despite a Facebook account in Zarooni&apos;s name suggesting last week that he would take such action. No date has yet been set for the appeal hearing, in contrast to the haste with which the matter was originally dealt with. The British Horseracing Authority&apos;s disciplinary panel heard the case and issued its verdict just three days after charges were issued against Zarooni last month, but a spokesman for the BHA said on Tuesday it was not yet clear how quickly an appeal panel could be convened. Zarooni appears to have indulged in a certain amount of brinksmanship in submitting the necessary paperwork, which reached the BHA mid-afternoon on Tuesday. The deadline for making an appeal was widely reported as being 5pm on Monday and it only emerged on Tuesday morning that the deadline had been held over 24 hours because of the Bank Holiday. The development was signalled last week, when a posting appeared on a Facebook account in Zarooni&apos;s name, saying: &quot;I have been advised to appeal the case, what are your opinions?&quot; However, the authenticity of the account has been widely doubted. The BHA has not yet been advised as to the basis for Zarooni&apos;s appeal and he is not obliged to offer specifics until the hearing itself, beyond stating his intention to argue for a more lenient penalty. He had no representation at the first hearing, despite early indications that he had hired the solicitor Gavin Bacon, but he has engaged William Clegg QC to represent him this time. Clegg&apos;s biography states that he has &quot;appeared before various professional regulatory and disciplinary bodies&quot; and that he has worked with lawyers in Dubai, Zarooni&apos;s home. Zarooni&apos;s solicitors are now the London-based firm Russell Cooke, where his case is being handled by two partners including Matt Bosworth, whose online profile describes a background in sports law and that he advises Newcastle United FC on media coverage of the club. The BHA&apos;s panel described Zarooni as acting alone when applying steroids to a total of 15 horses and reported that he instructed junior members of staff to inject horses with the contents of unmarked syringes. Even so, the case has been profoundly embarrassing to his former employers at Godolphin, the racing operation of Dubai&apos;s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed, who refused to discuss it in a live interview on Channel 4 at the weekend. On Tuesday, that policy was followed by Godolphin&apos;s spokesman, Simon Crisford, who said: &quot;This is a matter between Mahmood al-Zarooni and the BHA. It has nothing whatsoever to do with Godolphin.&quot; The BHA confined itself to a terse statement confirming the appeal, which went on to say that all horses formerly trained in Newmarket by Zarooni have now been tested and the results will be published &quot;in due course&quot;. Privately, there is some dismay amongst officials that the matter cannot yet be filed and forgotten, that it will undermine racing coverage in the buildup to the Derby on 1 June, just as it all but wiped out advance coverage of last Saturday&apos;s 2,000 Guineas. Meanwhile, in a sign that Sheikh Mohammed is not yet ready to distance himself from racing, it was revealed that he has bought the exciting Irish colt Fort Knox, who is trained by Tommy Carmody and will now be aimed at the Irish 2,000 Guineas a fortnight on Saturday. Johnny Murtagh, who owns Carmody&apos;s yard, said the horse would race in the Sheikh&apos;s own maroon silks rather than the royal blue of Godolphin.", "title": "Mahmood al-Zarooni lodges surprise appeal over Godolphin steroids ban", "sentences": ["Clegg&apos;s biography states that he has &quot;appeared before various professional regulatory and disciplinary bodies&quot; and that he has worked with lawyers in Dubai, Zarooni&apos;s home.", "Even so, the case has been profoundly embarrassing to his former employers at Godolphin, the racing operation of Dubai&apos;s ruler, Sheikh Mohammed, who refused to discuss it in a live interview on Channel 4 at the weekend."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-07T15:30:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/08/set-of-six-daryl-powell-castleford", "tags": ["Castleford", "Super League", "Super League XVIII", "Rugby league", "Sport", "Widnes Vikings", "Leeds Rhinos", "Huddersfield Giants", "Melbourne Storm"], "article": "1) Powell gives class to Cas When it emerged that Castleford were about to announce the dismissal of Ian Millward as their coach, I happened to be in the Carnegie Cafe Bar at Headingley, and wondered aloud to Gary Hetherington, the Leeds chief executive who happened to be walking past our table, who on earth would take the Tigers job next. &quot;Daryl Powell,&quot; he answered straight away. But I couldn&apos;t work out why Powell would swap his position at Featherstone Rovers, who would appear to be upwardly mobile after several successful seasons in the Championship including a famous win against Cas in the Challenge Cup last year, for what appears to be a poisoned chalice down Wheldon Road. Which all goes to prove two things. First, Gary Hetherington knows much more about what is occurring in rugby league than us journalists. Second, that all is not lost for Cas. As Brian Noble said in relation to his Salford team after their heavy defeat at Wigan last Friday, showing that he has not lost his pithy quoteability: &quot;There&apos;s still a pulse.&quot; Powell&apos;s acceptance of the job showers credibility on Castleford, and how they needed it. More significantly, how the game needed it. Sunday&apos;s attendance of 6,474, which I&apos;m guessing was boosted by the usual travelling support from Hull KR, was a reminder that if play-off places were determined on crowd numbers, Cas would never miss out on the top eight. How Ken Davy, who has been such a generous supporter of the Huddersfield Giants for the last decade, must wish that he was emotionally involved in a town where league held such appeal. Perhaps it&apos;s something to do with my age, but I&apos;ve always regarded the Tigers as one of the stronger brands \u2013 horrible word, sorry, but think it&apos;s appropriate here \u2013 in British rugby league. Something to do with Classy Cas, Malcolm Reilly, Hardisty and Hepworth, and more recently that terrific play-off run under Stuart Raper. They just need to reach out a bit, perhaps to the east Midlands where the other code has some pretty useful Tigers of its own (even if they do play in green, red and white). Suddenly those Cas fans can be cheerful again. Two wins in their past three league games to climb off the bottom of the table under Danny Orr, the local lad who is surely a head coach of the future, but will now revert to a low-profile role. The appointment of Powell, who has been such an impressive character since the start of his playing career. Even the assertion from the chief executive, Steve Gill, that Rangi Chase will be staying for the rest of the season, which is also terrific news for the England coach, Steve McNamara \u2013 for an explanation see last week&apos;s Set of Six. 2) Homegrown heroes for Widnes Talking of last week&apos;s Six, it would be remiss not to salute Widnes, not only for the outstanding result they achieved at St Helens last Friday \u2013 their first win on Merseyside in the Super League era \u2013 but also for the team with which it was achieved. Maybe through circumstance rather than design, Denis Betts selected a 17 including only three overseas players, and it sounds like Jack Owens, the young full-back of whom the Vikings hold such high hopes, had a blinder. Widnes will now head to the far north-west for a cup fifth-round tie at Workington Town on Sunday, which promises to be a super occasion, with a realistic sniff of Wembley for the first time in decades. 3) Splashdown Talking of Wembley, there&apos;s a high-calibre book launch coming up this weekend for a celebration of probably the most famous Challenge Cup final of them all. David Hinchliffe, the former Labour MP for Wakefield, was at Wembley in 1968 when Don Fox toe-poked wide from in front of the posts, and has been researching what happened that day, the background to the game and its implications \u2013 some of them tragic \u2013 for some time to produce &quot;They Walked on Water&quot; \u2013 the title reflecting the fact that the match is remembered not only for Fox, the &quot;Poor Lad&quot; of Eddie Waring&apos;s commentary, but also as the Watersplash Final. 4) Keeping it alive Highlight of the last week? The first Kallum Watkins try for Leeds at Bradford was a belter \u2013 surely confirming him as the most exciting British centre since Paul Newlove, at least (sorry Keef). There were also those big wins for Cas and Widnes, and terrific results in the Championship for Doncaster, Workington, Oxford and the long-suffering Gateshead Thunder. Please comment on them below \u2013 I&apos;d love to hear from someone who was at Iffley Road, or for that matter Blaydon. But if you didn&apos;t see the Premier Sports coverage of Swinton&apos;s home game against Whitehaven last Thursday night, have a look at this. Not so much for RefCam, which the former Great Britain captain Garry Schofield has already dismissed as &quot;the most comical image in the game for many a year ... he looked like the Hunchback of Notre Dame&quot;. It was Whitehaven&apos;s desperate attempts to keep the ball alive for a match-winning try after the final hooter has sounded that made the night, which also saw the comeback of Lee Briers in a splendidly old-fashioned blue and white Swinton jersey, memorable. How many phases? 5) Green shoots As for the result of the week, that came in Melbourne, where the Canberra Raiders, aka the Green Machine, revived memories of former glories, Mal Meninga and all that, with a 24-20 win against the Storm at AAMI Park \u2013 becoming the first team to beat Craig Bellamy&apos;s boys in 17 matches stretching back to July 2012. How about that try by Reece Robinson? But Melbourne remain the team to beat, and it was intriguing to hear whispers from Victoria that their new chief executive will be Mark Evans \u2013 a major player in rugby union in this country after playing a leading role in the revival of the Harlequins, but always a man who has shown a soft spot for league, and who could prove an inspired appointment to help promote the double header of World Cup semi-finals at Wembley. 6) Of Donkeys and Dubai Finally, congratulations to the wonderfully named Pia Donkeys, the new French champions after their win against St Esteve \u2013 who are basically the Catalan Dragons development team. There also seem to have been some positive international developments this week in South Africa \u2013 who will enter the Student World Cup later this summer, and have also gained formal recognition on the Western Cape \u2013 and Italy, where despite the ongoing and damaging split between two rival factions, enthusiasts continue to mobilise, and Anthony Minichiello, the Sydney Roosters and former Australia full-back who will lead their World Cup challenge, has even started learning the language!

For Sheikh Mohammed, Godolphin&apos;s founder, however, the response is more likely to have been a mixture of fury and frustration. It is not just that it is all the more difficult to draw a line under the doping and attempt to move on while Zarooni&apos;s appeal is pending, but the ex-trainer&apos;s decision also reinforces the impression that this story now has a momentum of its own. Sheikh Mohammed has been ruler of Dubai since 1995, and he is used to being in charge and being obeyed, but the present situation refuses to bend to his will. For those in search of answers to the many questions that remain about the Godolphin dopings, however, Zarooni&apos;s decision to appeal must be welcome news. The proceedings will not be open to reporters, despite the huge public interest in the story, as the media can report only those hearings which deal with running and riding offences. As he seeks to mitigate his penalty, however, Zarooni will inevitably provide a much more detailed account of what went on at his stable a few weeks ago than anything we have received to date. When the original case was heard by the British Horseracing Authority&apos;s disciplinary panel on 25 April, less than 72 hours after news of the doping broke, Zarooni did not have any legal representation. His only companion as he was tried, convicted, sentenced and, in professional terms, executed in the space of a few hours was Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, who helped Zarooni to fight his way through a wolfpack of photographers outside the BHA&apos;s offices, but looked all the while as though he would have preferred to let them tear Zarooni apart. At his appeal, however, Zarooni will be represented by William Clegg QC, one of the most senior and formidable operators in the business, and Clegg will in turn be advised by two specialist solicitors. Zarooni and his team will also have had plenty of time to get their story straight. The points that Zarooni and his advisors eventually decide to advance as mitigating factors will not be apparent until the appeal board publishes its findings, but this will be his one and only chance to pluck something from the wreckage of his career. There will be no reason to leave anything out, and every incentive to suggest that it would have been difficult to dope 15 horses at one of the biggest yards in Newmarket without at least a little of the blame being apportioned elsewhere. It will be up to the appeal panel to decide where the truth lies. Unlike the original hearing, this one will not be done and dusted within a few days. The QCs on both sides will need to compare their diaries before a date can be set, and while the word from the BHA is that Zarooni&apos;s appeal might be heard within the next two weeks, it is possible too that it will not even be this month. That will prolong the agony still further for Sheikh Mohammed and Godolphin, as they prepare to send Dawn Approach, the strong favourite, to the Derby in early June.

The attack on Ali Haider Gilani, the 27- year-old son of a former prime minister, happened on the final day of official campaigning in a contest made all the more unpredictable by the momentum gained in recent days by Khan, a former cricket star hoping to transform politics. Gilani, who is standing for a seat in the provincial assembly of Punjab province, was kidnapped after bearded gunmen who had arrived by car and motorbikes opened fire at a campaign gathering in the city of Multan. Two guards who attempted to shield him from a volley of gunfire were killed and several other people were injured, including the candidate himself who was reportedly bleeding as he was dragged into a black vehicle and whisked away. The snatching of the son of Yousuf Raza Gilani, who was disqualified as prime minister in June last year, represents one of the most high profile attacks in a campaign hit by daily acts of violence. More than 100 people have been killed during the campaign by attacks launched by the Pakistani Taliban which has singled out three leading secular parties for attention, including Gilani&apos;s Pakistan Peoples party (PPP). The threats have forced PPP candidates to abandon the traditional public engagements and vast rallies that characterise politics in South Asia. Instead they have relied on a largely policy-free advertising campaign which has eulogised Benazir Bhutto, a PPP leader assassinated in 2007. On Thursday it was reported that the party&apos;s chairman, Bhutto&apos;s 24-year-old son, Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, would probably not vote because of the security threats to him. The heir to the Bhutto political dynasty has even spent portions of the campaign in Dubai. He wound up the PPP&apos;s campaign no Thursday with a video address to supporters in Islamabad that was dwarfed by the one thrown by Khan&apos;s Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party (PTI). The Gilani family, landowning powerbrokers who have long enjoyed local influence as shrine custodians, dominate Multan and news of the kidnapping sparked protests across the city. In addition to the seat contested in the provincial assembly, three other members of Ali Haider Gilani&apos;s immediate family, including two of his brothers, are contesting seats in the national assembly. Although the culprits were not immediately identified, some members of the Gilani family laid the blame at banned Sunni sectarian militant groups Sipah-e-Sahaba and Lashkar-e-Jhangvi. They said the young candidate had become a hate figure from the militants after campaigning for votes from the city&apos;s minority Shia community. Some of his brothers vowed to boycott the election but Yousuf Raza Gilani told PPP supporters to remain calm. &quot;We will not derail democracy in the country due to my son,&quot; he said. &quot;I will sacrifice my son for democracy in the country.&quot; Authorities have long been concerned that an upsurge in violence could suppress turn out. According to a letter issued by the Pakistani Taliban leader, Hakimullah Mehsud, militants are under instruction to carry out suicide bomb attacks across the country during polling on Saturday. &quot;We don&apos;t accept the system of infidels which is called democracy,&quot; Mehsud said in the letter, dated May 1. But despite the threats of violence the mood on Thursday night was one of intense excitement, with broadcasters unveiling special election coverage studios and the leading parties rounding off their campaigns with a final burst of political theatre. Nawaz Sharif, the frontrunner and head of his own faction of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N), addressed a final rally in his home town of Lahore. But broadcasters cut away from the hoarse and visibly exhausted former two-time prime minister to show extraordinary scenes from Islamabad where a huge crowd had filled the city&apos;s expansive main avenue to listen to live video address from Imran Khan, who hopes to sweep away the PML-N. Khan has been resting in hospital in Lahore since Tuesday night after suffering serious injuries to his back after tumbling some 15 foot from a stage at a rally. The former national cricket captain who has inspired an army of young supporters with his promise to deliver a &quot;New Pakistan&quot; appeared on giant screens lying in bed, his head surrounded by Pakistani flags. Talking softly to an estimated crowd of 25,000 he told his supporters that they had a &quot;golden opportunity&quot; to change Pakistan. &quot;My message for you is that you have got a chance and you should seize it,&quot; he said. The party has made the most of Khan&apos;s hospitalisation by continuously broadcasting television adverts showing the PTI founder in hospital just hours after his fall. The sight of Khan, wearing a neck brace and lying flat in bed, engendered huge public sympathy for a man who has successfully created a sense of surging momentum in the last days of the campaign. The late rise of Khan has made predicting the final outcome extremely difficult. Although most analysts anticipate a hung parliament, estimates for the number of seats the PTI might win vary enormously. Even 10 seats \u2013 now at the low end of most predictions \u2013 would represent a breakthrough for Khan whose party has only ever won a single seat in the past.", "title": "Former Pakistan PM Gilani's son shot and kidnapped at rally", "sentences": ["The heir to the Bhutto political dynasty has even spent portions of the campaign in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-09T17:38:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/may/10/hugh-muir-diary-priti-patel", "tags": ["Politics", "UK news", "Priti Patel"], "article": "\u2022 Quite the worst outcome of the row surrounding Tory star Priti Patel and her father&apos;s very public allegiance to Ukip was that some might have questioned her own loyalty. One does routinely sense in the MP for Witham a certain exasperation with the dominant Cameroon strain of Tory politics, sullied as it is by association with the Lib Dems. But if there are doubts, Priti is busy putting them to rest by showing a positively Thatcherite zeal about the finances and making ministers account for every penny. To that end, we note that she has tabled some 230 written parliamentary questions since the Commons returned from its Easter recess on 15 April. It does show an enthusiasm for the task and may benefit us all in the long run, but in the short term proves expensive. According to the Commons authorities, each question costs \u00a3164 to answer. That\u00a0being so, Priti&apos;s cost to the taxpayer has been around \u00a337,720 in just two weeks. This is 57% of her salary. A tough one. Which is worse, the ailment or the cure? \u2022 After two mentions in quick succession, the English Democrats are back in touch. They don&apos;t mind the Guardian mockery, because that sort of thing happens all the time. But they&apos;re not sure they deserve to be branded &quot;rightwing&quot;. And it is true that when we peruse the manifesto, we find a mixed bag: calls for the UK to withdraw from the 1951 UN convention on refugees, to favour the promotion of marital families &quot;consisting of mother, father and children&quot;, to &quot;refuse to accept any further asylum seekers&quot;, and to repeal the Human Rights Act. But also a cry for the abolition of higher education fees, for an inquiry into &quot;the pros and cons of legalising the use of cannabis&quot;, a pledge to review, perhaps reduce, the number of criminal offences, and an endorsement of a low-carbon economy. A bit of a curate&apos;s egg, really. We&apos;ll hurl those instead. \u2022 For all its reactionary populism, the Queen&apos;s speech was massively overshadowed by news of Sir Alex\u00a0Ferguson&apos;s departure from Manchester United. Another victory for those who believe football is life and life is football. Tony Blair&apos;s former agent, John Burton, appears to be one of them. This week, as our hero celebrated his 60th year, Burton recalled his first meeting with the man who would lead Labour to three election victories. Blair had travelled to Trimdon in search of Labour&apos;s Sedgefield candidacy. &quot;We had a prearranged meeting but the football was also on,&quot; says Burton. &quot;It was a big game \u2013 Aberdeen versus Real Madrid \u2013 and then it went to penalties and we made him wait for about two hours while we watched the game.&quot; Shame there wasn&apos;t a replay delayed until the following week. \u2022 Journalists can never keep a good story to themselves, as you know. But there are exceptions. Hugo Dixon, formerly of Lex in the Financial Times, made it big with his Breaking Views website, which he set up\u00a0in 1999. It had a tough start, but soon\u00a0it flourished, and he sold it to Thomson Reuters in 2009. Since then, it has \u2013 like a thousand flowers \u2013 bloomed, all over the world, in India, China, Dubai, New York. But how much did Hugo get for his niche pot of gold? He seemed very reluctant to tell that story in the Oxford Cloisters this week until an audience member pointed out that his own website names the sale price as \u00a323m. And what next? Hugo turns his back on mammon for a bit to do a philosophy degree at Birkbeck College in London. \u2022 Great sadness, finally, at the death at 88 of the great British biblical scholar Geza Vermes. He was a sweet-natured, scholarly man of Hungarian Jewish origins, who survived the Holocaust, became a Catholic and later reconverted to Jewry. In 2004, on the release of Mel Gibson&apos;s bloodthirsty film The Passion of the Christ, with all its claims of authenticity, the Guardian took him to a press preview. As the audience recoiled from the scenes of bloody violence, we could hear him chortling. Why so? &quot;It&apos;s quite obvious that none of the actors could speak Aramaic,&quot; he told us afterwards. He knew hokum when he saw it.

But despite reports suggesting that David Cameron would ban this type of prize, it seems that private schools still have a taste for it. Westminster school, whose former alumni include Nick Clegg and Helena Bonham Carter, is offering open bids on internships at a range of companies in lucrative job sectors. Fancy a career in the law?

Of course lots of PTAs run auctions, but the kind of prize state school parents tend to offer isn&apos;t going to get you past security at Coutts (offers over \u00a3301, at the time of going to press). Nevertheless, state school auctions can still raise surprising sums. At Hollymount primary school in south-west London, mum Lucy Hatley says she was &quot;weeping on the stage saying thank you to everyone&quot; when the\u00a0auction raised \u00a314,000. The school used the money to rebuild a school playground that the council couldn&apos;t afford to pay for.\u00a0There weren&apos;t any internships on offer \u2013 the closest thing to work experience was &quot;being headmistress for a day&quot; (\u00a3260 bid). A &quot;home-cooked Indian meal for four&quot; went for \u00a345, as did a &quot;personalised poem, written especially for you&quot;. Mr Hatley, it turns out, will be servicing a family&apos;s bikes for the sum of \u00a3140. An hour and a half of bouncy-castle playtime went for \u00a390. The highest bid was \u00a31,600 for a week in a cottage in Brittany. Don&apos;t suppose anyone will get a foot on the career ladder or any juicy contacts from the Hollymount auction, but their prizes sound a lot more fun than paying top whack to spend a week traipsing round after a banker in your half-term holiday. \u2022 This article was amended at 17:30 on May 14 2013 to remove Martin Amis from the list of former Westminster pupils.

I was travelling alone with my 15-month-old baby. I arrived in Dubai on time and followed an Emirates representative to the gate for my onward flight. I was denied boarding and the staff refused to tell me why. I waited two hours and, eventually, I was given a hotel voucher and boarding passes for a flight the following day. This was the limit of the assistance offered. I was then sent to wait for a transfer bus. I was made to hand over the buggy so I had no option but to hold my baby for over an hour. Eventually, an unmarked minibus arrived (no baby seat) and took us to a hotel which was not the hotel we expected. I had been given an absolute assurance by transfer desk staff that there would be water and a cot for my baby. I made further requests on arrival but neither were ever made available. The hotel room was dirty with half-eaten food in the fridge. By this time only one hour remained before we travelled back to the airport. I had no opportunity to shower since I could not leave my baby asleep on the bed. By this time, I was in a state of utter distress with an exhausted baby and a feeling of total helplessness. The entire experience was frightening and exhausting and has impacted heavily on my first few precious days in Sydney with my sister. I chose to fly with Emirates partly as I was assured of support while travelling alone. JL, Sheffield If you are delayed when travelling with an airline based in the EU, or with a non-EU-based airline flying from an EU airport, then you&apos;re protected by the Denied Boarding Regulation which states that the airline has an obligation to offer you assistance if your flight delay is expected to go beyond a certain point. You are also entitled to compensation, which varies depending on the length of delay and distance travelled. Although Emirates is a non-EU based airline, the delayed flight originated from an EU destination (Manchester) so you should be entitled to compensation. We put this to Emirates and it argued that the delay was less than three hours \u2013 which it said means you can&apos;t make a claim. We checked this with the Civil Aviation Authority, which confirmed our view that under EC261 (Delayed Boarding Regs) the delay is measured by the arrival time at the final destination, which in this case was Sydney, not Dubai. You were 24 hours late reaching Sydney and are therefore entitled to compensation. Quite aside from this, is the issue of the way you were treated. There is also a question mark over Emirates&apos; flight schedules. It admits that you need a minimum of 75 minutes to change flights in Dubai \u2013 yet its schedule only gave you 75 minutes. So even a five-minute delay would have put you, and all the other passengers who were transferring from the Manchester to Sydney flight, in the same position. We put all this to Emirates but it ignored our latter point about the schedule and is sticking to its guns on the former. It said in a statement that it did everything &quot;in accordance with Emirates policy&quot; and that it had previously responded to you with a gesture of goodwill (some air miles) &quot;to apologise that the care and assistance provided did not meet with the customer&apos;s expectations&quot;. We suggest that you contact the CAA directly to pursue your case for compensation. You should be entitled to the minimum \u20ac600 (\u00a3507) for seriously delayed flights of more than 3,500km between an EU and a non-EU airport. It&apos;s a shame that Emirates will not, meanwhile, recognise its apparent poor customer care and offer you something more by way of apology. As you say, air miles that you have no intention of using don&apos;t cut it. It tarnishes the reputation of what is supposed to be one of the world&apos;s better airlines.

Secret Number is being aimed at Thursday&apos;s Dante Stakes at York, the final significant trial for the Epsom Classic, and his trainer, Saeed bin Suroor, was enthusiastic about his prospects on Monday. &quot;He worked [on Sunday] and went really nicely,&quot; said Bin Suroor, who won the Derby at his first attempt with Lammtarra in 1995 but has since fielded 20 beaten runners. &quot;I think York racecourse will suit him, so we&apos;ll see how he runs but I&apos;m really happy with him.&quot; Secret Number is flying well below the radar of most punters and is widely available at 33-1 for the Derby on 1 June but looked a top-class prospect in winning his first two races, including a Listed contest in Dubai. He was last seen when third in the UAE Derby in late March \u2013 he ruined his chances with a slow start but was flying home at the finish. Bin Suroor clearly feels the extra furlong and more galloping track on Thursday will help him and that the Derby distance should prove ideal. &quot;A mile and a half will be the best trip for him,&quot; the trainer said. Secret Number faces a serious test in the Dante, when his rivals are expected to include the Highclere-owned pair Telescope and Greatwood as well as Windhoek, Trading Leather and Indian Chief. Stan James offered him at 8-1 when pricing the race up on Monday. Sheikh Mohammed has never yet seen the royal blue colours of his Godolphin operation carried to Derby victory and a first success in this year&apos;s renewal would be timely in view of the steroid scandal that recently resulted in an eight-year ban for one of Godolphin&apos;s trainers, Mahmood al-Zarooni, who is pursuing an appeal. One result of that scandal is that all of Bin Suroor&apos;s horses have been blood tested by the British Horseracing Authority, even though he is not suspected of involvement in Zarooni&apos;s steroid use. The BHA are still unable to confirm a date when those results will be published but they are expected this week or next. Bin Suroor, who has often experienced slow starts to the British season, is still waiting for his first winner this year but sounded confident that the wait would not last long. &quot;We haven&apos;t had many runners this season as a lot of them were 100% for Dubai. Last week, most of our horses worked really well. Eighty-five per cent are ready to run and fit and soon you will see more runners from our stable.&quot; Bin Suroor was cautious, however, when discussing the chance of Farhh, the 100-30 favourite for Saturday&apos;s Lockinge Stakes at Newbury. &quot;I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll need the race,&quot; the trainer said, explaining that the horse had undergone surgery for a chip on his ankle over the winter. The Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes at Royal Ascot appears to be Farhh&apos;s main target. Andr\u00e9 Fabre is another trainer who will seek his second Derby victory next month, as the Frenchman confirmed his Ocovango is being aimed at Epsom. Fabre will save Intello, an unlucky third in the French 2,000 Guineas on Sunday, for the French Derby.

If Imran Khan had contested in west London he would have won hands-down. But since this is Pakistan, he has won in Peshawar and two other cities. His party is set to form a government in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, that north-western frontier province of Pakistan which Khan&apos;s profile writers never fail to remind us is the province that borders Afghanistan and the tribal areas that the world is so scared of. Or as some others never fail to remind the world: the land of the fierce pathans. It&apos;s true that Khan ran a fierce, bloody-minded campaign, drawing huge crowds. When his campaign culminated in a televised tumble from a stage, during a public rally, the whole nation held its breath. Khan galvanised not only Pakistan&apos;s parasitical upper classes but also found support among the country&apos;s young men and women of all ages; basically the kind of people who use the words politics and politician as common insults. He inspired drawing-room revolutionaries to go out and stand in the blistering heat for hours on end to vote for him. For a few months he made politics hip in Pakistan. Partly, he was relying on votes from Pakistan&apos;s posh locales. He probably forgot that there was a slight problem there: not enough posh locales in Pakistan. There were kids who flew in from Chicago, from Birmingham to vote for him. Again, there are not enough Pakistani kids living and studying in Chicago and Birmingham. He appealed to the educated middle classes but Pakistan&apos;s main problem is that there aren&apos;t enough educated urban middle-class citizens in the country. And the masses, it appears, were not really clamouring for a revolution but for electricity. From the gossip columns of British tabloids to massive political rallies across Pakistan, Khan has been on a meaningful journey. In his campaign speeches, his blatantly Blairite message of New Pakistan did appeal to people but he really tested his supporters&apos; attention span when he started to lecture them about how the Scandinavian welfare state model is borrowed from the early days of the Islamic empire in Arabia. Amateur historians have never fared well in Pakistani politics. Or anywhere else. Khan promised to turn Pakistan into Sweden, Norway or any one of those countries where everyone is blond and pays tax. His opponents promised Dubai \u2013 where everyone is either a bonded labourer or a property speculator and no one pays taxes \u2013 and won. It&apos;s a bit of a fairytale that Khan, whose message was directed at educated urban voters, has found supporters in the north-western frontier province that profile writers must remind us is largely tribal and the front line of the world&apos;s war on terror. Khan has led a popular campaign against drone attacks. He has promised that he will shoot down drones, look Americans in the eye, sit down with the Taliban over a cup of qahwa and sort this mess out. So we finally have someone who feels at home in Mayfair as well as Peshawar. He finally has the chance to rule Peshawar. Slight problem: as he speaks no Pashto, the language of the Pathans. But his first fight will be against American drones hovering in the sky. And drones speak no Pashto either. If Khan can win this match, he can challenge Nawaz Sharif in the next elections. Is this Nawaz Sharif man for real?     Nawaz Sharif at a campaign rally in Liaquat Bagh, Pakistan. Photograph: T. MUGHAL/EPA    Hasn&apos;t he been tried before? Twice? It seems voters in the largest province of Pakistani Punjab just can&apos;t have enough of this guy. At every campaign stop, Sharif reminded his supporters of two of his biggest achievements: I built the motorway, I built the bomb. He did build Pakistan&apos;s first motorway. And despite several phone calls from the then American president Bill Clinton and other world leaders and offers of million of dollars in aid, Sharif did go ahead and order six nuclear explosions in response to India&apos;s five. And then he thought that now that both countries have the bomb he could go ahead and be friends with India. While he was making history hosting the Indian prime minister in the historic city of Lahore, his generals were busy elsewhere repeating history on the mountains of Kargil. In a misadventure typical of Pakistani generals, they occupied the abandoned posts and then pretended that these were mujahideen fighting India and not regular Pakistan army soldiers. When India reacted with overwhelming force and a diplomatic offensive, Sharif pleaded ignorance and rushed off to Washington to bail out the army and his own government. President Clinton praised his diplomatic skills and the crisis was resolved briefly. When, months later he tried to fire his handpicked army chief General Pervez Musharraf, the architect of the Kargil fiasco, a bunch of army officers put their guns to Sharif&apos;s head. Handcuffed, jailed, sentenced to life imprisonment, in the end Sharif was saved by his powerful friends in Saudi Arabia. A royal jet flew him, his family and his servants to a palace in Saudi Arabia. An exile in Saudi Arabia for Muslim rulers is generally considered a permanent retirement home where you get closer to Allah and atone for past sins. Sharif must be the only politician in exile in Saudi Arabia who not only managed to survive this holy exile but in the process got a hair transplant and managed to hold on to his political base in Pakistan. Many of his political opponents say that if Sharif wasn&apos;t from the dominant province Punjab, where most of the army elite comes from, if he didn&apos;t represent the trading and business classes of Punjab, he would still be begging forgiveness for his sins in Saudi. But he returned just before the last elections and has been behaving like a\u00a0statesman. A very rich statesman. It has yet to be proven whether eight years of exile in Saudi Arabia can make anyone wiser but it has never made anybody poorer. Sharif was rich before he got into politics, then he became fabulously rich. Even in exile the Saudis gave him a palace and, on his return, a fleet of bulletproof limousines. His campaign proved that poor people don&apos;t really vote for somebody who understands poverty, or wants to do anything about it. People have voted him in because he talks money, talks about spending money, talks about opening a bank on every village street and who doesn&apos;t like that? He has promised motorway connections and airports to towns so small that they still don&apos;t have a proper bus station. Poor people, who couldn&apos;t afford a bicycle at the time of the elections, like to be promised an airport. You never know when you might need it. In his five years&apos; rule in Punjab, Sharif&apos;s party has had one policy about the Pakistani Taliban who have been wreaking havoc in parts of Pakistan: please go and do your business elsewhere. And they have generally obliged. But now that he is set to rule all of Pakistan, what&apos;s he going to tell them? Have we defeated the Taliban or\u00a0sent them a friend request?      A voter displays her inked thumb after marking her ballot paper at a polling station in Karachi. Photograph: Athar Hussain/REUTERS    When Pakistan decided to throw itself an election party, the first ones to arrive were the Taliban. They weren&apos;t really interested in the party because they keep reminding us that elections are un-Islamic and a major sin on a par with educating girls. But they were interested in watching what party games were played and who got to play them. They decided that the three political parties that had ruled Pakistan for the past five years and taken a clear stand against the Taliban would be targeted. And the Taliban started their own campaign, targeting candidates and their supporters with bomb attacks and drive-by shootings. In one case, a candidate in Karachi was shot as he came out of a mosque. Along with his six-year-old son. The election campaign across Pakistan looked like this: some parties held huge rallies, in a carnival-type atmosphere with live tigers and massive music systems. Other candidates sneaked from one little corner meeting to another trying to remind people of their heroic stand against the Taliban. Many of the candidates were never seen in public. Many journalists refused to visit them because they were sitting targets. Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the public face of the ruling People&apos;s party, could only deliver a couple of video messages from Dubai. The other parties, the ones who were allowed to campaign freely, were grateful in their silence. When we look at the election results we must not forget that while the Pakistani Taliban didn&apos;t contest the elections as a political party, they did see themselves as kingmakers. In Pakistan&apos;s liberal media the Taliban are often described as brutes with an endless bloodlust. But by making allies and choosing partners they have demonstrated that they are at least as canny as the average campaigning politician. But in the end the Taliban failed to deliver the kind of devastation they had promised. They managed to kill about 130 people in eight weeks. In the past they have achieved that kind of number in a single day. Also, 60% of Pakistanis who came out to vote seem to be politely disagreeing with the Taliban by saying that there is nothing un-Islamic about standing in a queue and stamping a ballot paper. The Taliban&apos;s real success is that they bet on the winners. They promised not to attack Khan and Sharif&apos;s parties. And these parties will be in power. But the Taliban have never contested an election before. And they are soon to find out that politicians never keep the promises they make during the heat of the campaign. Why does this election mean nothing for Farzana Majeed?     Pakistani voters line up at a polling station in Karachi. Photograph: Athar Hussain/Reuters    Three weeks before the elections, a 27-year-old biochemistry graduate stood outside Karachi Press club. Farzana Majeed and a couple of dozen young people carried pictures of Zakir Majeed, a literature student who was abducted by Pakistan&apos;s military intelligence four years ago and since then has become one of the hundreds of missing Baloch people, mostly young, political activists. Their mutilated, tortured bodies turn up on the roadside with sickening regularity. The Pakistani media, otherwise quite noisy about every subject under the sun, stay quiet. None of the political parties campaigning in recent elections uttered a word about Zakir Majeed or hundreds of other people languishing in military-run dungeons. Why? Because it&apos;s a security issue. A militant separatist movement in parts of Balochistan means that the rest of Pakistan sees it as an enemy. The protesters distributed pamphlets encouraging the fellow Balochs not to participate in the elections. The voter turn out in Baloch areas in Balochistan has been less than 10%. No political party in the country had the heart to go and ask Farzana Majeed or thousands of other families to vote. Farzana is a polite, articulate person but mention the word elections and she is likely to wave her missing brother&apos;s picture in front of you. And just like Pakistan&apos;s last political government, the new one also doesn&apos;t want to see this picture. So what happens to the federation?     Watching the election results come in, in a teashop in Lahore. Photograph: Damir Sagolj/REUTERS    Who needs a federation when you can have so much more fun doing things your own way. So in the post-election Pakistan, Khan will rule the north and shoot down American drones while discussing Scandinavian social welfare models with the Taliban. Sharif will rule in Punjab and the centre, try to do business with India and build more motorways all the while looking over his shoulder for generals looking at him. In the south, Bhutto&apos;s decimated People&apos;s party will keep ruling and keep saying that folks up north are stealing its water, destroying its social welfare programmes and secular legacy. And, in Balochistan, Farzana Majeed will keep waving her missing brother&apos;s picture. Do these bits add up to a country? They do, if you are sitting in Islamabad and showing off your nuclear weapons to the world or planning a motorway to central Asia. But if you are an old woman waiting for her 2,000-rupee welfare cheque or a student activist in a military dungeon waiting for your next interrogation session, you are not likely to dream of motorways and new\u00a0airports. Pakistan as a federation has gone through its first rite of passage: handover of power from one elected civilian setup to another. It took Pakistan 67\u00a0years to get here. Let us not forget that the reasons that caused this delay haven&apos;t disappeared. Mohammed Hanif is BBC Urdu&apos;s special correspondent based in Karachi.

Ask any canvasser and they report grim news from the doorstep: whatever the issue \u2013 housing, jobs,\u00a0benefits \u2013 in these hard times the blame has been successfully diverted on to migrants for taking jobs and homes. Tighten the\u00a0screw, pull up the drawbridge, cut\u00a0off the attractions that draw them to the UK, but no political action is ever\u00a0enough to sate the demand for tougher border defences. The government frequently takes noisy public action, even when it knows some things are far worse than useless. Economically, it&apos;s madness to cut off valuable students from China and India for the sake of hitting a meaningless &quot;net&quot; migration statistic. Morally, some &quot;action&quot; means deliberately turning a blind eye to some abuse that would shock many of the same people who want immigration cut, if they knew. Britain is importing domestic slaves and ignoring what becomes of\u00a0them so long as they vanish from the official figures. Wealthy foreigners are encouraged to come to London to spend\u00a0their money, and last year they brought with them 15,745 domestic servants on overseas domestic worker visas. Rich families from India, Nigeria and the Middle East bring servants from\u00a0the Philippines, Indonesia or elsewhere, usually not their own country. A year ago the government changed the visa requirements, making these servants the absolute slaves of their employers, with no escape from frequently appalling abuse. In 1998 Labour took action to give these servants \u2013 almost all women \u2013 freedom to escape employers who often physically and sexually abuse them. And although they were still pitifully vulnerable, their treatment improved once they had the essential freedom to change jobs. The visa still had strict conditions: they had to find similar domestic work, with no recourse to public funds, proving their employment for annual visa renewal. But a year ago the government turned these women into powerless chattels of\u00a0their\u00a0employers by binding their visa\u00a0to work only for the family that brought them in. The inevitable result has been a dramatic worsening of their lives as bonded slaves. The charity Kalayaan acts as advocate and haven for foreign domestic workers: it lobbied Labour hard to win the visa change and won a Guardian charity award. Its figures tell the story of the effect of the new visa. Since it came in, all those arriving at its door are paid less than \u00a3100, compared with 60% before the new visa requirements came in. In all, 95% are paid less than \u00a350 a week with 62% never paid at all, up from 14% unpaid on the old visa. Why would employers pay when workers have no freedom to leave? Before the new visa, 31% had no room of their own; this has risen to 85% who often sleep in the kitchen or lounge with no bed or place for possessions. Most are permanently on call and get little sleep. None of them interviewed during the last year said they have any day off. Some 96% report that to prevent them running away they are never allowed out unsupervised. The stories I heard from escaped women at Kalayaan were shocking. &quot;Anna&quot; was brought in by a Nigerian family she already worked for: she is from another African country. But they returned and handed her on to their son&apos;s family, who took away her passport and paid her no wages, which she had previously been sending home for school fees for her three sisters. She was sometimes thrown out on to the doorstep in winter until morning. She worked unpaid in the family&apos;s shops and restaurant while cleaning and caring for the children. She ran away, with one plastic bag, speaking only French, and asked for help from the only person she knew \u2013 the children&apos;s schoolteacher \u2013 who kindly took her in and directed her to Kalayaan. Now she inhabits a limbo where so many end up, with no passport, no visa, and no work. Kalayaan says embassies are rarely helpful when employers have withheld passports, taking the side of the rich and powerful with political influence back home. &quot;Maria&quot;, from Indonesia, was brought to London from Dubai by an Arab family who beat, half-starved and threatened her. She escaped and waited in Victoria coach station until she heard someone speaking her language, who helped her. But under the new visa system Kalayaan has little to offer. Cheated, abused and brought in under false pretences, Maria could be designated as trafficked, but that doesn&apos;t help. The National Referral Mechanism would offer 45 days\u00a0of accommodation with the Salvation Army for a period of &quot;recovery&quot; and then she would be sent back. Legal aid cuts mean these people have no right to\u00a0representation \u2013 they will be deported, then vulnerable to the same trafficking and exploitation again. Workers on these visas now know\u00a0that there is little point in reporting abusive employers to the police: they\u00a0will just be deported for breaking the terms of their visa. In the last year many fewer people have turned to Kalayaan, knowing there is nothing they can do to sue their employer, get their passport and missing wages or help settle them with another job now that changing employer is illegal. Revenue &amp; Customs only has 100 officers to police the minimum wage across the whole country \u2013 and they don&apos;t go looking in rich foreign households where domestic worker visas are registered. So thousands vanish underground, where they are prone to every kind of exploitation \u2013 while undermining local pay rates. It would be better by far to regularise them and arrest their abusers, thereby protecting others in their vulnerable situation and deterring slave employers. David Cameron spoke at the opening of an anti-slavery exhibition in the House of Commons last month, designed to warn MPs of hidden slaves brought in by gangmasters, the trafficked children who vanish and the plight of these domestic serfs. Immigration minister Mark Harper was among 100 MPs gathered to hear the PM say: &quot;Modern-day slavery comes in many forms \u2026 we have to have a really concerted approach \u2026 to make sure that we look at the rights of those who are affected, and take a criminal approach.&quot; You wonder how he can speak the words, knowing what his new visa has done to make slavery a near-certainty for thousands every year. I doubt many people hearing the stories of women like &quot;Anna&quot; and &quot;Maria&quot; would consider creating a growing underworld of the exploited a wise immigration policy.", "title": "The noise on immigration is drowning out real problems | Polly Toynbee", "sentences": ["&quot;Maria&quot;, from Indonesia, was brought to London from Dubai by an Arab family who beat, half-starved and threatened her."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-13T19:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/may/14/overseas-study-offers-broad-educational-experience", "tags": ["Students", "Studying abroad", "University of Nottingham", "University of Central Lancashire", "UCL (University College London)", "London Business School"], "article": "Studying management with Chinese studies at the University of Nottingham&apos;s campus in China was an eye-opener for Adrian Fu, 21.  He spent the second year of his degree course at Ningbo near Shanghai and really enjoyed the opportunity of seeing things from a Chinese perspective: &quot;I studied Chinese business law, saw a fast-moving economy at first hand and discovered that the Chinese are not as quiet and as reserved as you think. Like most of the students who came out with me I&apos;d now like to go back to live and work in China.&quot; Opened in 2004, the campus teaches about 4,500 students \u2013 mainly Chinese \u2013 and replicates the degree syllabus, teaching standards and quality control of the Nottingham campus. Overseas branch campuses are part of the growing internationalisation of higher education. Besides fulfilling a growing international demand for degrees validated by UK universities, UK students benefit from the experience of learning in a foreign country, being exposed to a different culture, moving outside their comfort zone and mixing with international students. The rationale for each branch campus is different. But what all do is provide a niche education whether it is University College London&apos;s (UCL) master&apos;s in Arab and Islamic archaeology in Qatar, London Business School&apos;s MBA taught in Dubai or the suite of accounting and business degrees offered by the University of Central Lancashire&apos;s campus in Cyprus. Study abroad is often seen as a career enhancer and the experience of meeting and working with overseas students can lay the foundations for future business networks. Most UK universities with overseas campuses offer students a year abroad as an opportunity to specialise in a geographical area or region. The advantage is that being part of the same institution, students are able to seamlessly combine modules studied overseas with those studied in the UK. The 2012 report from The Observatory on Borderless Higher Education lists 200 degree-awarding international branch campuses. Of these, 25 UK universities have branches overseas, putting the UK in third place behind France and the US. A further 10 UK universities are set to open overseas branch campuses over the next two years. UK branch campuses often fulfil a major role in the countries where they are based. UCL&apos;s postgraduate branch campus in Education City, Qatar provides a suite of cultural heritage degrees few international universities can match. Established two years ago on the back of huge financial support from the Qatar Foundation, UCL in Qatar functions both as a department of UCL and as a partner to Qatar&apos;s Hamad bin Khalifa University (HBKU).  Specialist master&apos;s programmes in Arab and Islamic archaeology, conservation and museum and gallery practice attract an international student body. &quot;UK students gain a high-quality degree in a subject specific topic that they cannot get anywhere else in the world,&quot; says Prof Thilo Rehren, director of UCL in Qatar. The University of Nottingham launched its Malaysia campus in 2000. &quot;In Malaysia there are a lot of research opportunities and funding streams that are unavailable in the UK,&quot; says Prof Hai-Sui Yu pro vice chancellor (international). For example, the foreign campus conducts research on crops which in the UK could only be done in the lab, but in Malaysia &quot;you can work in the field&quot;, says Yu. Last year 120 students went out to Nottingham&apos;s Malaysia campus at Semenyih studying a range of degrees from international business and economics to psychology and international relations. One of the newest and most enthusiastic entrants to the overseas branch campus movement is the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan). Based in Preston, UCLan aims to open a campus in Sri Lanka in 2014 with more campuses in Thailand and Bangladesh also planned. &quot;We&apos;re seeing a definite trend in trans-national education,&quot; says Lee Chatfield, rector of UCLan Cyprus, the university&apos;s first venture. The \u20ac53m (\u00a344.8m) state-of the-art campus, which opened its doors to Cyprus students in October 2012, aims to attract UK students wanting to spend a year overseas with accommodation and a return flight to Britain included within the \u00a39,000 tuition fee. Chatfield explains that despite the banking crisis earlier in the year, Cyprus is strategically placed to service eastern European and the Middle East as well as a burgeoning domestic market. First-year accountancy degree student Henry Boocock returned from a taster session in Cyprus earlier this year. &quot;The Cypriot students really made us feel welcome and the climate is a break from England&apos;s rain and snow,&quot; Boocock says. &quot;Spending part of the academic year abroad is a useful life experience \u2013 and it gets you thinking about career opportunities in Europe.&quot;", "title": "Students go abroad to immerse themselves in a new culture", "sentences": ["But what all do is provide a niche education whether it is University College London&apos;s (UCL) master&apos;s in Arab and Islamic archaeology in Qatar, London Business School&apos;s MBA taught in Dubai or the suite of accounting and business degrees offered by the University of Central Lancashire&apos;s campus in Cyprus."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-14T16:25:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/14/bamiyan-afghanistan-safe-foreign-troops", "tags": ["Afghanistan", "World news", "Taliban"], "article": "The people of Bamiyan raged against Black Hawk helicopters swooping too close to the empty niches that once held their colossal Buddha statues, blown up the Taliban in 2001, because the choppers&apos; thundering vibrations set off showers of the remaining fragments of mud and stones. By and large though they not only tolerated but welcomed the military base that until last month perched on the outskirts of their small town in the highlands of central Afghanistan. &quot;There are New Zealand soldiers, so there is no Taliban,&quot; said Ibrahim Chaman, a mobile phone seller whose father was killed by the hardline group over a decade ago. &quot;When they leave, the Taliban for sure will return.&quot; That affection made it an unusual, perhaps unique outpost in Nato&apos;s web of sprawling camps and fortified outposts across the country, often resented by the people they aimed to protect. Its closure in April was equally singular, with New Zealand&apos;s governor general and what seemed like half the country&apos;s government flown out on a Hercules military plane from Dubai, to say goodbye to a valley that has firmly etched itself into the consciousness of the distant nation. Commanders of other bases have kept their demise low-key, with troops slipping away into the night, sometimes leaving piles of debris behind. By contrast, the late afternoon ceremony in Bamiyan was packed with journalists. After solemn tributes to 10 fallen soldiers, the gathering dusk echoed with optimistic speeches from officials highlighting improvements in healthcare, agriculture and education brought by foreign troops and their cash, and the growing strength of local security forces. But when the New Zealand, Malaysian and US flags were lowered, leaving the Afghan flag fluttering alone as darkness fell, there was a sense that shadows of a more ominous kind were also gathering over the quiet valley. Bamiyan is a magical place, where the ghosts of long-lost power and opulence haunt a valley of spectacular natural beauty. Near the university lie the ruins of a citadel untouched since Genghis Khan sacked it in the 13th century, and although the giant Buddhas lie in fragments, frescos painted over a millennium ago still cling to corners of monastic caves that honeycomb the cliff around them. It is also haunted by more recent spectres, memories of those killed in Taliban massacres barely a decade ago. Home to a heavily persecuted ethnic and religious minority, it has remained one of the safest places in Afghanistan, partly because the memory of that suffering fuels profound hostility towards the insurgency. Mistrust of Afghans not from the local Hazara ethnic minority runs so deep that when the defence ministry was stationing troops across the country years ago, Bamiyan asked to go without. It is protected only by police, who in Afghanistan are usually recruited locally, and intelligence officers who will take over the New Zealand base. That was fine when Afghanistan&apos;s insurgency was largely contained, Taliban fighters still focused on areas like Helmand, and Bamiyan was left to its peaceful existence. It was probably the only place in the country where diplomats wandered freely and met Afghans beyond blast walls and security checks that constrict embassy life elsewhere. Even soldiers visited spectacular historical sites in the area, confident they would not be targeted, unthinkable on any other base I have visited in Afghanistan. So great was the sense of security that Bamiyan was chosen by Nato to be the very first place in the country where Afghan forces officially took over from foreign troops, although the ceremony in 2011 was just a nominal shift to pave the way for real changes this year. But since then the insurgency has spread and violence lapped steadily closer to this virtual island of calm, isolated by mountain peaks rather than water. First one, then both roads to Kabul became a dangerous lottery. The head of the provincial council, a popular man who had done much to help development in a desperately poor area, was abducted and slaughtered in 2011. A US engineer is among the many others killed on the roads since. The security of the province itself was next to crumble, with fighters pushing in heavily from the east but also testing boundaries to the west. Half of the New Zealand troops killed in combat during the decade-long mission died last August in the Do Ab area bordering Baghlan province, and their April departure was six months earlier than originally planned. For those left behind, the threat is tangible. &quot;I don&apos;t see any Taliban in Bamiyan, but when the foreign soldiers leave they will return and be strong,&quot; said Haider Mohammad, a 37-year-old who sold souvenirs to New Zealand troops for six years. Watching as preparations for the farewell ceremony got under way, he added: &quot;When they go, I will leave as well.&quot; On the base, there was almost an air of celebration after the handover. Soldiers barbecued a whole lamb and visitors clambered up a low blast wall for views to the niches where the Buddhas once stood. Gazing out at the starlit cliff that held the Buddhas, I remembered a man I had met in Bamiyan bazaar years earlier, infamous in the town because he had been forced as a prisoner to spend days stuffing dynamite into the giant statues. Blowing them up took days of hard labour, as other fundamentalists who had tried in vain years earlier found out. The Taliban were more persistent. \u2022\u00a0This article was amended on 15 May 2013 because the original said New Zealand&apos;s head of state visited Bamiyan in April.

And it&apos;s difficult to envisage a director better suited or more qualified to interpret the dank corridors and squelchy, shambling horrors of the USG Ishimura. The Thing, The Fog and Halloween clearly influenced Visceral&apos;s icky franchise, and Carpenter&apos;s ideas feeding back into a mythology they helped create gives a pleasing sense of symmetry. His skill with suspense and body horror would serve a cinematic Dead Space better than any other director we can think of. While, for now, Carpenter&apos;s Dead Space dwells solely in the realm of the hypothetical, we hope someone with a spare hundred million dollars or so takes a punt on it. It&apos;s a perfect fit. It also got us wondering which other film-makers would be best suited to gaming adaptations. We&apos;ve got a few suggestions: The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim \u2013 Guillermo del Toro     The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim: heavy on the dragons    Skyrim&apos;s tale of dragons and political power struggles doesn&apos;t seem like such a hard sell post-Game Of Thrones and Lord of the Rings, and while any of the Elder Scrolls games would be an ideal jumping-off point, Skyrim has dragons. And everybody loves dragons. Guillermo del Toro originally signed up to direct The Hobbit (before inner-studio politicking relieved him of the chance) so you&apos;d think he&apos;s got a superb dragon-heavy fantasy bubbling away in him somewhere. A liberal sprinkling of sensibilities from the darker end of his oeuvre (like Pan&apos;s Labyrinth and the Devil&apos;s Backbone) could produce a dense, dark and thrilling epic. Far Cry \u2013 Duncan Jones     Far Cry 3: journey to the heart of darkness    Let&apos;s forget for a moment that Uwe Boll has already made a Far Cry film \u2013 one so meritless it does you actual physical harm \u2013 and consider the potential of Far Cry 3&apos;s narrative. A group of teens captured on a Pacific island is held at the whim of an unhinged drug lord; Jason, the protagonist, abandoning his humanity, turns to murder and witchcraft in order to save them. It&apos;s a journey to the heart of darkness. With Moon, Duncan Jones explored the ramifications of one man&apos;s descent into ostensible madness. A similarly handled treatment of Jason, together with the adroit deployment of visual flair Jones once again exhibited in Source Code, would lend enough weight to Jason&apos;s journey to propose the same awkward insights into morality that the game almost did. Slender \u2013 Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 and Paco Plaza     Slender: pervasive, suffocating sense of dread    When used deftly, particularly in horror, &quot;found footage&quot; can be incredibly effective. Slender, Parsec&apos;s free-to-play chiller, has you wandering alone in the woods as you&apos;re stalked by the faceless, sharp-suited Slender Man. You&apos;re not armed \u2013 all you have is a torch \u2013 so if you see him, you run, or you die. Your brief glimpses of him become more and more frequent as he moves in. He toys with you. He waits. It&apos;s bowel-looseningly terrifying: no gore, just a pervasive, suffocating sense of dread \u2013 one which Jaume Balaguer\u00f3 and Paco Plaza&apos;s REC, particularly in its unbearably tense later scenes, oozed. Fleshing out the backstory a tad, a found-footage Slender might be a bit Blair Witchy, but in the capable hands of the REC helmers it could be utterly petrifying. Spec Ops: The Line \u2013 Kathryn Bigelow     Spec Ops: The Line: treatise on wartime morality    Spec Ops: The Line was one of last year&apos;s most interesting releases - a character study and treatise on wartime morality packaged as a gung-ho military shooter; more Apocalypse Now than Rambo III. In it, Dubai lies beneath the sands following a biblical sand storm, and your group is one of many fighting for survival in the wastes. The Line asks you to examine what each kill means, portraying its characters as affected by each life they take. Kathryn Bigelow&apos;s similar work on The Hurt Locker and Zero Dark Thirty might make her a bit of a route-one choice, but it&apos;s hard to think of anyone better. Dishonored \u2013 Nicholas Winding Refn     Dishonored: could be a violent, uncompromising revenge movie    One of the surprise hits of last year brought us the skewed-reality setting of Dunwall, a swarming den of skullduggery, murder and intrigue. Corvo, framed for a crime he didn&apos;t commit, becomes an assassin of singular purpose \u2013 ruthless, yes, but necessarily so. With Drive, Nicholas Winding Refn trod similar ground, showing the hero committing savage acts of brutality for the greater good. Valhalla Rising and Bronson marked him out as no slouch when it came to design and visuals, too \u2013 in Refn&apos;s hands, Disonored would be a violent, uncompromising revenge mystery in a nihilistic yet beautiful Dunwall. That sounds rather good. Tomb Raider \u2013 Danny Boyle      Tomb Raider: could become a darker tale of survival    It&apos;s certainly time for a new cinematic spin on the character of Lara Croft, sending the silliness of Angelina Jolie&apos;s efforts to the metaphorical step of shame where they can have a good think about what they&apos;ve done. This year&apos;s Tomb Raider showed Lara&apos;s metamorphosis from frightened, defenceless youngster to double-hard grave-burglarising kicker of bottom. It was, in places, incredibly dark, asking questions about what it takes to kill, even if it only partially succeeded in answering them. Doing what you must to survive is a theme Danny Boyle&apos;s explored, from 127 Hours&apos; self-amputation to 28 Days Later&apos;s less generous appraisal of the depths to which humanity will plunge. His kinetic visuals would not only give stylistic sheen, but also help convey the primal fear, instinctive violence and inner turmoil of Lara&apos;s journey, as they did with Aron Ralston&apos;s. Boyle wouldn&apos;t touch it in a million years though. Uncharted \u2013 Shane Black     Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception: reluctant, bickering heroism    Silver Linings Playbook director David O Russell wrote a treatment for an Uncharted movie, with the intent of casting Marky Mark Wahlberg as Nathan Drake. &quot;Creative differences&quot; \u2013 that ancient chestnut \u2013 caused him to abandon the idea. Shane Black, currently riding the wave of success with Iron Man 3, would presumably write as well as direct, bringing the confident understanding of spectacle which runs through his recent work. Most importantly, he&apos;d understand that the key to Uncharted is Nathan Drake&apos;s reluctant, bickering heroism. Black&apos;s work on Lethal Weapon, The Last Boy Scout and Iron Man make him the ideal choice. Mass Effect \u2013 Christopher Nolan     Mass Effect 3: deserves Christopher Nolan's touch    There have been grumblings of a Mass Effect film since 2010, but little actual movement beyond that. It certainly won&apos;t be a cheap film to produce, but Ridley Scott&apos;s Prometheus, if a meandering mess, proved expensive, mildly portentous sci-fi can make money. Christopher Nolan would be the safest choice for Mass Effect: his Batman films were intricately plotted dramas sold as blockbusters; intelligence perfectly balanced with bombast. If he could repeat this trick, Nolan could deliver the thrills the Mass Effect universe demands without scrimping on the multifaceted plot. Interstellar, his next film, is a sci-fi epic. Let&apos;s hope he gets a taste for them. Bioshock \u2013 Tim Burton     BioShock Infinite 3: could get the Time Burton tretment    Gore Verbinski (of dubious Caribbean Pirates fame) tried to get a Bioshock film off the ground in 2008, with budgetary concerns forcing him to abandon the project. This might, in hindsight, have been for the best. Tim Burton doing a better job than Verbinski could is by no means guaranteed, but he&apos;s mentioned here because the prospect of his visual eye falling on Rapture, throwing a gothic veil across the doomed underwater art deco dystopia, is tantalising. Burton does have something of style over substance about him, but if he could rein in his predilection for kitsch oddballity and bring the harder, nastier edge of Sleepy Hollow or Batman&apos;s grimmer moments, he could do ample justice to Andrew Ryan&apos;s legacy. Halo \u2013 Neill Blomkamp     Halo 3: packed with aliens and explosions    Neill Blomkamp was actually in line to direct a Halo movie, but even the producing might of Peter Jackson couldn&apos;t get that particular ball rolling. Irritating, because Blomkamp (whose Halo disappointment led to him directing District 9) was an excellent choice, and proof is in the pudding of Bloomkamp&apos;s short Halo film. If you like (a) aliens, (b) explosions and (c) combinations therein, Blomkamp&apos;s Halo would have been right up your strasse.            Let us know your suggestions in the comments.

Speaking to Clare Balding for Channel 4 News to be broadcast on Thursday night, the jockey said: &quot;Up until about two years ago I was having the best time of my life . . . and then for some reason things have changed. We had a new trainer, new way of doing things and I didn&apos;t know whether I was in or out.&quot; Things first began to go badly says Dettori when Godolphin - owned by the ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed - recruited Mickael Barzalona and Silvestre De Sousa, and he stopped being the automatic first choice for the stable. &quot;My first 17 years of my riding career [at] Godolphin, I was always the number one pick. All of a sudden I saw myself being the fourth in the biggest race in the world, and it started from there and it was never an explanation why and what, you know. I had to accept it for unknown reasons,&quot; said Dettori. He said the first &quot;stumbling hurdle&quot; was when he was refused a horse for a Derby trial. Then, at the Ladbrokes St Leger, he was beaten into third place by Mickael Barzalona, riding Encke. &quot;My head was wrecked, absolutely wrecked. I couldn&apos;t take it anymore,&quot; he said. In a move which was destined to cause trouble, Dettori chose to ride for rival stables, Ireland&apos;s Coolmore Stud, in the Prix De l&apos;Arc De Triomphe in October. He rode the Aidan O&apos;Brien-trained Camelot in the race, and split with Godolphin soon after. &quot;In hindsight, I should perhaps have confronted Godolphin ... I knew then when I did ride the horse that was me finished. For me wanting to leave as much for them wanting to get rid of me. I couldn&apos;t take any more and the rest is history,&quot; he said. Dettori said he was &quot;depressed&quot; as his relationship with Godolphin unravelled, and blames the collapse of the relationship for his state of mind when he took cocaine. &quot;You start getting depressed. I wasn&apos;t sleeping at night. I was arguing with my wife,&quot; he said. However, since then the jockey maintains he has changed and moved on, using the six months as a time to think and prepare for his return - as well as to put in a stint in the Celebrity Big Brother house. Dettori reports he has been drug tested 15 times in the last two months. &quot;I feel like Lance Armstrong - they come and knock on my door any time of the day,&quot; he said. Wednesday&apos;s best bets, by Greg Wood   There are several fascinating contests at York this afternoon, and though the Dante Stakes will get most of the attention, the handicaps are likely to prove significant too for many weeks to come, until Royal Ascot and beyond. This is the ideal moment to look out for lightly-raced handicappers on a decent mark with the season opening up in front of them, and Jamaican Bolt (1.45) is a horse that fits the profile. He has just 11 starts to his name as he sets out on his fourth racing season, and is one of the few in this big field of sprinters with obvious potential to improve. A mere repeat of his seasonal debut over six furlongs at the Lincoln meeting would see Jamaican Bolt go very close this afternoon, as he travelled best for much of the race. He will be fitter for that, and should be suited by the drop back to five furlongs too. Secret Number (2.45) is a big price in the Dante Stakes given the form he showed in Dubai earlier this year. He needs to transfer it onto the turf, but at around 7-1 it is worth chancing that he will, as his run in the UAE Derby, when he finished third behind Lines Of Battle, was the performance of a potentially top-class horse. He charged home from an impossible position to be two lengths adrift at the line, and the winner did not disgrace himself in the Kentucky Derby next time out. Prince Of Johanne (3.15) has a difficult draw to overcome in the Hambleton Stakes, but he is creeping down the weights and is an attractive price given his liking for big-field handicaps. At Newmarket this evening, Frozen Over (5.55) should be backed to improve on his third place last time out in a race at Chepstow that has already produced two subsequent winners from just three starters.

You start getting depressed, I wasn&apos;t sleeping at night and I was arguing with my wife. But then you think maybe I&apos;ll be all right next week, maybe I&apos;ll be back in favour. But then things kept on getting worse, and my head was wrecked, absolutely wrecked. I couldn&apos;t take it any more. &quot;When I got offered the ride on Camelot it was like winning the Lottery. I felt wanted again and for me it was a way out of the job. I did not want to leave \u2026 but they forced my hand for me. Another six months there and I think I would definitely have ended up in the Priory. I was done in, done in.&quot; Godolphin announced in mid-October that it would not retain Dettori during the 2013 Flat season. A few weeks later, it emerged that he had tested positive for cocaine after riding at Longchamp on 16 September. Dettori told Balding that he had attempted to meet Sheikh Mohammed, Godolphin&apos;s founder, to thank him for their 18-year association at the stable but had been unable to do so. &quot;I stopped in Dubai because I wanted to basically shake hands with Sheikh Mohammed, my patron for 18 years, and say thank you for all the good things that he&apos;d done for me,&quot; Dettori said. &quot;But for some reason or another, he was too busy. I&apos;m not sure if he refused [to see me], he was too busy.&quot; During the 2012 season, Dettori was primarily associated with Saeed bin Suroor, who trained about half of Godolphin&apos;s string in Britain at a stable in the middle of Newmarket. The Italian took 148 rides for Suroor but only 66 for Mahmood al-Zarooni, Godolphin&apos;s trainer at Moulton Paddocks, near Newmarket, who was banned from racing for eight years last month for administering banned anabolic steroids to 15 horses in his yard. Asked about the steroid-doping scandal that has overtaken Godolphin during his absence from the saddle, Dettori said that it had &quot;ruined&quot; the operation which Sheikh Mohammed founded two decades ago. &quot;All the hard work \u2026 has been ruined by one person,&quot; Dettori said. &quot;It&apos;s ruined my career for a start, and now it&apos;s ruined Godolphin. When I say ruined, he&apos;s given it a really, really bad reputation. What&apos;s intriguing is, when you train 300 horses, why do you need to do that?&quot; Dettori, who was cautioned for possession of cocaine when he was an apprentice jockey in 1993, insisted in the interview that he was not a long-term user of the drug. &quot;You feel low and perhaps you want to escape the reality of life,&quot; Dettori said. &quot;It was a moment of weakness and I fell for it. I&apos;ve only got myself to blame, I can&apos;t blame anyone else. It was Sod&apos;s Law, I did the wrong thing at the wrong time and I got tested. It&apos;s not just in this country that we get tested. We get tested everywhere we go. If you play with fire, you&apos;re going to get burned.&quot; Following Dettori&apos;s interview, Paul Bittar, the chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority, defended the regulator&apos;s record on drug-testing of jockeys following the suspensions of Dettori and Kieren Fallon after tests conducted by the French racing authorities. &quot;There&apos;s nothing going wrong with British testing,&quot; Bittar said. &quot;Frankie made the point that he regularly gets tested in this country as he does in every country that they ride in. Our riders on average get tested about four times a season, but those that are more active, such as Frankie and Kieren, will get tested more often than that. There&apos;s no fundamental difference between the tests. &quot;On a benchmarking perspective, the number of positives we have, it&apos;s very low but it&apos;s comparative to other jurisdictions, it&apos;s not massively out of kilter.&quot; Dawn Approach, the Godolphin-owned winner of the 2,000 Guineas, is top-priced at 5-4 to win the Derby at Epsom on 1 June after the Dante Stakes at York on Thursday failed to produce an obvious British-trained candidate for the Classic. Libertarian, the 33-1 winner of the Dante, is quoted at 25-1 to succeed in becoming the first Yorkshire-trained horse to win the Derby since Dante himself in 1945. Libertarian is trained in Middleham by Elaine Burke, though her husband Karl, who held the licence at their Spigot Lodge yard until 2009, is also a key figure in the operation. Karl Burke was banned from racing for a year in 2009 after he was found to have supplied inside information about his horses to Miles Rodgers, a former owner and gambler who has been banned from the sport for life for corruption offences. &quot;He&apos;s a horse we&apos;ve always thought a lot of, especially as he went through the winter,&quot; Burke said after Thursday&apos;s race. &quot;He did one piece of work at Southwell which was pretty special for such an inexperienced horse, and I said to Hugh [Hubert Strecker, Libertarian&apos;s owner], &apos;do you fancy entering him in the Derby?&apos; And we went from there.&quot; Libertarian was ridden along to hold his position in the early stages of the race, but came with a powerful run inside the final two furlongs to win the most prestigious of the main Derby trials. &quot;You could see today that he was running green, and that could be a major problem in the Derby if we go that route,&quot; Burke said, &quot;but he will come on again for today. He has got speed, I said to William [Buick, his jockey], if you&apos;re within striking distance two out, he will pick up for a smack.&quot; Buick is now likely to maintain his partnership with Libertarian at Epsom on 1 June, while Dawn Approach, the 2,000 Guineas, has hardened at the top of the ante-post Derby betting after several runners from big stables failed to impress in the Dante. Dawn Approach is now top-priced at 5-4 for the Classic, with Battle Of Marengo, Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s Derrinstown Stud Derby Trial winner, next in the betting at 5-1.", "title": "Frankie Dettori blames Godolphin downgrade for drugs test shame", "sentences": ["&quot;I stopped in Dubai because I wanted to basically shake hands with Sheikh Mohammed, my patron for 18 years, and say thank you for all the good things that he&apos;d done for me,&quot; Dettori said."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-16T16:37:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/16/court-papers-saudi-princes-relations", "tags": ["Saudi Arabia", "Open justice", "Law", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Hezbollah", "UK news", "Court of appeal"], "article": "Previously suppressed court papers released to the Guardian by the court of appeal provide an extraordinary insight into the way in which senior Saudi princes supposedly conduct their business. The breakdown in commercial relations between Prince Mishal, a former defence minister, his son Prince Abdulaziz and their Jordanian former business partner, Faisal Almhairat, have degenerated into a barrage of accusations and counter accusations that will eventually have to be settled by judges in London. The most wounding claims are contained in a petition submitted by Almhairat, who fled his native Jordan &quot;in fear of his life&quot; and has since been living in London. His documents claim that, at one stage, he sought the help of Scotland Yard&apos;s anti-kidnap squad. Almhairat maintains that key conversations on which he relies were recorded on his iPhone and then downloaded on to memory sticks which were subsequently stolen in the UK. The Saudis say they never existed. They also dismiss the allegations as fabrications designed to blackmail them into settling the case on disadvantageous terms. Almhairat&apos;s first allegation relates to a transaction said to have taken place in spring 2010, when he was asked to fly from the Jordanian capital Amman to Beirut to issue a bank guarantee for $5m to an intermediary who supposedly dealt with Hezbollah, the Shia political organisation which controls much of eastern Lebanon. Almhairat claims he declined to become involved but then received a phone call from Prince Abdulaziz during which he was told: &quot;We deal with whoever we want to deal with, whether it&apos;s Hezbollah, the mafia or even the Jews. The important thing is that you implement any given order without questioning. &quot;Even your King [of Jordan] does not raise a question \u2026 You agreed to obey us and in return you get our protection. Yet, be sure that if we remove our protection, you and all your family are dead within a second \u2026 Do as you are instructed. Otherwise your head will be at my feet without your body.&quot; Almhairat claims he was later told the banker&apos;s draft was to be used to &quot;facilitate money-laundering for Hezbollah&quot;, allowing Prince Abdulaziz to earn a profit of $5m. Almhairat&apos;s second main allegation relates to a charter flight said to have been paid for by Fi Call in late February/March 2011 from Nairobi to Amman. It was supposedly arranged on Prince Abdulaziz&apos;s instructions. The purpose, Almhairat was told, was to transport the prince&apos;s camping equipment. Almhairat, however, said that documents he obtained revealed certificates purporting to show that a mining company had been given permission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo to export &quot;5,000kg of ore nuggets worth $140m, plus another export of 5,000kg ore nuggets, 4,000kg of ruby gemstones, 3,000kg of green garnet, 7,000kg of malakis stone and 1,000kg of blue sapphire&quot;. Almhairat sent an email saying he wanted nothing to do with the business. He says he later saw an email saying the goods had been taken from Kenyan customs to the local United Nations office where officials had supposedly scanned some of the boxes, seen dollars and decided to ask for money in return for looking the other way. The value of the shipment was said to be &quot;2B&quot;, implying two billion, possibly in dollars. In April 2011, Almhairat met Prince Abdulaziz and his father, Prince Mishal, in Dubai. Mishal is alleged to have told him: &quot;When we enter a business we always have majority control of the company. We need to have majority control of the shares in Fi Call. You can keep a small percentage of the company as an incentive for you.&quot; Mishal supposedly added: &quot;You know that I have moved huge amounts of money for people like the Mubaraks. We&apos;ve been doing this business for years. We can move money for anyone, including the Iranians, because no one dares challenge us \u2026 Help my son and you&apos;ll get our protection.&quot;Throughout the preliminary hearings lawyers for Prince Mishal and Prince Abdulaziz, as well as Global Torch \u2013 the British Virgin Island company they are said to control \u2013 dismissed the allegations as false, &quot;scandalous and outrageous&quot;. The aim was to cause &quot;reputational damage, embarrassment and distress&quot;. The allegations should &quot;not be aired in open court&quot; because the allegations are &quot;wholly false&quot;, it was insisted. &quot;Publicity for the [Beirut ] allegation&quot;, it was said, would result in Prince Abdulaziz and Emad Ayshih, a director of Fi Call Ltd, being at risk of &quot;serious personal injury or death from reprisals from citizens of Saudi Arabia or certain organisations&quot;. Mark Warby QC, for the Saudi princes, said the allegations against the Saudi princes were &quot;very grave&quot; and were an attack on their reputations and their rights to a private and family life under article 8 of the European convention on human rights. In the Saudi submissions, put before the court first of all, they alleged that Almhairat misappropriated money from a joint account. They maintain he gave away intellectual property rights to telecommunications material without permission, failed to attend board meetings and effectively shut down the company without permission. Almhairat&apos;s lawyers deny the allegations. On the Beirut transaction, the Saudis insist the money was merely being prepared to pay a subsidiary for telecommunications work. The $5m never left the bank, it is said. On the Kenyan aircraft charter, the Saudis insist that the emails which Almhairat refers to about precious stones are fictitious and malicious. Publication of allegations of money-laundering links between two senior Saudi princes and Hezbollah are likely to prove deeply embarassing to the conservative kingdom, a sworn foe of Iran and Syria, Hezbollah&apos;s main backers. Over the past two years King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has emerged as one of the principal supporters of the Syrian rebels seeking to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. Hezbollah is blacklisted as a terrorist group in the US and its military wing is banned by the UK, and it is now fighting openly in support of the Assad regime. Abdullah has also been a staunch supporter of Sunni-led governments in Lebanon, where Hezbollah forms a part of the current coalition. They are also likely to fuel the resentment of Saudis who believe that members of the royal family are corrupt, at a time when the kingdom has largely escaped the mass protests seen elsewhere in the region.", "title": "Court papers chart breakdown of Saudi princes' relations with business partner", "sentences": ["In April 2011, Almhairat met Prince Abdulaziz and his father, Prince Mishal, in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-16T19:02:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/guardian-masterclasses/feature-writing-july-rob-orchard-journalism-course", "tags": ["Guardian Masterclasses"], "article": "Dates and times: Saturday 20 and Sunday 21 July, 10am-5pm Overview  Learn how to find, pitch and produce eye-catching, insightful and memorable stories worthy of any magazine or newspaper supplement with this intensive two-day masterclass.

Dettori&apos;s ban expires on Sunday, and he had been expected to make his comeback to the saddle at Leicester on Monday evening. In order to complete the administrative formalities following such a serious offence, however, Dettori needs to be interviewed by France Galop&apos;s medical committee. Until the BHA has been assured that France Galop&apos;s procedures have been followed, he will be unable to compete. &quot;We are keen to clear this up as soon as possible,&quot; Julien Pescatore, France Galop&apos;s spokesman, said on Friday evening, &quot;but it really depends on Mr Dettori. He has to tell us when he is available, send us all we need and tell us when he can see the medical committee. We are waiting for details from him. It could be Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday, we really can&apos;t tell.&quot; In a statement issued late on Friday afternoon, the BHA said that &quot;in line with the position outlined to Dettori by the BHA&apos;s Licensing Committee at their meeting on Tuesday 14 May, and in the absence of clearance from France, no licence will be issued while such matters remain outstanding. The BHA is seeking further clarification from France Galop but is unable to make any additional comment at this time.&quot; The news that Dettori is unlikely to ride at Leicester on Monday will be a disappointment for the course, which had expected a big crowd to see the return of the most popular jockey of the last 20 years. The course had already tried \u2013 and failed \u2013 to persuade the BHA to sanction the renaming of its opening race to &quot;The Welcome Back Frankie Maiden Stakes&quot;. Dettori will hope to receive a warm reception from racegoers when he eventually makes his comeback, but he admits to concerns that his ban may have damaged his image and his relationship with the sport&apos;s fans. Speaking in an interview with Clare Balding which was broadcast during Channel 4 Racing n Friday afternoon, Dettori said that he is &quot;nervous&quot; about his comeback. &quot;I&apos;d be lying to say that I&apos;m not,&quot; Dettori said. &quot;I think that the longest that I&apos;ve had off is perhaps just over two months after an injury or something like that. But I&apos;m more nervous about people&apos;s perception. I&apos;m not too nervous about my riding because it&apos;s something I&apos;ve done all my life. For the last nine months, I&apos;ve been in the news for the wrong reasons, so I don&apos;t know what people think of me now.&quot; In the course of the interview, Dettori admitted that he had suspected that the sample taken at Longchamp on 16 September would test positive for cocaine as soon as he was selected for testing. He then rode for the remainder of the season, at a time when his 18-year relationship with the Godolphin operation was disintegrating, in the knowledge that he would almost certainly receive a six-month ban. &quot;I had a feeling,&quot; Dettori said. &quot;A few days past had been when I did it, and when I got tested I felt like \u2026 you know when you get that gut feeling? And also it was in the period when everything was going wrong. I kind of knew that this wasn&apos;t going to be so good. We&apos;re talking about me failing a drug test, but also it was the time that I left Godolphin. &quot;So it was all just like a big snowball, like a runaway train. Basically I fulfilled my commitments by riding in Australia, and that was probably my hardest time as a jockey because I knew that I&apos;d failed a drug test but it wasn&apos;t out in the public domain. &quot;I had to beg Catherine [his wife] to come along with me to Australia and the Breeders&apos; Cup [in California] because I don&apos;t think I could have done it by myself. I remember walking down the step at Flemington for the Melbourne Cup knowing that it was my last day for six months.&quot; &quot;Then the news came out when I was in Dubai. I was in my hotel room watching Sky Sports, and my face was splashed all over the TV and I was the main news of the day.&quot; Dettori said that he has not spoken to Sheikh Mohammed, his employer for nearly two decades, following his decision to ride Camelot, owned by the Coolmore Stud, the Sheikh&apos;s biggest rival, in last year&apos;s Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe. However, he added that he expects Sheikh Mohammed to ride out the storm that has engulfed Godolphin following the discovery that Mahmood al-Zarooni, one of the operation&apos;s two trainers in Newmarket, had been using anabolic steroids to improve the conditions of some horses in his stable. &quot;Sheikh Mohammed is a powerful and very determined person, and there&apos;s no way he will turn back,&quot; Dettori said. &quot;He&apos;s going to face it head first, and be positive, and make sure that Godolphin come back bigger and stronger.&quot; Dettori&apos;s return had been expected to boost the attendance at Leicester on Monday, although the course was prevented from renaming the opening race on its card to mark the former champion jockey&apos;s comeback. The track&apos;s officials had hoped to stage the event as the &quot;Welcome Back Frankie Maiden Stakes&quot;, but has been informed by the British Horseracing Authority that that name is &quot;not deemed appropriate&quot;, and it will instead revert to its original title of the &quot;British Stallion Studs Supporting British Racing EBF Maiden Stakes.&quot; The BHA said on Friday that it will interview all trainers in Newmarket who are clients of a veterinary practice in the town which administered Sungate, a treatment containing the banned anabolic steroid stanozolol, to horses at Gerard Butler&apos;s stable earlier this year. In a statement, the BHA said that the practice had legally imported Sungate, and that after a meeting with representatives of the practice, the Authority &quot;believes that Gerard Butler was not the only trainer to whom the administration of Sungate was recommended&quot;. The statement continued: &quot;In order to establish the extent of the use of the product, BHA investigating officers will be interviewing trainers who are known to use the same veterinary practice. Under the Rules of Racing, licensed trainers are strictly liable for the administration of any prohibited substances administered to horses under their care and control.&quot;", "title": "Frankie Dettori's return from six-month drugs ban delayed", "sentences": ["I remember walking down the step at Flemington for the Melbourne Cup knowing that it was my last day for six months.&quot; &quot;Then the news came out when I was in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-17T16:09:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/17/south-africa-doctor-uae-death", "tags": ["South Africa", "Africa", "World news", "United Arab Emirates", "Middle East and North Africa"], "article": "A South African doctor detained in the United Arab Emirates on a decade-old manslaughter charge has returned home after nine months in limbo, declaring: &quot;It&apos;s wonderful to be out of that bloody place.&quot; Cyril Karabus, 78, had been convicted without his knowledge of killing a young leukaemia patient in Abu Dhabi in 2002. He was arrested in Dubai last August while in transit to South Africa from Canada. Karabus was acquitted in March but endured countless setbacks and bureaucratic wrangling before finally boarding a flight to Cape Town, where he was greeted with wild cheers and tearful hugs from family members and supporters. &quot;It&apos;s fantastic,&quot; said Karabus, meeting his three-month-old grandson, Gabriel, for the first time. &quot;I didn&apos;t realise what the welcome would be. It&apos;s unbelievable the number of people who are at the airport.&quot; A leading paediatric oncologist, he helped save the lives of black cancer victims during the apartheid era and pioneered treatment for cancer and blood disorders at the Red Cross hospital in Cape Town, where he worked for 35 years. Karabus had gone to Abu Dhabi for a six-week stint during which he treated a three-year-old Yemeni girl. She had a form of leukaemia with an 80% death rate at the time, he recalled. &quot;It happens. I&apos;ve had a lot of kids dying of cancer. It wasn&apos;t me that killed her, it was the disease.&quot; He left the UAE because his contract had finished and resents that the charge sheet later described him as a &quot;fugitive&quot; who jumped the country. &quot;The case record had 16 lies in it. It&apos;s absolute garbage. You cannot believe the rubbish written there. It&apos;s not exactly the best legal system.&quot; That would have been the end of the matter but for a fateful decision to travel through Dubai when returning to South Africa after attending his son&apos;s wedding in Canada. Ruefully explaining his choice of airline and route, Karabus said: &quot;The Emirates fares are usually better than most.&quot; With time to kill before their connecting flight, Karabus and his family went through immigration to look for an airport hotel. It was then he suddenly found himself under arrest. &quot;You&apos;re totally shocked and you&apos;re not sure what the hell they&apos;re talking about.&quot; There were immediate fears over how the septuagenarian would cope with prison. But he said: &quot;The conditions were not too bad. There were some interesting characters I was jailed with. In the first jail there were a lot of Filipinos in for cheque fraud and that sort of thing. Someone was in for murder. &quot;They were all very friendly. We were one happy family. Some needed medical advice which I could give them. But it was also boring. There was a television but it was mostly in Arabic. There was some soccer but it was Emirati clubs on high volume.&quot; Karabus was granted bail at the fifth attempt but, denied his passport, was forced to remain within the country. Fortunately a fellow South African doctor offered him lodgings. &quot;I don&apos;t think he expected me to be staying for next seven months.&quot; The charms of the UAE city soon began to wane, however. &quot;Abu Dhabi is a bit of a boring town,&quot; Karabus sighed. &quot;There&apos;s one tourist attraction which is a mosque which I&apos;d seen before. You can go for walks but there isn&apos;t much else to do.&quot; He blamed the endless delays on &quot;bloody incompetence&quot;, adding that it had taken 10 hours to obtain an exit visa over Wednesday and Thursday. He estimates his legal fees fighting the case at around $100,000 (\u00a365,755) but is grateful to supporters who have made contributions. Summing up the ordeal, he said: &quot;You have ups and downs. When it&apos;s an up, you have a drink to celebrate. When it&apos;s a down, you also have a drink to commiserate. &quot;On Friday it felt good to be home. I missed South Africa. It&apos;s such a beautiful country. Coming in on the plane and seeing Table Mountain was wonderful.&quot; The father of five intends to resume working as a locum. But he will not be going back to UAE in a hurry. &quot;Never again.

Oil traders claim that influential bankers \u2013 furious that their sector has been squeezed by regulators since the 2008 crash \u2013 have persuaded Brussels that oil traders should no longer be able to operate without the same rigorous rules. According to the bankers, oil traders behave worse than money brokers. And so the Eurocrats raided the offices of BP, Shell and Platts, comparing their investigation into oil price-rigging with the one into the bankers&apos; Libor scandal. By focusing on Platts, an unusual reporting agency whose methods to discover the price of oil often provoke accusations of dishonesty, the Eurocrats have won public sympathy and the gratitude of those banks who host massive oil-trading operations. Over the past century, the repeated charge is that oil prices have been rigged by oil traders, refiners or producers. At its simplest, traders are alleged to either flood or squeeze markets to fix prices to grab a quick profit. Undoubtedly some traders have been dishonest, and US regulators have charged a handful of them for manipulation. But their alleged crimes were short-lived and simple to detect. The current suggestion that BP, Shell and Platts have been conspiring for 10 years to manipulate oil\u00a0prices \u2013 possibly the Brent market in the North Sea \u2013 is mind-boggling. Setting the price of oil is fiendishly complicated. Unlike the price of gold or BP shares, oil&apos;s value is not fixed in one open stock market. Crude oil is not only traded on regulated markets in New York and London but also around the clock in thousands of opaque markets. Like wine and cheese, the quality and value of crude oil varies significantly, and this is reflected in its price. The difference in price also depends on the distance between the oilfields and refineries in three locations: Oklahoma, the North Sea and Dubai, as well as other factors such as whether the oil is for immediate delivery or in the future. Every day, tens of thousands of anonymous traders across the globe are secretly agreeing prices worth trillions of dollars. A market can only work if traders, including their dishonest brethren, know what prices their competitors have agreed. Since 1909, traders have relied on Platts, owned by McGraw-Hill, the US publishers. Platts reporters call hundreds of producers and traders every day to discover their purchase and selling prices. Unscrupulous traders lie to manipulate the market, but even the best manipulator can only fool the market for a couple of days yet often takes advantage of an incompetent Platts reporter. Some of the most aggressive traders suspected of speculation are global commodity trading giants who are beyond the Eurocrats&apos; reach. And so the bankers are angry. In a world of squeezes and deception, bankers&apos; oil-trading has shifted the balance. Over the last 20 years Morgan Stanley&apos;s sophisticated trading has become colossal speculation. Markets have witnessed huge crashes following crazy speculation to manipulate the oil market. But while US investigators have repeatedly accused honest speculators of causing phoney price increases, they have also failed to find convincing evidence of a conspiracy. After Morgan Stanley&apos;s traders suffered huge losses in 2008, Platts declared its price reporting was unacceptable. The bank protested that there was no evidence of wrongdoing but to its distress was excluded by Platts from the system for a period. Now bankers protest that oil traders and Platts should be regulated like them. The Platts system is imperfect, but no alternative has been found. Whatever transgressions the Eurocrats might discover are inconsequential compared to the world&apos;s mammoth price-fixer, Opec. Every day, those who claim to control about 80% of the world&apos;s oil restrict their production to keep prices artificially high. This group is too powerful to challenge. No one in Washington or Brussels can order the Saudis or Venezuelans to produce more oil or charge a fair price. Instead, Saudi officials in Dhahran unilaterally impose the highest price they can extract. Stymied by Opec, the Eurocrats have gone for smaller fish. Like the US regulators, they will at best emerge from the treacle with a minnow.", "title": "The crude reality of oil prices | Tom Bower", "sentences": ["The difference in price also depends on the distance between the oilfields and refineries in three locations: Oklahoma, the North Sea and Dubai, as well as other factors such as whether the oil is for immediate delivery or in the future."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-17T21:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/may/18/talking-horses-racing-blog", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "It hardly seems 10 years since the most provocative Lockinge of recent memory, when Hawk Wing cuffed his rivals by 11 lengths and was hailed by some as a superstar. It was his only success from his last five races, a run which included three defeats at odds-on, but it looked good at the time. Hawk Wing was 2-1 when he gave Aidan O&apos;Brien his sole Lockinge victory to date. As it happens, the same odds are available about O&apos;Brien&apos;s runner in this year&apos;s race, Declaration Of War (3.50), which hardly seems fair; Hawk Wing had been runner-up in two Classics and had won a couple of Group Ones, while Declaration Of War has never raced above Group Three level. But this ex-French four-year-old has shown abundant promise in his six starts to date, most recently when hosing up in Listed company at Leopardstown last month. He has been brought along steadily, is very easy to look upon and gets a good opportunity here. He is one of the few who should give his running whether the forecast rain arrives or not. Trumpet Major has solid form but it will be a weak Group One that goes his way. Farhh, who was favourite when the betting opened on Monday, is thought likely to need the race and comes from a yard that had to wait until yesterday for its first winner in Britain this year. Beauty Parlour probably has the necessary ability but has a bit to prove after flopping so badly on her first start for Henry Cecil in September. Fencing comes here in form but there is a suspicion that everything fell right for him at Ascot last time, which was only the second success of his career. Cityscape won a big pot in Dubai on his first run of last year and looks like the main danger, though it is open to question how many more career peaks he has in him at the age of seven. 2.05 Newbury Plenty of rain would be excellent news for Harris Tweed, whose last three wins have been on soft, though he has some form on faster surfaces too. He has usually gone well fresh to this point and looks the standout on quality in this field. 2.20 Newmarket Tiger Cliff is an interesting, lightly raced sort from the Cecil yard and there are a few in this field with the capacity to be some way ahead of their ratings. But they may all face a stiff task against Biographer, who has yet to finish out of the first two in six starts and rounded off last season with a Listed win at Ascot on soft going, powering home over this distance. He was only inched up another 2lb for that and should have more to offer this year. David Lanigan&apos;s string is three from nine in the past fortnight. 2.40 Newbury With Sir Michael Stoute in such irresistible form, Modern Tutor is easy to like. He took three goes to win a maiden last year but did it when dropped to this six furlongs and looks well treated for his handicap debut on that effort. A hood is applied for the first time and he should be able to settle behind a strong pace in this big field. 2.55 Newmarket The sprint handicap on 2,000 Guineas day really ought to have gone the way of Brazen, who pulled two lengths clear with a furlong to go but got tired and hung across the track. With the freshness out of him and more restrained tactics likely to be used, he can score despite the extra 3lb. There should be more give underfoot today and he is bred to appreciate that. 3.15 Newbury Stoute may strike again in the London Gold Cup with Hillstar, who looked a shade unlucky at Newmarket on his handicap debut last month. He was possibly given too much to do behind Soviet Rock that day and met trouble at a difficult moment but the winner has gone in again since from a 9lb higher mark. Hillstar has been raised the same amount, of course, so more is needed this time but he looks one to stick with. 3.30 Newmarket He may have had the run of the race when scoring at Newbury last month but Baltic Knight looked useful that day in what is usually an influential handicap.

This was also the first success at the highest level in this country for Silvestre de Sousa, who sent Farhh to the front just inside the two-furlong pole and quickly drew clear for an impressive four-length success. The significance for Godolphin, though, was much greater. The British Horseracing Authority is expected to release the results of drugs tests on all Godolphin-owned horses stabled in Newmarket, both at the yard of Saeed bin Suroor, who trains Farhh, and the disgraced former trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni, who was banned from the sport for eight years in April after he was found to have administered anabolic steroids to 15 horses at his Moulton Paddocks stable. Assuming that all the horses have tested clean \u2013 the way will be clear for Suroor to take temporary charge of Moulton Paddocks, and then send out runners from the yard 14 days later. All being well, Godolphin could be operating at something close to full strength by Royal Ascot in mid-June. &quot;We&apos;re trying to deal with this problem as quickly as we possibly can to restore the public&apos;s confidence,&quot; Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, said after Farhh&apos;s success, &quot;but I don&apos;t actually think that confidence has ebbed too much, because everybody knows that we&apos;ve always run a stable that is on its merits and nothing else. &quot;Obviously, Saeed has got nothing to do with that particular issue, and this horse has really put us back in pole position, which is where we like to be. He really did win very impressively, we were slightly concerned about his fitness level and the trip being a little sharp for him, but he handled the distance very well. Crisford added that Godolphin&apos;s internal investigation into the events at Moulton Paddocks is &quot;progressing very well&quot;, but would not say whether the findings will be published in full when it is complete. &quot;Hopefully it will [conclude] within the next couple of weeks, but we need to get the blood results back first before we can go to the next stage,&quot; he said. &quot;Everybody will be told what they need to know.&quot; Farhh could now attempt to give Godolphin a winner in the first race at Royal Ascot, the Queen Anne Stakes over a mile, although another Group One event, the 10-furlong Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes on 19 June, is an alternative target. &quot;He will run in one of those races,&quot; Crisford said, &quot;and we won&apos;t decide where he will go until the five-day stage.&quot; Farhh is joint-favourite at a best price of 7-2 for the Queen Anne, alongside Animal Kingdom, the Dubai World Cup winner, who is part-owned by Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s Darley Stud operation. The five-year-old is the same price with Paddy Power for the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes. Farhh was completing a double for Godolphin after the success of Willing Foe, last season&apos;s Ebor Handicap winner, in the Listed Aston Park Stakes. Willing Foe appears to have improved significantly over the winter, though it remains to be seen whether he can stay the two-and-a-half miles of the Gold Cup at Ascot, for which Godolphin could also field Colour Vision, last year&apos;s winner, and Cavalryman. &quot;Two miles would be within his compass,&quot; Crisford said. &quot;Two-and-a-half miles for the Gold Cup would be a big question mark.&quot; The last winner of the London Gold Cup saddled by a member of the Dunlop family was Green Moon, who took the race for Harry Dunlop in 2010 and achieved wider fame as the winner of the 2012 Melbourne Cup. The runner-up that day was Monterosso, who won the 2012 Dubai World Cup, the most valuable race of all, so the latest renewal, won by Harry&apos;s brother Ed with High Troja, could be one to keep an eye on. Sir Michael Stoute&apos;s Hillstar was the obvious improver in the field and was sent off at 10-11. He was giving 9lb to High Troja, however, and though he enjoyed a soft lead under Ryan Moore, he had no answer to the winner&apos;s finishing speed in the final quarter mile.", "title": "Farhh wins Newbury's Lockinge Stakes to lift scandal-rocked Godolphin", "sentences": ["&quot;He will run in one of those races,&quot; Crisford said, &quot;and we won&apos;t decide where he will go until the five-day stage.&quot; Farhh is joint-favourite at a best price of 7-2 for the Queen Anne, alongside Animal Kingdom, the Dubai World Cup winner, who is part-owned by Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s Darley Stud operation.", "The runner-up that day was Monterosso, who won the 2012 Dubai World Cup, the most valuable race of all, so the latest renewal, won by Harry&apos;s brother Ed with High Troja, could be one to keep an eye on."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-18T17:13:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/21/cameron-bring-own-tax-havens-to-book", "tags": ["Tax avoidance", "Corporate governance", "Business", "Cayman Islands", "David Cameron", "Politics", "G8", "World news"], "article": "I cannot see the point of tax havens. Or rather, I can see the point, but not why we tolerate them. They are licensed theft from the exchequer, offshore fiscal Scud aimed directly at the nation&apos;s budget. For a decade politicians in Washington, London and elsewhere have railed against them \u2013 but done nothing. Years ago I, by mistake, slipped an income tax voucher for March into my\u00a0folder for April. This delayed payment to the next tax year. Somehow I was detected. I was dragged before Her\u00a0Majesty&apos;s inspector, reprimanded and hit with a swingeing fine \u2013 just to\u00a0show who was boss. I wish my name had been Goldman Sachs, Amazon, Starbucks, Google or Apple. I would instead be popping in and out of Downing Street, lunching with the chancellor and having &quot;sweetheart&quot; conversations with HMRC,\u00a0offering them a few quid out of kindness as I left. The only downside would be a day spent before an &quot;influential&quot; Commons committee, listening to some bat called Margaret Hodge boring on about how evil I was. We cannot open a paper these days without reading tales of the fiscal antics of big corporations. Ever since the tycoon Leona Helmsley declared in 1989 that &quot;only the little people pay taxes&quot;, taxpayers have grown littler and littler. Treasuries have become more grasping. The wealth of the world has grown inexorably. But Helmsley&apos;s law has held\u00a0good. Taxes are paid by fools. Real\u00a0men go offshore. In the early days of the internet, companies such as Amazon, Google, Apple\u00a0and Facebook had liberal, funky images. Their staff said things like &quot;awesome&quot; and offered a service free at\u00a0the point of delivery. They were the welfare state of the wired generation, and the left loved them. Now they are grasping capitalists like the rest. They float their balance sheets on wild prospectuses. They gobble up competitors with leveraged deals. They buy hardware from cheap labour subsidiaries. Above all, they avoid tax by burying their businesses on Caribbean islands or in European principalities. The internet is built on a gigantic subsidy from the taxpayers of the world. The sheer gall with which the new cyber-corps defend tax avoidance is astonishing. They either claim that they employ lots of people and that is good enough, on which argument hardly an employer would pay tax; or, like Amazon, they pretend their real &quot;business&quot; is nowhere near where they trade. In four years, Amazon has paid just \u00a310m tax on \u00a312bn of UK sales, since it was really &quot;in&quot; Luxembourg. Likewise Google operates through companies lodged in Dublin, where tax can be negotiated close to nothing, while its large UK operation is merely &quot;encouraging&quot; sales. Since 1998 Starbucks has paid just \u00a38.6m in corporation tax on \u00a33bn in UK sales. Its boss said he might &quot;negotiate&quot; a bit more, but really Britain was just a &quot;franchise&quot;. Whose intelligence are these people trying to insult? And they are the tip of an iceberg, which Tax Justice Network estimates is a vast slew of $21 trillion stashed away in tax havens. Nor is only company tax foregone. The Times recently calculated that \u00a34.5bn in income tax was unpaid by individuals doing business in Britain but declaring offshore status. Some \u00a31bn was unpaid by UK &quot;residents&quot; of Monaco alone. Most of these people earn so much money that they could pay their taxes and hardly notice. The intention can only be to cheat other citizens of what should be a shared obligation to support the state. Every now and then politicians get hot under the collar about offshore tax, though usually only in opposition. In power, like Peter Mandelson, they get &quot;intensely relaxed \u2026 about the filthy rich&quot;, largely because they enjoy their company. The G20 in 2009 said it would\u00a0get tough with tax havens. It did\u00a0not. Nor did Alistair Darling or Gordon Brown. The Bank of England did\u00a0nothing. HMRC did nothing. The CBI did nothing \u2013 its president, Roger Carr, pleading last week that &quot;taxation cannot\u00a0be about morality&quot;. The irony is that the cyber-corps are now being hounded not by government, or the long arm of the fiscal law but by the web. It is the nerd in the attic, the downloader, the whistleblower who is hacking into tax haven records, publishing lists of tax dodgers and supplying information to the Revenue. Even then the only remedy is &quot;name and shame&quot;. There are proposals to force firms doing any sort of business in Britain (and hopefully Europe and the US) to register their profits wherever they operate, and be assessed for tax pro rata. The trouble is that any company whose business is not nailed to British soil seems to treat corporation tax as voluntary. It might be better to ease it out in favour of sales tax, business property tax and, if the City bites the bullet, a financial transactions tax. Meanwhile we gasp at the absurdity of HMRC in ignoring the cyber-corps&apos; gigantic warehouses and gleaming London offices as evidence of &quot;business&quot;. The biggest challenge lies in the havens themselves. Why do they survive as part of any tolerated union? Brussels is ruthless in enforcing its rules on members, yet indulges such fiscal miscreants as Luxembourg, Liechtenstein and Monaco. Why does it not excoriate Switzerland? The British Crown retains &quot;dependencies&quot; that enjoy the benefits of UK citizenship and yet harbour people who are lifting billions of pounds from UK taxpayers. The Cayman Islands, the worst culprit, has a government accountable to Britain that enforces banking secrecy, levies zero company tax and is consequently home to the biggest money-laundering and tax-evading operation this side of Dubai. British governments sometimes claim they turn a blind eye to these practices and places because they fear the tax-dodgers might go further afield, to the Gulf and the east. Why not then ban the dodgers from residing in England and their &quot;companies&quot; from operating in England \u2013 and, if Europe means anything, from Europe? Besides, we do not allow fraudsters free rein for fear they might take their business abroad. David Cameron and George Osborne have commendably reiterated opposition to tax rackets that drain some \u00a37bn from their revenue each year. Both have condemned tax &quot;avoiders&quot; and their accountants. Next month the G8 is again purported to be &quot;getting tough on tax havens&quot;, this time at Cameron&apos;s bidding.

The spectrum in which investigators will be working now is broad, and the characters within it unstable and unpredictable. In the immediate aftermath of the attack in south London, detectives might have been reluctant to tell the home secretary, Theresa May, conclusively that this was the work of jihadists, but as the hours passed any doubts must have evaporated. The language attributed to one of the men filmed at the scene, and brandishing a bloodied knife, was stark: &quot;We swear by almighty Allah we will never stop fighting you. The only reasons we have done this is because Muslims are dying every day. This British soldier is an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. We must fight them. &quot;I apologise that women had to witness this today, but in our land our women have to see the same. You people will never be safe. Remove your government. They don&apos;t care about you.&quot; This is classic al-Qaida rhetoric, similar to the phrases used by suicide bombers who have left martyrdom videos. Though the man did not appear to mention Afghanistan, this is the only country in which British soldiers are now directly embroiled in a conflict. More than 440 soldiers have been killed in the 12-year war in Afghanistan, including some shot by members of the Afghan security forces they are supposed to be supporting. British and Nato involvement in the fight against the Taliban is winding down, but the UK will still have a presence there until the end of next year. The decision last night to convene Cobra, the Cabinet Office committee that deals with security emergencies, came after the home secretary took soundings from the new head of MI5, Andrew Parker, and the Scotland Yard commissioner, Bernard Hogan-Howe. The Joint Terrorism Analysis Centre (JTAC), which includes members from MI5, MI6, GCHQ, the police and Ministry of Defence, will convene to decide what conclusions can be drawn from what has happened, even at this early stage. Crucially, JTAC will recommend whether to alter the national threat assessment level, which now stands at &quot;substantial&quot;. If there is any suggestion that this attack might be the start of a wave, the threat level will be increased to either severe or the highest level, critical.MI5 and Scotland Yard have warned repeatedly in recent years about self-starters \u2013 people who have been radicalised in the UK, affected, perhaps, by the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq, or by Arab spring events, or by emerging al-Qaida networks in Africa. Hundreds of Britons are known to have gone to Syria over the last two years to support the rebellion against Bashar al-Assad. The Syrian conflict is now the &quot;jihadist destination of choice&quot;, according to Whitehall officials. Britons are also known to have been involved with the al-Nusra front, which is heavily infused with al-Qaida elements from Iraq and has been designated a terrorist group by the US. Some of those people going abroad from the UK were already known to MI5 and MI6; some have now returned home. Many others will have come and gone without investigators knowing. The same thing has happened in Somalia, where a smaller number of Britons have been in recent years, to support the al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabaab. &quot;What they do when they come back here is more worrying to us than what they do when they are out there,&quot; is how one official put it. Even if those responsible for the Woolwich attack had not been abroad, they could have been motivated closer to home or online. Security officials have highlighted the dangers posed by the al-Qaida online magazine, Inspire, which is constantly urging its readers to undertake attacks, rather than wait for training or orders from above. Inspire, which is the work of al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsular (AQAP), has been causing concern since it was first published in 2010; the latest edition has just been published and is said to include an &quot;Open Source Jihad (OSJ) section \u2026 for aspiring jihadists seeking to assassinate US and European leaders&quot;. Though some academics have doubted whether Inspire is such a powerful tool, there is evidence that people inclined to commit violence have been tipped into action by such entreaties. Some of the biggest counter terror operations of recent years have involved suspects who have turned by Inspire. Three men from Birmingham were convicted this year of plotting the biggest potential terrorist atrocity than the 7 July attacks. They had read the magazine and been influenced by the preachings of Anwar al Awlaki, the now dead former AQAP leader. Attempts have been made to shut down the magazine, and to disrupt it by cyber warfare. Two years ago MI6 and GCHQ hacked into an article which set out how to make a bomb, and replaced the recipe with one for cupcakes. However, the magazine is still disseminated via internet forums. Other extremists who have used Awlaki as motivation to mount terror attacks in the UK include Roshonara Choudhry, who attacked the Labour MP Stephen Timms in his constituency surgery. Choudry, who was jailed for life in 2010, is also said to have named a US-based website as a source of inspiration. In 2007 a group of extremists in Birmingham plotted to behead a British Muslim soldier to undermine the morale of the British army and inhibit its recruitment of Muslims. The leader, Parviz Khan, admitted the plot and was sentenced to life imprisonment, to serve at least 14 years. Though the number of people arrested for terrorist offences have fallen in recent years, the police and MI5 still make arrests, and still uncover plots. &quot;They haven&apos;t given up,&quot; an official said. Last year, the Royal United Services Institute [RUSI] thinktank published a report which set out the difficulties now facing counter-terrorism officers; with al-Qaida fragmented and &quot;franchised&quot; across the Arab world and in Africa, identifying suspects was seen as harder than ever. The report warned: &quot;Though the death of Bin Laden began a succession of counter-terrorist victories in 2011, the threat from Jihadist terrorism has not diminished. If anything, the risk has evolved from plots carried out by organised cells within a leadership structure, to one carried out by lone wolves, radicalised by material on the internet. &quot;The latter is harder to track down and is potent given the uncertain international situation; where the outcome of the Arab spring has not been settled, and where there are frequent returns of British citizens from war zones such as Somalia and Yemen.&quot; The institute noted the arrival home of self-radicalised fighters would coincide with the steady release from prison of people convicted of terrorist offences in Britain over the last decade. It says their sentences, for good legal reasons, typically have not been very long. Michael Clarke, the director of RUSI, said: &quot;More experienced lone-wolf terrorists are likely to be returning to Britain in the next couple of years, not from training camps in Pakistan and via airports in Karachi and Dubai, but from wars in Somalia, Yemen, or Nigeria, from the renewed violence in Iraq, and from destinations and via routes that will be far more difficult for security services to monitor.&quot;", "title": "Woolwich attack: security forces will look at lone wolf and jihadist theories", "sentences": ["Michael Clarke, the director of RUSI, said: &quot;More experienced lone-wolf terrorists are likely to be returning to Britain in the next couple of years, not from training camps in Pakistan and via airports in Karachi and Dubai, but from wars in Somalia, Yemen, or Nigeria, from the renewed violence in Iraq, and from destinations and via routes that will be far more difficult for security services to monitor.&quot;"], "publicationDate": "2013-05-23T09:31:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/23/sheikh-mohammed-outlaws-steroids-dubai", "tags": ["Godolphin", "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Drugs in sport", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "The use of anabolic steroids on sport horses will be made a criminal offence in Dubai with immediate effect in the wake of the Godolphin doping scandal, Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum, the country&apos;s ruler and the founder of Godolphin, said on Thursday. Describing the use of anabolic steroids on at least 22 horses at Godolphin&apos;s Moulton Paddocks in Newmarket as &quot;the unfortunate recent event,&quot; Sheikh Mohammed said in a statement that he &quot;had directed that a decree be issued making, with immediate effect, the import, sale, purchase or use of anabolic steroids in horse sports a criminal offence under the UAE penal laws&quot;. The sheikh&apos;s statement, which was posted on Godolphin&apos;s website, said that the organisation&apos;s founder has &quot;always believed in the integrity of horse racing and all other horse sports&quot;. It continued: &quot;Regrettably, one of my stables in Europe has recently fallen below the standards that I expect and will tolerate. As soon as the internal investigations are complete and the requisite pre-emptory rules are put in place, Godolphin will go from strength to strength and lead, once again, adherence to the highest standards in that gracious sport.&quot; Discrepancies in the rules on the use of anabolic steroids around the world were highlighted when Mahmood al-Zarooni, who had been Godolphin&apos;s trainer at Moulton Paddocks since March 2010, was banned from the sport for eight years last month for administering the drugs to 15 horses at the yard. Zarooni has lodged an appeal, though it has emerged that at least seven more horses, including Encke, last year&apos;s St Leger winner, were also doped with the performance-enhancing drugs, for which Britain operates a zero-tolerance policy. Dubai, in common with several other major racing jurisdictions including Australia and the United States, had previously allowed the use of steroids provided that all traces of the drugs had left the horse&apos;s system when it competes. Zarooni is reported to have told the British Horseracing Authority&apos;s disciplinary hearing that he imported the steroids he used at Moulton Paddocks from Dubai during regular visits to his home country to saddle runners at the Carnival meeting between January and March. Following the sheikh&apos;s decision to criminalise not just the use of anabolic steroids on sport horses, but the import, purchase or possession of the drugs too, Dubai can claim to have even stricter rules than those which operate in Britain. The move to strengthen the rules on steroids in Dubai comes before the Derby at Epsom on 1 June, when Sheikh Mohammed will hope to realise one of his few remaining ambitions in racing by leading in a winner of the most famous Classic. Dawn Approach, who remained at Jim Bolger&apos;s stable in Ireland when Godolphin purchased a 51% interest in the colt after his victory in the Coventry Stakes at Royal Ascot last year, is expected to set off as the odds-on favourite. Paul Struthers, the chief executive of the Professional Jockeys&apos; Association, said on Thursday that it will support Eddie Ahern in his appeal against a 10-year ban from the sport for breaches of the anticorruption rules that was imposed by a BHA disciplinary panel on Wednesday. &quot;Eddie Ahern is adamant that he is not guilty,&quot; Struthers said. &quot;It is the PJA&apos;s role to support its members prior to and leading up to any disciplinary proceedings, and to provide any subsequent advice and non-financial support that is required.&quot;", "title": "Sheikh Mohammed outlaws use of anabolic steroids in Dubai horse racing", "sentences": ["The use of anabolic steroids on sport horses will be made a criminal offence in Dubai with immediate effect in the wake of the Godolphin doping scandal, Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum, the country&apos;s ruler and the founder of Godolphin, said on Thursday.", "Dubai, in common with several other major racing jurisdictions including Australia and the United States, had previously allowed the use of steroids provided that all traces of the drugs had left the horse&apos;s system when it competes.", "Zarooni is reported to have told the British Horseracing Authority&apos;s disciplinary hearing that he imported the steroids he used at Moulton Paddocks from Dubai during regular visits to his home country to saddle runners at the Carnival meeting between January and March.", "Following the sheikh&apos;s decision to criminalise not just the use of anabolic steroids on sport horses, but the import, purchase or possession of the drugs too, Dubai can claim to have even stricter rules than those which operate in Britain.", "The move to strengthen the rules on steroids in Dubai comes before the Derby at Epsom on 1 June, when Sheikh Mohammed will hope to realise one of his few remaining ambitions in racing by leading in a winner of the most famous Classic."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-23T16:11:59Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/may/24/home-without-credible-derby-contender", "tags": ["The Derby", "Horse racing", "Sport", "The Derby 2013"], "article": "The Listed Cocked Hat Stakes here on Friday was, in theory at least, the final British Derby trial of 2013 and it drew a suitably disappointing line below a process that has failed to produce an obvious home-trained contender for the sport&apos;s most famous Classic on 1 June. Three horses were declared, without an entry at Epsom between them, and just two went to post. One of those was a gelding, ineligible for the Derby. With an air of inevitability on a damp, grey afternoon, the gelding won. Time may show that Disclaimer&apos;s defeat of Contributer was one of the better match-race performances of recent times, as Contributer was four lengths behind Magician, the favourite for Saturday&apos;s Irish 2,000 Guineas, in the Dee Stakes at Chester last time out. In terms of adding a leading contender from a British stable to the Derby line-up, though, the Cocked Hat failed miserably, just as the other trials have failed from Lingfield and Chester to York. Until 2006, this race was known as the Predominate Stakes and though Troy, in 1979, is the only winner to go on to victory in the Derby, it has often sent horses on to Epsom at a single-figure price. The brilliant Dubai Millennium, who suffered his only defeat in 10 starts when favourite for the 1999 Derby, won a Predominate, while three years ago, Rewilding set off as a 9-2 chance for the Classic after winning at Goodwood. This year, Libertarian, the shock Dante winner, is the shortest-priced British-trained runner in the Derby betting, at best odds of 20-1. &quot;What you have to remember is that the majority of the Derby runners will be by stallions who were trained in Ireland,&quot; Ed Dunlop, the trainer of Contributer, said after this race, &quot;and the majority of the good ones are trained by Aidan O&apos;Brien. &quot;In 17 years, I think I&apos;ve had two runners in the Derby. Very few of us have horses that are bred to win the Derby, though this horse is by High Chaparral. I don&apos;t think I even made an entry in the Derby two years ago. &quot;This race has been moved, it&apos;s eight days before the Derby and it&apos;s not going to be a Derby trial again. There were only two runners, but there aren&apos;t the horses about. We&apos;re not hiding them. I&apos;ve got 90 horses and I don&apos;t have one in the Derby.&quot; Despite having two runners, the Cocked Hat produced some dramatic swings of fortune on Betfair, as Tom Queally made the running on Disclaimer and then Ryan More produced Contributer, the favourite, with a strong challenge. Queally had not asked Disclaimer for an effort, though, and, while he was briefly headed, Disclaimer then stayed on strongly to win, a rewarding result for the exchange player who had \u00a35 matched at an extraordinary 99-1. The gelding operation has removed Disclaimer&apos;s chance to contest a British Classic, but Contributer could yet build on the promise of his run behind Magician this month, possibly in the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot. &quot;He went to win his race then pulled himself up in front. My jockey&apos;s not happy,&quot; Dunlop said. &quot;He [Contributer] thought he&apos;d done enough and the other horse overtook him.&quot; When Dawn Approach won the 2,000 Guineas on 4 May, he put down a marker for Epsom that Britain&apos;s racing industry has failed to approach, never mind cross. The rehearsals are over and Dawn Approach is a much shorter price for the Classic than he was three weeks ago.

Could it? Whatever else can be said of Garc\u00eda, and plenty has since he sparked a worldwide race storm on Tuesday nightthis week, he clearly retains the ability to put off-course controversy to one side when at his place of work. The Spaniard should have been removed from the European Tour&apos;s flagship event after his &quot;fried chicken&quot; slur of Tiger Woods, or at the very least disciplined. Instead O&apos;Grady&apos;s leniency in accepting Garcia&apos;s apology was compounded when the chief executive referred to black people as &quot;coloured&quot;. While O&apos;Grady has not been seen or heard from since Wednesday Garc\u00eda has played himself into a position where he could win on what is a rare playing visit to England. A 68 leaves him five under par and within four of the leader, Alejandro Ca\u00f1izares. At this rate Garc\u00eda and O&apos;Grady could be reunited on the 18th green, and not only by ignominy, at the championship denouement. &quot;I can&apos;t predict the future,&quot; Garc\u00eda said when asked about his chances. An unavoidable glimpse back to the notorious events followed. &quot;If I could, I wouldn&apos;t be in this problem. This has been a tough week but I have been getting better every day, so hopefully I can finish on a high note. I&apos;ll go now to watch the Champions League final, try to disconnect a little bit and enjoy it.&quot; As has been the case from his step on to the 1st tee on Thursday Garcia was again afforded unwavering support from the galleries. That has unquestionably aided his performance. It remains entirely probable that the 33-year-old will be handed a rougher ride when he reappears on the other side of the Atlantic at next month&apos;s US Open, but for now Garc\u00eda is grateful for public backing. &quot;The galleries, I don&apos;t even have words to describe how they have been,&quot; he said. &quot;There is no doubt that everybody has made it easier for me here. Especially in the UK, they have always been amazing to me. I love playing in the UK. I have always said it; in my mind these are the best crowds we have. They really understand the game.&quot; Those spectators also have a strong affinity to the man who lies second, a shot behind Ca\u00f1izares, Lee Westwood.The Englishman dropped a single stroke en route to his third-round 67 and pointed to the significance of potentially winning again in Europe for the first time since he set up home in the United States. &quot;It would probably be right up there; it would probably be in the top three, I would say,&quot; Westwood said. &quot;The win in Dubai [in 2009] was obviously a big win because it was to win the money list as well. So you can&apos;t really not rate that one highly. Going down to Australia in 1997 when I was just on tour and beating Greg Norman for the Australian Open in a playoff, I rate that one highly and I probably would put this in with those two.&quot; Ominously for the others on the leaderboard, Westwood has a strong record here. He has finished second twice in this tournament and claimed the World Match Play title, also on the West Course, 13 years ago. This year, Westwood has displayed consistency without yet closing out the victory, which should arrive, if not in Surrey, before too long. &quot;I&apos;m after as many wins as I can get, no matter where they are,&quot; Westwood said. &quot;And this is a course I have enjoyed playing and it&apos;s suited me. I always feel like I have played pretty well around here. So it wouldn&apos;t surprise me [to win], but I&apos;m still far from holding the trophy up. It is a very crowded leaderboard. &quot;Today was one of the most fun days I have ever had on the golf course. The crowds have always been good when I played in England but I felt a lot of support out there. They must be missing me, now that I live in Florida.&quot;", "title": "Sergio Garc\u00eda puts Tiger Woods slur behind him at PGA Championship", "sentences": ["&quot;The win in Dubai [in 2009] was obviously a big win because it was to win the money list as well."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-25T17:06:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/may/26/lamprell-heat-off-meeting-dubai", "tags": ["Corporate governance", "Management", "Oil and gas companies", "Oil", "Energy industry", "Kingfisher", "Severn Trent", "Utilities", "Retail industry", "Business"], "article": "In an age where one or two shareholders have made occasional moves that might be portrayed as courageous, and posed the odd tricky question to company management, here is a public relations quandary. How does a London-listed company best stage an annual general meeting as shareholders reflect on a year in which (a) their investment has slumped by more than 60%; (b) the company has issued five (count &apos;em) profit warnings; and (c) one of those profit warnings came just a fortnight after two executives sold substantial stakes in the business? The answer to that thorny problem is simple. Hold the meeting in Dubai. And on a bank holiday. That is how the oil rig builder Lamprell will conduct its annual gathering on Monday, so if you&apos;re reading this over Sunday brunch and you fancied attending \u2013 you&apos;ll need to get a move on. To be fair to Lamprell, the company has enjoyed a far better 2013 (almost no sign of farce so far) and, being based in the emirate, it has staged previous annual meetings there. Dubai is also home to the group&apos;s largest shareholder \u2013 founder and current company president, Steven Lamprell. No doubt he&apos;ll use tomorrow&apos;s meeting to ask himself some pretty searching questions. DIY doesn&apos;t do it for the analysts There was a time when, for many, a bank holiday weekend meant a trip to a do-it-yourself store. Thankfully, for those without a screw loose, that trend has rapidly subsided, as amateur tradespeople begin to realise that even a plumber&apos;s extortionate charges are preferable to those disparaging looks from your spouse after you&apos;ve flooded the kids&apos; bedroom. Of course, the fact that common sense is beginning to break out is not tremendous news for Kingfisher, the owner of B&amp;Q and other stores designed to inflict similar miseries on the French. The company is set to update investors this week with news of its first-quarter trading, when the company is expected to unveil profits and sales that are falling quicker than a set of DIY shelving. As analysts at Cantor Fitzgerald put it: &quot;Trading conditions remain difficult in both Kingfisher&apos;s core markets ... In the UK, where the DIY market has been in decline for 10 years, a consumer shift from DIY to DFM and pressure on margins will continue to hold back growth.&quot; DFM means &quot;done for me&quot;. City wags say, when it comes to Kingfisher shareholders, they&apos;re simply DF. Severn Trent proves that water can rise Three days before Christmas 2011, analysts at Investec told clients to buy shares in Severn Trent at \u00a314.54 a pop \u2013 which looks pretty sage advice, as they closed on Friday at more than \u00a320. The reason this rather obscure note to investors is worth a mention now is not to laud Investec (Lord knows they get their fair share of calls wrong) but because it seems it was the last buy note that any City analyst bothered to send about the utility company. According to the website Digital Look, which tracks such things, Credit Suisse, Morgan Stanley and Bank of America were all indifferent to the shares as recently as last month at around \u00a317 each, while Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale took a firmer view and told clients to dump some. Earlier this month, HSBC followed SG&apos;s punt and advised its customers to cut their stakes in the utility, after the shares had risen to \u00a318. So what did they all miss? Well, a consortium including a Canadian pension fund and Kuwait decided to make a \u00a35bn bid for the company earlier in May that saw the shares leap 14% in a day on top of April&apos;s 6% rise. This week, Severn Trent, which reckons the offer isn&apos;t high enough, will attempt to show why it is worth more at its annual results. And who knows?

Saturday&apos;s Derby at Epsom offers purist followers of the sport some hope of wresting the conversation back to the basic question of which horse is best \u2014 but the difficulty for them is in settling on a preferred outcome. Dawn Approach, a bonny and unbeaten chestnut, is the hot favourite and might prove the sort of champion to engage the wider public as Frankel and Kauto Star have done. But victory for him will not be an unqualified Good Thing, as he carries the royal blue colours of Godolphin, the bloodstock organisation set up by Sheikh Mohammed in 1994 to promote Dubai but is currently best known for its association with the recent steroid scandal. There is no good reason why that should undercut Dawn Approach&apos;s achievements. He has always been trained in Ireland by Jim Bolger, whereas the steroid story has centred on\u00a0Mahmood al-Zarooni, formerly based\u00a0in Newmarket but now the subject of an eight-year worldwide training ban. Investigations continue, but the official story so far is that Zarooni was acting without the knowledge of anyone\u00a0else at Godolphin. Even so, the Sheikh&apos;s outfit is blamed by some for being the cause of such terrible publicity for horse racing that a first Derby victory for it would not be universally popular at this point. One upside is that it would give the Sheikh a chance to resume his conversation with Clare Balding on the subject of how the steroid issue has been handled by the sport&apos;s ruling body. When she raised the question at Newmarket recently, he terminated their live interview with a gruff: &quot;That&apos;s up to them.&quot; Another tarnished brand looking to regain some lustre at Epsom is that of Frankie Dettori, formerly the Sheikh&apos;s star jockey but dropped last year, just weeks before it became known that he had failed a drug test for cocaine while riding in France. Now the Italian is trying to start out as a freelance but he\u00a0has so far failed to clear the first hurdle of recovering his jockey&apos;s licence, a full week after the end of his six\u2011month ban. &quot;I&apos;m fit and healthy and ready to go,&quot; he told Balding in a confessional interview but that did not convince the French authorities, who, it seems, were less than completely satisfied after\u00a0he took a series of tests there in April. Dettori dutifully returned to repeat the\u00a0rigmarole last week and still hopes to be passed fit before Saturday&apos;s Classic. Whether there will be any horses left for him to ride is another question. Connections of the remaining runners appear to be pressing ahead with their plans rather than waiting to learn whether he&apos;ll be free and it may be that, at 42, he is finding a diminished demand for his services. Last week&apos;s bad-news story involved\u00a0the jockey Eddie Ahern being banned for 10 years for corruption offences. All told, recent headlines have made things difficult for Nick Attenborough, director of consumer PR at Great British Racing, the sport&apos;s promotional wing, but he remains upbeat. &quot;I don&apos;t find it as challenging as you might expect,&quot; he says when asked about championing the Derby against such a sordid backdrop. &quot;These stories are offensive for those\u00a0of us who love racing but the wider public don&apos;t notice as much, or, if they do, perhaps they think that racing has always had a bit of something going\u00a0on.&quot; He says figures for last year showed the sport growing in popularity each month. This week, he is proud to report,\u00a0racing will feature in both Nuts and Zoo magazines, which will carry a two-page spread on the best way to ride Epsom, as\u00a0outlined by the jockey Johnny Murtagh, three times a Derby winner. Dettori, who has but a single Derby to his name, should order his copy now. Attenborough&apos;s life would be easier if his task were to generate interest in the Derby of 100 years ago. This is the centenary of the race in which the suffragette Emily Davison ran onto the track and was fatally knocked down by George V&apos;s horse, a story retold on Channel 4 last night by Balding, who is doing her bit for equality by simultaneously holding down half of all\u00a0jobs in broadcasting. The anniversary is a tricky one for officials at Epsom, who want to show appropriate respect while stopping a long way short of condoning people running on the track mid-race. Racing, meanwhile, has not made quite the progress towards gender equality that Davison would have hoped to see. Of the 24 horses still entered in the Derby at the time of writing, just one is trained by a woman and no woman is likely to get a ride in the race. When the excellent Hayley Turner finally got her first Derby mount last year, it was on a 25-1 shot who trailed home ninth of\u00a0nine.", "title": "Epsom Derby is horse racing's chance to put steroid scandal aside", "sentences": ["But victory for him will not be an unqualified Good Thing, as he carries the royal blue colours of Godolphin, the bloodstock organisation set up by Sheikh Mohammed in 1994 to promote Dubai but is currently best known for its association with the recent steroid scandal."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-26T23:27:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/may/28/edward-viii-the-lion-king", "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "article": "The Apprentice9pm, BBC1 Lord Sugar tells his competing wazzocks to pack for Dubai, the city of gaudy excess and needless acquisition.

Tomic Sr is scheduled to defend allegations in a Madrid court in September that he head-butted his son&apos;s hitting partner, Thomas Drouet, at the tournament there last month, and stewards were on alert to keep him off the grounds. He watched the match in a Paris hotel room and will return with Bernard to his son&apos;s apartment in Monte Carlo , before they leave next week for Queen&apos;s, Eastbourne and Wimbledon. The All England Club said of Tomic Sr night: &quot;We are supporting the ban on accreditation pending his investigation/trial, and we will also look to prevent entrance by ticket.&quot; Tomic played with his usual disregard for convention and produced some sizzling shots in an hour and 51 minutes before quitting against Hanescu, who led 7-5, 7-6, 2-1 when the muscle tear that struck the Australian early in the match became unbearably painful. &quot;I&apos;d like to say some things before you guys ask me about them \u2013 obviously involving my father,&quot; Tomic, 20, said later. &quot;He&apos;s here right now in Paris, so he&apos;s still working with me, he&apos;s still my dad, he&apos;s still my coach, and I love him a lot. As for the incident, it&apos;s very difficult for me to put my words into that. I&apos;m the type of guy who can let these things go. I was feeling fine. The last two weeks, I was training well, playing well, didn&apos;t think a lot about it, was not worried. &quot;My dad&apos;s still my coach, and he&apos;ll always be. I grew up with him and he knows me better than everyone else. I might put someone else on board who can help my dad, and they can negotiate. I&apos;d like to get someone in before the grass.&quot; Tomic was ranked No27 in the world a year ago, but has slipped to 61 after a typically chaotic season. &quot;After Australia [in January] I took two weeks off, and I shouldn&apos;t have done that.

Didn&apos;t play that good in Indian Wells and Miami and then came to Barcelona, where I had problems. I had a skin infection for 10 days, couldn&apos;t play there, then moved on to Madrid and what happened there. It was just a little bit strange what happened the last few months. &quot;I have experienced a lot the last few years. When I didn&apos;t have to defend [points] it was very easy and comfortable. I was very relaxed. But then it became difficult to defend stuff. &quot;I got nervous \u2013 a little bit of pressure and I didn&apos;t handle it well. When I turned it around, I played well and showed that I can play. But this is the problem at a young age, you&apos;re up and down. I&apos;ve got to just keep working hard, keep trying, because, once I get to where I want to be, then there&apos;s no stopping me. [Now], I&apos;ve got to keep my head up, take four or five days off, see what the doctor says and get ready for the grass. &quot;[Wimbledon] is where it all started for me [he made the 2011 quarter-finals, where he took a set off Novak Djokovic]. If I can get in there, relaxed on the grass, that&apos;s big for me, because once I play relaxed, I can beat almost anyone.

The Colombian, who came close to beating Roger Federer in the first round at Wimbledon three years ago, was 4-3 and 40-0 up before a sore elbow undermined his tennis and he retired when 6-4 and 1-0 down. Late in the day, Elena Baltacha lost to the Croatia-born New Zealander Marina Erakovic, who came to the tournament in dreadful form \u2013 one win from her past eight \u2013 but played some scintillating tennis from all parts of the court to win 6-3, 6-0 in 56 minutes.

The news was broken by the British Horseracing Authority, whose press office said Zarooni&apos;s solicitors had withdrawn the appeal. Zarooni was banned four days after it was revealed that 11 horses had tested positive for anabolic steroids at his Moulton Paddocks stable in Newmarket, where a quarter of his string were tested by BHA vets in an unannounced raid in early April. He offered no defence at a hastily arranged hearing and even admitted having given steroids to another four. There was some sensation when he originally made an appeal, with some suggestion on social media that he might try to reduce his own responsibility for the scandal by implicating others, though the BHA&apos;s information was always that the appeal was restricted to the length of the ban. Zarooni&apos;s prospects of any success in that regard appeared to be dramatically reduced when it was revealed that a further seven horses at Moulton Paddocks had returned positive tests, including last year&apos;s St Leger winner, Encke. BHA officials have previously said that no charges would be considered in respect of those seven until Zarooni&apos;s appeal had run its course. As yet, there is no indication whether charges will now be pursued. Zarooni&apos;s ban prevents him from having access to any racecourse or racing stable in Britain and licensed professionals in this country are banned from discussing racing matters with him. The ban is expected to be reciprocated in other racing jurisdictions around the world. It is believed that Zarooni has returned to his native Dubai. The BHA&apos;s investigation into the steroid scandal continues, though it is not yet clear how much of the conclusions will be made public. The regulator&apos;s disciplinary panel decided on the basis of the evidence available in late April that Zarooni had acted alone, instructing junior members of staff to apply the steroids without telling them what the substance was. Zarooni was one of two trainers employed in Newmarket by Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s Godolphin operation. The other, Saeed bin Suroor, has been based at another stable about a mile from Moulton Paddocks and all of his horses have been tested clean by the BHA since the story broke. Bin Suroor is in the process of taking control of the horses formerly in Zarooni&apos;s care and could start running them next month, except for those that have tested positive, which are banned from racing for six months. Sheikh Mohammed has let it be known that he is furious about Zarooni&apos;s actions. Last week, he announced plans to criminalise the use of steroids in horse sports across the UAE.

A stylish and hugely experienced jockey, Velazquez did well to stay aboard when his mount unexpectedly took to the air as they passed the point where horses emerge on to the track from under the grandstand. &quot;You&apos;ve got to expect something, it&apos;s a new track. He&apos;s seen something that&apos;s not supposed to be there, obviously, it&apos;s going the opposite way to the grass.

I saw him seeing something, he did give me the sign before he was going to do it, so I was kind of prepared.&quot; Velazquez was sure that Animal Kingdom had not been spooked by a small group of people against the rail at the point where he jumped, which would have been a worrying sign with the busy Royal crowd in mind. &quot;If it would have been the people he would have gone the other way [towards the middle of the track],&quot; Velazquez said. &quot;He actually looked at the people before that, I thought that&apos;s what he saw first and then he looked again \u2026 I just didn&apos;t think he was going to do it because he looked at it and I kind of, &apos;Hah!&apos;, yelling at him, but he jumped right on top of it. It was a very awkward moment but thankfully nothing happened.&quot; The jockey hopes Animal Kingdom will do no such thing at any point of the Queen Anne itself but after a short discussion between him and the horse&apos;s trainer, Graham Motion, the two men agreed the horse might wear a noseband, which they called a &quot;shadow roll&quot;, on top of his usual blinkers. Motion did not see the incident, as he accompanied Animal Kingdom and his galloping companion to the start of the work, riding a pony. He then hacked up Ascot&apos;s straight a long way behind the two thoroughbreds. &quot;Johnny told me about it,&quot; said Motion. &quot;He just ducked from a shadow, I believe.

I just thought it was really important for the horse. What we&apos;re doing with this horse is so foreign to anything he&apos;s ever done before that I think, every stone we can turn, it really helps and I think this was a big part of it. &quot;I&apos;m very satisfied with how it went and Johnny seems really pleased with him. I&apos;m really pleased that he handled the soft grass. For us, it was very soft out there today, softer than I thought it was. &quot;Johnny felt he handled it great.

The three are believed to have been killed on Wednesday in Idlib province in the north of Syria. Syrian TV broadcast footage of the dead Briton&apos;s passport which appeared to identify him as 22-year-old Ali Almanasfi, born in London in June 1990. The Foreign Office could not confirm any details about the Briton and his identity could not immediately be verified. Syrian TV also identified the dead American woman as Nicole Mansfield, 33, from Michigan. The American woman&apos;s family said she had died while apparently fighting with the rebels against government forces. &quot;I&apos;m just devastated,&quot; her aunt, Monica Mansfield Speelman, told Reuters. &quot;Evidently, she was fighting with opposition forces.&quot; Speelman said the FBI had informed the family on Thursday afternoon. Rami Abdul-Rahman, of the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the trio had been ambushed in Idlib province, which is largely controlled by Syria&apos;s opposition. The Syrian government controls Idlib city. He told the Guardian: &quot;These people got too close to some military bases near Idlib and were killed.&quot; Abdul-Rahman said he did not know the nationality of the third foreigner. He also said it was unclear if the group was affiliated with the moderate Free Syrian Army (FSA) or a more radical opposition Islamist militia such as the al-Qaida-affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra. The three foreigners had almost certainly crossed into Syria from Turkey, either legally or illegally, he added. The Syrian TV footage showed a black VW Golf car riddled with bullets, in which the foreigners had apparently been travelling. It also said government forces had retrieved several Kalashnikovs. It showed a photo of what appeared to be the dead Briton, with dark hair and a short beard.

As little as 12 months ago, his daydream would have run something like this. There would have been the acclaim from tens of thousands of spectators as the Sheikh led his colt towards the famous circular winner&apos;s enclosure below the Queen&apos;s Stand. A grateful handshake with Saeed bin Suroor, the winning trainer, or perhaps Mahmood al-Zarooni, the new man on his team with two Classic wins to his name already. And the growing anticipation as Frankie Dettori, the Sheikh&apos;s loyal jockey for two decades, prepared to perform his famous flying dismount. One sacking and one doping scandal later, the Queen&apos;s Stand and the winner&apos;s enclosure are the only parts of the fantasy that Sheikh Mohammed might recognise if Dawn Approach, the hot favourite, becomes the first horse to win the Derby in Godolphin&apos;s royal blue colours on Saturday. Dettori&apos;s contract as Godolphin&apos;s No1 jockey was not renewed after he agreed to ride Camelot for John Magnier, the Sheikh&apos;s bitter rival, in last year&apos;s Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe. But at least he is back in the game after serving a six-month drugs suspension, unlike Zarooni, who is banned from every racecourse on the planet for the next eight years after he admitted doping horses at his Godolphin-owned yard in Newmarket with anabolic steroids. Suroor will be a spectator at Epsom too. Many hundreds of Classically bred colts have passed through his hands during his 18 years with Godolphin, yet it is Jim Bolger, who trains in County Carlow, and Kevin Manning, his son-in-law and stable jockey, who bear the burden of the Sheikh&apos;s hope and expectation on Saturday. Dawn Approach is the first Godolphin-owned horse that Bolger has trained, and could well prove to be the most important. Sheikh Mohammed arrives at Epsom bruised and wounded. A few days ago, he issued an edict banning the use of anabolic steroids on all sport horses in Dubai, which included a promise that soon Godolphin &quot;will go from strength to strength and lead, once again, adherence to the highest standards in that gracious sport&quot;. Yet Zarooni&apos;s extensive and systematic doping was uncovered only in mid-April. No one can be certain that such a renaissance is even possible. The Godolphin brand may have been damaged beyond repair. Even without the shadow cast by the dopings, the Sheikh&apos;s failure to see his colours win the Derby despite ploughing billions into his effort would be a source of fascination. He has been second and third and seen favourites beaten, including the brilliant Dubai Millennium, whose flop at Epsom was his only defeat in an outstanding 10-race career. But the Sheikh is hardly the first rich and powerful man before whom the Derby has refused to yield, nor the first to face a decisive moment on Epsom Downs. Fortunes and careers have been made and ruined here for more than two centuries, while political and personal rivalries have been played out through the medium of three-year-old thoroughbreds. It is a century since the most dramatic Derby of all, when the suffragette Emily Davison died in a collision with the King&apos;s horse, Anmer, and the favourite Craganour was disqualified from first place. Bower Ismay, Craganour&apos;s owner, was from the family that had built and launched the Titanic a little over a year beforehand, and though Ismay had little time for business, his name alone tainted him by association with Bruce, his brother and the chairman of the White Star Line, who found his way to a lifeboat while women and children drowned. Nor did it help in the stewards&apos; inquiry that Ismay was conducting a very public affair with the sister-in-law of the chairman of the panel. Hermit&apos;s Derby in 1867 made an estimated \u00a3100,000 for his owner, Henry Chaplin, and carried the 4th Marquess of Hastings to the brink of ruin, which added considerably to Chaplin&apos;s satisfaction as his financee had ditched him to marry Hastings just three years earlier. Michael Tanner, whose recent book The Suffragette Derby analyses the 1913 race in great detail, offers another example of a man who was driven to distraction by the Derby. &quot;William Waldorf, the 2nd Viscount Astor, won every Classic bar the Derby,&quot; Tanner says. &quot;He was a rich and powerful man, and everything else fell before him, but in the Derby he had the second horse five times in seven years, in 1918, 1919, 1921, 1922 and 1924, three of which were from the same broodmare. &quot;Funnily enough, while he was enduring such terrible luck in the Derby, he was scooping the Oaks [the Epsom Classic for fillies] almost at will. He had five winners of that between 1917 and 1929.&quot; Sheikh Mohammed too has won every Classic bar the Derby, and like others before him too, he is a man in the midst of a crisis, in urgent need of a result. Victory for Dawn Approach would hint that his fortunes are on the turn, while a warm reception from the crowd would imply that Godolphin&apos;s reputation, and by extension his own, have not been damaged beyond repair. The betting says that it is little more than a coin toss. Dawn Approach was brilliant in the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket last month but the Derby is over another half-mile and the favourite will now be racing against colts that have been bred for just this test. He will set off at around 11-8, not too far off a 50-50 chance in the race his owner wants and needs to win like no other. And when the stalls open at Epsom on Saturday afternoon, all Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s wealth, influence and billion-pound investment in bloodstock will count for nothing. He will be at the mercy of the world&apos;s most famous Flat race, and for two-and-a-half minutes he will be just like the rest of us.

Now I&apos;m embarking on a new challenge and I&apos;m a little bit afraid of the future, which is natural, but I&apos;m very positive and I&apos;ve got a good clear head.&quot; Dettori had been expected to just ride Beatrice Aurore and Fattsota but he picked up the ride on Sri Putra on Friday morning when Callan, Sri Putra&apos;s partner in his last 13 starts, was &quot;jocked off&quot; in favour of the Italian. Callan&apos;s Twitter timeline later retweeted a number of comments about the decision to replace him, including two which described it as &quot;strange&quot; and &quot;shameful&quot; while another read &quot;Wow, no loyalty, the bloke cheated and gets treated like a hero&quot;. Dettori was unable to renew his licence in time to ride in Saturday&apos;s Derby, but he will be at Chantilly on Sunday when his rides will include First Cornerstone in the Prix de Jockey Club [French Derby]. &quot;The deadline was too close to get a Derby ride,&quot; Dettori said, &quot;and it would have been unfair for owners and trainers to [get] a Derby ride that close [to the race] after not being able to ride for so long. The Derby is a very important race but it&apos;s not the end of the world. &quot;The next step will be Chantilly on Sunday, but in the near future it will be [Royal] Ascot [in mid-June]. I&apos;ve been riding out a lot for numerous trainers \u2013 I&apos;m really keen and so is my agent [Ray Cochrane].&quot; Ralph Beckett won the Oaks here on Friday for the second time in six years, but the result was disappointing for punters as Talent, a 20-1 chance ridden by Richard Hughes, came with a strong late run to beat her stablemate Secret Gesture, at 3-1, by nearly four lengths. Hughes, the current champion jockey, rode his first English Classic winner when Sky Lantern took the 1,000 Guineas at Newmarket in May and has now doubled his total at the next attempt, while the victory was the second in three Classics so far this season for Talent&apos;s sire, New Approach. His son, Dawn Approach, meanwhile, will start a hot favourite to win the Derby at Epsom on Saturday. &quot;I looked at her when they were at the top of the hill,&quot; Beckett said, &quot;and I thought, she can&apos;t win from there. I stopped watching her, and was just willing Jim [Crowley, on Secret Gesture] to get out from his position on the rail because he was going to have horses coming back on top of him. &quot;I feel genuinely sorry for Jim. He had the choice of rides, but how could he have picked the winner? He couldn&apos;t pick her on homework. Richard came and sat on her [last] Friday and I knew from his face when he pulled up that he was thinking, &apos;this isn&apos;t going to happen&apos;.&quot; Hughes said afterwards that he was confident of victory more than half a mile from home. &quot;I wasn&apos;t impressed when I rode her in work in the week,&quot; Hughes said, &quot;but I thought I would win five furlongs out, she was going that well.&quot;", "title": "Frankie Dettori is back but has day to forget at Epsom Oaks meeting", "sentences": ["The first three was a bit of a novelty to be able to eat and chill out with the family, but as soon as the World Cup got started in Dubai, it was really hard."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-31T17:28:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/may/31/nicole-lynn-mansfield-syria-killed-brainwashed", "tags": ["Syria", "Michigan", "US news", "Al-Qaida"], "article": "The daughter of an US citizen killed while fighting in Syria has dismissed claims that her mother was a terrorist, and said she was &quot;just a regular American&quot;. On a Facebook page set up in the memory of Nicole Lynn Mansfield \u2013 who was among three westerners who died in an apparent ambush earlier this week \u2013 her 18-year-old daughter Triana Lynn Mansfield said her mother was killed by the Syrian government for &quot;media publicity&quot;. Adding that she did not know why her mother was in the country, Mansfield criticised those who have alleged that her mother was a terrorist or working for the CIA. &quot;She was just a regular American woman who was misguided by the people who just wanted to use her because she&apos;s American,&quot; she said. Nicole Lynn Mansfield, the only American known to have been killed in the Syrian conflict, died in Idlib province in the north of the country. State media reported that she, along with two others \u2013 believed to be an a British man and a Canadian \u2013 were killed fighting for the opposition. Some reports further implied that all three were with the group al-Nusra, an affiliate of al-Qaida. Speaking from the family hometown of Flint, Michigan, relatives of Mansfield said they did not know who she had been with and were not even aware that she was in the region. &quot;I didn&apos;t think she was [a terrorist], but God only knows,&quot; her aunt, Monica Mansfield-Speelman, told the Detroit Free Press. &quot;I&apos;m just devastated,&quot; she told Reuters. But her grandmother Carole Mansfield told the newspaper that although Mansfield possessed &quot;a heart of gold&quot;, she was &quot;weak-minded&quot;. &quot;I think she could have been brainwashed,&quot; she claimed. The FBI informed the 33-year-old&apos;s parents of her death on Thursday, relatives said. Syrian TV footage of the aftermath of the fighting showed a black Volkswagen Golf \u2013 in which the trio had reportedly been travelling \u2013 riddled with bullets. A British man named as Ali Almanasfi is also thought to have been one of those killed. The identity and nationality of the third person has not been officially released. Reports suggested that Kalashnikovs were retrieved from the scene. Nicole Lynn Mansfield was identified from a driving license and her US passport, according to Syrian reports. Family members in Flint told reporters that Mansfield had been brought up a Baptist but converted to Islam after marrying a Muslim several years ago. After the marriage ended, Mansfield-Speelman said her niece remained a Muslim and had visited Dubai about three years ago. It remains unclear how or when she and her companions entered Syria, though it is thought likely that they went in from Turkey. It is not known which arm of the opposition in Syria Mansfield was fighting with. &quot;I didn&apos;t think she would stoop that low to go over there and try to harm anybody,&quot; her aunt said. On Facebook, a woman who says she is Manfield&apos;s daughter, Triana Lynn Mansfield, posted a series of pictures which appeared to be of the pair together and posted a message in her memory:  &quot;I love you forever and always mom, I will never forget everything you taught me. I wish I could honour in some other way but I have no control what happens to you now. I will try to not give up on life even though I really want to. I just want to see your face, hear your voice, and touch your skin again. But I&apos;ll stay strong. And you will never be forgotten.&quot;  The Guardian has not been able to independently authenticate Triana Lynn Mansfield&apos;s Facebook page. In a statement Friday, the State Department would only say that it was &quot;aware of the reports&quot; of the death of a US citizen. Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki added: &quot;We are not able to confirm the death at this time, in light of the security situation in Syria and given that we do not have consular officers on the ground.&quot; She went on to thank the work of the Czech mission in Syria for assisting the US in the matter.", "title": "Nicole Mansfield 'just a regular American', says daughter", "sentences": ["After the marriage ended, Mansfield-Speelman said her niece remained a Muslim and had visited Dubai about three years ago."], "publicationDate": "2013-05-31T21:04:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/02/frankie-dettori-french-derby-chantilly", "tags": ["Frankie Dettori", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Frankie Dettori was back in a Group One race here on Sunday for the first time since completing a six-month ban for using cocaine but if the run of First Cornerstone in the Prix du Jockey Club \u2013 the French Derby \u2013 is any guide, making a success of life as a &quot;hired gun&quot; jockey will be one of the most significant challenges of the 42-year-old&apos;s career. First Cornerstone carries the same colours as Animal Kingdom, the Dubai World Cup winner and a leading contender for the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot next month, but was a 29-1 chance on the pari-mutuel and looked like one from the off. Always towards the rear, Dettori&apos;s mount suffered some interference on the far bend but was not travelling like a horse with a chance at the time and beat only four of his 18 opponents to the winning line. Dettori was reluctant to talk to reporters on the way into Chantilly, and equally so afterwards, having given a press conference at Epsom on Friday not only to mark his return to race-riding but also to draw a line under his drugs ban and move on. But move on to what? Chantilly on French Derby day is one of the most captivating settings for a horse race anywhere in the world and a very pleasant place to earn a living. Dettori, though, should be past the point where the money really matters. Group One winners are all that will concern him as he enters the final years of his outstanding career, and while First Cornerstone merely ran as the market expected him to, there is no reason to think that Dettori&apos;s next Group One ride will start at the other end of the betting. In a way, it is a problem of Dettori&apos;s own making, or at least, one to which he has made a significant contribution. Racing power has become concentrated over the last 20 years into operations like Godolphin, which employed Dettori as its No1 rider for 18 years until deciding that his contract would not be renewed last autumn. Godolphin let Dettori go after he accepted the ride on Camelot, the 2012 Derby winner, in the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe, for John Magnier&apos;s Coolmore Stud syndicate, a rival superpower in racing. Having been the agent of his demise at Godolphin, Coolmore may well employ him again in Group One races but Joseph O&apos;Brien, the son of Coolmore&apos;s principal trainer Aidan, has first call on most of the horses, and Ryan Moore, who won the Derby for O&apos;Brien on Ruler Of The World on Saturday, is as likely to step in for the big rides when O&apos;Brien Jr, one of the tallest jockeys in the business, cannot make the weight. Sheikh Fahad al-Thani, who enjoyed his first Classic success when Just The Judge took the Irish 1,000 Guineas last Sunday, is the coming force in European racing but he too has a retained rider in Jamie Spencer. When Dettori started out in racing, there were still plenty of traditional owner-breeders with the potential to get lucky and produce a Classic prospect \u2013 the sort of horses that Lester Piggott would famously get himself aboard at Epsom every June. Now, though, the openings are not there. Where once he could pick between two or even three Godolphin runners in a major race, Dettori will be forced to take what he can get. Royal Ascot later this month promises to be a defining moment for Dettori&apos;s second career. If he cannot pick up a decent book of rides over the five days of the Flat&apos;s top meeting, when his return from suspension has forced him back into the news, it could be a long few months for the Italian on the way to the Arc and Champions Day in the autumn. France may prove little better than Britain in terms of opportunities, as the Prix du Jockey Club demonstrated. Here too there are well-established owners like the Aga Khan and the Wertheimer brothers, whose Intello justified favouritism in the big race, and they have well-established links with their preferred jockeys. Olivier Peslier, Intello&apos;s jockey, had the main part of his job done in the early stages as he got his partner out of the stalls quickly and settled in third place. Intello suffered a troubled passage in the French 2,000 Guineas last time but there was no danger of a repeat in a race that has often produced hard luck stories since its trip was cut to 10-and-a-half furlongs. Intello quickened away in the straight to beat Morandi by two lengths and is now a leading contender for the Arc at Longchamp in October. A big field is guaranteed for Europe&apos;s showpiece event and Dettori, no doubt, will pick up a ride somewhere. Whether he will stand any realistic chance of finishing closer to Intello than he did here is another question.", "title": "Frankie Dettori may be frozen out by march of Turf superpowers", "sentences": ["First Cornerstone carries the same colours as Animal Kingdom, the Dubai World Cup winner and a leading contender for the Queen Anne Stakes at Royal Ascot next month, but was a 29-1 chance on the pari-mutuel and looked like one from the off."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-02T17:23:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/australia-culture-blog/2013/jun/07/1", "tags": ["Film", "Culture"], "article": "     My first experience of a film festival was through a catalogue. I was about 16 at the time, and in my weekly forays into Durban&apos;s city centre I would pick up a copy of the New Musical Express, and the occasional football or cricket magazine. One day, I came upon the catalogue for the Durban International Film Festival. Though I was too young to attend, I bought it, and pored over it for weeks, noting all the films I wished I could see \u2013 all of them really.  Around the same time, a friend had somehow managed to get his hands on a UK-distributed VHS tape of Takeshi Kitano&apos;s Sonatine. I adored everything about the film: the extreme violence, the childish games on the beach, the black suits, the dreaminess of it. Sonatine, along with a range of other unusual films at the time, created a hunger to see more and more. A couple of years later, when I was old enough to attend, I devoured the Durban festival programme. Kitano and the festival led me in many different directions.  When I moved from festival viewer to festival programmer, I naturally began to see many more films; and though it is perhaps true that critics and programmers see too many films, I still go into screenings with a sense of great anticipation and excitement; hoping to see something magnificent and original. Often I do.  It is always a tremendous privilege to present the world premiere of a film at a festival. There&apos;s a nervous tension and excitement shared between audience and filmmakers, and generally a will for it to turn out perfectly. In Durban, there were world premieres of films by talented South African directors such as Darrell Roodt, Khalo Matabane, and Oliver Hermanus. Last year in Sydney, there were great screenings of the world premieres of films by Cate Shortland and Tony Krawitz.  Over the years, I have experienced so many beautiful spontaneous moments. At the screening of the protest music documentary Amandla! A Revolution In Four Part Harmony, the audience in Durban broke into song, accompanying the film in emotional unison. At SFF last year, when Bonita Mabo took the stage following the world premiere of Mabo, the 2000 members of the audience stood and clapped and cried \u2013 as much for the film as for Eddie and Bonita Mabo&apos;s determination and heroism. It is no coincidence that it was a combination of art and politics in both cases that inspired such extraordinary reactions. In the context of a festival, cinema becomes &quot;live&quot;, and allows for a particular type of communal watching that cannot be replicated in the multiplex.  And if there are explosions of emotion and passion, there are also smaller moments that are as important. The first time you introduce a filmmaker to an audience\u00a0\u2013 as in the case of Pen-ek Ratanaruang in South Africa, or Mahamat-Saleh Haroun in Dubai \u2013 it might not be to the full cinemas you had hoped for. But years later, that experience might still be with members of the audience, and with time particular directors develop loyal followings at particular festivals. It&apos;s a great pleasure to watch it happen.  But films in festivals are not just about the art and the artists. While the thousands of films I&apos;ve seen at festivals have taught me a lot about cinema, they have also done a great deal to shape my view on and understanding of the world, my political opinions, my attitude to different cultures. If on the screen one can empathise with people of a different cultural background or race or nationality or class, it makes prejudice in real life foolish.  Each time I make a festival programme, I hope that someone out there will discover their Sonatine, a film so different from those they have seen before, and one that sets them on their unique path of discovery of cinema, of different cultures, and of the world.

There are no names, for privacy reasons. \u2013 The author The alarm bells ring, and I jump out of bed. (I suppose this isn&apos;t normal, or whatever, for most people my age hit the snooze button like a million times before actually getting up; or they just throw the alarm clock, so that it shuts up.) I don&apos;t like it - me jolting out of bed, that is - but I&apos;m just programmed like that, through years of getting up an at ungodly four o&apos;clock in the morning to reach my tennis court, all not to get like 10 extra rounds around the campus. This was back when, of course, I still thought doing the above was actually cool (!) GOD! I don&apos;t like it, but I do it anyway. I saunter out of bed, mentally cursing my younger self (what was I THINKING?) and slowly finish my &apos;hygienic&apos; activities. For a minute I have an internal debate about convincing my parents to get me an intercom so that when I want something, I can just shout it through (and then, why don&apos;t I also convince them to get me my very own 50 inch TV and a home theatre system, too?) and unhappily, tread down the stairs. Everything is in full swing downstairs: cleaning for the major festival going on (its an ENTIRE week away, what is everybody&apos;s problem?) and my mother is telling me to come help her and the help with some sort of work. I mumble something about me having to study for my exam and place myself on the nearest chair, that is not being scrubbed or dusted, desperately wanting the clock to hit 8, so we could leave for school (It&apos;s not that I like it better, just certain aspects about that building) Well, what is the point of writing this, you may ask? Okay, um, I know why\u2026 But I guess you will have to read and find out! 6:45 pm, Blue Room \u202615th September 2012Friday Hi!  So, well, today we had the WORST exam in the history of exams and I&apos;m pretty sure that three fourths of teenagers around the world agree with me. Math! Over here, in India, (the supposed &apos;jewel of South-East Asia&apos;, but, according to me, a DUMP) it&apos;s not like calculus separate, and trigonometry and algebra, but all put together as one MEASLY paper. How do you even study for something like that? Oh well, at least we had five days off to prepare, but in my opinion, even a week wouldn&apos;t be enough for TWO entire textbooks of letters and numbers just coming out to hit you in the face! I suppose the only good thing about going to school and trying my best to not flunk an exam, is to see my friends. (And him). We sit alphabetically in our exam hall, which puts him right behind me, which is both AWESOME and HORRIBLE at the same time. Awesome because, well HE SITS BEHIND me, and then we talk like A LOT before and after the exam and horrible because, well, HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO CONCENTRATE? I give it some thought, but in the end, I decide that it&apos;s way better to have him (my best friend and crush, as well, but he just doesn&apos;t know it) sit behind than to have him not sit behind me!  So, I&apos;m back on the table and my mother has put something that I REALLY don&apos;t like to eat, and tells me I have to or she is not going to take me. I smile at her, because if it wasn&apos;t for him (and that fact that I NEED to pass this grade) I would LOVE to not go to the building that they call an educational institution, which only makes her give me her do-what-I-asked-you-to-or-else glare, so I have no choice but to eat (well, swallow miserably) my food. My dad enters (I only pass math cause he teaches me, so) and gives me an inspirational speech about how I was capable to do anything I want if I just put my mind to it (really? Well, how come I DON&apos;T HAVE A BOYFRIEND YET, THEN??). Which was sweet, and all, but I could not FOCUS I suppose you can guess why!  So, it&apos;s going to be time and I flip open my textbook and read the formulas again, as if by doing so, they will be magically etched into my memory for the rest of time and it only makes me more nervous. I do my hair (Oh Hair God, what did I ever do to you?), it&apos;s too, well, it&apos;s just not right, so I pull it into a pigtail, throw on my uniform (YES, we have a uniform) put on my &apos;regulation&apos; shoes, my charm bracelet (for luck) and then holler for my mother to start the car - we need to leave!! The car pulls up in school fifteen minutes later and almost everybody is there. My mom wishes me luck, and I open the door\u2026 &quot;OW! What was THAT for _____ (insert my name here)?? I come up here to talk and you hit me&quot; Me (mortally embarrassed): SO SORRY ___ (insert HIM here) HIM: Now, look, I&apos;m going to flunk, same as you, so there is no need to injure me as well Me: YOU\u2026 FLUNK? Yeah, and I&apos;m currently making the honor roll! HIM: You could, you know? Anyway, wanna go in, or punch me one more time? ME: Funny. And we walk in together. (Insert me almost floating here) He is going on about how after today, how amazing his break in Dubai is going to be and I put a smile on my face, listening to him, but not at the same time (I&apos;m just staring at his face) and desperately holding onto the strap of my bag, for it is the only thing keeping me from jumping around like a crazy person. We walk into the quadrangle (look, I know a complicated word) and my best friends&apos; eyebrows fly up, on the verge of disappearing and I just grin like a mad person, hoping like crazy he doesn&apos;t notice. We just stand there for a while, talking and laughing (EEEE!) waiting for the teachers to give us the sign to go to the hall. I see his friends coming and so I walk off, saying I have to go meet mine. (I REALLY DON&apos;T WANT TO!) Twenty minutes later, the bell rings and we start making our way up. He walks up to me and my friends (being sensible, for ONCE!) walk away, leaving just the both of us\u2026 He asks me if I&apos;m ready (for the exam) and I laugh nervously. He grins (he looks so HOT when he does that) and we make our way up the stairs. We reach the hall, and my elatedness is (partially) replaced by nervousness. We are putting our bags down together when\u2026 HIM: You, me, coffee after this is done! I have to tell you something! AND I AM SPEECHLESS!! Chick flick movies at home? OUT YOU GO!! Me (very smartly): Umm\u2026 okay?  HIM: You know, you can sound a little more interested. (With a grin on his face) And, besides, we won&apos;t meet each other after this!  Me (still shocked): Yeah\u2026 Okay\u2026 Lets! (And on the inside: OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG!) HIM: Good luck! (And he walks inside) Me: (still SHOCKED!) The next two hours are a TOTAL DRAG as I try to remember stuff like polynomials, powers, union of sets, means and extremes, cosines, planes, variables, exponents and all the other SUPER complicated mathematical, well, stuff and somehow, manage to finish the (dreadful) paper all while my mind keeps drifting off to what I chalked up, in my head, to be a date!!  After what seemed like forever, the final bell rang, we thrust our papers at the teacher in the room and ran outside, glad to FINALLY be done! He comes out slower that everybody else and (he was always more mature than the rest of us) picks up his bag, smiles at me and asks me for a minute for him to say bye to his (other) friends. I nod and he goes on (what is a few more minutes, really, for our first &apos;date&apos;) and I walk over to mine, telling them I will call them later with ALL the details.  He comes back and we make our way to the caf\u00e9 on the next street. I&apos;m SO happy, nothing can burst my bubble!! We enter and order and he pays for me (I tease him about being way too chivalrous and he just laughs it off\u2026 maybe this IS a REAL date!)  We sit down and have a stupid chat about how the paper went and then the food comes. I&apos;m not really hungry and so, I offer him my sandwich as well, which he promptly eats (He is SUCH a guy!) all while I try to think about some sort of (smart, funny and flirty) topic to talk about.  And I come up with: So, you wanted to tell me something? HIM: Yeahh, just a minute, let me finish\u2026 And the anticipation builds in my stomach\u2026 This is it\u2026  &quot;__ (my name) I&apos;m not coming back to school, I&apos;m going to America, I have Stage Four cancer.&quot; Are you a budding writer or poet?

At a hearing in the city&apos;s anti-terrorism court, Shahrukh Jatoi and Siraj Talpur were told they would be executed for their role in the killing of Shahzeb Khan last year. Two other men, including Talpur&apos;s brother Sajjad, were given life sentences. The 20-year-old Khan was shot dead in December last year after being chased through the streets of one of Karachi&apos;s richest neighbourhoods. It followed a late-night altercation with the servant of Khan&apos;s neighbour who had verbally abused Khan&apos;s sister after she returned home. &quot;The death penalty is absolutely the right thing,&quot; said Umer Mukhtar, a friend of Khan&apos;s who set up a Facebook campaign demanding justice. &quot;All of them should be hanged in public, in the same place where they brutally killed my friend.&quot; In a city where violence and gangland murders are a fact of daily life, the killing of the clean-cut university student fuelled the anger of Karachi&apos;s increasingly assertive middle classes fed up with landowners and the super-rich who are regarded as a spoilt, unaccountable elite. The Jatoi family are major industrialists, owning construction companies and a television station. The Talpurs are landowners in Karachi&apos;s rural hinterland, part of a class of &quot;feudals&quot; that many Pakistanis believe still wield too much power. Jatoi is said to have confronted Khan at the block of flats in the Defence Housing Association after Khan had complained about the treatment of his sister by a man working for the Talpurs. The two men shared a flat where they entertained on the 11th floor of the building, directly next to where the Khan family lived. Although Khan&apos;s father, Aurangzeb, a senior police officer, succeeded in defusing the row, the argument flared up again in the car park when Shahzeb Khan went to park his car. Jatoi is said to have fired shots in the air, before pursuing Khan through the streets. He died in the car, which crashed and overturned. At the time the politician Imran Khan said the case was a &quot;classic example of how our ruling elite violates laws&quot;, including murder. Popular anger increased when it emerged that Jatoi had left the country on a fake passport despite being put on an exit control list. Footage from Karachi airport showed him being escorted through security controls by unidentified men. He surrendered in Dubai after his father was arrested outside Pakistan&apos;s supreme court, where he was appearing in connection with a major corruption scandal involving energy companies. Mukhtar said allies of the accused had tried hard to derail the case, which involved key witnesses retracting their statements and death threats being made to campaigners who had publicised the issue. He said the case had only come to trial because of a social media campaign and protests by middle-class young people. It forced Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, the activist chief justice, to take an interest in the case. &quot;In Pakistan there was never really hope for justice before this case,&quot; he said.", "title": "Pakistani men sentenced to death for policeman son's murder", "sentences": ["He surrendered in Dubai after his father was arrested outside Pakistan&apos;s supreme court, where he was appearing in connection with a major corruption scandal involving energy companies."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-07T12:57:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/jun/07/tamara-ecclestone-working-it", "tags": ["Tamara Ecclestone", "Beauty", "Life and style", "Fashion", "Bernie Ecclestone"], "article": " Tamara Ecclestone walks into the studio wearing pink pyjama bottoms tucked into Ugg boots.

If Herm\u00e8s were to deign to sell you or me such a bag \u2013 and that&apos;s a big if: you have to know the right people just to get on the waiting list \u2013 the price tag would be about \u00a340,000. The bag sits abandoned for the rest of the day, an elephant-grey Birkin representing the elephant in the room, which is the Ecclestone billions. Her outfit is a benchmark of how powerful a\u00a0certain aesthetic \u2013 Uggs, diamonds, big fluffy hair \u2013 has become. This is a young woman who could choose to dress any way she pleases. She could wear Chanel couture, or comfortable Levi&apos;s and Converse trainers, but she chooses this very particular look: Jackie Collins updated for the sex-tape age, the point over the Atlantic where Wag meets Kardashian. Why would a woman such as Tamara, who needs a rich husband like a fish needs a bicycle, adopt the look of a wannabe trophy wife? Today, she is in the makeup chair to try out a\u00a0different look. She has just launched her first solo venture, a range of hair styling products called Show Beauty. The concept of our shoot to mark this occasion is to present a different side of Tamara. She has agreed to be photographed in &quot;natural&quot; makeup, without backcombed big hair, and to wear\u00a0tailoring and pared-down, androgynous clothes rather than spray-on Herv\u00e9 L\u00e9ger. The idea is\u00a0to\u00a0show that she can do refined as\u00a0well as frivolous, can look less billionaire&apos;s daughter and more grown-up businesswoman. Ecclestone isn&apos;t exactly working to pay the rent. She could stay at home and watch TV, or go shopping, every day for the rest of her life. But that, she says, &quot;is not even vaguely tempting. It might not be about making money, but it is about making my own way in life. Anyway, I&apos;m a geek at heart. I love a list and a\u00a0plan.&quot; She once laminated lists of restaurant reservations and made multiple copies for her friends when they went on holiday. For the past seven years, she has organised regular fundraisers for Great Ormond Street hospital. Two years ago, she &quot;saw a\u00a0gap in the market for a luxury haircare range, something that smells like a fragrance and looks incredible in the bathroom&quot;. Her PR brought goodie bags to the shoot, and I can report that the products make your hair look very pretty and smell delicious, like a Bounty bar. However, my favourites, the Dry Shampoo and Volume Mist, are \u00a330 and \u00a335 respectively. Ecclestone says she has &quot;reached a point where I don&apos;t care any more what people think of me&quot;, but the statement doesn&apos;t ring true. She sounds as if she is testing the phrase out, to see if she can convince herself. Anyway, she says, most of what is printed about her is rubbish. For instance? &quot;Well, I don&apos;t have a dog spa in my house! I\u00a0wash my dogs in the kitchen sink and blow-dry them myself.&quot; (I love that blow-drying your own chihuahuas counts as keeping it real.) She is 28, but seems much younger \u2013 about half that. For most of us, financial landmarks such as getting a job and buying a house are inextricably linked with growing up, so it is surreal to meet someone whose real estate and scale of business operation are so out of sync with her maturity.     Tamara wears jacket, \u00a3664, by Halston Heritage, from net-a-porter.com    The makeup artist is finished. Ecclestone is underwhelmed. &quot;It&apos;s very naked,&quot; she says. &quot;No, it&apos;s not,&quot; her PR says, soothingly. &quot;It&apos;s\u00a0very, very pretty.&quot; &quot;It&apos;s not very pretty, it&apos;s very natural,&quot; Ecclestone says, before damning with faint praise:&quot;I suppose it will be fine for the Chelsea match tonight.&quot; (She has season tickets at Stamford Bridge and wears her shirt, hat and scarf &quot;like a proper mascot&quot;.) We break for lunch, and everyone finds a chair and fills a plate. Everyone apart from Ecclestone, who sends out her security guard to fetch her a Nando&apos;s takeaway. It is an odd moment: I can&apos;t help thinking it rather gauche to send out for your own food without asking if anyone else would like the same. And there is something bizarre about the rest of us sitting with our rice-stuffed peppers, salads and homemade bread while the heiress eats fried chicken out of a brown bag at the makeup table. It&apos;s like a warped episode of Upstairs, Downstairs. It is post-Nando&apos;s that things start to get sticky. Natural makeup is one thing, but natural hair \u2013 that is, hair that isn&apos;t backcombed to high heaven and set into cartoonish, Disney princess waves \u2013 is another. No sooner have we appeared to reach a straightish compromise than\u00a0Ecclestone, thinking the hairstylist&apos;s back is turned, picks up the curling tongs and starts re-curling her hair. Tamara, the stylist says gently, I think we agreed we&apos;d try a\u00a0shot with straighter hair? &quot;I can&apos;t understand why people don&apos;t want other people to look pretty,&quot; she says, keeping a white-knuckle grip on the tongs. &quot;It&apos;s not that they don&apos;t want you to look pretty, it&apos;s just a different version of pretty,&quot; her PR offers. &quot;My version of pretty is everyone&apos;s version of pretty. Hot and groomed. That&apos;s what pretty means, and everyone knows that apart from the people in this room.&quot; With that, she flounces off to the loo. And that is why Ecclestone&apos;s hair is quite curly in these photos. In her defence, her brand of Elnetted glamour is armour for many women in the public eye. This may sound ludicrous, but then so is the existence of paparazzi who ruthlessly hunt out &quot;bad hair day&quot; shots, which they can sell at a\u00a0premium. Tong-gate might sound like a brat-out, but it wasn&apos;t; it was pure insecurity. And the irony is that Tamara Ecclestone is actually very beautiful. She has extraordinary bone structure, wide and proud as a Renaissance prince, enormous deep-set eyes, brows like charcoal thumb smudges. But her natural beauty is not the ultra-feminine kind which, it seems, is the only one she can recognise. Hair and makeup is so central to her sense of self-worth that, without it, she can&apos;t face the camera even fully clothed, but with it she is happy to strip off. She recently did a nude shoot for Playboy: &quot;The first day, I was nervous, but by day three I\u00a0was like, whatever, you&apos;ve seen it all now, just whipping my clothes off. I am happy with my body and I want to celebrate that. My mum has seen it, and loves it, and so does my sister. I don&apos;t know if my dad has seen it or not, but I guess he knows about it, and he hasn&apos;t mentioned it.&quot; On her shoulder, she has a tattoo of a quote by Marilyn Monroe: &quot;Sometimes good things fall apart so better ones can fall together.&quot; She had it done a few months ago, just after a particularly icky break-up. (A sex tape featuring her long-term boyfriend Omar Khyami with another woman was sent to her father&apos;s offices. Khyami initially said that the video pre-dated their relationship, until she pointed out that in it he was wearing two Cartier love bracelets that she had given him.) Soon afterwards, she met Jay Rutland, a\u00a0stockbroker. He proposed within a month, on holiday in Dubai, and they will be married this summer. Her maid of honour will be her sister Petra, 24, to whom she is very close, although Petra lives in Los Angeles, with her husband and baby daughter. Petra&apos;s house was previously owned by Aaron Spelling, is bigger than the White House and has a gift-wrapping room. The sisters are on the phone constantly, talking about the forthcoming wedding. The ring is snow-blindingly enormous. All Ecclestone really wants for the future, she says, is &quot;to make a success of my life, and to have a lovely family, like the one I grew up in. But\u00a0I guess that&apos;s asking for quite a lot.&quot;", "title": "Tamara Ecclestone: working it", "sentences": ["He proposed within a month, on holiday in Dubai, and they will be married this summer."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-07T15:30:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/jun/08/talking-horses-horse-racing-tips-pastoral-player", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Pastoral Player (3.15) is one of those slightly frustrating horses whose success rate never seems to match their talent and he rubs along on a single win each year but today looks like the day.

Seven furlongs on decent ground seems his ideal set of conditions and the drier surface should enable him to turn the tables on Eton Forever, who beat him here four weeks ago. The German raider, Amarillo, is rather an unknown quantity but would surely have preferred some juice underfoot. Some punters may be put off Pastoral Player by the fact that George Baker, who rode him in his last two races, opposes today on Premio Loco, but Baker has a five-year association with that horse and his trainer, Chris Wall. The jockey&apos;s agent, Guy Jewell, told me yesterday that this was a decision which could only be made one way and had nothing to do with assessment of relative merit. Graham Lee is an excellent substitute and should put Pastoral Player in position to make the most of his finishing burst. 2.05 Haydock  David Simcock is a trainer worth following just now, with seven winners at a 23% strike-rate in the past fortnight.

Faster going may help him back to the winner&apos;s enclosure. 3.30 Newmarket  Suroor could be in for a good day, as Handsome Man still looks handicapped to win on the basis of his return effort, when he and Harry Bentley did not seem to get along all that well.

At 20 years old his achievements offer abundant proof of that. Even before the young Italian claimed the PGA Championship last month, Manassero had become the first teenager to win three times on the European Tour. He was the youngest winner of a Tour event \u2013 at 17 years and 188 days \u2013 and youngest, not to mention the first Italian, winner of the Amateur Championship in 2009. For good measure, he became the youngest winner of the Open&apos;s silver medal a few months later and the youngest player to make the cut at the Masters the following April. Manassero&apos;s recent Wentworth triumph \u2013 the youngest victor of the European Tour&apos;s flagship event \u2013 continued a remarkable run of four wins in four years as a professional. Manassero does not turn 21 until April but is rated 26th in the world rankings and is the early leader of the European Tour&apos;s Race to Dubai standings. So what next? Manassero will arrive at Merion for the second major of the year, the US Open, believing he can achieve further greatness. &quot;I will think that way,&quot; he says. &quot;I have earned the right to play there so, when I tee up, I will think that way and think about playing my best. &quot;I will try to stay around the top of the leaderboard. That is the idea but it is a major championship; all the top players are there, it will be tough. It is not easy to be at your best in just four tournaments. It is very difficult, but that is why they are majors. &quot;I have never been to Merion before but I know there is an opening stretch of five or six holes that you just have to get through before some chances arrive. There will be extreme conditions \u2013 the US Open course always plays very\u00a0difficult.&quot; Manassero already has a broader focus. Along with the emerging Dane Thorbjorn Olesen he is likely to launch a youthful push to be a part of Europe&apos;s\u00a0Ryder Cup team for the defence of the trophy at Gleneagles in 2014. That is a challenge, like so many, that Manassero embraces. &quot;It would be amazing to be there next year,&quot; he admits. &quot;It won&apos;t be easy but it is possible and I will try my best. This is the biggest event on my mind right now, more than majors, because the Ryder Cup is up to me.&quot; In Manassero&apos;s homeland football is, and will always be, king. Manassero regards it as an &quot;honour&quot; that he, along with the Molinari brothers, have emerged as flag bearers in another sport. Not that Manassero has any problem with Italy&apos;s national passion, since he references that when contemplating a dream four-ball. &quot;I would say Marco van Basten, I&apos;m a huge AC Milan fan and he was my favourite player. I&apos;ve met him and he&apos;s a really nice guy,&quot; Manassero says. &quot;I&apos;d also like to meet and play with Michael Jordan, who is a good golfer. I don&apos;t play much basketball, but I do like to watch it. It has to be another sportsman to make up the team and I&apos;ll take Novak Djokovic. &quot;That would be an easier question if it was just golfers; I would choose Seve Ballesteros, Ben Hogan and Tiger Woods. I know Andriy Shevchenko as well now. I had never met him when he lived in Italy but during the week of Wentworth he came to watch. He is a great guy. For me, it has been nice to grow up and be part of a sport that is not as big. That causes less problems.&quot; In physical terms, there has been definite growth. Manassero spends much of his off-season playing and practising in the ideal climate of Abu Dhabi and last winter he focused on improving his athleticism. The Italian has always retained a formidable short game but lagged behind in driving distance. At Wentworth he was not at all fazed by the playing of the par-5 18th as the playoff hole; an impressive change of tactic at the fourth time of asking (driver off the tee rather than three wood) allowed him to outsmart Simon Khan and take home the \u00a3666,500 first prize. Had he not turned to professional golf, Manassero could have been juggling figures of another kind. &quot;I was OK in school, but I always missed a lot because I was playing so much,&quot; he says. &quot;But if I&apos;d stuck at it I imagine that I&apos;d be doing something financial or economical. Finance always attracted me, even though maths was always a bit of a love-hate relationship. I would have tried playing football, but I don&apos;t think I&apos;d have made it.&quot; Ballesteros has been hailed as Manassero&apos;s golfing hero, but he isn&apos;t alone. &quot;One guy that really inspired me was Michael Jordan,&quot; Manassero says. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t say that he inspired me as a sportsman, but I love going back and watching videos of him, especially how he conducts himself in interviews. He always seemed to be very careful about the words that he used and thought about everything differently to anybody else. &quot;I would say Tiger also. He is so strong mentally that he must be in the top three in that category, of all sportsmen, in the history of sport. &quot;The earliest golfing memories that I have are of the Italian Open when I was about six years of age. Watching that event is how I really got started in the game. Seve played, as did Bernhard Langer, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal and Costantino Rocca. But I watched everybody \u2013 they all looked amazing to me. I wanted to be just like them.&quot; Mission accomplished on that front. All that is missing is the major and Ryder Cup glory which, inevitably, will arrive for the brightest young talent in\u00a0Europe.", "title": "Matteo Manassero confident he can live up to his reputation at US Open | Ewan Murray", "sentences": ["Manassero does not turn 21 until April but is rated 26th in the world rankings and is the early leader of the European Tour&apos;s Race to Dubai standings."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-08T22:06:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/jun/09/godolphin-doping-british-horseracing-authority", "tags": ["British Horseracing Authority", "Godolphin", "Drugs in sport", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "The Sungate doping story moved on last week when Gerard Butler was charged over the positive tests for the anabolic steroid stanozolol returned by nine horses at his yard. And the entirely separate case of the Godolphin dopings at Moulton Paddocks moved on too, though this was a little overlooked amid interest in Frankie Dettori, their former jockey, pursuing his first winner following a six-month drugs ban, and the size of John McCririck&apos;s pay packet. The news from Moulton Paddocks was that there may soon be a new trainer in charge at the stable where, a little under two months ago, Mahmood al-Zarooni was found to have been conducting the most extensive steroid-doping programme that British racing has seen. And the man being lined up to take over, until long-term plans are finalised at least, is Charlie Appleby, Zarooni&apos;s former assistant. My first thought on hearing this news was that I must have missed something. Had the British Horseracing Authority completed its investigation into the doping of \u2013 at least \u2013 22 horses at one of the biggest yards in the business, and then published its findings? And had its completed investigation shown beyond doubt that Zarooni conceived and executed the doping programme almost entirely by himself, despite spending a good part of the winter in Dubai? The answer to the first question, of course, is no, which renders the second irrelevant. Yet both Godolphin and the BHA now seem to be proceeding \u2013 or hope to proceed \u2013 as if the regulator&apos;s response to the scandalous behaviour at Moulton Paddocks is more historical than current. This seems unfair on Appleby as much as anything else. He is, no doubt, like the great majority of Godolphin employees, talented, dedicated and reliable. They can, after all, afford to employ the best around. But Appleby may well have spent more time at Moulton Paddocks than Zarooni did between January and mid-April, a period when horses were being doped with substances which, in the case of ethylestrenol (also known as Nitrotain) in particular, need to be administered almost on a daily basis to be effective. One thing that we do know about Zarooni&apos;s doping programme is that it was not just extensive but also considered. Colts almost always received stanozolol, which can remain in a horse&apos;s system for three weeks or more, while the fillies got Nitrotain, which is normally gone within a week. On Friday, Saeed bin Suroor, who is currently attempting to oversee both Moulton Paddocks and Godolphin Stables, his original yard a mile away in the middle of Newmarket, had a 1-2 in a maiden on the July course. Wedding Ring, the 8-1 winner, is stabled at Moulton Paddocks, while Ihtimal, the 6-4 runner-up, is at Godolphin. Shortly after that race, I tweeted: &quot;Filly. Cd have been doped with Nitrotain until wk b4 BHA testers arrived. We don&apos;t know she wasn&apos;t &amp; neither, I suspect,does BHA&quot;, and then &quot;Perf[romance]-enhancing effects of doping with anabolics can last for 6 months, according to BHA.&quot; A few minutes later, the BHA was in touch to point out, politely, that, without a positive test, the same could be true of pretty much any horse in any race. My response was that, unlike most horses, Wedding Ring is known to have been stabled in a yard at the centre of a significant and shocking doping scandal, which remains the focus of an ongoing investigation by the Authority&apos;s integrity department. If the BHA hoped that charging and then banning Zarooni in the space of three days in April would make the smell go away, it was wrong. Zarooni is now out of the picture, but there is still no credible account of how this extraordinary and unprecedented situation came about. The next trainer at Moulton Paddocks needs to be able to make a fresh start. Until the BHA has demonstrated to general satisfaction that the doping scandal is all in the past and that all those involved in any way have been accounted for, no one can do so, least of all Zarooni&apos;s former assistant.", "title": "Scandal of Godolphin trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni's doping still festers | Greg Wood", "sentences": ["And had its completed investigation shown beyond doubt that Zarooni conceived and executed the doping programme almost entirely by himself, despite spending a good part of the winter in Dubai?"], "publicationDate": "2013-06-09T18:13:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/10/immigration-rules-separating-thousands-families", "tags": ["Immigration and asylum", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "Work & careers", "Money", "UK news", "World news", "Children", "Society"], "article": "A cross-party group of MPs has called for an urgent review of new immigration rules, which they claim are tearing hundreds of British families apart. Their inquiry report shows that a new minimum earnings rule of \u00a318,600 a year, which came into effect last July, has meant that thousands of British citizens, including people with full-time jobs, have been unable to bring a non-European husband, wife or partner to live with them in Britain. A dossier drawn from submissions by 175 individual families affected by the rule includes the case of an Australian who works as a \u00a3250,000-a-year chief financial officer of a multinational company in Dubai and has a \u00a33.5m property in Britain. He is not eligible to live with his British wife and children in the UK under the new rule, because she is not employed and his overseas earnings do not count. The dossier also includes examples of elderly couples who are being denied the chance to retire in Britain or face separation because their earnings fall short of the \u00a318,600 threshold. The threshold rises to \u00a322,400 if the couple have a child, and rises by \u00a32,400 for every extra child. The inquiry report by the all-party parliamentary group on migration, published on Monday, says the requirement that only the earnings of the UK sponsor can usually be counted has meant that high-earning individuals and families with significant resources have been prevented from living in Britain. The MPs say the income threshold has also led to many young children being separated from one of their parents, including a breastfeeding mother who was separated from her baby. The former Liberal Democrat children&apos;s minister, Sarah Teather, said the new rules on family migration showed that the government was far from meeting its pledge to support family life in Britain: &quot;During the course of the inquiry we heard from many families in which British children are being made to grow up away from a parent, or where families had been forced to move overseas in order to be together. Whatever the objective of the policy, children shouldn&apos;t suffer as a result. Now is the time to take another look at the policy.&quot; Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman, Baroness Sally Hamwee, who chaired the inquiry, said it had also shown that a previous route under which elderly relatives, including grandparents, were cared for in Britain by their families had now all but closed. The report shows that one elderly dependent relative visa was granted between July and October last year. The restrictions on family migration were introduced by Home Office ministers as part of the drive to reduce net migration to Britain down to the &quot;tens of thousands&quot;. A Home Office spokesperson said the family rules had been designed to make sure that those coming to the UK to join their spouse or partner would not become a burden on the taxpayer and would be well enough supported to integrate effectively. &quot;High-value migrants would not be refused because their British spouse or partner was not employed. They can meet the income threshold by having cash savings of \u00a362,500 or through their own private income, for example from investments. We have also introduced greater flexibility for those holding investments to liquidate them into cash in order to meet the rules,&quot; they said. A Home Office impact assessment estimated that up to 17,800 fewer family visas from outside the European economic area would be issued each year as a result of the income threshold rule. Examples given to the inquiry of families being split apart by the new rules include: \u2022 Rachel: &quot;I am a British citizen and my partner is Albanian. I&apos;m not able to sponsor him, as I am still studying and not earning over \u00a318,600. Our baby is now two months old, but his father has only seen him via Skype.&quot; \u2022 Hannah: &quot;Currently, I&apos;m \u00a317 a month short of the financial requirement \u2026 I served in the British army for nine and a half years, have a first-class honours degree and my husband is also degree-educated and currently earning more than I do in the US.&quot; \u2022 Sarah: &quot;As a clinically skilled NHS nurse, I&apos;m earning only \u00a314,153 a year in my full-time post. I have been with my partner for three years and unless I leave my nursing job \u2013 leaving behind my pension and my career path \u2013 and look for something else that pays better, I currently have no chance of having our application approved.&quot; \u2022 Anon: &quot;I have been here in Australia for 45 years and I wanted to spend these later years in my home country, which is Scotland. We got a shock when my Australian husband of 43 years applied for a visa.

In a set-piece speech on Britain&apos;s role in the world before next week&apos;s G8 summit, Cameron on Monday tried to offer a vision in which the country rejects an unthinking embrace of globalisation, exemplified by New Labour, or the timid alternative of go-it-alone Little Englandism. He also tried to present his domestic reforms to welfare and education in the context of the global race for jobs and competitiveness, adding that Britain, so long as it did not lapse into denial, could still make the choices that would determine its own fate. He claimed: &quot;This is the generation that hasn&apos;t passed the buck. Where there has been a fork in the road between doing what is easy and doing what is right, we have chosen what is right.&quot; Cameron chose the dramatic setting of the London Gateway, near Tilbury, the largest private sector infrastructure investment in the UK, being overseen by the Dubai-based DP World. The speech itself was months in preparation and is seen as the most important statement of his vision for Britain outside the party conference season. He said the need for domestic reform was being driven by the pace of global competition. &quot;Those who defend the case for an ever bigger state and ever bigger spending, or those who say we don&apos;t need to radically reform welfare or education, they&apos;re fundamentally saying we can ignore these leaner, fitter countries who are breathing down our neck. &quot;And then there are those who say we should turn our backs on the world and on our wider obligations, that we should cut ourselves off from influential organisations in the belief that we can go it alone.&quot; He said both arguments were appealing but amounted to denial \u2013 &quot;denial of a world where our young people are competing for jobs with graduates from California to Tokyo, where a revolution thousands of miles away can affect the guy filling up his van at a service station. Denial that we are a premier trading nation whose prosperity depends upon the maintenance of global peace and security \u2013 in which we play such an important role.&quot; But he also rejected those who &quot;embrace globalisation so enthusiastically that they lose sight of the national interest \u2013 &apos;Open your borders. National sovereignty is obsolete. Multilateral relationships are the only ones that matter, bilateral ones are so 20th century&apos;.&quot; Cameron said both approaches represented a form of national timidity \u2013 too wary of engaging with the modern world or too afraid to stand up for national interests. He said his plan for national renewal had already identified &quot;our key areas of potential national weakness compared to the rest of the world. One, our debt-fuelled, unbalanced economy. Two, our bloated welfare system. Three, our underperforming education system.&quot; He said Britain had been &quot;a 20th-century economy wheezing and limping into the 21st century&quot;. The UK was already in the top 10 countries in the world to do business, he said, and he predicted that the reforms he had introduced, from corporation tax to infrastructure, would make Britain rise in the next three years to being &quot;in the top five places in the world to do business and as the number one country to do business in Europe&quot;. He also tried to make his plea for reform in the EU in the context of the global race for competitiveness. He pointed out: &quot;Europe today accounts for just over 7% of the world&apos;s population, produces around 25% of global GDP and has to finance 50% of global social spending. To the vast majority of the emerging economies, the idea of a welfare system that incentivised people not to take a job would be regarded as national stupidity.&quot; He also attacked the British education system, saying it had been &quot;increasingly comfortable with failure while grade inflation robbed our qualifications of rigour and respect&quot;. He said the education secretary, Michael Gove, would set out his plans for reform to the GCSE exams on Tuesday. Giving a foretaste, he said: &quot;We spent two years analysing what they teach in the world&apos;s best school systems, from Hong Kong and Singapore to Massachusetts in the US, so we can import the best of their curricula into our own. &quot;We&apos;re proposing more arithmetic and algebra in maths, more detail in science, more clarity on punctuation and spelling in English, more emphasis on modern methods of computing like coding.&quot; But he rejected an entirely insular approach. He said: &quot;When your prosperity is won in far-flung places, when your fortunes are disproportionately affected by what happens beyond your borders, then your national interest is not just about standing up for yourself \u2013 but standing up for what&apos;s right, and standing for something more.&quot; He said: &quot;Over the past three years, we have been steadily transforming the entire outward-facing effort of the United Kingdom into a coherent plan to make sure Britain succeeds in a more competitive world. A big part of that plan is connecting up with the fastest-growing parts of our planet, re-forging friendships where they were forgotten. &quot;This policy of engagement, of connecting with the fastest-growing parts of the world \u2013 it is paying off. Over the past three years our exported goods to Brazil have gone up by half; to India by more than half; to China, almost doubled; to Russia, up by 133%. This is how British foreign policy is making the world work for us.&quot; Cameron defended Britain&apos;s involvement in large international bodies, saying: &quot;When a country like ours is affected profoundly by those rules, I want us to have a say on them. That doesn&apos;t mean supinely going with the flow of multilateral opinion \u2013 the lowest common denominator approach to democracy, as we&apos;ve seen in the past.&quot; He also promised the same ambition \u2013 and practical results \u2013 for his G8 summit next week \u2013 &quot;not for us some turgid communiques with little purpose&quot;. He said his key ambitions were: \u2022 The free trade agreement between the US and EU \u2013 which could add as much as \u00a310bn to the UK economy. \u2022 Getting behind African efforts to tear down the bureaucracy and red tape that prevents people from trading freely with one another. \u2022 An international agreement on tax evasion \u2013 &quot;because we can&apos;t just clamp down on this in the UK, the cash would simply move elsewhere&quot;. \u2022 Transparency in mining, oil and gas so that people in developing countries can see how their mineral wealth is being used. He concluded: &quot;This is how our country thrives \u2013 when we lead, when we strive to be more than the sum of our parts, the small island with the big footprint in the world \u2013 and that&apos;s the way it must stay.&quot;", "title": "UK success not in blindly embracing globalisation nor in going it alone \u2013 PM", "sentences": ["Where there has been a fork in the road between doing what is easy and doing what is right, we have chosen what is right.&quot; Cameron chose the dramatic setting of the London Gateway, near Tilbury, the largest private sector infrastructure investment in the UK, being overseen by the Dubai-based DP World."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-10T13:51:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2013/jun/07/knights-of-change", "tags": ["International Development Journalism competition"], "article": "&quot;I make more mezze for them than for my mother,&quot; Isaiah, 15, points through the steam emanating from his sizzling pot of chickpeas, lime and spice, to a line of garment boutiques in downtown Amman. The vibrant souks of King Talal Street in the foreground reflect back in his hopeful eyes. They are Isaiah&apos;s battleground for money, to feed himself and his ailing mother. The irony is not lost on him: &quot;To feed us, I must feed others first.&quot; Young people are the creative lifeblood and future of the developing world. Jordan&apos;s current Head of state, King Abdullah II, addressed his nation&apos;s youth as &quot;the knights of change&quot; in his speech on the country&apos;s 61st anniversary of independence in 2007. The words echo through the chaotic capital today, where a shrewd-faced Isaiah senses opportunity.  Each day before the Dhuhr salat, the noon prayer, he helps offload fresh carcasses for the local butchery and uses his six dinar earnings to purchase some meat and haggle expertly for Za&apos;atar, a Middle-Eastern spice mixture. By midday he has created an assortment of sumptuous mezze dishes to sell to the wealthy clothing retailers. Though he earns enough to subsist, he walks precariously along the poverty line. Whilst the World Bank estimates that about one billion people in the developing world will still live in extreme poverty in 2015, these regions also await a demographic &apos;youth bulge&apos; with bated breath. For Jordan, chronic resource shortages are likely to be strained with the recent influx of Syrian refugees and increasingly burden the shoulders of youth, where approximately 55 percent of the population are aged below 25. &quot;Without urgent measures, we risk creating a &apos;lost generation&apos; of squandered talent and dreams,&quot; lamented Ban Ki-moon, United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, in his International Youth Day 2012 message.  Last year Isaiah&apos;s father left Jordan to work for a construction firm in Dubai. &quot;His payments are not enough to cover both of us anymore. I cannot go to school, I must make money,&quot; adds Isaiah fervently. Almost one-third of the world&apos;s children live in countries where lower secondary education is formally considered to be compulsory but where the commitment is not met, according to the UN&apos;s educational agency&apos;s (UNESCO) Global Education Digest 2011. Recent global focus has been upon resourcing for universal primary education, in line with the UN&apos;s second Millennium Development Goal. Isaiah will struggle to find well-paid formal employment having only a primary school education, especially when the number of jobseekers in Jordan already outweighs the jobs created by its economy. UNESCO&apos;s Director-General Irina Bokova added in the Digest that secondary education was the &quot;minimum entitlement for equipping youth with the knowledge and skills they need to secure decent livelihoods in today&apos;s globalised world.&quot; Thrust into early adulthood, without schooling, Isaiah&apos;s future balances on leveraging his natural talents. The King&apos;s call to integrate youth into the development process has boosted support frameworks within Jordan. Youth for the Future (Y4F) is a program of the International Youth Foundation in partnership with the United States Agency for International Development and the Jordanian government. Isaiah&apos;s resolve is rare- often youth can become disillusioned and expel their energy disruptively. Y4F&apos;s goal is to empower youth at-risk to realise their potential, while helping Jordanian society maximise their flair and enthusiasm. &quot;A million mile journey must begin with a single step,&quot; affirms fledgling entrepreneur Mohammed, 20, interviewing for Y4F&apos;s summer 2012 newsletter. The first step was developing life and work place skills via enrolment in the Y4F program. Following an entrepreneurship workshop he took out a 2000 Jordanian dinar loan from the &apos;Youth from the Neighbourhood Loans&apos; project, and only a month later he could cover the regular loan payment and generate a small profit from his air-conditioning business. &quot;I was daydreaming one day and saw the name &apos;Al Nabuti Air Conditioning&apos; sparkle in front of my eyes and I knew I had to start a business,&quot; he recalled. Mohammed is one of around 900 youths who have completed the entrepreneurship training through Y4F and one of 60 to establish a business. His success story is poignant for Isaiah. The tailored network of support initiatives can enable Isaiah to transform his daily battle to sustain himself and his mother into a viable livelihood, and to grow away from the margins. As Isaiah dares to dream, Leyla, 21, dare not dream. Despite having a modern languages diploma from community college, the gifted linguist survives on tips from guiding tourists around Amman&apos;s various Roman ruins. &quot;The tradition here for women is to marry early and contribute to the family as a mother and housewife. At my age, employers are too worried to hire me.&quot; In the World Economic Forum&apos;s Global Gender Gap Report 2012, Jordan ranked 121st out of 135 countries. The Middle East and North Africa region as a whole ranked lowest on economic participation and opportunity, and political empowerment. Leyla is talented like Isaiah and has the knowledge to succeed like Mohammed, but lacks a voice like most youth in the developing world.  Y4F also facilitate &apos;Let&apos;s Talk&apos; seminars which give Jordanian youth, including women like Leyla, the opportunity to voice their concerns in confidence. Lessons from Jordan&apos;s Middle-Eastern neighbours, galvanised by the Arab spring, suggest that giving youth a voice and listening to them amidst economic and political strife can be a powerful weapon for change. Ban Ki-moon acknowledged that: &quot;The time has come to integrate youth voices more meaningfully into decision-making processes at all levels.&quot; Y4F&apos;s personalised approach via forums such as &apos;Let&apos;s Talk&apos; places youth at the heart of change in their community. It provides the seeds to identify how best to harness the talents of youth like Isaiah and Leyla, considering their struggles, and empowers them to become the masters of their own future in the same vein as Mohammed.  The scent of Isaiah&apos;s spices linger around him like a halo. Now he points from a different perspective, high up on Citadel hill overlooking Amman&apos;s contemporary quarter. &quot;I am the lucky one; my excellent cooking is my voice. I will own a restaurant just over there.&quot; We need to start feeding young people&apos;s ambition before they are unable to feed themselves.", "title": "Knights of change", "sentences": ["Last year Isaiah&apos;s father left Jordan to work for a construction firm in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-10T14:19:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/11/australia-refugees-detention-afghanistan", "tags": ["Australia news", "Refugees", "Afghanistan", "Australian immigration and asylum"], "article": "     An emotional Australian government-funded advertisement in which an actor poses as a failed asylum seeker is being aired in Afghanistan in a new strategy aimed at stopping Hazara people seeking refuge by boat. The advertisement cost $550,000 to make and footage obtained by News Ltd shows a man sitting against a black background telling the story of how he sought asylum in Australia by boat and instead found himself locked up for years in a detention centre on Nauru island. &quot;I thought it would never happen to me but it did,&quot; the actor says with his head in his hands. &quot;Many years of my life wasted there until my application for asylum was rejected and I was eventually sent back to Afghanistan. I have so much debt and no money now.&quot; The advertisement, filmed in Afghanistan, ends with a warning that even women and children are sent to the detention centres on Nauru and Manus. It is aimed at deterring Hazaras from trying to reach Australia by boat. The asylum seekers who drowned in the Indian Ocean and whose bodies were not retrieved by Australian authorities are believed to be Hazaras. Pamela Curr from the Asylum Seeker Resource Centre in Melbourne works with Hazaras and does not believe the advertisement will work. &quot;These sorts of campaigns really don&apos;t have any effect on people who are in terror at the thought of going down to the local bakery for their families and knowing that they may not come home alive,&quot; she told ABC radio&apos;s AM program. Curr said no visas had been granted to Hazaras by Australia while they had been waiting in Afghanistan. &quot;There is no process in place for a Hazara to apply to leave Afghanistan or Pakistan and come to Australia,&quot; Curr said. &quot;That is the bottom line. We have families who have been waiting four and five years, men who&apos;ve been waiting to reunite with their wives and children. &quot;They go through an incredibly long, complicated process and the applications are sitting in Dubai as we speak. Thousands of applications from Hazara families. &quot;What are they to do when they fear for their lives? They know they&apos;re not going to get here under a formal process because Australia does not follow through on its promises?&quot; Afghanistan&apos;s deputy minister for refugees and repatriations Abdul Samad Hami told News Ltd that while he did not disagree with the contents of the advertisement, his government would have liked to have been consulted. &quot;It would have shown that both governments are serious about this issue,&quot; he said. &quot;People will look at this ad and say this man failed, but won&apos;t necessarily think it will happen to them.&quot;", "title": "Australian TV ad warns off Hazaras", "sentences": ["&quot;They go through an incredibly long, complicated process and the applications are sitting in Dubai as we speak."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-11T07:02:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/jun/11/live-racing-june-11-2013", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Tuesday&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook Here&apos;s a video that deserves more views. It was taken from the helmet cam used by Johnny Velazquez when he worked Animal Kingdom up the straight at Ascot 12 days ago. Animal Kingdom is the American-based horse who will add international intrigue to day one of Royal Ascot next Tuesday, when he is expected to start hot favourite for the Queen Anne Stakes. The winner of the Dubai World Cup when last seen, he is also a past winner of the Kentucky Derby - for many people, his appearance at Ascot will be their first chance to see a winner of that race in the flesh. As it happens, Animal Kingdom raised his head on the way down to the start of the gallop, bashing Velazquez&apos;s camera so that it is pointing slightly down rather than straight ahead. The view, therefore, is mostly of his chestnut mane flapping at the lens and Ascot doesn&apos;t get much of a look-in until the very end, when Velazquez pulls the horse up and has a look back around at the grandstand. Still, it&apos;s probably a more realistic view of what a jockey sees during a race than these helmet cams normally provide. One particular point to look out for is the moment near the end of the gallop when Animal Kingdom took a flying leap in the air, shortly after passing the post. If you didn&apos;t know it was there (at about 1.26), you might miss it, which is a testament to Velazquez&apos;s balance because it looked pretty hairy from the stands. Hopefully, there will be no such antics at Salisbury today, where I&apos;m hoping for a Hughie Morrison double. Morrison, a trainer I like, has been having a thin time of it lately but his Pastoral Player would have won a Group Three at Haydock on Saturday if he&apos;d had room to go inside Eton Forever rather than around him, so it&apos;s not as though the yard is presently incapable of sending out a winner. Lyric Ballad (3.30) is too big at 6-1 for the 10-furlong fillies&apos; handicap, having stormed home over a slightly shorter trip at Sandown last month, her first run since New Year&apos;s Eve and her first time on turf since her debut in October. She looked a different horse that day to the green, one-paced thing that had wrestled with our tight all-weather circuits in early winter and been handicapped on that basis. The Racing Post analyst noted that she had &quot;done well&quot;. Raised 7lb for her win, Lyric Ballad should still have a fair bit in hand and a three-week gap since the last run should be plenty of time to recover. Morrison appears to have a connection with the race, the Margadale Fillies Handicap, since he is the younger brother of the 3rd Lord Margadale. He has a runner in the race in most years, winning at 10-1 in 2009 and being beaten a nose at 11-2 in 2011. Half an hour later, Morrison runs Maisie&apos;s Moon (4.05) in the seven-furlong handicap. Another filly, she was stuffed in three quick maidens at the end of last year but was backed down to 7-4 favourite for her handicap debut at Wolverhampton in April. The money was lost as she dropped herself right out, Martin Harley reporting that she wouldn&apos;t face the kickback. Her breeding suggests fast turf should be fine and the trainer has had 50 days to prepare her for the recovery mission, so double-figure odds would be tempting. Both are ridden by the excellent Silvestre de Sousa, which is interesting, because he has never had more than one ride for Morrison in a single calendar year until today. His only ride for Morrison so far this year was that win on Lyric Ballad. Tipping competition, day two Thanks to Mulldog for clarifying that he can&apos;t use last week&apos;s prize (Ascot tickets). 72luca, as the runner-up, we&apos;ll be in touch with you! This week&apos;s winners so far: Monday Little Eaglet 7-2 Even Bolder 20-1 Malekat Jamal 6-1 And our leader is, er: 72luca +8.50 who had Little Eaglet and Malekat Jamal and is therefore literally on fire (which does not accord with the Ascot dress code). Nobody found Even Bolder. Today, we&apos;d like your tips, please, for these races: 4.05 Salisbury, 4.20 Fontwell, 6.10 Worcester. This week&apos;s prize is a copy of Her Majesty&apos;s Pleasure, Julian Muscat&apos;s book about the Queen&apos;s involvement in horse racing which was named &apos;Racing Book of the Year&apos; at the recent Sports Book Awards. It seems a timely prize, with Royal Ascot next week. If you don&apos;t win, you can buy a copy here. As ever, our champion will be the tipster who returns the best profit to notional level stakes of \u00a31 at starting price on our nominated races, of which there will be three each day up until Friday. Non-runners count as losers. If you have not joined in so far this week, you are welcome to do so today, but you will start on -3. In the event of a tie at the end of the week, the winner will be the tipster who, from among those tied on the highest score, posted their tips earliest on the final day.

We&apos;re not through it yet and we&apos;re certainly not sitting back, thinking, job done. But I feel we&apos;re doing OK.&quot; Brickell, giving his first media interview, is known in racing, if at all, as &quot;the new Paul Scotney&quot;, which is accurate only inasmuch as he succeeded the older man to the title. Scotney had been 27 years a policeman and met the world with a frankly suspicious glare, seeming to be constantly engaged in the estimation of recent felonies committed by those in his line of sight, then moving swiftly to the question of appropriate punishment. There is no such immediate threat in Brickell&apos;s gaze and his promotion by the BHA&apos;s chief executive, Paul Bittar, in his first year at the time, seemed to signal a change in the way integrity would be approached. Brickell describes the sport as telling Scotney, at his appointment during an especially troubled time in 2003, that: &quot;We need you to set something up and come and give us a short, sharp shock.&quot; Brickell adds: &quot;I think that worked perfectly. That seemed to be what was required, some quite serious action and I think what Paul&apos;s done is fantastic, if you look at the model and team he&apos;s put in place. We are held up there as a model for other sports. But I feel, 10 years down the track now \u2026 you don&apos;t need to ram it down people&apos;s throats as much, maybe. I&apos;d like to think our participants understand it a bit better.&quot; Brickell has no doubt about one of the BHA&apos;s more controversial recent decisions, to charge, try and punish Zarooni within three days of releasing the news that some of his horses had tested positive for anabolic steroids. Banned from training for eight years, Zarooni returned to his native Dubai and was unavailable for questioning when seven more positives turned up among his horses. &quot;We felt that our obligation to act in the best interests of the sport was to get this wrapped up quickly,&quot; says Brickell, who doubts whether there was any more useful or reliable information to be wrung from Zarooni. He feels a longer process would have exposed the BHA to accusations of dragging the matter out for no good reason, a complaint made this week by a senior trainer in relation to the Sungate case. Brickell hopes it will only be a matter of weeks before the BHA concludes its investigation into what went on at Zarooni&apos;s yard but, surprisingly, will not yet commit to publishing any details as a cathartic offering to the racing and betting public. Has he no fear that official reticence on the subject could be seen as a whitewash? &quot;I can assure you that&apos;s not happening. There&apos;s some pretty tough questions being asked. I&apos;m speculating but, if we get to the point where the story we&apos;ve previously been given [Zarooni acting entirely alone] has been corroborated and we&apos;re not going to be able to identify anything to the contrary, then that might have to be the answer, as frustrating as that might be for some conspiracy theorists. &quot;If we don&apos;t identify any other breaches of the rules, I think it&apos;s fair to say there&apos;ll be an element of it that would have to remain private between Godolphin and BHA \u2026 recommendations to them [Godolphin], if there&apos;s anything operationally that we can maybe do better. I think we&apos;ll probably be giving them some pointers \u2013 I&apos;m saying this without even knowing what they&apos;d be likely to be.&quot; Would confidentiality be appropriate in such a case? Surely all trainers and the public would benefit from knowing what the best practice advice was from the regulator after such a high-profile story? Brickell&apos;s instinct is still to be cagey. &quot;If there&apos;s general advice we can give to all trainers as a result of this, we probably would look at a way of conveying that to them.&quot; At the end of the Zarooni case, the BHA&apos;s policy on dope-testing will be reconsidered, with the possibility of more emphasis on out-of-competition testing in future, that having been the means by which this trainer was caught. &quot;That might be a way we go,&quot; Brickell says. &quot;It could well be, but I want the opportunity to look at the whole piece \u2026 No sport tests every participant at every opportunity. There&apos;s always got to be a certain approach, I hesitate to say risk-based, but you do it in the most sensible way and the most efficient way.&quot; Brickell feels there is a case to be made for more money being spent on testing but has no idea whether it will be approved at a time of such tight budgets. He can say little on the Sungate case, with charges having been made against the trainer Gerard Butler only last week, while other unnamed trainers are thought to be on the point of being dragged into the story. An aspect which must concern him, however, is the refusal of the vets practice involved, the Newmarket-based firm Rossdales, to co-operate with the BHA investigation. &quot;This isn&apos;t necessarily the party line but I suppose I&apos;m slightly more sympathetic to that position if they are genuinely citing client confidentiality, legal reasons for not giving us information. Perhaps they could be doing more but we do have to recognise they have obligations. Let&apos;s not forget, they can&apos;t be disclosing lots of details about their clients without their consent.&quot; While the BHA has no direct authority over vets, the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons is a powerful regulator and Brickell hopes it can be &quot;more active&quot; in future. &quot;The evidence of the last couple of years is that they&apos;re prepared to. They took action against James Main [the vet involved in the case of Moonlit Path, injected with an anti-bleeding agent on raceday], they&apos;ve conducted a couple of other investigations. &quot;They&apos;ve shown an interest in what happens when vets are involved in our disciplinary cases and that gives me some encouragement that they are keeping an eye on it now. I&apos;d hope that the one regulator they&apos;ve got already is enough and that that regulator acts. &quot;We&apos;d have to look to the RCVS first. That&apos;s their role and as long as they can assure us that they&apos;re keeping an eye on things and prepared to act if anything untoward has happened, that&apos;s the right and proper way of dealing with things.&quot; While Rossdales have clammed up, Brickell is satisfied that he can recover any necessary evidence from the trainers who use them. &quot;We know trainers can get hold of information from his vet, it just takes consent and that&apos;s worked for us previously. We&apos;ve got those records because we&apos;ve said to the trainer, we want these, we know your vet&apos;s got them, so go and get hold of them, and that&apos;s worked. So that&apos;s always going to be our first course.&quot; Steroid stories aside, racing has suffered from a steady, drip-drip of corruption cases over the past decade, most recently involving the well-established jockey Eddie Ahern, who was banned for 10 years. Brickell has advance knowledge of any prosecutions that may be on the horizon; what can he say about the level of corruption in the sport? &quot;I suppose it&apos;s pretty hard to measure and I&apos;m not going to sit here and tell you we&apos;re never going to have another one. Whilst there&apos;s an opportunity, no matter what we do in terms of putting out deterrents and messages that you might get caught, people will try it on. &quot;I guess it&apos;s within the last 18 months or so that we&apos;ve had some really high-profile, big penalties handed down and it may be that it takes a little while for that to trickle through, the effect of that. The very nature of these investigations is that you&apos;re working through a period of investigation of something that happened a few months ago. &quot;The more you expose, the more you have those serious sanctions, logic would suggest there&apos;s going to be enough of a message out there to deter people but you probably also have to accept that there will be people trying it on whilst there&apos;s a chance to cheat and gain. So we remain vigilant. The systems we&apos;ve got in place are fantastic and the way that we deal with intelligence, that&apos;s far, far beyond what I&apos;ve seen in other sports.&quot;", "title": "Adam Brickell believes racing can take positives from drugs cases", "sentences": ["Banned from training for eight years, Zarooni returned to his native Dubai and was unavailable for questioning when seven more positives turned up among his horses."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-14T16:40:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jun/15/queens-birthday-honours-diplomatic", "tags": ["Queen's birthday honours list", "Monarchy", "UK news"], "article": "Order of St Michael and St George  KCMG The Honourable Peter Richard Caruana, QC.

Graham Motion, who saddles Animal Kingdom, the probable favourite, in the opening Queen Anne Stakes on Tuesday has yet to send out a single winner at the Royal meeting. However, since emigrating from Cambridgeshire to pursue a training career in the United States he has won races worth many millions of dollars, including the Kentucky Derby with Animal Kingdom in 2011, and he is accustomed to success on the sport&apos;s grandest stages. Animal Kingdom (2.30) has proved to be impressively versatile throughout his career and won the Kentucky Derby on his first start on dirt after preparing for the race on synthetic tracks. He ran a huge race after a long lay-off when second to Wise Dan in last year&apos;s Breeders&apos; Cup Mile on turf and radiated quality as he ran away from the field on the Tapeta in Dubai. He will start at short odds on Tuesday but the last chance to back him before he retires is one worth taking. The Royal meeting starts with three consecutive Group One events, a lop-sided schedule which divides opinion as the opening day attendance is no match for the 70,000-plus who will be there on the last three afternoons. But it does give the true enthusiasts a chance to get a ticket and a decent view when some of the most interesting horses of the week are on view, including the international cast of sprinters in the King&apos;s Stand Stakes. Mike de Kock&apos;s Shea Shea, like Animal Kingdom a winner on World Cup night in Dubai, is the probable favourite but the Al Quoz sprint did not look to have quite the quality of the main event and there is plenty of quality lined up against him. Swiss Spirit (3.05), who looked an improved performer when desperately unlucky behind Kingsgate Native last time out, is a very fair price at around 9-1 to keep the prize at home. There is no obvious reason why Al Kazeem (3.45) should not confirm last month&apos;s form with Camelot when they meet again in the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes on Wednesday, while Rockalong (4.25) is an interesting runner for Luca Cumani in the Royal Hunt Cup the same afternoon. Saddler&apos;s Rock (3.45), who was not suited by the steady pace last year but still managed to finish third, can win the Gold Cup that he probably deserves on his overall form on Thursday. Sky Lantern (3.50) was half a length in front of Just The Judge in the 1,000 Guineas and can confirm the form in Friday&apos;s Coronation Stakes, while Rex Imperator ran an excellent trial for the Wokingham on his first start for William Haggas and is a big price for Saturday&apos;s main betting event at around 16-1.

One such moment is at the luggage information desk at Dubai&apos;s colossal, soul-sucking airport where, after the third overnight flight, the inevitable has happened and our bags have finally gone astray. Atherton has just done a full cooking shift at 22 Ships, his inspired tapas bar in the heart of Hong Kong&apos;s old red light district, while simultaneously checking in with staff about the lunch service at his Michelin-starred London home, Pollen Street Social, and fielding emails about his new ventures in Sydney and Shanghai. He&apos;s due at a meeting with a developer working with the InterContinental hotel group in Dubai at 9am to sign off on a deal to open a new waterfront property worth several million dollars. He is in the jeans and T-shirt he has tried to sleep in on the plane, and unshowered. At 7am the glum manager of the luggage information desk, at which we are the sole customers, is showing little interest in our missing bags. After extensive walkie-talkie conversations and a languid, fruitless search for a pen with which to take our details, a long hour or so has passed before he relays the information that &quot;I think your bags are somewhere in the system&quot;. At which point you might imagine Gordon or Marco, testosterone pumping, jetlag jagging, would have taken some selfish relief in reducing the manager, his system and the entire luggage information operation at Dubai International to a lightly astringent jus. Atherton, who worked for Ramsay for 10 years, creating the highly successful Maze, and who has, as I have witnessed in various time zones, an obsessive interest in the efficiencies of service, remains courteous. &quot;I tell you what,&quot; he says, &quot;I wanted to have a look at the fish market this morning before the meeting, so we&apos;ll head out there, and perhaps if our bags turn up we can pay for them to be sent on to the hotel?&quot;     Jason Atherton at Deira Fish Market in Dubai. Photograph: Richard Saker    We head to the fish market, a dockside hangar in which an extraordinary variety of sea creatures have been dredged from the Gulf to be vigorously descaled, chopped and then examined by some of the desert city&apos;s army of chefs. Atherton is in his element, enthused by the idea that &quot;there are probably 30 species here I&apos;ve never cooked&quot; and therefore further excited by the prospect of his Dubai kitchen, which might be open by the autumn, if he makes his InterContinental meeting. We head to the hotel to find the bags have been delivered, testament to Atherton&apos;s patience and local knowledge (&quot;I worked here for Gordon for four years and I know if you start shouting the odds to locals you are screwed&quot;). The chef makes his meeting, signs his deal, does a walking tour of the first-floor shell of a skyscraper fronting the marina in which his restaurant will take shape, and is still smiling at lunchtime when he sits down at the waterside opposite the building site, and celebrates the contract with a carrot juice. &quot;The thing is,&quot; he says of our morning, &quot;if I start to get annoyed about a lost bag or whatever, I just make sure I immediately give myself a kick up the butt. You know, I&apos;ve had more difficult days than these\u2026&quot; Atherton&apos;s journey to this particular waterfront began at a seaside about as far from the glass-fronted fantasy of Dubai&apos;s marina as you can imagine. Born in Sheffield, he moved with his mother to Skegness after his parents separated when he was three. He lived with his mum and his sister in a caravan, &quot;quite cosy but frigging cold in the winter&quot;, and got his first taste of kitchens and hotels at a guesthouse, the Maryland, that his mother set up on Skegness&apos;s North Sea coast. &quot;Even in the holidays we always had to work,&quot; Atherton, now 41, recalls. &quot;I would get up early to help do the breakfasts, then go out and be a donkey boy, doing rides for kids on the beach all day, then come back, help with the evening meal. My stepdad Dave was a joiner. He would be out first thing on building sites, then come back and put a dickie bow and a white shirt on and work the bar until midnight. On a Friday, the treat for my sister and me was to watch the telly, plugged into the cigarette lighter of the car, with pop and crisps, for an hour before the battery ran down.&quot;     Jason Atherton's quote which is on the wall of his 22 Ships restaurant in Hong Kong. Photograph: Richard Saker    This work ethic has clearly never left Atherton. After &quot;24 years busting my nuts in other people&apos;s kitchens&quot;, he invested every last penny of his savings into Pollen Street Social in Mayfair only two years ago; with the help of partners he now has eight restaurants and counting across the world (two others opened earlier this year in London, Little Social, over the road from the original, and the Social Eating House, in Soho). All have quickly won praise and awards and, more to the point, customers. &quot;We have two kinds of restaurants, extremely successful ones and successful ones, but they all make money,&quot; he says and shows me the daily incoming texts of takings to prove it. Esquina, for example, has paid back its investment in just 10 months. Atherton, who is married to Ihra, a Filipina who worked with him in Dubai, and has two daughters, aged seven and two, is about to start filming a TV series for Sky, My Kitchen Rules, in which couples compete to create pop-up restaurants in their front rooms; he has three cookbooks in the works. It is, you might say, his moment; but having seen casualties of previous such moments up close, he is anxious, desperate, not to let it go to his head. One of the fascinations of Atherton&apos;s rise \u2013 White singled him out recently as one of only three or four &quot;proper&quot; British cooks \u2013 is that he is very much a second-generation figure; he has learned from the excesses of the celebrity fathers. He won&apos;t say a bad word about Ramsay but they don&apos;t see each other now \u2013 &quot;his choice not mine&quot;; the Scot was characteristically annoyed that his protege eventually left Maze, but still Atherton has learned, he says, from his old boss, &quot;both what to do and what not to do&quot;. Much of this is detail. In his autobiography, Ramsay reveals that when he started out he was in the habit of chucking any complaints from customers in the bin. The chef was always right. In the course of our travels, Atherton has any complaints made in any of his outposts immediately texted over to him. In Hong Kong he discovers that a lunch party in Singapore had to wait 20 minutes for dessert, while one of 100 diners in Soho at lunchtime thought his steak a little fatty. Atherton immediately responds with questions to sous chefs and maitre d&apos;s, and apologies to customers. He talks in passing, &quot;don&apos;t quote me&quot;, of memorably truculent guests over the years but prides himself on never losing his rag. &quot;I&apos;ve never chucked anyone out,&quot; he says, &quot;and I don&apos;t imagine I ever will. I have had people in Pollen Street say &apos;there is not a single thing on this menu I like&apos;. But I kill them with kindness. I go out and say, tell me what you want and I will happily cook it for you. I&apos;m not interested in &apos;chef knows best&apos; bullshit.&quot; When Atherton worked for Nico Ladenis in London in the early 90s they weren&apos;t allowed to put salt and pepper on the table. &quot;If people asked for pepper, Nico would likely ask them to leave. To me, if someone likes a lot of pepper, it&apos;s not a problem. He has paid for it, he can do what he likes.&quot; It&apos;s tempting to think that some of this spirit is a legacy from Skegness. He agrees that there was probably no tougher crowd to please. &quot;We had busloads every week from Doncaster, Barnsley, Rotherham, Nottingham,&quot; Atherton recalls. &quot;We would have Leicester week, in which the only question you ever heard was &apos;Ow much is it, duck?&apos; I&apos;d have to check with my mum but I think to start with it was about \u00a33.50 for the weekend, bed and board, so it wasn&apos;t bad value.&quot; Atherton brought a good deal of that can-do possibility down to London with him. At 16, he wrote to the top 20 chefs in the country, from Raymond Blanc down, and asked if they might find a space for him. He received a positive reply from one, Boyd Gilmour, who had left the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra to set up Boyd&apos;s in Covent Garden. Atherton came down with his knives and his whites, said he could start tomorrow and that was that. He lived in the youth hostel in Earl&apos;s Court for two years with about a tenner a week to spend and &quot;loved every second of it&quot;. He didn&apos;t travel abroad until he was 22, working a season at the three-star Auberge de L&apos;Ill in Alsace. Five years after that he became the first non-Spanish speaker to work with Ferran Adri\u00e0 at El Bulli having turned up with a backpack and refused to leave until he got a trial in the world&apos;s best kitchen. In between times he cooked with White in his heyday at Harvey&apos;s and then at the Hyde Park hotel. His time in Spain perhaps gives most clues to the kind of cooking Ahterton aspires to now \u2013 smart, witty plates, with intense flavours, made with sharing in mind. &quot;You stepped into that kitchen and it was like you were in a different world,&quot; he says of El Bulli. From White, the original el bully, he learned something about man management. &quot;You&apos;d try not to catch Marco&apos;s eye at midnight when he was off hunting with his mates, otherwise you would be up making bacon sandwiches for them when they got back at five in the morning and then straight on to prepping,&quot; he says. He put up with that, and even, he hesitates to suggest, the occasional physical confrontation, because &quot;Marco was the best chef working in Britain. He was so fast and so perfect, all out of this complete chaos.&quot;     Jason Atherton and staff outside his Pollen restaurant at Gardens by the Bay in downtown Singapore. Photograph: Richard Saker    As I witness a few times, watching him at work, at the futuristic Pollen in Singapore, which is housed in a glass-domed botanical gardens on the bay, or at Esquina, his tapas bar in that heart of that city, Atherton is hardly reticent when imposing his standards on his chefs. He is only here for a day or two, so each observation has to count. &quot;When I do give someone a hard time it&apos;s usually if they disrespect ingredients, or if the veg is not packed away properly in the morning. I know it sounds OCD but my organic carrots, I don&apos;t want them tossed in a scruffy container: they are laid down nicely all facing the right way and treated with respect. I get angry if stuff like that is not done, but not madman angry.&quot; A running theme of our travels is the fact that Atherton only ever gets asked two questions by journalists: &quot;How did you survive working with Gordon?&quot; and &quot;Aren&apos;t you in danger of spreading yourself too thin?&quot; In a sense one of the questions answers the other. Atherton eventually left Maze not because of Ramsay, &quot;but because I couldn&apos;t work with his father-in-law [Chris Hutcheson, Ramsay&apos;s then business partner]. I tried for years. But it was time to move on.&quot; Atherton has so far been luckier with his own business partners. His principal backer is Mrs Mavis Oei, owner of the Goodwood Park group of hotels and daughter of the late Khoo Teck Puat, once Singapore&apos;s richest man. Oei was seduced by Atherton&apos;s food \u2013 he cooked for her first at Maze and then at her homes in Bray and in the Far East. Having invited him over to discuss a business proposition in 2011, she refused to let him return to the UK until he had signed a deal by which she offered an initial \u00a33m as finance for a 25% stake in what became Pollen Street Social. The rest of the opportunities have flowed from there.     In a meeting with business partner Peng Loh.  Photograph: Richard Saker    In Singapore, Atherton has breakfast with Peng Loh, a former lawyer who has hotel and restaurant interests throughout the world, including London&apos;s Viajante and One Leicester Street. Their plans for the former Foster&apos;s brewery building in Sydney are laid out on the table. &quot;What do the Australians eat for breakfast?&quot; Peng wonders. &quot;Well, I do this great kind of mini-English breakfast on a proper pizza,&quot; Atherton suggests, which sounds about right. In Hong Kong he meets Yenn Wong, perhaps the most immaculately groomed woman I have ever encountered, with whom he is renovating PMQ, the former colonial police barracks in the middle of town, with a casual &quot;bread oven-type place&quot; downstairs and a &quot;farm-to-table eating&quot; restaurant upstairs. There is talk of tracking down &quot;the only properly organic farmer in China&quot; for the veg. Yenn takes a precise note. She helped to design 22 Ships and they have plans for a speakeasy across the street. All of which begs an answer to the second of the two questions Atherton is perennially asked: is he in danger of spreading himself too thin? Inevitably, I guess, but the trick is to find chefs who instinctively know what he wants, for each of his satellites, and to keep them happy. He has a scheme for Andy Walsh, a young Irish chef doing precise wonders at Esquina, which gives him a 10% profit share. His chefs in Hong Kong and London are on the same incentive once the restaurants have earned back their investment. &quot;I feel like the bloke who did Dolly the Sheep,&quot; he says at one point. &quot;We clone them and we put them in a box and we ship them out. It&apos;s like Madagascar 3, crates of chefs marked fragile.&quot;            Atherton will have to find a few more crates yet. Three other London properties are planned for this year or next. A collaboration with the ultimate concept man Ian Schrager in the now defunct Berners Hotel; a City Social satellite of his deconstructed Pollen Street concept in Tower 42; and perhaps something in the old Bow Street Magistrates building in Covent Garden. Only a few places are beyond the pale. He was recently approached to do something in Moscow. (&quot;I have no desire even to visit.&quot;) Likewise Tokyo: too many great restaurants already. Otherwise, the world still seems a newly shucked oyster. Looking at that world through the eyes of a chef like Atherton is a curious thing. Cities become not so much multi-faceted metropolises as the home to places you can buy food. &quot;When we are not working in restaurants we are eating in restaurants,&quot; Atherton says, and in my time with him this seems literally true. In Singapore he takes his chefs for spicy crab at the beach on their Sunday lunch off; in Hong Kong we visit the cheapest Michelin-starred restaurant in the world, the dim sum canteen Tim Ho Wan. In Dubai he checks out, and loves, La Petite Maison, and puts his head round the door of the outpost of Wheelers, to which Marco Pierre White has given his name, which is all but empty. And all the time he seems to be thinking, sniffing, tasting opportunities. In his efforts to coolly colonise the world, one site-sensitive neighbourhood tapas bar at a time \u2013 &quot;we are not into concepts, we are not fucking TGI Friday&apos;s&quot; \u2013 it seems he is not alone. One night, on our way between Esquina in Singapore and his bar over the road (which requires a password to enter, and in which a Buddhist cocktail impresario serves drinks in miniature wooden dhows), Atherton meets Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s, another graduate of El Bulli. Andr\u00e9s is puffing on a big cigar, and also covertly looking for new opportunities. Outside 22 Ships in Hong Kong, Atherton runs into Alvin Leung, the so-called Demon Chef, who has just exported his &quot;extreme fusion&quot; cooking to London. They talk of cities not yet on the international restaurant radar, Rangoon, Bangkok, Manila. There is, Atherton suggests later as we wait for a plane, hardly a departure lounge in which he does not meet one Michelin star or another, all scenting possibilities in the global foodie air. A few days after we return, I look in on Atherton in Pollen Street Social. After the spin of the previous week he seems relieved to be grounded. Before an impeccable lunch he shows me around with pride and joy. The kitchen in which all the carrots, and everything else, are facing the right way, the dessert bar, and the Buccleuch beef ageing behind glass. Downstairs is his office, in a corner of the prepping kitchen, no bigger than a Skegness caravan bedroom. He doesn&apos;t have a PA, so he runs his mini-empire from here by email. What you&apos;ve got to remember, he says, not for the first time, is that, &quot;we are just a bunch of guys cooking food and having fun&quot;; and the thing is, he still just about believes it.

Trained in the United States by an Englishman, ridden by a Puerto Rican who is one of the best jockeys in America, owned by a syndicate that stretches through Dubai to Australia, he is also the first Kentucky Derby winner to turn up on these shores for almost 80 years. A powerful chestnut with a quirky nature, he has overcome two major injuries to be here, giving the Ascot crowd the privilege of witnessing what is almost certain to be his final race before he starts life as a stallion this autumn. No one is likely to make a fortune from supporting him; the bookmakers will offer you no better than 8-11 about his chance in the Queen Anne Stakes, such is his reputation. Those close to him seem half in love with the five-year-old, but Graham Motion, his Cambridge-born trainer, is not so misty-eyed as to recommend a bet in the circumstances. &quot;What we&apos;re taking on is a huge challenge,&quot; he said last week, &quot;and I think that&apos;s a very short price for what we&apos;re doing. When things look too good to be true, it makes me worry more.&quot; Tipsters are combing through his rivals for a viable alternative, because it is unusual for a horse to be so strong in the betting while trying something so new. Not only has Animal Kingdom never raced in Europe before, he will be running on a straight mile for the first time, having had all his experience to date around tight ovals in America and, once, Dubai. It is a significant difference that has been preying on the thoughts of Barry Irwin, a plain-spoken American who bred him and organises the ownership syndicate. &quot;Initially, when I thought about Ascot, in my mind I&apos;m thinking about the St James&apos;s Palace Stakes [also on Tuesday over a mile], which is around a turn. Then it dawned on me, this darned race is run up the straight. For at least a month, I was very apprehensive.&quot; To reassure themselves, Irwin and Motion arranged for the horse to have a practice gallop up the Ascot straight last month and the result was fairly satisfactory. Animal Kingdom showed talent, though one would hope any of Tuesday&apos;s runners would be able to pull clear of his work companion, a failed handicap hurdler. Then, as he whizzed past the point where the winning post will be this week, he threw in an unorthodox leap, as if himself auditioning for a future over obstacles. Because he was moving a lot faster than most hurdlers can manage, it took plenty of skill from his jockey, Johnny Velazquez, to avoid being unseated and loosing $10m-worth of horseflesh on Ascot Heath. Motion, hacking along about half a mile behind on a pony, saw nothing of the incident and said he was glad to have missed it. The thinking is that Animal Kingdom may have spooked at a shadow, which is not quite the expected behaviour from such an experienced beast. To limit the chance of a repeat in mid-race, he is expected to wear blinkers and a noseband this week. &quot;He&apos;s a remarkably laid-back horse, he&apos;s almost like an old steeplechaser, he&apos;s very calm. But he does have a quirky side,&quot; says Motion, exhibiting a finger with equine teeth marks still visible. Apparently, Animal Kingdom has also taken &quot;a pretty good chunk&quot; out of a member of his stable staff during his stay in Lambourn. &quot;I&apos;m thrilled with how he&apos;s doing,&quot; adds Motion, who has been shuttling between Lambourn and his base in Fair Hill, Maryland. &quot;I&apos;ve been coming back every two weeks, pretty much, and I&apos;ve seen a change in him every time I&apos;ve come back.&quot; For many American horses racing in Europe, a concern might be how they would cope without the anti-bleeding drug Lasix, which is permitted on racedays in America, but Animal Kingdom ran without it and won the Dubai World Cup in March. That was a source of delight to Irwin, who has called for an end to raceday medication and was incensed when challenged on his record by John McCririck at a press conference last week, taking the veteran pundit outside for a quiet word. &quot;I had to wise him up in terms of what I&apos;ve done, fighting the drug battle,&quot; Irwin said afterwards. &quot;I mean, I am the leading owner proponent in America against drugs. And I don&apos;t need that asshole sitting there, popping off, telling me that I&apos;m not doing anything. &quot;I choose not to run my two-year-olds on Lasix. Older horses, if we didn&apos;t use Lasix, it would be like Usain Bolt putting his starting blocks five metres behind the other guys. I&apos;m not prepared to do that. I&apos;m fighting as hard as anybody in America to change the rules.&quot; Animal Kingdon&apos;s best moments KENTUCKY DERBY 2011 Sent off at 20-1, he became the first horse to win America&apos;s most famous race without having previously raced on dirt.

PA Monday&apos;s best bets, by Greg Wood The day before the most competitive Flat meeting of the year is unlikely to yield too many obvious betting opportunities, but there are a handful of interesting races around, not least the \u00a310,000 fillies&apos; handicap at Carlisle. It is a tightly-knit contest, with Timeform suggesting that there is just 5lb between the best and worst of the 11 runners, but the one with scope to be better than her mark is Silkelly (4.45). She has been raised 6lb for a successful seasonal debut at Musselburgh last month but should find enough improvement for the run to account for that, and her previous victory in a maiden at Thirsk last September suggests she should still have something in hand from a mark of 75. Rex Romanorum (4.15) ran well to finish third in a race run in a good time at Redcar a couple of weeks ago, and both the winner and an also-ran have managed to record a victory since. Taurus Twins (7.35) at Windsor is a more speculative choice, but is back to six furlongs after dropping to five last time and did enough at Haydock two runs ago to suggest that a win is not beyond him off his current mark.

La Plante was on the show to discuss her induction into the Forensic Science Society. However, the interview quickly moved on to a discussion about a news article in the Daily Mail that had quoted her as allegedly saying at the Dubai literature festival that some BBC staff are &quot;retards&quot;. La Plante raised the topic of her saying the offensive word and initially appeared to deny to the interviewer that she said it. The interviewer sought further explanation from La Plante, with the BBC submission to Ofcom explaining that there was &quot;editorial justification&quot; because the author appeared to be about to offer an &quot;important clarification, and possibly a denial, for something she had been widely criticised&quot;. &quot;This merited journalistic exploration,&quot; the BBC said in its defence. However, La Plante&apos;s did not deny using the word at the event, she in fact repeated the assertion that some publishing executives can be &quot;retards&quot;, only refuting that she ever used the offensive term to refer to BBC staff. &quot;When Ms La Plante used the word a second time it was to confirm she had in fact used it to make a derogatory remark about some script editors and their approach to reading a full script,&quot; said Ofcom, which received four complaints about the interview. The BBC interviewer swiftly attempted to move the topic of conversation on once realising that La Plante&apos;s clarification was &quot;considerably less significant&quot; than had been hoped. &quot;Ms La Plante did not appear to recognise the potential for offence caused by this use of language, and did not apologise,&quot; Ofcom said in its ruling. &quot;Nor did the presenter explicitly challenge the guest&apos;s second use of &apos;retard&apos;, choosing instead immediately to change the subject. Ofcom considered that the broadcast of the word on the second and third occasions had the potential to cause considerable and gratuitous offence, and was not justified by the context.&quot; The regulator said the presenter should have &quot;addressed the issue with a more explicit statement, to clarify the potential for this use of language to offend, and apologise for any offence caused to listeners&quot;. \u2022 To contact the MediaGuardian news desk email media@theguardian.com or phone 020 3353 3857.

But his amazing behaviour, fly-jumping and pulling his way to the front, means punters have to ask themselves if they still trust him to behave like a professional racehorse. In hindsight, he probably had an extremely hard race when so impressive in landing the 2,000 Guineas and it may have left a mark. If so, he would be a doubtful winner on Tuesday and we may never see his best effort again. But, at 6-4, I&apos;m prepared to bet that he can bounce back.

He should prove too good for Magician, who had the Irish Guineas run to suit. 2.30 Animal Kingdom is one from four on turf, five from 11 overall and has won two races in the past two years, so odds-on cannot be tempting for his first visit to Europe and his first try up a straight mile.

He prevailed by a short-head at the end of a dramatic race, with favourite-backers kept on tenterhooks by a photo-finish and then a stewards&apos; inquiry. Despite his stablemate Leitir Mor setting a decent gallop, Dawn Approach failed to settle once more, albeit not so dramatically as in the Derby, when he lost his unbeaten record and finished last. As he made his challenge up the middle of the track in the home straight, he was pushed wide by the wayward Glory Awaits and in turn hampered Toronado on his outside. Of the pair, it might be argued that Dawn Approach lost marginally more momentum but both rallied to fight it out through the final furlong. Toronado, so disappointing in the 2,000 Guineas, when hampered by a breathing problem, managed to sustain his effort this time and seemed sure to go past. Instead, Dawn Approach showed tremendous toughness to hold on. He was immediately praised as &quot;a great battler&quot; by his jockey, Kevin Manning, who had been so dismayed about the colt bolting underneath him in the first half at Epsom. Mars ran on to be third, ahead of the French challenger Mshawish. Most disappointing was Mars&apos;s stablemate from Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s yard, Magician, the winner of the Irish Guineas, who faded out of contention in the final quarter-mile. Sheikh Mohammed, owner of Dawn Approach, told Channel 4: &quot;He&apos;s proved to me that he&apos;s the best miler in the world.&quot; Jim Bolger, the winning trainer, praised for letting the horse take his chance so soon after the Derby flop, said: &quot;Sure, that&apos;s the nature of the sport: you take chances and sometimes they work, sometimes they dont. But Sheikh Mohammed was a very willing risk-taker.&quot; Asked about the interference in the straight, Bolger said: &quot;He&apos;s a very tough horse, he was fortunate to survive that. I knew he wouldn&apos;t let me down.&quot; At 5-4, Dawn Approach became the first winning favourite at this year&apos;s Royal Ascot. Animal Kingdom, the American-trained hotpot for the Queen Anne Stakes, ruined his chance by pulling too strongly in a race eventually won by O&apos;Brien&apos;s Declaration Of War. Shea Shea, the South African favourite for the King&apos;s Stand Stakes, was pipped close to the line by Sole Power, trained by Eddie Lynam. Irish-based trainers have now won the first three races at the meeting. 3.45pm Ireland 2, Rest of the World 0 Chris Cook: The big names from America and South Africa have let their backers down in the opening two races at Royal Ascot. Animal Kingdom was most disappointing in the Queen Anne, racing freely and finding nothing from halfway. His connections were most deflated but confirmed this is most likely to be his final race. There simply wasn&apos;t enough encouragement for them to persist with more ambitious targets, so off to stud he will go. It was a brave try and we&apos;ll hope it doesn&apos;t put off other American challengers in the future. The race was won by Declaration Of War, the hotly touted Aidan O&apos;Brien beast who blew out so badly in the Lockinge last month. The trainer said he didn&apos;t have him fit enough and it appears to have been true. Aljamaheer and Gregorian were the placed horses, suggesting this wasn&apos;t a great Queen Anne. Elusive Kate and Trade Storm were just behind. Edward Lynam made it two wins for Ireland on the day by landing the King&apos;s Stand with Sole Power, who finished strongly on the stands&apos; side to pip Shea Shea, who was over on the far side, by a neck. Christophe Soumillon, on the runner-up, simply said: &quot;I was on the wrong side, behind the wrong horses.&quot; Pearl Secret ran a blinder on his reappearance to be third. The bookmakers are off to a flyer with the first two favourites downed. 3.40pm Sole powers to King&apos;s Stand victory Tony Paley: Sole Power edged out South African raider Shea Shea to claim a late victory in an exciting finish to the King&apos;s Stand Stakes. Winning rider Johnny Murtagh said: &quot;Forty winners at Royal Ascot, I&apos;m really proud of it. As a jockey this is where you want to be performing. It makes the Mondays and the Fridays a lot easier when you come to a meeting like this and ride great horses for good people. I&apos;vejust been one of the lucky ones. &quot;Eddie [Lynam] told me to ride him like I normally ride him and to ride him like I owned him. He&apos;s got a great turn of foot if you can just conserve his energy. He&apos;s very willing and if he gets going too early he runs out of steam. You&apos;ve got to time it to the best. I didn&apos;t see Shea Shea but I knew I&apos;d hit the line well.&quot; 3.30pm Kingdom flops as War bombs in for O&apos;Brien Tony Paley: American superstar Animal Kingdom proved a bitter disappointment as Declaration Of War claimed victory in the Queen Anne Stakes, the opening race of Royal Ascot 2013. Winning rider Joseph O&apos;Brien said: &quot;I&apos;m not really quite sure what happened in the Lockinge. Dad thought he wasn&apos;t quite as fit as he&apos;d hoped to have him. He said he had him 100% today and he was bang on. &quot;I was going very well and I just went into the gap. It got a little bit tight, but he was going exceptionally well and quickened up well, but he idled when he got there. &quot;He&apos;s a very good horse. We thought that at Newbury and we were a little bit disappointed but we sorted a few things - all the lads in the yard have done a great job. It&apos;s nice to start off on the front foot.&quot; Trainer Aidan O&apos;Brien reported: &quot;We are delighted. We thought the world of him last year. He just had an easy win first time at Leopardstown and then he went to the Lockinge. I left him unready and he wasn&apos;t ready for the race at the time, but he has made great progress since and has come back to what we thought and hoped he would be. &quot;He has a lot of speed, so Joseph waited as long as he could. He&apos;s a big powerful horse and when he asked him he put his head down and went through.&quot; 2pm Missing Mickael Chris Cook: When Mickael Barzalona won the 2011 Derby as a teenager and then signed for Godolphin last year, I bet he wasn&apos;t thinking of riding at Thirsk and certainly not on day one of Royal Ascot. But that&apos;s where he&apos;s been sent, to ride Waverunner (4.45) in a fillies&apos; handicap. Many will see it as a major tip, though you could read too much into it; Godolphin are not over-supplied with runners at Ascot today. Barzalona will be here tomorrow for Saint Baudolino in the Prince of Wales and Fire Blaze in the Queen Mary. Then he&apos;ll make the short hop to Kempton for the evening meeting, where he&apos;ll be on a Godolphin beast called Controversy. She was named in April last year but it turns out to have been a prescient bit of labelling. 12.45pm Remembering Sir Henry Cecil Chris Cook: Before the royal procession arrives here today, there will be a minute&apos;s silence in memory of Sir Henry Cecil, the hugely gifted and popular trainer who died last week. He holds the record for most Royal Ascot winners by a trainer at 75, 10 more than anyone else now training, and loved this week. His business is being sustained by his widow, Lady Jane Cecil, who has had five winners from her first 13 runners and is near the top of the Racing Post&apos;s &apos;hot&apos; list on day one of Ascot. Her sole runner today is Tiger Cliff, the 11-2 favourite for a tricky handicap at 5pm, and his support will not be confined to those who have backed him. The Cecil yard will have a few other chances of an emotional success this week, notably with Joyeuse, a classy-looking half-sister to Frankel, in Friday&apos;s Albany Stakes. That same day, the Queen&apos;s Vase, won seven times by Cecil, will have his name added to the race title and his widow has a big chance with Disclaimer. The Guardian&apos;s obituary for Cecil is here and an appreciation of his life is here. 11.15am Today&apos;s races: an in-depth guide by Chris Cook 2.30 Queen Anne Stakes A Group One race over a mile, all the way up Ascot&apos;s straight. This was the race in which Frankel was so impressive last year and the recent roll of honour also includes Canford Cliffs and Goldikova, with Barathea and Rousillon a bit further back. Today&apos;s race revolves around the American raider, Animal Kingdom, a winner of the Kentucky Derby and the Dubai World Cup among other races. This has been his target for months and he appears to have scared off some opposition, while others have been injured. He&apos;s even-money, which is better than the 8-11 of a few days ago, but still hardly value, for me. This is a horse making his European debut, running up a straight mile for the first time and it&apos;s not as though he&apos;s been unbeatable, even with his ideal conditions: his overall record is five wins from 11 runs and he&apos;s only one from four on turf, his sole win coming in a small-field race worth \u00a318,000 to the winner. He&apos;s had two major injuries, from which a screw remains in a hind leg, and he&apos;s won a total of two races in the past two years. If that makes him an attractive bet to you, then good luck. It seems like a leap in the dark to me and he&apos;ll have to be a very serious talent indeed to win this, even if the opposition isn&apos;t quite as strong as you&apos;d expect. Trade Storm is the each-way value for me, as a progressive type from the Newmarket stable of David Simcock, whose runners are always worth a second look. Aidan O&apos;Brien runs Declaration Of War, who has a big home reputation but flopped horribly when stepped up to this level last time; &quot;Maybe he wasn&apos;t quite fit enough,&quot; says the trainer. Sovereign Debt, still under-rated, was second in that race. Trumpet Major seems exposed as not good enough but represents the dangerous combination of Richard Hannon and Richard Hughes 3.05 King&apos;s Stand Stakes Another Group One, this time a sprint, and another visiting favourite. Shea Shea was so good in winning two races in Dubai this spring that I wondered where the South Africans had been hiding this six-year-old. He made Sole Power look slow but Sole Power is one of the fastest in Europe when he gets a decent surface over five furlongs. We haven&apos;t seen Shea Shea for more than two months, so there&apos;s something to be taken on trust. His trainer, Mike de Kock, reports him in fine form but has yet to train a Royal Ascot winner. Shamexpress represents Australia, which has done so well in this race over the past decade. He&apos;s young and improving and the handicap he won last time has been a good trial for this, though he had a suspiciously low weight. Reckless Abandon heads the home challenge, having won a two-year-old race over this course and distance at Royal Ascot last year. He also won a couple of Group Ones and ran an excellent trial for this race when third against some of these rivals on his reappearance. That race was won by Kingsgate Native, who also won a Group One sprint at Royal Ascot five years ago. The ground might not be quite quick enough for him today, a concern that also applies to Swiss Spirit, second in that race. 3.45 St James&apos;s Palace Stakes A third Group One on the bounce, this race over a mile on the round course will be one of the highlights of the week. Most Improved was a surprise 9-1 winner last year but this has often been won by favourites in recent times, like Frankel, Canford Cliffs, Rock Of Gibraltar and Giant&apos;s Causeway. Kingmambo, Kris and Brigadier Gerard are other big names who won this a wee while ago. Dawn Approach would add his name to theirs if he could reproduce the form of his five-length success in the 2,000 Guineas. But, though he won with a degree of comfort, that was a hard-run race which will have taken plenty out of him and we may have seen the effects when he threw himself around in the early stages of the Derby, ruining any chance of stretching his stamina to a mile and a half that day. At odds-against, I think he&apos;s a fair bet but there&apos;s a significant risk of another flop and there&apos;s another risk, that he may not be suited by being asked to quicken up this short straight; Newmarket&apos;s straight mile may have been ideal. Magician looks pretty good on the strength of his dominant successes at Chester and in the Irish Guineas, though that race panned out perfectly for him. His trainer, Aidan O&apos;Brien, has won half of the last 12 runnings of this race and also fields a couple of interesting runners at bigger odds. Mars didn&apos;t get much of a run in the Derby but finished strongly into sixth in the Newmarket Guineas. George Vancouver blew out completely in both the English and Irish Guineas, so he&apos;s 66-1, which looks big in light of his win at last year&apos;s Breeders&apos; Cup. Of course, he may not have trained on and he could do with a faster surface but, at those odds, I shall probably stick another few quid on him. Toronado runs for Hannon and Hughes, who thought the world of him before he faded in the Guineas. They say his breathing let him down that day and a special bit is to be fitted this time, but it seems a rather fragile basis for hope when his odds are still pretty short. 4.25 Coventry Stakes A Group Two (pshaw!) over six furlongs, this is the most significant two-year-old race of the week and it&apos;s done an excellent job of pinpointing future champions in recent years. Dawn Approach, Canford Cliffs and Henrythenavigator have all won since 2006. Aidan O&apos;Brien, seeking his seventh win, runs three, with Stubbs the most fancied and the most experienced, though to my eye he was still rather green when winning last time. Sir John Hawkins, a promising winner of his only start, is by Guineas winner Henrythenavigator out of Peeping Fawn, who you may remember winning four Group Ones on the spin in the summer of 2007. Championship, for Hannon and Hughes, won a maiden race at Newbury that was also used to prep Canford Cliffs and Strong Suit, who both won this. Championship is said to have impressed with his physical progress since then, but Hannon also has the zippy Wahaab, a Goodwood winner, and Thunder Strike, unbeaten in three and a Listed winner on Derby day. Thunder Strike was possibly lucky to beat Riverboat Springs, who failed to handle Epsom but made up an astonishing amount of ground once he&apos;d sorted his knitting out in the final furlong. He appeals each-way. 5.00 Ascot Stakes The first of many impossible handicaps served up this week, any one of which will make you justifiably smug if you find the winner. This race, over a marathon two and a half miles, quite often falls to a jumps trainer: Willie Mullins, Nicky Henderson, David Pipe, Martin Pipe (twice), Paul Webber and Tony Martin in the past decade alone. Think how galling it must be for Flat trainers, who&apos;d give their right arm for a Royal Ascot winner, to see their winter rivals swanning in and lifting a trophy at a time of year when they&apos;ve basically got their feet up. It might be Jonjo O&apos;Neill&apos;s turn today, via Well Sharp, who was third in a shorter handicap here a couple of years ago when with Michael Dods. O&apos;Neill turned him into a hurdler and he won a couple of times last year but, returned to the Flat at York last month, he hosed up and I bet he can go well again, despite the extra 10lb. Also running for the Jumping Game: Softsong (trained by Philip Hobbs, has been a bit disappointing), Investissement (David Pipe, third in the 2011 Ebor and back on a handy mark), Midnight Oil (WIllie Mullins, recently progressive over hurdles), Junior (Pipe again, won this in 2010 but getting on a bit at 10), Big Easy (Hobbs again and a serious player after recent hurdles success) and Lieutenant Miller (Nicky Henderson, in fine form on the Flat this spring). The fav is the lightly raced Tiger Cliff, a promising winner at Newmarket last month and potentially a most emotional winner, since he represents the stable of the late Sir Henry Cecil, who died last week. More on the prospects of the Cecil yard later. 5.35 Windsor Castle Stakes Another two-year-old race, which the market has found much harder than the Coventry. The past 10 winners included some returned at 100-1, 33-1, 20-1, 14-1 and 14-1. The 33-1 was a horse sent over from America by Wesley Ward in 2009 and, since he had another two-year-old winner that week, we&apos;ve learned to respect him. He hasn&apos;t managed to repeat the trick but he&apos;s back this year and runs Ogermeister. I&apos;d say 7-1 probably understates his chance but he could really do with proper fast going. If that&apos;s how it looks after a couple of races today, consider Ogermeister. At twice those odds, I like Ben Hall, who improved for the drop back to this distance of five furlongs when winning last time. He&apos;s got plenty of pace and could give the champion trainer, John Gosden, a first win in this race. Heck, Jonjo won this 23 years ago; what&apos;s Gosden been doing with his time? More remarkably, Aidan O&apos;Brien has never won this race. He fields the fancied Fountain Of Youth and Wilshere Boulevard, both winners last time . . . but perhaps it&apos;s the kind of race he uses for his second tier types. 11.10am Market movers . . . brought to you today by Ladbrokes and Stan James. Both firms report money for Trade Storm in the opener, 11-1 from 14s with Ladbrokes and 12s from 16s with Stan James. Declaration Of War is apparently weak, but there is still some support around for the favourite, Animal Kingdom. Shea Shea is a strong favourite for the King&apos;s Stand, 9-4 from 3s with Ladbrokes, though Reckless Abandon has also been backed. Stan James say the front three in the market for the St James&apos;s Palace are not being backed, with punters nibbling at outsiders, led by Dundonnell. My Catch is 12-1 from 20s for the Windsor Castle with both firms after a promising second on his only start so far. He comes from the David Brown yard near Newark that won this race with Frederick Engels two years ago. Stan James also report interest for John Gosden&apos;s Ben Hall (14s from 16s) in that race. 10.45am Stickels predicts good to firm ground if rain stays away Chris Cook: Chris Stickels, the clerk of the course, said: &quot;If conditions remain dry, we could see some &apos;good to firm&apos; come into the going description later today. We put on some water last week on Monday, Wednesday and Saturday, as it has been a pretty dry June. We have had only 9mm of rain so far this month. We have missed the thunderstorms. The ground seems to be very consistent across the straight course.&quot; 10.30am Weather and going news Chris Cook: Welcome to Ascot, where it is cool but the sun is threatening to break through heavy cloud cover. It has been dry overnight and the going remains good. We&apos;ve been told to expect possible showers this afternoon, which will be a theme of the week, I&apos;m afraid. It will be interesting to see what effect the going will have today. The new straight here drains well and it might end up slightly on the quick side, but my instinct is that conditions will not quite be ideal for those who like to bounce off a really sound surface. Top jockey, top trainer Just because I have it to hand, here&apos;s William Hill&apos;s betting list on who will do best over the next five days. We&apos;ll see how accurate this market turns out to be . . . Royal Ascot 2013 Top Jockey: 2-1 Ryan Moore, 9-4 Joseph O&apos;Brien, 4-1 Richard Hughes, 8-1 Jamie Spencer, 12-1 William Buick, 14-1 Paul Hanagan, 20-1 Silvestre de Sousa, 25-1 Joe Fanning, 33-1 Frankie Dettori, Kieren Fallon, 50-1 Johnny Murtagh, Kevin Manning, Pat Smullen, Tom Queally. (Win Only) winner is the jockey with the most winners, with 2nds and then 3rds taken in to account in the event of a tie, dead heat rules apply if still a tie Royal Ascot 2013 Top Trainer: 1-2 Aidan O&apos;Brien, 4-1 Richard Hannon, 10-1 Sir Michael Stoute, Saeed Bin Suroor, 14-1 Mark Johnston, 16-1 John Gosden, 25-1 Jim Bolger, Roger Charlton, 33-1 Lady Jane Cecil, William Haggas, 50-1 Jeremy Noseda, Luca Cumani, Roger Varian. (Win Only) winner is the trainer with the most winners, with 2nds and then 3rds taken in to account in the event of a tie, dead heat rules apply if still a tie Royal Ascot starts here! Chris Cook: &quot;What a smashing, positively dashing spectacle: the Ascot op&apos;ning day,&quot; as they sang in My Fair Lady. Like the well-dressed folks in the musical, I have never been so keyed up. Or, to put it another way, if I was a bell, I&apos;d be ringing. Five days of top-class racing starts this afternoon with three (that&apos;s right 3!) Group One races, back to back. There&apos;s no question, it&apos;s an unorthodox way to arrange things, considering we&apos;ll be rationed to one a day for the rest of the week. But is it genius to arrange things in this way, with an enormous bang that gets everyone&apos;s attention, or is it no more than silly squandering of what should be treasured assets? Have your say in the comments below and let us know how you&apos;d arrange things in your republic (it&apos;s just a game, ma&apos;am, there&apos;ll never be a republic in this island). First up is the Queen Anne, which, last year, meant Frankel and his 11-length demolition of Excelebration. This year brings another hot favourite, wreathed in glamour: Animal Kingdom will be the first Kentucky Derby hero that many in today&apos;s crowd will ever have seen in the flesh. No winner of that race has come to these shores since Omaha was the beaten favourite in the 1936 Gold Cup. Boy, those Americans can hold a grudge. The second Group One, the King&apos;s Stand Stakes, is also marked for export. This sprint has been dominated by international raiders in the past decade, especially by Australians. This year&apos;s favourite is Shea Shea from South Africa. Today&apos;s third race may be the most thrilling of the week, thanks to the presence of Dawn Approach, the handsome, enormously talented chestnut who must be regarded with the deepest suspicion after a lunatic display in the Derby. A well-backed favourite that day, just over a fortnight ago, he came out of the stalls as if someone had just hit his mother with a two by four, fly-jumping and fighting his jockey for every inch of rein. Conditions today should suit him better and those close to him say he&apos;s much better now, thank you. So will he just snap back to being a professional racehorse or is he doomed to be mad for evermore? Are you backing Dawn Jekyll or Hyde Approach? Find out at 3.45pm. Today&apos;s action is rounded out with a couple of races for highly promising two-year-olds (the Dawn Approaches of next year, if you like) plus a handicap over two and a half miles that will go on forever, by comparison.

Shea Shea was edged out by Sole Power in the King&apos;s Stand Stakes, the second of the three Group Ones at the top of the first day&apos;s card, but that was a minor surprise when set alongside Animal Kingdom&apos;s defeat behind Declaration Of War in the opening Queen Anne Stakes. A noise that was somewhere between a gasp and a groan emerged from the grandstand just under three furlongs from home as it became obvious that Animal Kingdom, the 5-4 favourite, was under pressure and finding nothing for it. He had won the 2011 Kentucky Derby on dirt, the 2013 Dubai World Cup on synthetic Tapeta and finished second in the 2012 Breeders&apos; Cup Mile on turf but the switch to a straight mile at Ascot proved a step too far. Instead it was Declaration Of War, who was only fifth in the Group One Lockinge Stakes last month, who raised his form on the way to a three-quarter length defeat of Aljamaaheer, becoming the first Irish-trained winner of four in all on the day. &quot;We always thought the world of this horse,&quot; Aidan O&apos;Brien, the winning trainer, said. &quot;He had a very easy run first time this season [at Leopardstown] and we thought he was ready for a Group One but obviously he wasn&apos;t. I hadn&apos;t trained him hard enough for it. He&apos;s a big powerhouse capable of taking training and I didn&apos;t get that right.&quot; Graham Motion, the trainer of Animal Kingdom, was disappointed by his horse&apos;s performance but reflected also on an outstanding career as the five-year-old prepares to travel to Australia for his stud career. &quot;I&apos;m sorry it didn&apos;t work out,&quot; Motion, who was born and raised in Cambridge before moving to the US to train, said afterwards. &quot;He trained great [but] it is so different. He is used to being tucked in and, when you are out in the open like that, it is a different ball-game.&quot; &quot;I would say that is probably it for him. The experience has been tremendous and, if I ever had the opportunity to do it again, then I would, absolutely.&quot; Sole Power came with a strong late run to catch Shea Shea in the final strides of the King&apos;s Stand Stakes and win by a neck, while Shamexpress, from Australia, was back in ninth place. He was Johnny Murtagh&apos;s 40th winner at the Royal meeting, a total which extended to 41 a couple of hours later when he took the concluding Windsor Castle Stakes on Extortionist. &quot;I get on well with this horse [Sole Power],&quot; Murtagh said. &quot;Eddie [Lynam, the trainer] told me to ride him like I own him. If he gets going too early, he runs out of steam, so you have to time it.&quot; Lynam added: &quot;I&apos;m delighted for the horse and the whole family and he&apos;ll now go for the July Cup.&quot; The fourth Irish-trained winner of the afternoon was another for O&apos;Brien, although not the one that appeared to be favoured from his three runners in the Coventry Stakes. War Command \u2013 like the opening winner, a son of the sire War Front \u2013 was a 20-1 chance but ran away with the Group Two contest by six lengths for Seamus Heffernan and is now the ante-post favourite at around 10-1 to emulate Dawn Approach, last year&apos;s Coventry winner, by winning next season&apos;s 2,000 Guineas. The opening-day crowd of just over 46,000 observed a minute&apos;s silence before the start of the first race in memory of Sir Henry Cecil, who died last week. Lady Jane Cecil, his wife, saddled Tiger Cliff, the favourite, in the Ascot Stakes Handicap but, despite delivering a strong challenge from well off the pace, he could not run down Well Sharp and was two and a half lengths adrift of the winner at the line. Well Sharp was the first British-trained winner at the meeting but he was saddled by Jonjo O&apos;Neill, the only trainer at Ascot to have won both a Grand National and a Cheltenham Gold Cup. &quot;Everything went according to plan. Fran had him in a lovely position all the way. That&apos;s my second Royal Ascot winner [after Gipsy Fiddler in the 1990 Windsor Castle Stakes],&quot; O&apos;Neill said afterwards. &quot;I must do this a bit more often.&quot;", "title": "War horses land Aidan O'Brien an unexpected Royal Ascot double", "sentences": ["He had won the 2011 Kentucky Derby on dirt, the 2013 Dubai World Cup on synthetic Tapeta and finished second in the 2012 Breeders&apos; Cup Mile on turf but the switch to a straight mile at Ascot proved a step too far."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-18T19:42:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/jun/19/royal-ascot-live-racing-june-19-2013", "tags": ["Royal Ascot", "Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "6pm Sandringham result 1 Annecdote 11-1 2 Auction 16-1 3 Woodland Aria 7-1 4 Nargys 20-1 Chris Cook: This was another race up the straight course to suggest that those on the far side have an advantage. The first three were drawn 3, 5 and 2, while the fourth has tacked right across from 22. Annecdote adds to a healthy summer for the unsung trainer Jonny Portman, having his first Royal Ascot winner. He also had a winner at Epsom on Derby day. Richard Kingscote was riding his fourth Royal Ascot winner in three years, which is pretty impressive for someone who doesn&apos;t get to sit on top-class types. Woodland Aria hit the front in the final furlong but was outbattled. Nargys has run an amazing race. From her draw on the stands side, Jamie Spencer dropped her out the back, where she cruised along in last until the final quarter-mile or so. As she continued to travel beautifully, Spencer picked a route through the field, gradually tacking over to the far side, and the jockey must have thought he was going to shoot past the front three, but she found nothing when it mattered most. Spencer had been drawn closer to the far rail in the Hunt Cup on Educate but switched over to the stands side early on. That turned out to be the wrong place to be and in any case he met travel problems on the near side. He must be experiencing plenty of frustration just now. 5.45pm Queen Mary result 1 Rizeena 6-1 2 Sweet Emma Rose 16-1 3 One Chance 66-1 Chris Cook: James Doyle has just won his third race at Royal Ascot in a row, driving Rizeena to an emphatic success in this fillies&apos; race. The crowd appears to have latched onto him, driving his mount&apos;s odds down from 8-1 in the closing minutes before the stalls opened. &quot;I&apos;d have take one but three is unbelievable,&quot; he told Channel 4. &quot;Great day.&quot; But now he must rush off to ride a maiden at Kempton. The winning trainer is Clive Brittain, having his 17th Royal Ascot winner but only his second in 10 years. He did his traditional celebratory jig in the winner&apos;s enclosure and even appeared to include a couple of moves from The Robot. But it looked for all the world as if America was about to get a winner here through Wesley Ward&apos;s Sweet Emma Rose, who shot clear before tying up in the final furlong. 4.55pm Royal Hunt Cup result 1 Belgian Bill 33-1 2 Premio Loco 40-1 3 Arsaadi 50-1 4 Don&apos;t Call Me 25-1 Hot on the heels of riding his first Royal Ascot winner on Al Kazeem, James Doyle made it a quickfire double as Belgian Bill landed the Hunt Cup. Sent off at 33-1, the George Baker-trained five-year-old was kept on the far side by Doyle when the majority of runners decided to head towards the stands side. Expected to go well in this race 12 months ago when only 12th, Belgian Bill, who traded at 999-1 on Betfair, burst past the veteran Premio Loco and Arsaadi to win by three-quarters of a length. Don&apos;t Call Me finished fourth with co-favourites Fury, Two For Two and Stirring Ballad all unplaced. The first four were all drawn 10 or lower. Doyle said: &quot;To be fair, George said to me he was well fancied for this last year, he had dropped a lot in the weights and had run some good races out in Dubai. The race worked out perfectly, I was able to keep him interested all the way through.&quot; PA 4.25pm Prince of Wales&apos;s result 1 Al Kazeem 11-4 2 Mukhadram 14-1 3 The Fugue 13-2 Al Kazeem got up in the shadow of the post to deny Mukhadram in the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes at Royal Ascot. The race was billed as a match up between Al Kazeem and Camelot, but Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s dual Derby winner was ultimately disappointing after travelling strongly for much of the journey. Paul Hanagan gave William Haggas&apos; Mukhadram a bold sight from the front, kicking a good few lengths clear and at one stage appearing like he may hold on. But James Doyle got stuck into Roger Charlton&apos;s stable star and the 11-4 chance was on top just before the line. The Fugue ran a blinder on her first run of the year back in third. Doyle said: &quot;I thought Paul Hanagan gave his horse a fantastic ride, he got his fractions right. He got a couple of lengths on me turning in and I had to make them up. He&apos;s a very tough horse and I&apos;m lucky to be sat on him. It&apos;s magical really, to get a Royal Ascot winner. It leaves you speechless, it&apos;s what it is all about. Hard work pays off and when it does it&apos;s fantastic.&quot; Al Kazeem has had more than his share of injury problems but was recording his second Group One success following the Tattersalls Gold Cup at the Curragh, where he also beat Camelot. Charlton said: &quot;You need to have a lot of patience in this game, it&apos;s what Sir Henry Cecil always said, and we&apos;ve been patient with him but you need the owners. We always thought we had a really good horse. To be fair we nearly ran him in the autumn, but decided to give him more time. &quot;I thought for a minute we weren&apos;t going to get there, but James seemed confident. There are a lot of lovely races and without discussing with the owners I don&apos;t know where next. Like most people I&apos;d love to have a runner in the Arc and if we go there maybe the King George would be next.&quot; PA 3.15pm Duke of Cambridge result 1 Duntle 100-30 2 Ladies First 25-1 3 Dank 7-2 Chris Cook: That&apos;s six out of eight for Ireland as David Wachman&apos;s filly wins her second Royal Ascot race, following her success in the Sandringham here last year. Ladies First cut out the running and rallied bravely in the second half of the race as a series of challengers came to her. She just didn&apos;t have enough to withstand the thrust of the winner, who would be on a run of five wins in a row but for that Leopardstown demotion. Richard Fahey has just had his third runner-up of the meeting so far and will be desperate to get his head in front at some stage. The Cecil runner, Chigun, pulled too hard in the early stages. Beatrice Aurore was a good fourth. 2.45pm Jersey Stakes result 1 Gale Force Ten 9-2 2 Montiridge 15-2 3 Tawhid 25-1 Chris Cook: Gale Force Ten gets punters off to a flyer in the Jersey, a well backed winner. He&apos;s a third winner of the week already for Aidan O&apos;Brien and a fifth for Irish trainers from seven races. The winner went to the front a fair way out, seemed like being swallowed up by the pack and then rallied impressively to hold off Montiridge. Godolphin&apos;s Tawhid made a promising run on the stands&apos; side before veering towards the rail. Gale Force Ten peaked at 139-1 on Betfair in the Jersey Stakes, presumably when it looked as though several rivals were about to sweep past him. Montiridge got down to 1-5. When last seen, Montiridge beat Mango Diva. With that form now boosted, she is still more interesting for the Sandringham at the end of today&apos;s card. 12.20pm Going change at Royal Ascot Chris Cook: The going at Ascot is now Good to Firm, good in places. No rain is expected until after racing. 11.50am Top trainer, top jockey Here&apos;s the standings after day one at Royal Ascot: Trainers Aidan O&apos;Brien 2 wins Jim Bolger 1 Edward Lynam 1 Jonjo O&apos;Neill 1 Olly Stevens 1 Richard Fahey 0 wins, 2 seconds Jockeys Johnny Murtagh 2 wins Fran Berry 1 Seamie Heffernan 1 Kevin Manning 1 Joseph O&apos;Brien 1 Tony Hamilton 0 wins, 2 seconds 11.45am Me and JP = great mates Chris Cook: Just to let you know how I spend my time between races, here&apos;s the transcript of my interview with the owner JP McManus after Well Sharp became his first Royal Ascot winner yesterday. I feel it is a classic of the post-race interview gone awry, me blurting out questions in a desperate attempt to stimulate a response, him smiling serenely through it all and not much interested in engaging with me. Me: Congratulations, JP, how does that feel? JP (greeting a friend): How are you? Me: Has it been an ambition of yours to have a winner here? JP: Well, you know, listen . . . it looked like he didn&apos;t make it over jumps, so . . . Me: We were wondering if he might go back over jumps at some stage? JP: Yes, it&apos;s great. Me: Have you had many runners here over the years? JP: Ah, just an odd one. Me: Did you come here expecting something like that, so impressive? JP: It was very pleasing, anyway. He went off to receive his trophy while I slunk back inside the grandstand. 11.30am Wednesday&apos;s races: Chris Cook&apos;s in-depth guide 2.30 Jersey Stakes This is one of the trickier Group races to solve this week, typically attracting a large field, including a handful who were supposed to be aiming a bit higher. Aidan O&apos;Brien won with his seeming second string, Ishvana, at 20-1 last year, while the previous three winners were returned at 11-1, 8-1 and 12-1. Since 1996, there have been two other winners at 20-1, plus one at 33s and one at 50s. O&apos;Brien fields the likely favourite in Gale Force Ten, who ran well in the French and Irish 2,000 Guineas without ever threatening to win. This is a step down in class but it&apos;s dangerous to assume that he is therefore entitled to take front rank. He had a decent draw in the French race, while the Irish race panned out to suit him, so although he has quality, his short odds probably overstate his chance. Jean-Claude Rouget, who has already won an English Group One, sends over two runners, including the unbeaten Mutin, who travels so smoothly that you&apos;d think a strongly run seven furlongs might be ideal. His best form is on softer than this, though. His stablemate, The Brothers War, is a zippy sort who also has a chance if on song. Rouget&apos;s jockeys today are Christophe Soumillon and Olivier Peslier, a pairing that any trainer would be delighted to have on his side. A positive view could be taken of Garswood&apos;s seventh in the Guineas, when he didn&apos;t get a clear run, and he&apos;d be a live player on the pick of his previous form. Richard Hannon, who went heartreakingly close with Toronado yesterday, runs Montiridge, Ninjago and Tamayuz Star, the first two of which have clear chances to give the trainer his first winner at the Royal meeting since this day two years ago (now watch the third-string win). 3.05 Duke of Cambridge Stakes Formerly known as the Windsor Forest but now named in honour of Prince William, whose wife gets a race at Newmarket&apos;s July Festival named after her. This is a Group Two up the straight mile for fillies and mares only, being run for the 10th time. Soviet Song is the name that stands out on the roll of honour. This is a high-quality, very competitive renewal. Duntle, from Ireland, would be unbeaten in four, including a Group One, were it not for a mildly contentious demotion at Leopardstown in September. That result worked out well for the late Sir Henry Cecil, whose Chachamaidee was promoted to first. The Cecil yard, now being run by the famed trainer&apos;s widow, Lady Jane, runs Chigun this time and her classy Group Three success at The Curragh last time suggests she belongs at this level. Dank represents Sir Michael Stoute, who has won this three times. She pipped Chigun at Newmarket last time and is 3lb better in with that rival, albeit the slightly shorter trip may not be ideal. It&apos;s a hard race to sort out, with the French raider Sarkiyla also interesting. But I think Thistle Bird is being a little overlooked at around 7-1, especially in light of her second against the colts in a Group Two at Goodwood last year. 3.45 Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes Usually one of the highest quality races of the week, this has been won by So You Think, Rewilding, Ouija Board, Azamour, Fantastic Light and Dubai Millennium since 2000. Today&apos;s names are probably a shade below that level, though hopes were high for Camelot through last summer, after he won the Guineas and the Derby. His generation appears to be a bit light on quality, though, and there seemed no fluke about his defeat in Ireland by Al Kazeem last time. Al Kazeem looks progressive and this is a home game for him, so he is hard to oppose. The French raider, Maxios, would have been tempting if the rain had come but might now be a bit short of pace. Saint Baudolino, formerly French but now with Godolphin, is intriguing; if his sole run in Dubai this spring was a fair reflection of his ability, he won&apos;t trouble the judge but conditions today are closer to those he faced last year, when he showed lots of promise. He looks the each-way bet if you can still get double-figure odds. 4.25 Royal Hunt Cup Alongside the Wokingham, this ranks as one of the two most impossible handicaps of the week. Double-figure odds about the winner would be the norm, although Forgotten Voice was a popular winner at 4-1 four years ago. Stirring Ballad is the likely favourite after winning four on the bounce last year. She&apos;s run with credit in Listed races this year but this is a new test for her and it&apos;s not clear that she has much less weight than her ability deserves. Her draw in three, over on the far side, does not seem an advantage. Last year&apos;s winner, Prince Of Johanne, is a fair bet to go well again, since he seems to cope so well with big-field handicaps run in a straight line, a kind of race that many horses find intimidating. He&apos;s dropped to the same handicap mark as when he won last year and ran well last time. Excellent Guest, second in this last year and the winner of the Victoria Cup here recently, is another who specialises in this kind of race. Still, his last-time-out success means a new career best is needed, with a bit of extra weight to lump. Burke&apos;s Rock, from the same Jeremy Noseda that won this with Forgotten Voice, looks fairly treated on the pick of her form. She and Stirring Ballad have beaten each other once each in recent encounters. Frankie Dettori rides. Elusive Time is a fascinating contender, having great form from Scandinavia before joining a Japanese trainer who is based in Ireland. His form is hard to assess in this context but it will be some effort if he can win such a test on his seasonal return for a new trainer. 5.00 Queen Mary Stakes A big field of unexposed two-year-old fillies should invite caution, bearing in mind that yesterday&apos;s two most surprising winners came in the two-year-old races. There have been a few fancied winners of this Group Two over five furlongs in the past decade, mixed with others at 25-1, 20-1 and 20-1. Beldale Memory already has a Listed winner to her name but both her outings have been on ground with some give, so she needs to be able to adapt to this sounder surface. Richard Hannon, who has four wins in this race since 1992, fields four and the pick appears to be Oriel, judging by the fact that his son-in-law, Richard Hughes (also known as the champion jockey) is on board. Oriel has yet to win in two starts but has shown lots of promise in good company both times. One that could make Hughes regret his choice is the aptly named Fast, who hosed up on her debut at Chepstow. She needs to prove that she can cope with going other than soft but she is all potential so far. Mick Channon&apos;s Kaiulani is easy to like after whizzing home ahead of a subsequent winner on her debut. The very zippy Quatuor flopped on soft last time but might find today&apos;s conditions more suitable. Godolphin run Fire Blaze, one of the last winners trained by the now disgraced Mahmood al Zarooni, found to have given anabolic steroids to many of his horses. This one has never tested positive but that won&apos;t be enough to dispel suspicion. She won a hot little maiden at Newmarket in April and commands respect. Rizeena was only fifth that day but has progressed since, beating Oriel over today&apos;s course and distance before hacking up in a Listed at Sandown. She looks the form pick to me and will be hard to beat if improving again. 5.35 Sandringham Stakes Another large-field handicap, confined to fillies and mares over the straight mile, this was won last year by Duntle, who runs today in the Duke of Cambridge. This race has only been going since 2002 and Sir Michael Stoute has yet to win it but he has a big chance with Mango Diva, the likely favourite after her second to Montiridge (runs in the Jersey) in a Listed race last time. Bracing Breeze has been well backed and has shown promise in thee starts. It would be no surprise if Dermot Weld&apos;s runner is ahead of her rating as she maker handicap debut. John Gosden has a fancied runner in Woodland Aria and she scored at Leicester last time but I was frankly disappointed with her previous effort in the Musidora. I&apos;m not sure how much scope she has to do better than we&apos;ve seen so far and Gosden may have a better shot with Stresa at 28-1. She was behind Mango Diva on her reappearance but looked a deal sharper next time, winning a maiden that is working out. She looks progressive. 11.15am Market movers Chris Cook: . . . come with a caveat of having been terribly misleading on day one. William Hill and Victor Chandler have been first with the info today, the main event being Field Of Dream in the Hunt Cup. Trained by Jamie Osborne, he&apos;s been put up by a couple of heavyweight tipsters this morning and is 11-1 from 33s with Chandler, 14s from 18s with Hill&apos;s. Hill&apos;s other big loser so far is Bracing Breeze in the Sandringham that closes today&apos;s card. She&apos;s a lightly raced Dermot Weld runner. Few are sharper than Weld, though it&apos;s been 10 years since his last handicap winner at this meeting. Garswood and Mutin are popular in the Jersey, while Saint Baudolino is being nibbled at in the Prince of Wales. Ed Walker&apos;s once-raced Reroute is attracting support for the Queen Mary. 11.00am Weather and going  Chris Cook: It&apos;s warmer and more humid at Ascot today, with clouds overhead. There has been no rain overnight and only the lightest shower yesterday, but the going remains Good. That being said, the clerk of the course, Chris Stickels, says it will be Good to Firm in places if there is no rain by the time of the first race. We&apos;re due to get some thundery showers today but probably not until after racing is over. Royal Ascot, day two Chris Cook: &quot;Everyone deserves a second chance,&quot; we are told by most Hollywood movies and it turns out to be true, at least in horse racing, at least yesterday. Declaration Of War was beaten 11 lengths in the Lockinge last time out, while Dawn Approach finished stone-bonking last in the Derby, but both of them managed to win top-class races as Royal Ascot opened yesterday. Watching their latest, catastrophic runs, you couldn&apos;t have backed them. But if you had the vision to see past those flops . . . Successful betting on horses requires you to use a certain amount of imagination, but not so much that you find yourself repeatedly throwing away good money on hopeless schmoes like George Washington. Ireland dominated day one, with Aidan O&apos;Brien, Jim Bolger and Eddie Lynam training the first four winners between them. Stopping the rot by winning race five for Britain, was . . . er, Jonjo O&apos;Neill. And since Johnny Murtagh rode the last winner, I think Ireland can fairly claim a clean sweep. Ireland&apos;s runner in today&apos;s big race, the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes, is Camelot, who came within a length of winning the Triple Crown last year and was beaten in the St Leger only by a horse who is now under a cloud of suspicion. But he has become something of a &apos;meh&apos; horse (&quot;What do you think of Camelot?&quot; &quot;Meh.&quot;), most especially because he seemed to be beaten fair and square by Al Kazeem last time. But maybe Aidan can get this one to bounce back from his bad day, just like Declaration Of War . . . The international contingent let down their backers yesterday but today may go better for them. Trainers from France have serious contenders in the first three races, while the Royal Hunt Cup, an impossible handicap, features a runner from South Africa. And this might be the day when the Cecil yard get their first Royal Ascot winner since the passing of Sir Henry last week. Lady Jane, his widow, fields Chigun in the Duke Of Cambridge and the filly has a favourite&apos;s chance, or close to it. My tipping preview is here. Think you can do better?

Trained by Andreas W\u00f6hler, he makes plenty of appeal at 20-1 in an open renewal of the famous marathon. Germany has not been a consistent source of top-quality Flat horses but has enjoyed notable successes in the past two years, especially through Danedream, winner of the Arc and the King George for Peter Schiergen. Energizer, trained by Jens Hirschberger, gave the country its first Royal Ascot winner in a Group Three last year, while Chopin became a first German runner in the Derby this year and fared respectably. Less than a fortnight ago, Schiergen&apos;s Amarillo turned up at Haydock for his British debut and won a Group Three at 10-1. W\u00f6hler, whose highlights include victories in the Arlington Million and the Dubai Duty Free, has only managed one Listed winner in Britain from a handful of attempts, but he has saddled a runner-up in the Coronation Stakes and his Indomito was fourth to Frankel in last year&apos;s Queen Anne. It seems that German raiders are routinely capable of competing in the best races around Europe and that British punters have not quite embraced the fact. Altano is certainly taking a step up in class but he has a fine strike-rate in recent seasons and seems on a gradual upward curve. He is a very strong stayer and should be among the few to cope if there were a strong gallop throughout, as seems quite possible with 18 in the field. He will cope fine if rain arrives but would probably prefer a sound surface and looks like being in luck; the ground has been drying out all week as the threat (but actual absence) of rain has prevented artificial watering. W\u00f6hler&apos;s other runner, Earl Of Tinsdal, may be a late non-runner if no rain arrives, as he would not appreciate quick ground. It is hard to believe that the veteran Rite Of Passage, with his history of leg problems, wants fast ground either. The Queen&apos;s filly Estimate still has plenty to prove for a horse at the head of the market, though she is on an upward curve. Saddlers Rock has the necessary talent but is unappealingly inconsistent. Simenon seems likely to run well, though the value has gone. 2.30 Coach House is justifiably short in the market after the excellent showing of his stablemates in the Coventry, when Aidan O&apos;Brien trained the first and third. Coach House was favourite for the Coventry at one stage but connections have clearly decided this shorter race was a better option for a horse who is bred to be fast and has won twice over five furlongs, including on fast ground last time. 3.05 Ireland&apos;s good run at the meeting petered out after the second race on Wednesday but momentum may be restored if Alive Alive Oh proves as good as she promises here. Trained by Tommy Stack, she could hardly have been more impressive with the way she quickened to win a Listed race at Navan in early May, after which she got single-figure quotes for the Oaks, which connections quickly ruled out. She has to prove she can cope with a decent racing surface. 4.25 Wentworth looks a serious prospect and is predictably a warm order for this. But there are other progressive types in the field and a concern would be that he may have been drawn on the wrong side, judging by the Hunt Cup and the Sandringham on Wednesday. Prophets Pride, from the in-form Jeremy Noseda yard, has been quietly progressive on the all-weather, should be fine on turf, has a bit in hand of his mark, is drawn on what seems the right side and wears cheekpieces for the first time. The 20-1 might prove a bit big. 5.00 O&apos;Brien may be in the winner&apos;s enclosure again with Indian Chief, a close third in the Dante. That seemed disappointing at the time, as he started favourite and the yard had been mopping up Derby trials for fun, but the winner was a strong-finishing second in the Derby, while the runner-up has also boosted the form. 5.35 Brian Meehan has few stars but has managed a winner at each of the last two Royal Ascots and may get on the board with Eshtiaal. Bred to appreciate this trip, he improved to win on his handicap debut with some comfort, beating a subsequent winner with the rest stuffed out of sight. Raised 9lb, he has lots of scope to be in front of the assessor.", "title": "Altano can win the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot for Germany", "sentences": ["W\u00f6hler, whose highlights include victories in the Arlington Million and the Dubai Duty Free, has only managed one Listed winner in Britain from a handful of attempts, but he has saddled a runner-up in the Coronation Stakes and his Indomito was fourth to Frankel in last year&apos;s Queen Anne."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-19T18:18:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/jun/20/prime-central-london-property-bubble", "tags": ["House prices", "Property", "Money", "Housing market", "Real estate", "Business", "London", "UK news"], "article": "The average asking price of a property in London has increased by more than \u00a330,000 since the start of 2013, according to figures from property website Rightmove, and is now comfortably through the half-a-million pound mark, at \u00a3515,243. It sounds a lot, but in some parts of the capital it is small change. Land Registry figures show the most expensive areas of the country - and those that have seen some of the biggest increases in prices - are the neighbourhoods that estate agents like to call &quot;prime central London&quot;. The property boom in these places \u2013 primarily Mayfair, Knightsbridge, the West End, Kensington &amp; Chelsea, and Holland Park \u2013 has been extraordinary. The average price of a PCL home is now \u00a31.53m, with the dearest deal done so far in 2013 believed to have been for a flat at One Hyde Park, sold for \u00a329.35m. It may seem that the only way is up, but politicians, retailers and even estate agents are warning that expensive homes are creating soaring rents, an exodus of small shops and a ghost town atmosphere, and that the market could turn out to be a bubble. Silent streets One big concern about the PCL boom is that it is leading to streets where nobody actually lives. &quot;More and more stats and anecdotes indicate that &apos;Fortress Central London&apos; is emptying of residents,&quot; says Ed Mead of Douglas &amp; Gordon, an estate agency with 11 branches across the capital. He says many overseas buyers own multiple homes around the world and rarely spend time in any one, however much it cost. As a result, parts of PCL fail the neighbourhood test of having milk and newspapers on sale within a short walk of where people live. &quot;Why should owners care? They&apos;re never here to need them,&quot; Mead says.     Chef Aldo Zilli moved his restaurants out of Soho in 2012. Photograph: ITV/Rex Features    In 2012, of 7,000 new-build homes sold in PCL, more than 5,000 went to overseas buyers, and the estate agency Knight Frank says buyers from just two countries, China and Singapore, bought 40% of them. Savills, another agency, says fewer than half of PCL buyers treat their purchase as their main home, the rest are just investments. &quot;Some of the richest people in the world are buying property as an investment. They live here for a fortnight in the summer but the rest of the year they are contributing nothing to the local economy,&quot; says Paul Dimoldenberg, leader of Westminster council Labour group. One of the reasons so many homes lie empty is that house prices have been rising rapidly, meaning capital appreciation is so high there is little incentive for some investors to let their property. &quot;Take a flat worth about \u00a3850,000 a year ago. That&apos;s worth \u00a3950,000 now,&quot; Mead says. &quot;The capital growth alone is equivalent to almost \u00a32,000 a week and there&apos;s no wear and tear.&quot; He believes some investors purchase new-build apartments only to &quot;bubble wrap and sell in pristine condition at some point in the future&quot;. This may account for why Knight Frank, which had expected no growth in PCL rents in 2013 on the back of City of London job losses, has now reported spring increases in rents in St John&apos;s Wood, Kensington, Marylebone, Belgravia and Knightsbridge. Not only have residential prices and rents rocketed, excluding many London buyers and tenants, but commercial rents have soared as chains have outbid long-standing local shops in a bid to attract wealthier homeowners. Aldo Zilli shut his two Soho restaurants in 2012 claiming &quot;Soho&apos;s not the same as 35 years ago when I moved in&quot;, and that the influx of chains that could pay high rents meant the area was &quot;becoming like Dubai&quot;. Roe &amp; Moore&apos;s art shop next to the British Museum has closed, citing soaring rents as a main problem. Meanwhile, the Heygate, a former council estate in Southwark \u2013 an area on the edge of PCL but identified as a growth area by estate agents \u2013 is being demolished, but only 79 of the 2,535 projected homes on the site will be offered to renters as social housing. Closed market Another issue raised by commentators is the shortage of homes for sale in PCL. Many existing overseas owners are not reselling on the open market; instead they sell or pass them on to members of their families, or advertise them through agents in their own countries. &quot;As a result there is less stock available and prices rise still further, narrowing the type of buyer who can afford to purchase,&quot; says David Adams of John Taylor, a high-end estate agency. &quot;British buyers traditionally used to trade up, even in central London. They would buy a flat, do it up, move to a terrace, then move out of the centre when a family came. That buyer doesn&apos;t exist in central London anymore, so turnover is much reduced.&quot; Hamptons International, another high-end agency, says there is now &quot;an acute shortage&quot; of stock. The firm&apos;s head of sales, Marc Goldberg, says PCL stock is &quot;45% lower compared with the bottom of the market in 2008 and 17% below 2012.&quot; Even if they are sold, many PCL homes are put on a private grey market where &quot;property is traded out of sight of the internet and done by email and telephone instruction,&quot; according to Henry Pryor, a buying agent locating homes for wealthy clients. When central London apartments and houses wanted by these buyers become available, details are sent electronically to agents who then inform their exclusive clients. Typically there will be no hard-copy brochures in order to ensure confidentiality for the seller and deter would-be buyers who are not cash-rich and able to buy without a mortgage. Currency concerns A big problem for PCL is its vulnerability to currency exchange rates, international financial crises and fiscal volatility. Knight Frank says buyers using US dollars will find PCL properties 7% cheaper than in 2008 thanks to sterling&apos;s slide, while buyers using pounds pay 17% more. By contrast, a collapse of the dollar or of Asian currencies which have shown similar strength against sterling could badly damage demand for London homes. On top of this, Adams warns that trigger events \u2013 a second international banking collapse or the introduction of higher UK property tax \u2013 &quot;could expose PCL as being nothing more than a bubble.&quot; &quot;It is easy to see a failed bank or a heavy duty mansion tax completely changing the perception among international buyers,&quot; Adams says. &quot;You could see 20% wiped off prices overnight. It would be the end of PCL as we know it.&quot; Although that prospect may not bring tears to most people&apos;s eyes, it is worth remembering that just as booming prices have had a knock-on effect on other areas, so would a crash. The ripples of a substantial fall in prices could be felt throughout London, while a return to negative numbers in house price reports could damage sentiment beyond the capital. While PCL&apos;s relentless rise has its problems, so too would a fall. \u00a0", "title": "Prime central London property prices inflate bubble fears", "sentences": ["Aldo Zilli shut his two Soho restaurants in 2012 claiming &quot;Soho&apos;s not the same as 35 years ago when I moved in&quot;, and that the influx of chains that could pay high rents meant the area was &quot;becoming like Dubai&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-20T06:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/jun/20/ted-baker-record-high-sales-surge", "tags": ["Business"], "article": "Ted Baker has surged to a new high despite the market slump, prompted by a jump in the fashion retailer&apos;s sales.

It has been expanding internationally, opening flagship stores and concessions in the US and Asia to take its total number of outlets to more than 300.

The truth is, he is even more subsidy-hungry than I thought, 11 June). In fact, we have always worked in competitive industries, battling with larger rivals and with no subsidies. Neither is Virgin Money a &quot;frontman for the serious money of America or Dubai&quot;: we remain its largest shareholder, with almost 50% of the equity. Chakrabortty claims &quot;the only way Branson and the vast majority of train barons make their profits is through handouts from the taxpayer&quot;. This misrepresents why subsidies were paid in the early years of the west coast franchise, when it was heavily loss-making and costing the taxpayer a fortune. The subsidies were calculated by government to cover losses in those early years and ensure a regular service could be maintained while the track was repaired and before we could start turning around the franchise. From 1997 until 2004, Virgin Rail&apos;s shareholders took no dividend. Instead we worked to create a reliable service, in spite of the collapse of Railtrack and huge delays in the infrastructure work, which severely slowed the turnaround. Chakrabortty confuses with his claims of &quot;the service&apos;s upgrade (worth around \u00a39bn, and paid for by the public), and the fleet of Pendolino trains (again, largely subsidised by the government)&quot;. Of the \u00a39bn spent on the line, only \u00a32bn was for upgrade work. The remaining \u00a37bn was spent to renew a railway that had no investment since the 1960s and needed to be made safe. Contrary to the claim that the Pendolinos were subsidised and &quot;most of the improvements were subbed by taxpayers&quot;, the train fleet has been 100% privately financed and we pay Angel Trains and Alstom more than \u00a3200m each year to lease and maintain one of the most modern fleets in Europe. We now carry 31 million customers a year, compared to just 13 million when we took over the franchise in 1997. This has created great benefits for the Midlands, north-west and Scotland as well as government. In the last five years, premium payments to government have been some \u00a3500m, in contrast to Chakrabortty&apos;s claim we have only paid agreed amounts in the last two years. For over 15 years we and our partners have created a franchise so successful that last year&apos;s bids for the west coast were offering premium payments to government of more than \u00a35bn. This is a big turnaround from the liability we inherited and in that time we and our partners have taken total dividends of \u00a3499m, while the government and the taxpayer have seen a rise in revenues and a massive increase in assets values. It is wrong to claim that with &quot;new rolling stock, a more frequent service and a superfast line that whisked passengers from London to Manchester in just two hours \u2026 the company couldn&apos;t help but pull in the customers&quot;. We introduced the new rolling stock, and helped to deliver the more frequent service and &quot;the super-fast line&quot;. Most were sceptical about our plan, dubbing it &quot;mission impossible&quot;. Network Rail has cut the overall track access charges from \u00a33bn to around \u00a31.5bn a year, but these are set by the government, and the west coast charges reflect a reduction in costs after the renewal and upgrade work and other efficiencies it has made. Chakrabortty says: &quot;Private companies who don&apos;t make a profit can simply walk away, dumping their service back in public hands.&quot; By contrast we have stuck with the task despite the dreadful performance by Railtrack.

Masasit Mati, creators of the YouTube finger-puppet show Top Goon: Diaries of a Little Dictator, have begun to perform the satirical series live inside the war-torn country in an attempt to bolster peaceful protest and spur the revolutionary art movement. The series, which will be shown in London next month as part of the Shubbak festival of Arab culture, caricatures Assad through the puppet Beeshu, the brutal, childish son of a dictator with a beaky nose and saucer-shaped ears. He is protected by his sinister and unquestioning henchman, The Goon, while ordinary Syrians are portrayed as brave and idealistic. Speaking via Skype from Lebanon, the show&apos;s director, Jameel, said they decided to use puppets to protect the identities of the 10 artists involved and because their small size &quot;was a good way of lampooning the regime that presents itself as godlike&quot;. The episodes were filmed in Beirut, with the puppets and props smuggled out by the artists. &quot;We disguised the puppets, especially the one of Beeshu,&quot; said Jameel. &quot;We gave him a moustache and extra hair. Otherwise, everyone would have recognised him.&quot; The first series, launched in autumn 2011, attracted more than 200,000 views on YouTube and was broadcast on the Dubai-based Syrian opposition channel Orient TV. But escalating violence and power blackouts shrank the domestic audience for the second and third series. So in January the group surreptitiously travelled into the rebel-held town of Manbij in the northern region of Aleppo to perform live in an arts festival organised by local activists. The town had enjoyed relative calm for a month, with no attacks or kidnappings, but on the day they arrived it was bombed by Assad&apos;s forces, leaving 12 dead and dozens more wounded. &quot;We were very shocked and the organisers of the festival thought it should be delayed,&quot; said Jameel. &quot;We felt we couldn&apos;t wait another week, but we didn&apos;t want to gather people indoors in case there was another air strike. So we performed some of the episodes in the street during a protest [about the bombings].&quot; Top Goon draws on Assad&apos;s speeches and biased state TV coverage of the uprising to highlight and subvert the regime&apos;s propaganda. In the episode Prostitute Media, a protester is forced to confess to being a violent criminal on an official news programme, saying: &quot;I held an olive branch in my hand ... I mean I was holding an RPG [rocket-propelled grenade], a nuclear bomb, pistols, rifles I got from al-Qaida.&quot; The series has also been critical of the armed resistance. In the episode Monster, Beeshu tortures a protester and taunts him to take his revenge. The prisoner attacks and strangles the dictator, who then gloats: &quot;I told you, you&apos;re a monster, just like me.&quot; Jameel said the live performance was &quot;also about testing out the boundaries of the new regime in the liberated areas&quot;. He added: &quot;It&apos;s one of the regions suffering now from the temptations of the Islamists and sectarianism. We were apprehensive about how they would react to one actress \u2013 hearing the voice of a lady who was making fun of a famous singer with this kind of sexy voice. But we felt very welcomed and respected.&quot; The group is preparing for live performances in Aleppo and the northern regions, which it hopes will support local artists. Arts committees and newspapers have been set up in rebel areas, but some have been shut down by hardline elements of the Free Syrian Army. &quot;There&apos;s a whole civil society that&apos;s being ignored by activists and the western and Arab media,&quot; said Jameel. &quot;We&apos;re trying to come up with a concept of street theatre where we&apos;ll go to an area, put on a show, then teach the people how to make puppets and put on shows.

For Boeing, this is a further opportunity to restore the reputation and fortunes of a carbon fibre miracle that briefly took on the air of an industrial disaster when burning batteries grounded the fleet in early 2013. Its gestation has been public and painful: after endless delays in production, the hype over its maiden voyages gave way to safety concerns that grew until aviation regulators took the fleet out of service. The 787 did not return to the skies, with modified batteries, until late April. But airlines haven&apos;t lost their lust for a wide-bodied plane with the fuel efficiency and range of a much larger model \u2013 and one that also promises more peace for passengers and bystanders. As British airports push to expand, noise levels may prove particularly relevant and backers of Heathrow&apos;s expansion will welcome a quieter presence over west London. Boeing&apos;s arch-rival, Airbus, has not revelled in its competitor&apos;s discomfort. Before the Dreamliner saga, the Franco-German business was in the headlines for persistent delays in producing its A380 superjumbo, which then endured high-profile mishaps once it entered service. The discovery of cracks in the wings of the A380 fleet \u2013 in the wake of an engine blowout on a passenger flight in 2010 \u2013 undermined the allure of a plane that represented the cutting edge of commercial aviation before the Dreamliner came along. With perfect timing, Airbus has unveiled its response to the Dreamliner&apos;s return \u2013 the A350. The first of these slightly smaller jets took off from Toulouse on 14 June, in time for a swoop over the Paris Airshow last week. The Airbus plane is less revolutionary than the 787. It has similarly efficient engines and enough carbon-fibre to bring down the weight and the fuel bill, but not the battery-driven auxiliary systems that have plagued Boeing. For an airline industry wary of taking chances as profits tumble, it is a conservative compromise. At Paris Airbus sold 69 more A350s, mainly to established customers such as Singapore Airlines, along with a good batch for Air France, naturellement. But Boeing secured &quot;commitments&quot; for 102 Dreamliners at Paris as it finally revealed plans for the 787-10 \u2013 a stretched model with around 330 seats that will match the capacity of the smaller A350s, entering service in 2018. Randy Tinseth, Boeing&apos;s vice-president of marketing, says the battery problems had delayed the go-ahead despite interest from customers. But he adds: &quot;There is a little bit of magic in that aircraft because of the experience it gives passengers ... The more the airplane is out there in the air, the better it will do in the market because people just love it.&quot; The crucial people who &quot;love it&quot; are airlines who see a way into new long-haul markets on a lighter, fuel-efficient plane. Airports, meanwhile, think it can change the way planners view the economics of certain routes. In Britain this adds to the debate on whether, and where, to expand London&apos;s crowded airports. Gatwick trumpeted the merits of the &quot;hub-busting&quot; Dreamliner that Thomson Airways will operate from the airport, claiming its arrival meant that the decades ahead would shift airlines away from the &quot;hub and spokes&quot; model \u2013 where passengers fly in on short-haul planes then transfer to a long-haul flight. That is the business plan for the UK&apos;s biggest airport, Heathrow. But the Dreamliner gives the likes of Gatwick a chance to offer economically competitive long-haul services with just one runway. For Heathrow, even more significant is the arrival of BA&apos;s first A380 on 4\u00a0July. A hole has already been carved in the entrance to the BA hangar, to allow the tailfin of the giant plane to squeeze through. This is the plane of Heathrow&apos;s future \u2013 doubly so if expansion plans are thwarted. With passengers connecting at the hub, it can load ever greater numbers on a single take-off. Where demand is high, such as on transatlantic routes, the numbers can make sense for airline and airport alike \u2013 and potentially for Londoners under the flight path, with the A380 promising to be far quieter than the Boeing 747. With Boeing&apos;s own superjumbo heading for extinction because of the advent of the A380, it&apos;s perhaps unsurprising that Tinseth is sniffy about the A380 and its prospects for solving airport capacity issues. &quot;I could take every passenger on a wide-body today, put them on an A380, and that&apos;s not going to address the issue,&quot; he says. &quot;The way we see the market still headed is more fragmentation ... more flights to more places, rather than bigger and bigger airplanes. That really provides benefit to the passenger because it dramatically reduces their flight times.&quot; Airbus, and plenty of aviation analysts, remain confident about the future of the A380, but it is heavily reliant on one customer. Emirates has ordered 90 A380s and transformed its Dubai airport home to accommodate a plane whose economics match the strategy of the airline and its host hub airport. Only 20 A380s were sold at Paris, to a leasing company, Doric. While the battle lines are being drawn, many airlines are happy to pitch their tents in the middle. BA and Singapore Airlines have announced carefully balanced orders from both manufacturers in recent months. Douglas McNeill, investment director at stockbroker Charles Stanley, says that when planning future fleets, &quot;you&apos;re never quite sure what would suit you best&quot;. The bottom line is the cost and revenue generated per seat per kilometre. &quot;Those might sound like quite simple questions but they&apos;re not: the number of people on the plane influences the weight, then the fuel ... Frequency and speed might mean you can raise fares. So airlines are reluctant to commit \u2013 they&apos;re hedging their bets. It also lets you drive a hard bargain.&quot; This negotiating tactic was claimed by easyJet to bring in its own Paris deal although low-cost carriers generally prefer to run as few aircraft types as possible to minimise crew training and maintenance costs. McNeill says that, to make the sums add up, Boeing would have had to go some distance to undercut Airbus, whose planes are the only ones easyJet now flies. With such deals potentially valued at tens of billions of dollars, the finely balanced corporate battle has a wider impact: prime minister David Cameron was quick to tweet congratulations to Airbus for the A350 take-off &quot;securing 6,200 UK jobs&quot; \u2013 reflecting the fact that all Airbus wings are made in the UK. Meanwhile, as befits two heavyweights, there was, before Paris, an edge detectable in Tinseth&apos;s voice as he talked of the &quot;strong rivalry&quot; and accused Airbus of holding back orders for the show. By the time of the show he had upped the rhetoric to claim that Boeing was outmanoeuvring Airbus: &quot;We&apos;ve got them boxed and bracketed.&quot; John Leahy, chief operating officer for Airbus, retorted: &quot;Our A350 XWB has been outselling the 787 by better than two to one over the past five years. In addition our [short- haul] A320neo family retains a 60% market share lead. That&apos;s a corner I want to stay boxed into.&quot; And the final score in this Paris match? Airbus pipped Boeing with deals worth $68.7bn, for 466 passenger jets. Boeing notched $66.4bn for 442 planes. The running total for 2013, meanwhile, has Airbus ahead by 734 planes to 692.

The latest theme to get the Dubai treatment is not an Angry Birds theme park, or the world&apos;s largest Ferris wheel, but the holy Qur&apos;an. In this most recent episode in its litany of excess, Dubai is planning a Qur&apos;an theme park. It appears that in order to combat its irreligious public image, the Dubai planning authorities have resorted to a typical manoeuvre. Spend loads of money, build a spectacle, and make it big. Dubai, although fundamentally a conservative place, has done as much as it can to distance itself from religion (apart from when public order is seen to be assailed) and has generally gone about building a secular emirate that welcomes western tourism. It is also accommodating of its diverse expat population, south Asian labourers, western bankers, Arab middle men, Gulf billionaires; all are welcome, tied by the shared bond of a tax-free salary. Of course there are inevitable tensions, but the emirate is like a bizarrely themed bar where everyone drinks in harmony, before fighting breaks out at the end of the night, and the whole process is repeated the next day. This reputation has started to alienate regional tourists from the Arab Muslim world. Recently, a controversial Saudi preacher ordered Saudi women not to visit Dubai (obviously Saudi men are incorruptible) due to the city&apos;s licentiousness. This latest theme park can therefore be seen as a move to appease regional tourists and plug a gap in the market that would enable Dubai to have 20 million visitors a year. This latest offering to the pantheon of extravaganza is to be called &quot;Holy Qur&apos;an Park&quot;. The general projects department at the Dubai municipality announced that the park had been designed &quot;from an Islamic perspective to introduce the miracles of Qur&apos;an through a variety of surprises for the visitors&quot;. Designs include an outdoor theatre, fountains, a lake, walking and biking tracks, a children&apos;s play area, Umrah corner and &quot;areas for showing the miracles of the Qur&apos;an.&quot; The whole project is characteristic of the emirate&apos;s commodification of everything. It&apos;s a project that appeases and attracts no one. If tourists are religious enough to want to come to Dubai and eschew its other attractions in order to execute a mock mini-pilgrimage in the &quot;Umrah corner&quot;, chances are they won&apos;t be enamoured of its circus-like nature.It appears that the park is an excuse to build an area set back from the rest of the city&apos;s charms, but the religious subject is too vague, too tenuous. One of the features of the park is reportedly a series of gardens bearing the fruit and vegetables mentioned in the Qur&apos;an, in order to &quot;stimulate people to think why these were mentioned&quot;. The park is symptomatic of a dispiriting focus on the spectacle as opposed to the history and antiquity of Islam and cultural legacy in general. Saudi Arabian authorities busy themselves with erecting malls and gigantic clock towers on sites where real estate is at a premium, while tearing down historical sites of great import in order to clear space. And when there are projects that seek to further cultural causes, they are usually along the lines of the gauche replica of the Guggenheim Museum of Modern Art in Abu Dhabi, which aims to transform the city into the &quot;Paris of the Middle East&quot;. If Dubai wants to develop retain a regional and cultural identity, the way forward is to use its resources to encourage the preservation of its heritage and architecture, and tap into the art and history of the wider region \u2013 not to build mini-golf versions of religious pilgrimage. The Holy Qur&apos;an Park is a classic case of not knowing your market. Dubai is the anti-Mecca of the Arab world. It&apos;s why tourists from the region go there.

Not this time. The clashes that have erupted in the southern city of Sidon mark a new phase in the country&apos;s slide towards the unknown. A series of battles between hardline Sunni groups and the Lebanese army are a direct challenge to the authority of the fragile state. But more worrying than the clashes in Sidon is a growing view among Sunni groups across the region that the Lebanese state is giving cover to Hezbollah as it shores up the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria. As Hezbollah \u2013 an exclusively Shia militia \u2013 has expanded its role in Syria, regional Sunni leaders have vowed to punish both the group and its backers. And rather than direct their anger solely at Hezbollah, this time the Lebanese state is in their sites. To the Gulf states, who have led the charge for vengeance, that means potentially expelling Lebanese citizens who they allege are connected to Hezbollah in some way. There are deepening fears, however, that this could amount to a collective punishment aimed at a Lebanese diaspora that sends home around $8bn (\u00a35.2bn) a year from Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Qatar alone. To those a little closer to home, like the Salafist Sheikh Ahmed al-Assir, whose fighters have killed at least 20 Lebanese soldiers since Saturday, the call to account, led by the Gulf, means taking the fight to the Lebanese army \u2013 an institution regarded as the bedrock of the state, but one which defers to Hezbollah. In all the skirmishes to have taken place inside Lebanon&apos;s borders over the past two years, especially in the northern city of Tripoli, the national army has played a bit part at best. Its troops have often watched on as gun-fights have erupted between factions. Assir&apos;s thinking is the same; Lebanon \u2013 not just Hezbollah \u2013 must pay a price for what is going on in Syria. If, as the group&apos;s leader, Hassan Nasrallah, suggests, he has joined the battle in Lebanon&apos;s name, his opponents have a new, and easier, address where they can direct their anger. As well as running a heavily armed militia, Hezbollah has also effectively run the Lebanese government for more than two years, after a political bloc it leads ousted former prime minister Saad Hariri in January 2011. Hariri&apos;s support base both in and outside of Lebanon is predominantly Sunni. Assir, a figure with a small though well armed group of followers, had been a vehement critic of Hezbollah well before its role in Syria was exposed. Ever since, however, he had become more strident in sectarian rhetoric. He now finds himself holed up with around 100 supporters, vowing to fight to the death, while a volatile region watches. Assir is not the only Sunni cleric to be raging against Hezbollah and the Shia sect in general. A meeting in Cairo 10 days ago of the region&apos;s most influential Sunni clergy called unambiguously for followers to join a jihad in Syria against both the Assad regime and its Shia supporters. The call to arms was a response to Nasrallah&apos;s speech on 25 May, in which he acknowledged his group&apos;s large-scale role in the border town of Qusair. His tone was perceived by some in the Sunni world as a direct challenge. And, ever since, an already grave situation in Syria, Iraq and Lebanon has been steadily worsening. Lebanese identity, only tenuously tied to the notion of nation state even in the best of times, is lurching ever closer to sect. In Iraq&apos;s Anbar province, Sunni resentment at the Shia-dominated government in Baghdad is palpable and an insurgency is again raging. All the while, a potent form of sectarianism appears to be calcifying well beyond the Levant. In Egypt, four Shias were killed and dozens wounded when their small community was stormed on Sunday.

The technique is of particular use in detecting the use of anabolic steroids, which have been at the centre of two separate drug-abuse scandals in recent months. Anabolic steroids are a more pernicious threat to the integrity of racing than many other performance-enhancing substances such as bicarbonate &quot;milkshakes&quot; or painkillers, because the extra muscle growth and general wellbeing that their use promotes can continue to improve performance many weeks or even months after the steroid itself has left the horse&apos;s system. The hair in a horse&apos;s mane or tail, however, can provide evidence of the substances in its body throughout the time that the hair has taken to grow. As a result, tests on hair samples could prove invaluable in detecting sustained use of steroids, such as that conducted by the disgraced former trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni at the Godolphin-owned Moulton Paddocks stable in Newmarket earlier this year. &quot;At HFL [Horseracing Forensic Laboratory] Sport Science there is a team whose role is to constantly research methods of improving our sampling techniques,&quot; Robin Mounsey, the BHA&apos;s media manager, said on Monday, &quot;and, if it was deemed an effective method of testing and of benefit to achieving our objectives, then the introduction of hair samples is a possibility. It has been explored in the past and could be incorporated to our rules and procedures in the future.&quot; In all, 22 horses at Moulton Paddocks tested positive for either ethylestranol or stanozolol, both of which are banned anabolic steroids, during the BHA investigation into Zarooni&apos;s doping programme. The Dubai-born trainer was found to have been conducting the most extensive steroid-doping programme that British racing has seen. On 25 April Zarooni was banned from racing for eight years and all 22 horses are barred from competition for six months from the date of their positive test. This, according to the BHA&apos;s veterinary advice, is the length of time over which the performance-enhancing effect of steroids may persist. However, the 22 positive tests included seven for stanozolol when the entire string of nearly 200 horses at Moulton Paddocks was drug-tested by the BHA nearly three weeks after it had initially found 12 positives in a sample of 45 horses. The seven additional positives included Improvisation, a winner at the Craven meeting in April, who had not been tested after his victory even though the BHA was already aware of a significant number of positive results from the Zarooni stable. Fire Blaze, another winner at the Craven meeting, was not subject to a post-race test either, and was negative in the wholesale testing at Moulton Paddocks a couple of weeks later. However, as a filly, she would have been more likely to be doped with ethylestranol, which clears the system in a week, rather than stanozolol, which can persist for up to three. Fire Blaze finished unplaced in the Queen Mary Stakes at Royal Ascot last week. The testing of hair samples could have provided the BHA with a much clearer picture of the extent and duration of Zarooni&apos;s doping activities. It could also provide evidence of steroid use on horses from foreign jurisdictions, such as Australia and the United States, which do not adopt Britain&apos;s zero-tolerance approach to steroids but send runners to major festival meetings such as Royal Ascot. Any introduction of hair-sample testing is likely to depend on cost. In the wake of the Zarooni scandal Paul Bittar, the BHA&apos;s chief executive, said that &quot;the stakeholders in British racing can&apos;t have it both ways. They can&apos;t constantly demand that the BHA makes really significant cuts to its budgets, which has to impact on all of its operations, yet expect that at the same time we will maintain a world-leading volume of testing.&quot; In the battle against drugs which can continue to corrupt the sport long after all traces have left a horse&apos;s system, however, hair-sample tests may prove to be a weapon that the sport cannot afford to be without.", "title": "Testing horsehair samples for steroids to be considered by BHA", "sentences": ["The Dubai-born trainer was found to have been conducting the most extensive steroid-doping programme that British racing has seen."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-24T19:02:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/guardianwitness-blog/2013/jun/25/fast-pet-readers-videos", "tags": ["Pets"], "article": "From rapid rodents to darting dogs, we asked you to share your photos and videos of fast pets.

It was no great surprise that Warrington and Wigan served up such a classic on Monday night, although Wigan&apos;s ability to compete so strongly despite the absence of so many key players spoke volumes yet again for the depth of talent at the club and in the town. But Castleford&apos;s 30-28 win against Hull in the Friday night televised match was just as exciting. Hull KR had an equally thrilling, and unpredictable, triumph against Catalan Dragons in Toulouse, and the impressive 14,858 gate at the Stade Ernest Wallon boosted the aggregate attendance to 62,268 on a weekend when four of the biggest crowd-pullers \u2013 Wigan, Leeds, Hull and St Helens \u2013 were playing away. It would also seem to have strengthened the case for Toulouse as the base for a second French Super League club under the revised structure that will be introduced from 2015. 2) Giant strides Huddersfield claimed their third win of the season against Leeds to consolidate their position in the top three. If the coach of the year award is determined by exceeding pre-season expectations, then surely Paul Anderson is a shoo-in. A quick word, too, for Ken Davy, whose huge but low-profile financial investment has allowed the Giants to establish themselves among the elite. Could this finally be the year when they win a major trophy \u2013 which would be their first since claret and gold ribbons adorned the Championship in the spring of 1962? 3) Boys of summer Talking of end-of-season gongs, Eddie Hemmings nominated Ben Crooks as a strong contender for the young player of the year award in commentary at the Cas-Hull game \u2013 well before the rangy 20-year-old centre had completed his first four-try haul with his dad, Lee, watching from the open terrace at the railway end of Wheldon Road. By all accounts Crooks has had a terrific season, although the way he was exposed defensively by Rangi Chase in the second half put a realistic context on some of the premature demands for Crooks to be included in the England squad. Tom Lineham, his strapping wing partner who was such a bonus find for Hull last season, must also be in the running, and Warrington&apos;s ball-playing back-row Ben Currie came of age with the key role he played in their win against Wigan. Kieran Dixon is worth a shout for the quantity and quality of tries the young Londoner has scored for the Broncos this season, and Morgan Escare has made a major impact for Catalans since being handed a chance in the full-back shirt. Any other nominations? 4) Must do better So much for the good news. This is rugby league, so all silver linings must be accompanied by at least one black cloud. The dislocated hip suffered by Gareth Widdop in Melbourne&apos;s win against the Gold Coast on Monday seems likely to put a major dent in England&apos;s World Cup plans. Then there is the continued player drain to join Widdop in the National Rugby League, with confirmation expected shortly that Super League will be losing its brightest star of all, Sam Tomkins, to New Zealand Warriors. The aforementioned Hemmings, who is often criticised for acting as a propagandist rather than a commentator, made no effort to talk down what a major blow this would be to the national and international credibility of Super League. Surely this should be one of the major factors in the plans to restructure the game \u2013 to produce a more intense, streamlined, glamorous and lucrative competition whose clubs would have a better chance of retaining British league&apos;s top talent, and of recruiting stars from elsewhere. Does anyone seriously believe the latest proposals emanating from the Rugby Football League, and driven by the Super League clubs, do that, by extending the league season to 30 fixtures? Back to the drawing board, chaps. If you really want to make a difference, and give league a chance of the necessary relaunch, you&apos;re going to need something a good deal more radical \u2013 and radical doesn&apos;t mean complicated \u2013 than that. 5) New faces and old friends It&apos;s an abbreviated set this week for logistical reasons, so tackle five will bring together Apollo Perelini and Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson. Perelini, the former St Helens and Samoa prop, is now based in Dubai, and was therefore a natural target for Ben Bolger, the former London Broncos forward, in his attempts to establish league in the United Arab Emirates. He&apos;s agreed to coach a junior representative side for a fixture against Lebanon in September. Grey-Thompson has agreed to be the guest of honour at the Wheelchair World Cup final in Medway on Saturday 13 July \u2013 one of the five &quot;other&quot; league World Cups being played in England this summer before the main event in the autumn. Everything has gone pretty quiet on the latter front, although I&apos;m told that ticket sales continue to tick along nicely. The Festival action starts this Sunday, with the first two fixtures in the Armed Forces competition at the Colchester Garrison \u2013 Great Britain face New Zealand, and Australia take on the newcomers from Serbia. The Wheelchair World Cup begins next Wednesday in Kent, then the focus switches to more familiar rugby league territory in Yorkshire for the start of the student competition on Thursday. The women&apos;s and police competitions begin with an intriguing triple header in Dewsbury on Friday 5 July, when the police opener between Great Britain and Australia (kick-off 8pm) could see PC Sean Long (not that one) taking on the real Scott Donald and Robbie Mears. 6) Origin has everything covered Finally this week, just for Wednesday&apos;s second State of Origin clash in Sydney, a piece of merchandise that really does take the breath away.", "title": "Super League set of six: Castleford kicked off a long weekend of classics | Andy Wilson", "sentences": ["Perelini, the former St Helens and Samoa prop, is now based in Dubai, and was therefore a natural target for Ben Bolger, the former London Broncos forward, in his attempts to establish league in the United Arab Emirates."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-25T13:51:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/25/syria-oil-assad-rebels-tribes", "tags": ["Syria", "Middle East and North Africa", "Oil", "Commodities", "Gas", "Bashar al-Assad", "Energy", "Environment", "Arab and Middle East unrest"], "article": "A northern wind had been blowing since early morning, lifting a veil of dust that had blocked the sun and turned the sky the colour of ash. Abu Zayed was sitting on the porch of his unfinished concrete home, watching the storm build. He loved sandstorms. They reminded him of Dubai, where he had lived before the war. He admired the people there for turning a desert into a paradise. They had vision, he told his followers. Six months ago, he left the Gulf emirate to join the Syrian revolution, attending opposition conferences in Istanbul and Cairo, jostling for position on behalf of his father, the leading sheikh of a powerful tribe in eastern Syria. But Abu Zayed soon became disgusted with the bickering among the rebel leadership. &quot;There is an opposition council in every hotel lobby in Istanbul,&quot; he said. &quot;You can&apos;t distinguish them from the regime.&quot; Instead, like other disaffected tribal leaders, Abu Zayed returned home to his ancestral land and put his energy into building up his clan, taking control of his energy-rich ancestral lands. Most of the oil and gas fields in eastern Syria lie idle or pump meagre quantities that are refined using primitive techniques to generate a pittance, but Abu Zayed&apos;s land has a huge gas plant. It stands less than a mile from his home. His father had chosen him out his 40 brothers to look after the plant because he was seen as a man of vision. The war had given him a chance to realise his dream: to build an oil-fuelled emirate. The hard edges of Syria&apos;s frontlines \u2013 dogmatic, revolutionary, Islamist or pure murderously sectarian \u2013 almost melt away outside the oilfields. New lines emerge pitting tribesmen against battalions, Islamists against everyone else, and creating sometimes surreal lines of engagement, where rebels help maintain government oil supplies in return for their villages being spared from bombardment and being allowed to siphon oil for themselves. &quot;There is chaos now,&quot; Abu Zayed said. &quot;The Free Syrian Army is chasing loot, and they don&apos;t care about civilians. The military councils are stealing the aid and then selling it. There are dozens of battalions here, we don&apos;t even know who is manning a checkpoint at the end of the street. Some people are saying the days of Bashar [al-Assad] were better, that the opposition has betrayed the people. &quot;But we can organise this situation,&quot; he said. &quot;Look at this gas plant, it&apos;s under our control. Things are organised here and we can do the same for other oil and gas fields. &quot;Most of the people who control the oilfields around here are making about 5m Syrian pounds [\u00a332,000] a day. They exploit a field for a few weeks, but because of the chaos, another powerful cousin or battalion soon arrives to fight for it and take control of it. &quot;I tell these people to lease me the field for S\u00a310m a month. I collect all the fields under my control, bring in companies to exploit them properly and organise truck convoys to sell the gas to Turkey. Then we&apos;ll buy Patriot [missile] batteries and drones to protect the fields against the regime.&quot; His ambition did not stop there. &quot;Once you have economic power you can convene a council for the tribes here inside the country, and organise all the military units in one military council,&quot; he said. Using the old definition of tribal land from the French colonial era, before the Syrian republic and its socialist laws that smashed feudal property, each tribe is now claiming ownership of the fields that lie in its wajeh (tribal territory). As the Syrian regime has crumbled, society in the desert east has fallen back on the tribes. &quot;Even [al-Qaida affiliate] Jabhat al-Nusra can&apos;t do anything against us,&quot; said Abu Zayed. &quot;They try to get fields but they can&apos;t. Not Nusra, not even the Americans could take these fields from us with all the weapons we have now.&quot; He stood up and walked to the edge of the porch, the slow, deliberate, short-stepped walk of the Gulf &quot;nobility&quot;, swaying slightly from side to side. He wore his keffiyeh [scarf] and dishdasha [robe] not in the style of the Syrian tribesmen but like the rich Sunnis of the Gulf. Our land, our gas plant He led me to a gleaming BMW 4x4 at the front of the house. Two gunmen jumped into the back seats, their presence just a precaution: there was no fighting in these parts, no shelling or air raids, only the wind blowing and the approaching sandstorm. At the gates of the plant, four fighters standing guard hurriedly opened the gates. Once inside, Abu Zayed stepped out of his car and stood in front of the modern factory with its metallic chimneys, spherical storage tanks and eternally burning flames, like a benevolent ruler inspecting the latest achievement of his nation. A few shafts of light escaped the sand veil shrouding the sun and danced wildly in the sky, bouncing off the chimneys and throwing coloured shadows at the walls. &quot;This is a top-class factory,&quot; he said. &quot;They built all these factories on our land and only 10 guards and two cooks from our area worked here. The rest all came from the cities. Now it&apos;s over. This is ours. &quot;This plant makes S\u00a310m a day. We protect it and we wouldn&apos;t let anyone steal anything from here. We get gas and electricity from the plant and we sell the petrol that it produces.&quot; Three engineers in blue overalls were walking about the perimeter of the factory inspecting some damaged warehouses. One of them broke away from the group and walked briskly to greet the sheikh. &quot;Everything is going well,&quot; the broad-shouldered engineer reported to Abu Zayed. &quot;But we shouldn&apos;t produce any more LPG [cooking gas]. We need it all pumped out today; I want to keep the tanks empty.&quot; A shadow of annoyance flickered across Abu Zayed&apos;s face. The cooking gas was very important to him, as some of it was pumped to a nearby gas plant under the control of Jabhat al-Nusra to keep its fighters happy. The rest was bottled and sold in the market. The engineer continued with his technical report to his new boss: &quot;I am pumping 4.5m cubic metres of gas into the main gas grid. That&apos;s enough electricity for five times the needs of [the province of] Deir el-Zour.&quot; Who controls the main grid? &quot;The government,&quot; said the engineer, matter of factly. He had a weightlifter&apos;s physique but looked exhausted, with two very dark circles surrounding his small eyes and seemingly covering most of his face. &quot;The regime wants production regardless of who is in control. I pump gas to the government and give the LPG gas to the terrorists,&quot; he said, only half joking. &quot;I tell the regime everything, I tell them that the Jufra field is under the control of Nusra, that the tribes have taken over the wells or have looted them. But the regime officials don&apos;t want to listen, they just want production. If we reduce production, they go mad. They tell me to send them my LPG production and I tell them the locals take that, so they shout at me. I tell them if they don&apos;t like it I will shut the plant, so then they shut up. In their heads I think the regime still consider themselves the masters. But where are they? Where are they to protect the facilities? &quot;I pump around 5m cubic metres of gas a day into the system that feeds the regime&apos;s power stations. Even though the regime is rationing the electricity to certain cities, if I stop pumping, the system will collapse. In the end he [Assad] doesn&apos;t mind dealing with rebels if they give him electricity.&quot; A wall of dust loomed from behind the chimneys and moved like a giant wave over the plant, engulfing everything. Only the flame remained visible, and, as if by magic, all the lights of the factory turned on. Caravan of tankers The engineer invited us into his 1980s-style office. Only half the plant&apos;s workforce showed up each day, he said; the rest had all deserted. When he asked them why, he said, they told him that it wasn&apos;t only them and that he should look at what had happened to the rest of the country. &quot;I produce 120MW of electricity. I give this to the rebel areas because if I shut electricity off they will attack me tomorrow, and if I stop pumping gas to the government they will bomb all of this tomorrow. &quot;I feel like I am sitting on a bomb. The rebels fight at night,&quot; he said with a look of rebuke towards his new master &quot;over their shares of the gasoline. They don&apos;t use Kalashnikovs any more but anti-aircraft guns. If one bullet got in the gas tanks, the whole area would explode. That&apos;s why I try to keep them empty.&quot; As we drove back through the storm, Abu Zayed tried to explain why is he was still pumping gas to the regime. &quot;If we don&apos;t pump, the regime will attack the plant, which is providing us with gas and electricity,&quot; he said. &quot;The engineer is a very honest and patriotic man. He stayed when others had fled. I brought him to my house and told him: &apos;Don&apos;t wag your tail and try to send fuel to others, this is our land and you have your factory here, fine, but it&apos;s ours now.&apos;&quot; By nightfall the sandstorm had moved on, leaving everything covered in a thick brown layer. A cold wind was blowing over the porch, where more men had gathered. Beyond it, a long trail of headlights followed the narrow road linking the highway to the gas plant.     Syrian rebels pump crude oil from a well under their control to dealers who will either export it or resell it to peasants to refine it themselves.  Photograph: Ghaith Abdul-Ahad    This caravan of tankers and pick-up trucks was heading to the plant to fill up with petrol. As they did every night, tribesmen and their kinsmen from local rebel battalions congregated at the edge of the plant, where the pumping station is located, to scoop out the precious petrol that would be resold a few miles down the road to oil traders. The tribesmen brought heavy 23mm anti-aircraft guns mounted on pick-up trucks as a precaution, should any disagreement arise over each group&apos;s quota. An old Russian tank stood like a muscled bouncer, ready to intervene. Abu Zayed walked around the porch striking deals as the buyers sought his influence to increase their quotas, reduce those of other tribes, or buy tanks of cooking gas. It was the Syrian desert&apos;s equivalent of a London or New York club where major deals are negotiated. Two commanders were sitting on the porch, watching the trail of lights and lamenting the state of revolution in theatrical voices. Each of them ruled a considerable oil fiefdom. &quot;Oh Hassan, what has become of us?&quot; asked a commander with a very thick black moustache. &quot;Where is the beauty of our early jihad? In the first days \u2026 before the damn oil came and everyone started building their fortunes, and leaving the fight.&quot; Hassan, a notorious bandit-cum-rebel who had become one of the richest men in Deir el-Zour, replied: &quot;I swear to Allah that with the revenue from my oil I am equipping and organising a battalion that will go fight in the city.&quot; &quot;Oh Hassan, this is why Allah is not rewarding me with martyrdom yet,&quot; said the commander with the moustache. &quot;As long as the city is there waiting for us, we fight.&quot; Oil fuels division Hassan said the oil was dividing the tribes. &quot;An oilfield belongs to the ancestral land of a tribe, but which clan? Which family? Which brothers? This is why everyone is arming and this is why there are daily clashes over oilfields and why a 23mm anti-aircraft gun has become a weapon of necessity.&quot; Listening to the tribesmen lamenting the loss of their Jerusalem while busy making fortunes from the oil was Ahmad, a tall, athletic young man with a thick shock of hair always covered in gel that was now caked with dust. A barber by trade in his native Deir el-Zour and a corporal until he defected, he had a kind, self-effacing smile. Ahmad&apos;s battalion commander had looted an oil tanker, which was then leased to Abu Zayed. The revenue from the lease supported a battalion of 200 men fighting on the frontline. Ahmad was the logistics officer in charge of collecting the rent, buying ammunition and weapons, and feeding the men. &quot;With the weapons you have collected, you could have liberated the city of Deir el-Zoura long time ago,&quot; Ahmad told Abu Zayed in his musical accent. &quot;You people of the city always blame the countryside,&quot; replied Abu Zayed. &quot;You received weapons that would have liberated the city a few times. While we fight, you sit playing cards at the cafes in the city. We did our duty and liberated the countryside. Now it&apos;s your turn.&quot; &quot;And most of the fighters in the city are countryside people, not from the city,&quot; he added. &quot;And yes, we have weapons but we have taken them with our hands. You sold your weapons.&quot; &quot;Have you seen the city? Ahmad replied. &quot;We have been hammered day and night by Katyushas [rocket launchers] but look at you sitting on the veranda enjoying a breeze, there we would have been dead by now. We are eating dried bread. We mix it with water and eat it. This oil is for everyone. It&apos;s not your oil to treat like your property.&quot; &quot;This oil is ours, not yours, not al-Qaida&apos;s \u2013 and no one, no matter how powerful, can take it from us. We have weapons to fight America if we want \u2013 even the regime can&apos;t take this back now. And who wants to eat dried bread any more? We want to sell oil and build houses.&quot; Everyone laughed. &quot;You should make the ministry of oil here in the new Syria,&quot; laughed one of the men. &quot;And what about the gas plant,&quot; said Ahmad. &quot;You don&apos;t think it&apos;s wrong that you are giving gas to the government that&apos;s shelling me 20km from here?&quot; The answer came back: &quot;If I don&apos;t give them gas, he will bomb this whole village from the face of earth.&quot; Later, on the frontline in Deir el-Zour, Ahmad told me how the new oil barons were draining the revolution of its strength in the east. &quot;Those oil lords, our version of warlords, they are the reason why we haven&apos;t won yet. They don&apos;t care if we all die here, they care about how much money they will make. &quot;They were with the regime and when they saw the regime collapsing decided to join the revolution. Now I don&apos;t recognise them as part of the revolution. I only see those around me on the frontlines as the real revolutionaries. The rest \u2013 they are mercenaries and they will be eradicated after the war.&quot;", "title": "Syria's oilfields create surreal battle lines amid chaos and tribal loyalties", "sentences": ["They reminded him of Dubai, where he had lived before the war."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-25T16:17:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/26/the-fiver-carlos-tevez", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "WE TAX YOUR PATIENCE Today&apos;s Fiver has, as you, our eagle-eyed reader, will no doubt have already noticed, been sent out three hours earlier than usual. There&apos;s a simple explanation for this: we&apos;ve relocated temporarily to Dubai for tax purposes on the advice of our successful city-boy cousin Rolled-Up \u00a350 Note Braces Buy Sell Buy Sell Convertible Front-Tail Extension Fiver, who incidentally has also [decidedly not \u2013 Fiver Lawyers] given Lionel Messi and 41 Italian clubs a few money-saving tips, though that&apos;s a story for another day. Anyway, five bells at our Dubai bureau equates to 2pm back home. That time difference is something we didn&apos;t factor into this caper, tell the truth, but we&apos;re not hanging around for another three hours just in case the rest of the afternoon sees a bankrupt Manchester United wound up in the courts, England&apos;s 1966 World Cup win struck off the record books due to a bribery scandal, or Plain Old John Terry announce her gender reassignment therapy. If it happens, it happens, we&apos;ll take our chances. Luckily a big story broke nice and early today, with Carlos Tevez finally taking his leave of Manchester a mere seven years after turning up in England and immediately deciding he wanted out. Manchester City have managed to extract nearly \u00a38m from Juventus, no mean feat considering the Italian champions are currently all over the shop, their gaff being one of many recently turned upside down by tax bobbies sniffing around a money-laundering racket. City will get additional bonuses too, should Juve manage to win a league title or two and keep qualifying for Big Cup, which they will, Italian football being as soul-crushingly predictable as anything on offer in England. Unless of course they get themselves demoted again, but we&apos;re great believers in humanity, so let&apos;s assume the best of folk. The deal may not be wholly clever for Tevez, who&apos;ll have to take a hit on his current salary of \u00a3198,000 a week, but it&apos;s a pretty good one for City, who have trousered a fair fee for a 29-year-old player with only one year remaining on his contract, and will save an additional \u00a317m in projected wages and bonuses. They&apos;ll try to spend the cash on Robert Lewandowski, if the Dortmund striker can be persuaded to bodyswerve Bayern Munich, or Edinson Cavani, if the Napoli man sees sense and drops the preposterous \u00a3300,000-a-week wage demands. City have certainly planned this one out well! Unlike the Fiver, who has saved \u00a37.34 in taxes but is facing a \u00a31,800 bill for flights to the UAE, \u00a31,000 for office space rental, and \u00a37.35 for sundries such as staples, tea, and quaffable turps.

The sculptures adorn the top of the orange, silver and blue &quot;Pomegranate Towers&quot; apartment block, one of the more garishly ostentatious buildings thrown up by Kabul&apos;s nouveau riche but also an unlikely token of hope in city threatened by a tenacious insurgency as foreign troops leave. &quot;I get a lot more confidence from looking at these awful buildings. It kills me as an architect, but from an economic point of view it seems to be quite a vote of confidence,&quot; said Jolyon Leslie, a South African with several decades experience of restoration and urban planning in Afghanistan. &quot;Everyone is talking about the tide going out economically, but everyone is still investing in these fancy buildings \u2026 they are making a long-term bet the city will stay stable enough to earn it back.&quot; Builder Faizullah Barakzai&apos;s tower, which pays tribute to his hometown of Kandahar, famous for its autumn crop of sweet, juicy pomegranates, is part of a building boom that has transformed the Afghan capital in little more than a decade.     Faizullah Barakzai (right) confers with a worker inside the top-floor apartment of the Pomegranate Tower. Photograph: Joel van Houdt for The Guardian    &quot;There is a lot of negative propaganda, but I think that eventually the rich Afghans who take money out of the country will regret it,&quot; Barakzai said after a tour of his glitzy penthouse suite. Once a sleepy mountain town of low-rise homes, Kabul&apos;s smartest areas are now a grid of multicoloured, multi-storey family palaces studded with mirrors and stucco, one even boasting a rooftop lion enclosure. The rich gather to celebrate their children&apos;s unions at opulent wedding halls, one guarded by golden elephants, another by a looming model of the Eiffel tower. There are bowling alleys, supermarkets crammed with imported clothes and food, and leisure centres with pools and saunas. The lavish lifestyle has been funded by an influx of foreign money and the proceeds from drugs, which have enriched a tiny elite while most of the country still grapples with desperate poverty, malnutrition, illiteracy and some of the lowest life expectancy in the world.     Emzee, a fashion shop at the Majid mall in the Shar-e Naw (new city) area of Kabul. Photograph: Joel van Houdt for The Guardian    Nato combat troops will be gone by the end of 2014 and as they head home, spending is shrinking. There is widespread fear that Afghanistan faces economic collapse, a security vacuum and a repeat of the civil war that ripped the country apart in the 1990s. Rents and land prices in the capital have fallen as people hedge their bets and opt for more portable investments. That choice is made easier in a country where tracking of wealth is in its infancy, as evidenced by a former vice-president who once flew to a Gulf state with $52m (\u00a334m) in cash, according to a US diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks. Trust in the financial system was further undermined with the near-collapse of the top private lender Kabul Bank in 2010, amid a $900m corruption scandal, exposing a web of dubious assets including a clutch of villas in Dubai. Rather than experiencing a slowdown in its frenetic building sector, however, Kabul is increasingly overrun with precarious apartment blocks. Cement and brick walls climb ever higher in defiance of planning laws, frequent earthquakes and the threat of war. If cranes are a benchmark of economic growth, then this city is booming.     Early evening at the entrance to one of the most expensive wedding halls in Kabul, the City Star Hall. Photograph: Joel van Houdt for The Guardian    &quot;The phrase &apos;2014&apos; is a form of psychological warfare,&quot; said builder Hasan Ali Sakhizada, who has invested around $1m in a block of apartments for rent and sale, and a luxurious home. &quot;It&apos;s not going to have an effect on the property market, because people still need somewhere to live. &quot;Everyone says the Americans are leaving but they are not. They have invested too much in Afghanistan. The current problems are just politics by the US to help them negotiate their strategic pact [for a long-term military presence].&quot; The new buildings are a dramatic contrast to the muted colours and elaborate handicrafts that adorned the homes of Afghanistan&apos;s traditional elite, hidden behind high, plain walls. The new rich want their wealth on show. &quot;After we finished work on the pomegranates, someone driving past had a road accident because he was staring at them,&quot; Barakzai said with obvious pride. He has personally furnished the penthouse apartment, reached by a gold-lined lift, with plush leather furniture, ceilings swept with gilt and carving, shining parquet floors, cabinets of curios and statues backlit in neon pink, green and blue, and a television that responds to voice commands.

Photograph: Joel van Houdt for The Guardian    &quot;I wanted to make it as luxurious as possible,&quot; said Barakzai in a tiny office at the base of the tower, where staff drank sweet, milky coffee he swore was the best in Kabul, and cans of Red Bull. &quot;One of my dreams is that the homes which are mud will all be concrete and beautiful, like buildings in our neighbours India and Pakistan. In other countries there are a lot of tall buildings, so I wanted to do something similar for Afghanistan.&quot; The country&apos;s new rich may like to show off their wealth, but they are less keen about discussing where it came from. Barakzai said his apartment plot was built on family land that once held a bungalow and garden, building on a long family history of entrepreneurship. Funding came from advanced sales of apartments, he said, even though he put the average unit price at a modest $90,000, and admitted that his commercial empire now includes another construction site near Kabul&apos;s parliament and a wedding hall, hospital and supermarket in southern Kandahar.

Among the vehicles in the basement car park are those of a deputy provincial governor and a senior intelligence official, both among the new tenants of the 32 apartments. Their luxury armoured SUVs are a subtle boast of Barakzai&apos;s impressive neighbours, but may also hold a clue to one prop for the Kabul property boom as western cash dries up and an escalation of violence looms. &quot;It used to be you had a guest house where people could stay, and your wealth would be judged by the number of guests who could sit down to dinner,&quot; said Leslie. &quot;This is a latter-day way of dispensing patronage, because I&apos;m sure the tenants aren&apos;t paying full market rate.&quot; Additional reporting by Mokhtar Amiri", "title": "Kabul property boom confounds fears about Afghanistan's security", "sentences": ["Trust in the financial system was further undermined with the near-collapse of the top private lender Kabul Bank in 2010, amid a $900m corruption scandal, exposing a web of dubious assets including a clutch of villas in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-27T14:52:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jun/27/the-fiver-confederations-cup-brazil", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "NOT ONE OF THESE? Like that special lady who kept seeing the U2 guitarist in clouds, toast and pebble-dashed walls, top coaches look for an edge wherever they can find it. But with Spain looking mightier than a pen-and-sword multipack, Cesar Prandelli was struggling to find a weakness to exploit in Italy&apos;s Confederations Cup semi-final opponents. Until, that is, reports emerged this week of several Spanish players being robbed at their hotel when a game of str1p poker with a samba band and assorted other guests somehow went wrong. At last a chink of vulnerability from the relentless Iberian ball-busters! But no sooner had Prandelli begun figuring out what formation could best expose Spain&apos;s apparent inability to concentrate while tracking cards, removing clothes and cavorting with open-minded funsters, than the Italian manager was a foiled like a shady old theme park owner at the end of every episode of Scooby Doo. Because it turns out the story was not true. &quot;The Real Federacion Espanola de Futbol denies completely the news spread by a Brazilian media outlet that infringes upon the good name of the Spanish national side and the honour and professionalism of its players,&quot; stormed a Spanish statement that the Fiver is happy to accept was written by a fully-clothed official who would not be distracted by n@ked revellers if he were ever to play cards, which doubtless he would never do. &quot;Six players of the national team were the subject of a burglary in the team hotel in Recife during the Spain-Uruguay game,&quot; continued the thoroughly upstanding statement. &quot;This fact was duly reported to the Brazilian police. Later there has emerged a series of allegations about our players, which the RFEF completely denies and repudiates deeply because they damage the honour of the players and their families and friends.&quot; This powerful rebuttal sent Prandelli back to the drawing board, still wondering how his team could possibly beat the European and world champions without Mario Balotelli and with Andrea Pirlo not fully fit. Then he hit upon another plan: clutch at straws! &quot;We are the only team to embarrass Spain,&quot; he grabbed selectively. &quot;We have played three matches against them: we won in Bari in 2011, drew in the Euro 2012 group stages and lost badly in the final. But this will be a completely different match. We have the weapons to fix that if we have courage and personality to do them harm.&quot; Now there&apos;s a statement to be doubtful about.

FIVER LETTERS &quot;On hearing that Macclesfield Town had offered a 10-minute appearance to one lucky supporter for the princely sum of \u00a320,000, I was struck by the shortsightedness of their strategy \u2013 why limit it to one 10-minute appearance across a whole season? If \u00a320,000 is the going rate for a minimum of 10 minutes, and assuming they sold every minute of the league season (including three subs per game) then, if my maths is right, which it probably isn&apos;t, they could net a cool \u00a312.88m.

His colt ended a seven-year run of success for the trainer Aidan O&apos;Brien, Bolger&apos;s protege, and the race was a disaster for those who tried to buy their way to Classic glory, with two horses recently sold for undisclosed sums, believed to run into seven figures, finishing last and second-last. Advance publicity sold this as a rematch between the first three home in the Epsom Derby four weeks previously but that form was left looking suspect. O&apos;Brien&apos;s Ruler Of The World, the Epsom winner, was a one-paced fifth after sweating up in the paddock, while Libertarian, bought by Godolphin after finishing runner-up at Epsom, was the first beaten. Sugar Boy, purchased by a member of Dubai&apos;s Maktoum family, was the only horse to finish behind Libertarian. Only Galileo Rock upheld the Epsom form, improving his position by one place to be second this time. Punters here did well to send off Trading Leather as short as 6-1 after he was beaten by Libertarian at York last month. But Bolger has earned many fans for his exploits with horses like St Jovite, who won this 21 years ago, and Dawn Approach, the winner of this year&apos;s English 2,000 Guineas. &quot;It doesn&apos;t get any better than this,&quot; Bolger said. His wife, Jackie, owner of the horse, said her husband had always promised to train an Irish Derby winner in her colours. The Bolgers bred the winner and he was ridden by their son-in-law, Kevin Manning. Asked if he had considered sending Trading Leather over for the English Derby, Bolger said: &quot;I did, yeah. He would have gone to Epsom if Dawn Approach hadn&apos;t been going but I couldn&apos;t run the two of them in the one race. &quot;I don&apos;t normally do that anyway but it would have been counter-productive for Dawn Approach for him to be there, because he [Trading Leather] likes a strong gallop, whereas we weren&apos;t sure about the stamina of Dawn Approach. &quot;As it turned out anyway, stamina wasn&apos;t the issue. Other things went wrong.&quot; That was a reference to Dawn Approach bolting to the front of the field at halfway before fading tamely. But Dawn Approach atoned with a Group One win at Royal Ascot and Bolger now has two horses with claims to being the pick of their generation and a long list of major prizes on the target list. Bolger was circumspect about outlining the rest of the campaign for Trading Leather but mentioned Ascot&apos;s King George at the end of July, York&apos;s Juddmonte International in August and the Irish Champion Stakes in September. He was more emphatically ambitious about Dawn Approach. &quot;The Sussex Stakes and the Jacques le Marois would be very much on the cards and then the QEII at the end of the year. My personal hope would be that he&apos;d line up for all three and win all three.&quot; As a fast-ground horse with the speed for 10 furlongs, Trading Leather might be thought a natural for America&apos;s Breeders&apos; Cup at the end of the year but Bolger was not keen. &quot;I don&apos;t tend to go much there because I nearly get arrested any time I go there,&quot; he said, apparently alluding to the current murder trial in Boston of James Bulger, accused of being an organised crime boss. O&apos;Brien said of Ruler Of The World: &quot;Maybe he&apos;s had three quick enough runs. I suppose he was a bit warmer [before the race] than he was in Epsom, wasn&apos;t he? &quot;I&apos;m not going to make excuses. We&apos;ll go back to the drawing board. We&apos;ll give him a break now and see again. He deserves a break.&quot; Earlier, O&apos;Brien had revealed that last year&apos;s Irish Derby winner, Camelot, may have run his final race, having been beaten on four of his five outings since. &quot;He&apos;s a very important horse to us and he&apos;s not one we want to take any risks with,&quot; the trainer said. &quot;The last day at Royal Ascot, he obviously hadn&apos;t come back to his best and, while the Eclipse [at Sandown next Saturday] is still an option, retirement is something we might have to consider as well. The spark was never there after his run in the Irish Derby last year. He had a tough race there on testing ground and then had that problem over the winter.&quot; &quot;That problem&quot; was life-threatening colic, necessitating surgery in October. O&apos;Brien has repeatedly warned that horses do not always retain their ability after such a setback. Then again, Camelot won a Group Three on his reappearance and did not run badly when second and then fourth to Al Kazeem on his two most recent starts. An alternative narrative for his career trajectory is that he was the pick of a poor generation when winning the Guineas and the Derby last year and that his limitations have since been exposed. Either way, it is understandable that his connections are not attracted by a third clash with Al Kazeem, the Eclipse favourite. Camelot still has his fans, however, and he came within a neck of being the first Triple Crown winner since 1970 when runner-up in September&apos;s St Leger. He was beaten only by Encke, who tested clean on the day but was found to have anabolic steroids in his system in May and was banned from racing for six months. Tominator became the first horse since 1978 to win two Northumberland Plates when finishing strongly to collar Oriental Fox at Newcastle. He was able to overcome repeated trouble in running under Graham Lee, who also won a Group Three sprint on the card aboard Jack Dexter. Lee, a Grand National winner in his former career as a jump jockey, spoke of the pleasure that a Plate victory gave him after so many years on the northern circuit: &quot;I always wanted to win an Eider Chase here and I managed that on Philson Run, and I desperately wanted to win a Fighting Fifth, but Harchibald beat me when I was on Inglis Drever. This is a very nice substitute.&quot; Tominator was with the late Reg Hollinshead when landing his first Plate in 2011 but was sent to Jonjo O&apos;Neill in the autumn, primarily with a jumping campaign as the aim. O&apos;Neill praised Hollinshead&apos;s work with the horse and thanked him for leaving &quot;a bit in the tank for me&quot;.", "title": "Trading Leather gains decisive victory in Irish Derby at Curragh", "sentences": ["Sugar Boy, purchased by a member of Dubai&apos;s Maktoum family, was the only horse to finish behind Libertarian."], "publicationDate": "2013-06-29T18:49:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jun/29/paralympic-grand-prix-birmingham-team-gb", "tags": ["ParalympicsGB", "David Weir", "Hannah Cockroft", "Sport", "Jonnie Peacock"], "article": "They were back, the &quot;superhumans&quot; of last summer, and on a warm day in Birmingham the memories of what Great Britain&apos;s paralympians achieved at London 2012 felt fresh once more. In the first major domestic meeting for members of that medal-grabbing team since the Paralympics there were more victories and, yet again, it was Jonnie Peacock who took the breath away. The 20-year-old followed up on his triumph in the men&apos;s Paralympic T44 100m final with another stunning win here, coming home in the T43/44 sprint in a season&apos;s best 10.90sec, five-hundreths of a second shy of his world record. The sense of anticipation was palpable among the 5,000-strong crowd as Peacock positioned himself on the start line for what was the penultimate event of this International Paralympic Committee Grand Prix final. There was silence followed by thunderous roars as the champion got off to a blistering start and controlled the race from therein. Even the disqualification of the American David Prince for a false start did not distract the man with the shock of blond hair. &quot;Five months of training and I can come up with that, not really much to complain about,&quot; said Peacock, who has changed his coach, training base and blades since the Paralympics. &quot;I&apos;m in good form for Lyon [where the World Championships will be held this month]. We&apos;re working on getting better and better.&quot; Peacock&apos;s upbeat mood was in contrast to the final&apos;s other standout star, David Weir. The man who lit up London 2012 with four gold medals could only secure second place in the T54 1500m final, coming a second behind the world record holder Marcel Hug, of Switzerland. Weir was fifth at the bell of the final event and despite a late surge could not catch Hug. He crossed the line in 3min 28.01sec. &quot;I&apos;ve only been training for a week so today was always going to be tough,&quot; the 34-year-old said. &quot;I&apos;m sure I can get stronger.&quot; For Weir this meeting was about more than personal success. In the aftermath of his stunning Paralympic feats he said the &quot;biggest challenge post London 2012 was keeping momentum going and ensuring there is a legacy in place to develop Paralympic sport.&quot; That was the aim, too, of the IPC when they decided to launch the Grand Prix Series, with this final following on from six others meetings, the first of which took place in Dubai four months ago. The crowd may not have managed to even half-fill the 12,700-seater stadium but they were nevertheless a sizeable number given this was a paralympic event taking place at a venue that in 24 hours&apos; time would host Mo Farah and Greg Rutherford in a Diamond League meeting. Proof, no doubt, that the achievements of Britain&apos;s paralympians have not been forgotten. The final began awfully. Richard Whitehead, who won gold in the men&apos;s Paralympic T42 200m final was disqualified for a false start. Moments later it was announced Shelly Woods, who won silver in the women&apos;s T54 marathon in London, would not take part in the T53/54 1,500m final due to a broken wheel. Suddenly spectators who had been cheerily bashing their air-filled orange &quot;thunder sticks&quot; were reduced to moans and groans. &quot;It&apos;s one of those things,&quot; said Whitehead of his false start. &quot;I felt I needed a quicker start than I got in London but I obviously went too quick. I&apos;ve learned my lesson.&quot; Whitehead apologised to the crowd for his aberration but they had forgotten soon enough following barnstorming performances from two other Paralympic heroes.

Sophie Kamlish stormed home in the women&apos;s T43-46 100m final in 13.56sec and Peter Blake, the Paralympic T36 400m silver medallist, secured a personal best of 2min 06.39sec in the men&apos;s T36/37 800m final.

Disappointed because whenever I am in proximity to swimming facilities I feel a weary obligation to use them. I do not enjoy swimming, a solitary and monotonous form of exercise which makes my nose ache and, worse still, denies me the chance to talk. Sadly, however, it is the only physical activity for which I have demonstrated any natural affinity and has as such become the only thing standing between me and my imminent jellification. It is a cruel cosmic joke that the one sport I care nothing about is the only one I might have been any good at. In my fantasies I have a Wasim Akram-esque ability to spear inswinging yorkers at batsmen&apos;s feet; I make jinking runs from full-back, stepping round second-rows and leaving men three times my size bewildered by my dummies. If I were choosing a sporting quality to complement my innate abilities, meanwhile, I would ask for decent hand-eye coordination, so that I could indulge in low-level archery or a spot of double-trap shooting or any sport which would indulge my natural inclination to stay very still and make as little corporeal effort as possible. But God has seen fit to bless me with none of these abilities; instead he has gifted me a pair of feet so large I can water ski on them, along with a workmanlike but surprisingly efficient breaststroke that leaves me grasping at the toes of the dawdlers in the medium lane. I swim in a state of perpetual anger. Unfortunately, that only makes me faster. If I feel I am trapped in the wrong sporting body, how much worse for the professional athletes who have spent their entire working lives in the same situation, by dint of either physical proclivities or environmental pressures. The England fast bowler Steve Harmison dreamed of playing for Newcastle United throughout his childhood but his hopes were stymied and, although being 6ft 4in turned out to have other uses, one could never shake the feeling that even when Harmy was bossing the stage at Lord&apos;s he would rather be putting a header past a goalie. It makes for the perfect premise for a body-swap movie with Phil Neville (Gerard Butler as Harmison, Rob Brydon as Neville). He admitted in March this year that the first thing he would do on retirement is get back to playing cricket. &quot;People sometimes fear retirement,&quot; he said, &quot;but I am looking forward to it because I can go and do something I love.&quot; And that, Everton, is what they call a burn. Usain Bolt has never made any secret of the fact he would rather be playing on the wing for Manchester United; at last year&apos;s Olympics his team-mate Yohan Blake admitted he itched to face Brett Lee and announced with typical modesty: &quot;I&apos;m a better cricketer than I am a runner.&quot; If all the sportsmen who wished they had been pro golfers had their way \u2013 from Viv Richards and Ricky Ponting to Nigel Mansell and Tim Henman \u2013 Dubai would long ago have run out of penthouses and the PGA Tour would be colonising the moon for practice greens. And then there are the sportsmen who do not even realise they are in the wrong sport. It has surely been apparent for some time \u2013 to most people, if not him \u2013 that Roger Federer is a frustrated polo player. The sooner he is released to share his sartorial smarts and slightly lordly manner with the horsey set, the happier he will be. And I cannot be the only person who can picture Tim Bresnan finding great fulfilment at the oche. This week, thanks to a flight cancellation and a 12-hour overnighter in Washington Dulles airport, I had the kind of soul-baring conversation that two British strangers share only when under extreme duress in a foreign clime. It was 5am and I started chatting to Mark, the man queueing next to me, about the Lions tour. He explained how he had become a rugby player thanks solely to a black and white newspaper photo of Brian Moore, belting out the national anthem before the 1991 World Cup semi-final between England and Scotland. &quot;I&apos;d never watched rugby,&quot; Mark said, &quot;but that picture stirred something in me that football never had.&quot; And so a 20-year\u2013old goalie whose father had been a semi-pro footballer and whose school playing fields had not even stretched to a pair of uprights, walked into his local club that very weekend and asked for a game. Within a month he had swapped his nicotine-stained goalkeeping gloves for a roll of ear tape, his Chris Waddle mullet for a grade 2, and was a fixture in the second row. He gave up the &quot;Es and wizz&quot;, and met a beautiful, rugby-player wife. &quot;In essence,&quot; said Mark, &quot;Brian Moore is responsible for every good decision I made in my life. I&apos;ve always wanted to thank him for that.&quot; Mark&apos;s story made me happy and not just for lightening a long dark night of air-travel-related misery. It was a welcome reminder of how precious sport can be. Yes, sport is an anthropologically useful outlet for aggressive behaviour; and yes, it is an ever more seedily commercialised form of mass entertainment. But it is also a gift from the gods. When you locate it, and use it, you are fulfilling a unique part of yourself.

It would be like calling the Place Vend\u00f4me a roundabout, or Versailles a country cottage. There is a scale of ambition when Lagerfeld creates for Chanel that is on a quite different level to that operated on by any other designer. (It is a different level, indeed, to the scale Lagerfeld operates on when he designs under his own name, or for Fendi.) And there is no doubt that it pays dividends: the Chanel atelier, where the haute couture dresses are made, has recently expanded to keep up with demand. In London, the brand recently opened a three-storey Bond Street flagship, complete with a giant art installation of dripping pearls. For his latest extravaganza, Lagerfeld recreated the shell of a burnt- or bombed-out theatre. Hidden within the Grand Palais was a full-sized theatre which guests entered to find the plush curtains drawn, the floor banked to allow all a clear view of the stage, the ceiling blasted away to allow sunlight to stream through from the domed glass roof of the Grand Palais. In between the rows of vintage wooden seats \u2013 to which the seat numbers of each guest had been screwed in tiny antiqued brass plaques \u2013 were prettily dishevelled piles of rubble. In the aisles, ushers handed out programmes from wicker ice-cream baskets. The effect of such elaborate, immersive scene-setting is that the audience experience is one of an almost dreamlike intensity. At many catwalk shows, the personality of the fashion designer is something glimpsed only briefly when he or she takes a bow; here, it was all around, heavy in the fake-brick-dust-laden air the audience breathed.     Karl Lagerfeld acknowledges applause at the Chanel show. Photograph: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images    The message of the collection, said Lagerfeld, was of the old world meeting the new. So the curtains opened to reveal a backdrop of a futuristic skyline, city landmarks from London, Dubai and Shanghai merging together. The tall, column silhouettes came in skyscraper shades of steel and iron, belts dropped to hip height to create a long straight line. The effect \u2013 especially when the sun caught the rows of tiny sequins, fracturing the light in the way that sunlight catches on glass \u2013 was that the models looked like walking versions of the buildings on the theatrical backdrop. Lagerfeld never deigns to be pinned down to just one era, or even two. The dropped waists and spaghetti straps were slightly 1920s, while the squared-off hats and striped-on makeup had something of the 1980s London Blitz club look about them. But the real point was the notion of one era imagining a future one. So there were elements of Star Trek, and visual references to Fritz Lang&apos;s 1927 silent film classic Metropolis. Lagerfeld, who has a collection of memorabilia of the film, took it as inspiration for a couture show two years ago, and there were echoes of that collection here, in the gunmetal greys, and angular hairstyles. Above all, of course, this was an event firmly rooted in 2013. Two shows were held in order to accommodate not one but two front row special guests. Rihanna held court for the paparazzi at the first show, Kristen Stewart did the honours at the second, without any need for an unseemly battle for celebrity supremacy, and with a corresponding doubling of publicity for all. Everyone&apos;s a winner \u2013 especially, of course, Karl.", "title": "Karl Lagerfeld creates ruined theatre for Chanel haute couture show", "sentences": ["So the curtains opened to reveal a backdrop of a futuristic skyline, city landmarks from London, Dubai and Shanghai merging together."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-02T14:52:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/02/aidan-obrien-eclipse-stakes-mars", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Aidan O'Brien", "Camelot", "British Horseracing Authority", "Sport"], "article": "Mars appears likely to be the sole runner for Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s Ballydoyle stable in the Eclipse Stakes at Sandown on Saturday, bookmakers reported on Tuesday. The final shape of the race will only be known when the Irishman declares his hand and, as so often before, he is leaving it late to decide between his three entrants. If Mars lines up, he is likely to be ridden by Ryan Moore, as Joseph O&apos;Brien, the trainer&apos;s son and principal jockey, is too heavy to do the colt&apos;s allotted weight of 8st 10lb. If O&apos;Brien Jr were to ride in the Eclipse, it could only be on Declaration Of War or Camelot, the yard&apos;s other two entrants, so it is at least interesting that he has agreed to ride Fury for the Newmarket trainer William Haggas in another race on the card, indicating that he expects to be at Sandown. However, David Stevens, representing the bookmakers Coral, who sponsor the card, said: &quot;If the money&apos;s any guide, then Mars will be Ballydoyle&apos;s sole representative. He&apos;s down to 9-2 now, having been 8-1 at the weekend and it&apos;s great that he&apos;ll represent the Classic generation.&quot; Mars is the last three-year-old left in the Eclipse and no horse as young has been placed since 2010. &quot;Declaration Of War is a very interesting entry but there&apos;s been no indication at all as to whether he&apos;ll take part,&quot; Stevens added. &quot;We&apos;ve decided not to quote him in our list but punters won&apos;t lose out if he does run; we&apos;ll settle all bets so far as &apos;Betting without Declaration Of War&apos;. &quot;There&apos;s been no word coming either way about him or Camelot, though it seems the latter could just as easily be retired as run. Hopefully the picture will become clearer when final declarations are made on Thursday morning.&quot; Haggas will run Mukhadram in the Eclipse and said his colt was none the worse for a hard race in the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes at Royal Ascot, when he was beaten a neck by Al Kazeem, the Eclipse favourite. &quot;He lost 6kg at Ascot,&quot; the trainer said, &quot;and then the following night, he&apos;d put 14kg on. I took that as a sign that he&apos;d come out of the race well, but if he runs flat, I&apos;ll be wrong.&quot; Haggas noted that Mukhadram, who has a possible long-term target in next year&apos;s Dubai World Cup, is now the highest rated horse that he has trained, having passed even Shaamit, the 1996 Derby winner. Haggas will give Mukhadram a &quot;blow&quot; up the gallops on Wednesday, while his fellow Newmarket trainer John Gosden plans to get &quot;a little bit of work&quot; into The Fugue, another Eclipse runner, who was three lengths back in third at Ascot. Gosden said: &quot;She was drawn wide that day and we decided not to rush her down the outside on fast ground just to get a good early position before the bend, which comes up pretty quickly. So she was settled well back and ran on nicely. We won&apos;t, hopefully, be so adrift this time. I think she&apos;ll come on a bit just for having that run. She&apos;s in good form.&quot; Dave Smith will no longer act as a racecourse judge, following his mistake last week in declaring a hasty dead-heat when, as was announced on Monday, the photo-finish print showed that one of the horses was a clear winner. The British Horseracing Authority said on Wednesday that Smith had failed to follow its standard operating procedures and would therefore have his contract for services terminated. Smith feels he has been treated harshly following the incident. He said: &quot;Gutted is the only word really. I don&apos;t think I deserve what they are doing to me.

I should know.&quot; When even those who keep a close eye on tennis struggle to name the only previous champion among the women&apos;s last eight at Wimbledon, it is perhaps a sign of the relative anonymity of a draw missing the star power of the ejected Serena Williams and Maria Sharapova. This could be unfair. Aside from Petra Kvitova, the Czech 2011 Wimbledon champion, among yesterday&apos;s quarter-finalists was also Li Na, the 2011 French Open winner and a superstar in China. Elsewhere, however, was a mix of the mid-level battlers such as Germany&apos;s Sabine Lisicki and Marion Bartoli of France (the latter, admittedly, a 2007 Wimbledon finalist), and prospects such as the 20-year-old American Sloane Stephens. Walker, a 51-year-old doctor from Hastings in East Sussex, was settled at a picnic table before heading to Court One to see Lisicki defeat Estonia&apos;s Kaia Kanepi. &quot;It&apos;s quite exciting, not having any idea who&apos;s going to win. It could be any of them really,&quot; he said. The lack of star power \u2013 or British interest, after Kanepi defeated Laura Robson \u2013 definitely contributed to a subdued atmosphere, with the long queues ubiquitous thus far in the tournament disappearing. &quot;We turned up here at 11am thinking we&apos;d have to queue for quite a while to get ground tickets. But we&apos;ve walked straight in. Didn&apos;t even have to stop once,&quot; said Dubai-based Kate Turner, 57, who is staying with her 24-year-old daughter, Meryl, in north London. The pair, sharing the picnic table with Walker, knew less still about the quarter-finalists but were not unhappy at the absence of the big names. &quot;I&apos;m not a big fan of Serena Williams,&quot; said Turner. &quot;She never really looks like she&apos;s enjoying herself. Same with Sharapova. It can all be a bit boring. But I love Bartoli. She&apos;s very eccentric by comparison.&quot; The uncharitable could point to a somewhat low-wattage royal box on Centre Court, with luminaries ranging from Kim Cattrall to Vernon Kay. But when play began the crowds were no less involved than usual, adopting the technique honed over decades without much of a British interest of adopting a favourite on instant and sometimes arbitrary grounds. Thus Centre Court cheered Lisicki in part for her heroics in removing Williams, while some of Court One turned against the low-slung, scuttling Bartoli after she requested a rain halt amid showers heavy enough to see many of those booing hoist their own umbrellas. There was drama, too. Li lost to Polish fourth seed Angela Radwanska only after the Chinese player saw an ace which would have clinched the first set wrongly called out. Li opted not to challenge the call on the Hawk Eye replay, only learning what had happened at the post-match press conference. During a late afternoon rain break Phil Jones, a technology company manager from Horsley in Surrey, conceded he and his wife, Sonya, had only been able to name two of the quarter-finalists when they arrived. This mattered little, he argued: &quot;Williams and Sharapova seem to have dominated the women&apos;s game for so long that it seems the next tier down are a bit starved of attention.

At the time Machar was a commander in the Sudan People&apos;s Liberation Movement/Army (SPLM/A) fighting the government in Khartoum. After they married, McCune threw in her lot with the southern rebels. In 1993, while pregnant with Machar&apos;s child, she was killed in a car crash in Nairobi. Her story was later told in a book, Emma&apos;s War, by Deborah Scroggins. Machar&apos;s career as a guerrilla leader brought similar vicissitudes. His quest for independence for South Sudan led him into conflict with the then SPLM leader, John Garang, who initially favoured a reformed but united Sudan in which the equal rights of non-Arabs and non-Muslims would be respected. In 1991 Machar broke away, forming a rebel faction, the SPLM/A-Nasir. A period of complex, rival alliances based on ethnic and tribal lines followed, involving sometimes heavy fighting between Machar&apos;s forces and the SPLA. His groups received help from the Sudanese government and in 1997, along with other disaffected rebels, he signed the ill-conceived Khartoum Peace Agreement and became an assistant to President Omar al-Bashir. Machar eventually patched up his differences with Garang and rejoined the SPLA as a senior commander in 2002. He was subsequently involved in negotiations leading to the 2005 Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA), which ended the civil war, and after Garang&apos;s death in an accident he became South Sudan&apos;s first vice-president on independence in July 2011. Friction between Machar and President Salva Kiir has built up in the past two years as South Sudan&apos;s new SPLM-led government has struggled to meet the daunting challenge of building a nation state from scratch. Observers in the capital, Juba, say memories of Machar&apos;s machinations during the war and the many deaths that resulted from the split with Garang have left a residue of distrust. In his interview with the Guardian, Machar was highly critical of Kiir&apos;s record as president and urged him to step down, thereby avoiding a leadership contest. But he also made plain that he was ready for a fight, at the same time revealing his knowledge of British political precedents \u2013 he holds a PhD from the University of Bradford. &quot;Even in your own country, Margaret Thatcher had to leave after leading the Conservative party for a very long time. Tony Blair also had to leave after winning three consecutive elections and give way to the next generation,&quot; he said. Theirs was an example that Kiir would do well to follow, he suggested. He rejected any comparison between himself and Gordon Brown. His criticism of Kiir aside, Machar offered several reasons why the new government was underperforming. It was difficult, he said, to make the switch from guerrilla movement to governance; Khartoum continued to make problems for the impoverished new state, particularly over oil exports; and South Sudan was the world&apos;s youngest independent country. It would take time to build institutional strength, he said. &quot;After independence, the expectations of the people shot up very high. They want us to turn this country into another Dubai or Korea or Malaysia, countries that have moved fast in their economic and social development \u2026 That is good, but we have to weigh and measure those expectations against the reality on the ground \u2026 We haven&apos;t met the expectations of the people in the last two years.&quot; Machar rejected a suggestion the ruling party elite had become out of touch with ordinary people. &quot;We are of the people, we come from the people. We are pastoralists, camel-herders, peasants. It would be difficult to say we are out of touch.

Bjorn is seeking to qualify for the Open via the European Tour mini order of merit, which is available to players in the top 20 of the Race to Dubai after a series of events of which the French Open is the final one. The Dane began in 16th place in the Race to Dubai, after a disappointing finish last Sunday left him tied for 18th in the Irish Open. In the second round again it was the finish which proved problematic for Bjorn. He signed for a two-under 69 to add to Thursday&apos;s 68, but closed with consecutive bogeys for a share of the clubhouse lead with Richard Sterne of South Africa. Bjorn has understandable cause to want to appear at Muirfield having finished in a tie for eighth when the Open was last there, 13 years ago. In 2011 at Royal St George&apos;s, he finished fourth; Muirfield, at least, is within touching distance. One of those challenging his position is Scotland&apos;s Stephen Gallacher, who lies one shot adrift of Bjorn at four-under after a second round of 70. Graeme McDowell is on the same score after adding a second consecutive 69. Play had been delayed for an hour on Friday morning because of fog on the outskirts of Versailles. Phil Mickelson, who will return to Europe for next week&apos;s Scottish Open at Castle Stuart, has reflected on his latest failure to close out a US Open, at Merion last month.

Mickelson had been the leader, or tied as leader, after 18, 36 and 54 holes. &quot;I&apos;m disappointed,&quot; Mickelson said. &quot;It took me a few days to just not do much, but the fact is in the last few months I&apos;ve had some breakthroughs in my game. &quot;I&apos;m playing better than I have in years. My putting hasn&apos;t been this good in four or five years. My driving is off the charts. I&apos;m hitting fairways at the US Open and I&apos;m moving it out there a decent amount. So I&apos;m excited to keep playing, because I keep putting myself in good positions and I&apos;m playing better than I have in a long time. &quot;Golf is a game that you end up losing so much more than you win. You have to deal with losing a lot more. Even the highest percentage winners of all time lose more than they win. It&apos;s like batting in baseball. The best hitters still fail a majority of the time. It happens. &quot;I had a good chance to win and I&apos;m certainly bummed that I didn&apos;t, but I can&apos;t wait to get back out and play.

He does look like a proper horse. It would have been awfully sad if he&apos;d been a 75-rated horse, looking like he does.&quot; Now 63, Charlton began his career with a thundering bang in 1990, winning both the English and French Derbys in the space of four days, four months after receiving his licence. Quest For Fame and Sanglamore did that for him; weeks later, Deploy came within a length of giving him a most unlikely treble in the Irish Derby. &quot;Bless their cotton socks,&quot; he says at the memory of those three colts, while acknowledging that their generation may not have been of the highest quality. It would have to count as a surprise that no middle-distance horses of comparable ability have either been sent to Charlton or have emerged from his Wiltshire yard in the intervening years, until Cityscape, who won a \u00a32m race in Dubai last year, and now Al Kazeem, seeking his third Group One victory on the trot. An emergent star of British racing, Al Kazeem would be doing his winning for someone else on the other side of the world had it not been for a well-timed foot abscess in late 2011 that scuppered a sale to Hong Kong. &quot;He&apos;s probably worth 10 times what that rather generous offer was then,&quot; the trainer reflects. &quot;We were lucky. It was a very, very small issue ... [but] the would-be buyers didn&apos;t particularly like it.&quot; They would have regretted that reticence the following May, when Al Kazeem hacked up in a Group Two race. But fortunes change rapidly where horses are involved and he returned home with a pelvic fracture, necessitating weeks in a sling. &quot;It was bad,&quot; says Charlton. &quot;One thought, OK, the owner has no choice now, we have to be relaxed, we have to be patient and however long it takes, it&apos;ll take. The vets seemed confident that, if we had enough time, he&apos;d come back. Whether he&apos;d come back as good ...&quot; It is no longer an issue, Al Kazeem having won all three races this year. Along the way he gave Charlton a first Irish Group One, beating Camelot in the Tattersalls Gold Cup. That was also a first win in Ireland for Al Kazeem&apos;s 25-year-old rider, James Doyle, whose reputation has grown from almost nothing since he eased his way into the job as Charlton&apos;s stable jockey early last year. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to say: &apos;James, how many times have you ridden at The Curragh?&apos;, because I thought I might get an answer that would give me a bit of an uneasy feeling in my stomach,&quot; Charlton recalls. But, in a taxi on the way to the track that day, the itch overcame him and the question was asked. Doyle replied that he had ridden there once, in an apprentice race over six furlongs. Charlton describes himself as naturally apprehensive before many races, especially major races, especially in Ireland, where Camelot&apos;s connections dominate the sport. &quot;You feel as if you&apos;re in the lion&apos;s den when you go there,&quot; he says. But he and Doyle came up with stalk-and-challenge tactics that exposed Camelot&apos;s limitations and when Mukhadram threatened to pinch the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes from the front at Royal Ascot, Doyle was alive to the threat and had Al Kazeem a neck in front by the line. Tactical awareness will again be important, with Mukhadram expected to try something similar. Charlton seems secure in the knowledge that his horse has recovered quickly from a hard race at Ascot. &quot;He eats incredibly well. In fact we almost have to restrict how much he eats.&quot; There is still talk of a return to Ascot for the King George at the end of the month but the trainer&apos;s preference would be to give Al Kazeem two months off before the Irish Champion Stakes and then his big target for the whole year, the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe, when the extra distance and a bit of cut underfoot should, he hopes, provide the horse with his ideal conditions. Charlton has described the Arc as &quot;the best race in the world&quot; but has not had a runner since Quest For Fame, seventh in 1991.

Chosen by five curators from around the world, each of which offer up two rising talents, it aims to show the range of contemporary photography. But this year, exciting work is thin on the ground. Maybe it&apos;s because the festival&apos;s theme is Arles in Black, which really means Arles in black-and-white, the work on display seems overly concerned with process \u2013 at the expense of the end result. Thus Martin Becka has shot Dubai, that most postmodern of cities, in monochrome using a 40x50 cm view camera and printing on waxpaper negatives, a process almost as old as photography itself. The end results resemble stills from a 50s sci-fi film shot by someone still in thrall to modernism. Interesting, but oddly flat. Likewise Craig J Barber&apos;s tintype photographs of farmers and woodsmen in upstate New York, all of whom have a hands-on relationship with the land that they cultivate. The long exposure required by the tintype process \u2013 the length of two or three heartbeats, according to Barber \u2013 makes these portraits look like they come from an older time, even as the subjects&apos; contemporary clothes and hair undercut that suggestion. Again, I was left unmoved, despite the meticulous process.     Yasmine Eid-Sabbagh and Rozenn Quere, Possible and Imaginary Lives.     Elsewhere in the show, three of the nominees work with found photography, one of the recurring tropes of contemporay image-making that seeks to make sense of the digital onslaught by recontextualising older work. Yasmine Eid-Sabbagh and Rozenn Quere use a family to cast light on the plight of exiles from Palestine and Lebanon, mixing fiction, anecdote and history. For me, the whole never transcends the sum of the parts; I was more bemused than enlightened by the installation. I was more drawn to Marcela Paniak&apos;s found photographs, unearthed at flea markets then overlaid with dried flowers. The portraits have a surreal feel that feeds into her other work, which uses fairytale imagery remembered from her Polish childhood.     Marcela Paniak's Elysium, 2013.     All of this work seemed oddly insubstantial compared to the found photographs presented by French curator Daine Dufour, which centre on the popular uprising in Turkey in 1968. Titled A Cloud of Black Smoke, the grainy monochrome shots capture street riots, shootings and beatings, and cannot help but evoke recent events on the streets of Turkish cities. The images were taken by unknown photographers who were simply bearing witness, then hidden for decades following the Kizildere massacre of 30 March 1972, which features in the last batch. &quot;Photographs have a language that everyone can understand without any historical knowledge,&quot; writes Dufour. &quot;Is Kizildere a beginning or an end?&quot; No process here, only protest.

It is about the director&apos;s home town of Quneitra, on the borders of the Golan Heights, which was almost completely destroyed by the Israelis after the 1967 war and remains in ruins. The film is a historical-autobiographical epic of three generations, taking you from the Syrian fight for independence against the French in the 1930s, through the 1948 war with Israel, and into recent times. Malas is probably the most highly regarded living Syrian director \u2013 he is still based in Damascus as far as I know \u2013 and this film is heavily influenced by Tarkovsky in the use of long, contemplative dream and memory sequences where time is as important an expressive element as space, dialogue or movement. The Mummy (Al-Mummia), aka The Night of Counting the Years Shadi Abdel Salam, 1969     The Mummy (Al-Mummia), aka The Night of Counting the Years: 'unrivalled aesthetic rigour'. Photograph: www.ronaldgrantarchive.com    This was the most successful full-length feature film by Shadi Abdel Salam, who started his career as an assistant to Rossellini and Mankiewicz (on Cleopatra) and died quite young. Set in Egypt at the end of the 19th century, it tells of a peasant family living off the illegal trade in pharaonic treasures. The theme here is the continuity between ancient and modern Egypt and the importance of preserving pharaonic culture. Abdel Salam, also a great costume and set designer, based everything on meticulous research. Its aesthetic rigour was never again rivalled in Egyptian cinema. Watch out for ZouZou (Khally ballak min ZouZou) Hassan Al Imam, 1972            Reading on mobile? Watch a clip here I love musicals, and this one is particularly good as it was written by the great cartoonist, poet and satirist Salah Jaheen. It is a comedy of class conflict \u2013 Zouzou (Soad Hosny) comes from Cairo&apos;s popular quarters but is attending the liberal world of university. It&apos;s a satirical film but sexy and lively. If you watch this, and then visit a Cairo university campus today, with its veiled girls and bearded boys, you will be shocked by how conservative and reactionary Arab urban society has become in the past 40 years. The Cruel Sea (Bas-Ya-Bahar) Khalid Al Siddiq, 1972     The Cruel Sea (Bas-Ya-Bahar): 'evokes Kuwait's pre-oil days'.    This, I think, is the first feature film ever made in Kuwait by a Kuwaiti director. Shot in black and white, it evokes the pre-oil days when Kuwait relied almost entirely on the sea, either for trade or for pearl-fishing. Men would go to sea for months, leaving the women, children and elderly to fend for themselves. The sea is the main character here \u2013 initially the source of all things beautiful but equally a monster that destroys lives. The film is a Greek tragedy of sorts, and despite its formal simplicity, it is technically ambitious and very beautiful. I also admire the spare acting style. Fertile Memory (Al Dhakira al Khasba) Michel Khleifi, 1980     Fertile Memory (Al Dhakira al Khasba): 'the first feminist Arab film'.    The Palestinian Michel Khleifi is probably the finest Arab film-maker of his generation. I must declare an interest here as we have worked together for more than 20 years, but in truth I admire all his films. His most famous is Wedding in Galilee, but for me his most moving and exciting work is the documentary that made his name.Fertile Memory is a portrait of two women: one a radical young Palestinian novelist, a divorc\u00e9e, living with her daughters in the Occupied Territories; the other Khleifi&apos;s illiterate aunt, who lost her husband just after the 1948 war. This is the first feminist Arab film and it has a very keen sense of observation and political engagement. The Dupes (Al-makhdu&apos;un) Tewfik Saleh, 1973            Reading on mobile? Watch a clip here Set in Iraq, shot in Syria, based on a famous Palestinian novel by Ghassan Kanafani (assassinated by the Israelis in 1972) and directed by an Egyptian, this harrowing film is about a group of Palestinian workmen in the early 50s trying to cross the border illegally from Iraq into Kuwait, to join the oil boom. They get a lift inside a water tank and are stuck there when the driver is held up by customs officials. The action takes place inside the tank in the searing desert heat as the men dream of the homes and loved ones they left behind. A classic of the Palestinian experience. Man of Ashes (Rih Essed) Nouri Bouzid, 1986      Reading on mobile? Watch a clip here This powerful film about working-class boys growing up in Tunisia caused a stir because it deals with sexual harassment and homosexuality. A carpentry apprentice is about to celebrate his wedding but he and his close friend have both been victims of sexual abuse, notably by the monstrous local carpenter. This dark secret threatens to come out before the young man&apos;s wedding. Several Arab films in the mid-80s \u2013 another is Michel Khleifi&apos;s Wedding in Galilee \u2013 explored the close links between sexual oppression and political and social oppression, whether in the form of traditional patriarchal orders or foreign military occupation or entrenched class interests. Man of Ashes does this brilliantly. The Call of the Nightingale (Doa al-Karawan), aka The Nightingale&apos;s Prayer Henry Barakat, 1960     The Call of the Nightingale (Doa al-Karawan): 'humane and beautifully made'.     Barakat was the master of classical cinema in Egypt, and this film is based on a novel by the great Taha Hussein. It is humane and beautifully made. The heroine, a peasant girl, decides to take revenge on a handsome engineer who has seduced her sister and caused her &quot;honour&quot; killing by her uncle. In order to do so, she becomes his live-in maid but soon finds herself falling in love with him. It stars a very young Faten Hamama, who went on to become a huge star and who plays every role with grace and elegance, without ever seeming contrived or dull. 12 Angry Lebanese Zeina Daccache, 2009     12 Angry Lebanese: 'deeply moving'.    I was on the jury when this won the top documentary award at Dubai in 2009. The director is a young Lebanese drama-therapist who put on a production of 12 Angry Men inside Lebanon&apos;s most notorious prison and filmed the long protracted process. The film was partly an attempt to reform the country&apos;s criminal and penal laws and improve prison living conditions. It also enabled Daccache to extend her drama-therapy work to prisons across Lebanon, and she had started working in Syria shortly before the current conflict began. It is deeply moving and full of humanity, particularly in the way it describes the process of lifting men from a profound states of despair into a renewed desire to live and build a different future for themselves. Chitchat on the Nile (Thartharah fawq al-Nil) aka Adrift on the Nile Hussein Kamal, 1971     Chitchat on the Nile (Thartharah fawq al-Nil): 'has a great subversive power'.    Based on a novel by Naguib Mahfouz, this film&apos;s theme is decadence. It is set on an illicit barge on the Nile where disenchanted government employees meet to get drunk and smoke hashish. Made soon after President Nasser&apos;s death, the film is critical of the old &quot;socialist&quot; bureaucracy, which had become extremely corrupt. It has the foresight and courage to mark the end of an era, with eyes keenly locked on a not-very-promising new one. One could consider the film overmoralising in that it conflates sexual freedom with corruption, but it has a great subversive power and is still banned in many Arab countries.

Parveen doesn&apos;t like to talk much. She might not do the interview at all. And yet, 19 minutes of conversation later, it&apos;s obvious that the greatest female Sufi singer in history is almost disappointingly blissed out. &quot;My culture \u2013 our culture \u2013 is rich in spirituality and love,&quot; she says, in a densely poetic Urdu. &quot;Sufism is not a switch, the music isn&apos;t a show \u2013 it&apos;s all of life, it is religion. If I want to be recognised for anything, if we should be recognised for anything, it&apos;s the journey of the voice. And that voice is God&apos;s.&quot; Smoothing herself elegantly on to the sofa of a hotel suite in Manchester, Parveen gives a beatific smile. It would be eerie if it wasn&apos;t so soothing; anyone who has watched her on stage knows that this magnificent projection of calm often ends up a wild, sweaty, ecstatic mess. She has admitted to hallucinating while deep in performance and she regularly sends her audiences in Pakistan and India into swaying raptures, swooning and fainting being quite standard reactions. Her first US tour was in 1993 and she has since travelled across the world to perform at sold-out venues. Bj\u00f6rk counts Parveen as one of her greatest musical influences; composer John Tavener \u2013 who she performed with last Sunday night at Manchester international festival \u2013 said he had a gut-wobbling, primordial experience watching her in rehearsals for their one-off show together. Her own concert last Saturday, where she sang classic qawwalis, ghazals and kafis \u2013 all variations on Pakistani folk and classical \u2013 was met with yelps and dancing in the aisles of Bridgewater Hall. She credits her father (and God, naturally) for the success. &quot;I was very attached to my father. Classical Sufi music, for him, came from the soul \u2013 I was pulled in by it. We spent hours at the dargahs [Sufi shrines, often built over the graves of saints], singing and reciting at festivals. It was normal in the culture I grew up in.&quot; Parveen, now 59, says she was three years old when she first sang. She was born into a long line of Sufi mystics and singers; her father, Ghulam Haider, founded a devotional music school in Larkana, the Sindhi city in which she was born and, famously, where the Bhutto political dynasty \u2013 and its Pakistan People&apos;s party \u2013 was established. Parveen&apos;s talent, decided Haider, outweighed tradition. He trained her throughout childhood, rather than his two sons, to pursue music \u2013 &quot;because it was my calling&quot;. She laughs when I ask her about the sexism she might have faced earlier in her Sufi singing career, in such a male-dominated environment: &quot;The concept of being a man or a woman doesn&apos;t cross my mind. I&apos;m neither on stage, I&apos;m a vehicle on stage for passion.&quot; She is dressed androgynously today as she always is: beige, buttoned-up collar kameez (long tunic) and shalwar (trousers), with a traditional Sindhi print shawl draped over her chest. &quot;I&apos;ve never felt the need to challenge anyone else \u2013 I should be concentrating my energies on challenging myself.&quot; To an extent it&apos;s true: Parveen&apos;s talent transcends any gender expectations back home; she is adored, just as much as her peers Mehdi Hassan and Nusrat Fateh Ali Khan have been. Parveen&apos;s late husband, Sheikh Ghulam Hussain, retired from his job as a producer on Radio Pakistan to mentor and manage her career in the 80s. After he died of a heart attack on an international flight in the early 00s, her daughter Maryam took up the role. There is a sense that Parveen&apos;s career has taken a more commercial route as a result. She has performed on Coke Studio, Pakistan&apos;s biggest music show, sponsored by the cola company. She joined the judging panel, with Asha Bhosle, of the hugely popular TV talent show Sur Kshetra, which was filmed in Dubai and pitted Indian and Pakistani performers against one another. She even licensed her spiritual ghazals to Bollywood, since her &quot;spiritual brother&quot;, Khan, recorded songs for Bollywood films in the 90s. It&apos;s a long way since Parveen&apos;s early days, when she would reportedly leave jewellery dropped at her feet on stage, as she didn&apos;t want to be remembered for how much she had, rather than what she did. After all, business and Sufism, arguably the purest devotional form of Islam, can hardly make for natural bedfellows? &quot;The business side. Yes, that has to be for others because this journey, money doesn&apos;t come into it. I don&apos;t let it enter my mind because it&apos;s a pollutant. They tell me to do a show, I do it. Record a CD, I do it. I want this to be peace and love, I go to India so much because of this reason \u2013 we used to be one country. I go to Mauritius, Singapore, America, it&apos;s my job \u2013 I am an ambassador for the heart and will of our Pakistan. This is my destiny.&quot; Unsurprisingly, Parveen laughs and declines to comment on who she voted for in recent elections. She declines to comment, too, on whether Sufism and its music is being used by successive Pakistani governments as a political tool to improve the country&apos;s image abroad, rather than there being a genuine state-level interest in preserving and supporting this part of the nation&apos;s heritage. After all, the Pakistani Taliban are still bombing and violently attacking Sufi sites and shrines, which are left unprotected and ignored by political leaders. Isn&apos;t there a disconnect? &quot;Pakistan seems disconnected from the outside. But it is built and running on prayers of our Sufi kings, our pirs. Poor people, rich people \u2013 we are all God&apos;s servants \u2026 I&apos;m lucky. My audience is my God.&quot;", "title": "Abida Parveen: 'I'm not a man or a woman, I'm a vehicle for passion'", "sentences": ["She joined the judging panel, with Asha Bhosle, of the hugely popular TV talent show Sur Kshetra, which was filmed in Dubai and pitted Indian and Pakistani performers against one another."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-08T17:10:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/11/gulf-on-thames-scar-london-southbank-boris", "tags": ["Architecture", "Building and town and country planning", "London", "Art and design", "Planning policy", "Politics", "Education", "The Shard", "Boris Johnson", "UK news", "Cities"], "article": "When the jokes and buffoonery are dead and forgotten, the towers will remain. The true nature of Boris Johnson&apos;s London is taking shape in the form of some 30 bleak glass megaliths dotted at random across the capital. He did not intend them and appears not to have planned them. Like Ken Livingstone, Johnson came to power pledged to end the &quot;pepper-potting&quot; of London. As with Livingstone, power seized him in the grip of an edifice complex. I cannot find a Londoner who realises what is about to happen on the south bank of the Thames opposite Westminster. Johnson and the planning minister, Nick Boles, have allowed a Qatari consortium to build a visual wall of towers on a truly Stalinist scale behind the Royal Festival Hall next to Waterloo. It is as if Paris had relocated La D\u00e9fense to the Ile de la Cit\u00e9. I am told these properties will mostly lie empty \u2013 useful collateral for the world&apos;s migratory money, ever in search of a safe haven. The Shell Centre will be demolished, except for its central 26-storey slab. Four new towers, one even taller than the present one, will cling round it. Behind this cluster will rise a 29-storey stack of glass boxes on the site of Elizabeth House, rumoured to be the largest occupied structure in Europe. This will be dwarfed by a tower of luxury flats 100 yards downstream, its 43 storeys just seven fewer than Canary Wharf. This massive scheme will comprise the greatest intrusion imaginable on the London skyline. Sited at the tip of the peninsular loop in the Thames meander, it will block sightlines from Westminster to the City of London and be far more dominant over the horizon than the Shard at Bermondsey, or &quot;new Chinatown&quot; soon to emerge upstream opposite Chelsea at Battersea. The latter will include a 60-storey Nine Elms tower, 10 more than Canary Wharf, to join the 50-storey ones arising at Vauxhall. Talking towers with London architects is like talking disarmament with the National Rifle Association. A skyscraper seems every builder&apos;s dream. At a Royal Institute of British Architects seminar on the subject last April, I faced an audience almost entirely of architects who treated any criticism of tall buildings as nothing to do with aesthetics or urban culture but to do with denying them money. They played the man, not the ball, accusing critics of being elitist, reactionary, heritage-obsessed and enemies of architecture. Of course cities must change with the times, and buildings with them. Like most people, I appreciate some modern buildings and not others, just as I want to protect some buildings and not others. I like Broadgate, the Gherkin and the new King&apos;s Cross. I admire Zaha Hadid&apos;s Olympic pool and Lord Foster&apos;s Millennium Bridge \u2013 not to mention Thomas Heatherwick&apos;s proposed garden bridge. I would not have saved Bankside power station or listed Goldfinger&apos;s bleak Elephant and Castle blocks, as the government did this week. Tall buildings well sited can be exhilarating. I was thrilled by Dubai&apos;s Burj Khalifa \u2013 located as it is in the desert \u2013 and the City of London tower cluster seen from the Monument; Canary Wharf is exciting from Greenwich Park, less so from Poplar. But siting is all. Most London towers are plonked down wherever the money talked. The charm of London still depends on relatively low-rise streets and open spaces. This is not an &quot;accident of history&quot;, to be overridden by property speculation at will. It is part of the character of the metropolis. London&apos;s neighbourhoods can be revitalised, as are other European cities, to higher densities without the visual bruising of point blocks. It just needs planning. London is alone among Europe&apos;s great cities in its drooling slavery to &quot;anything goes&quot; on its skyline, in its refusal to stand up to big money or choose a handsome development from a rubbish one. Its planners can regulate minute details of front doors or wall colours with, we assume, some urban aesthetic in mind. They regulate the foreground but let the background go to hell. I can find no public document indicating where towers should be thought appropriate or inappropriate in London. There is no strategy for their location or exclusion, only a dwindling protection for &quot;views&quot; of St Paul&apos;s. Artist&apos;s impressions never indicate surrounding towers. Each planning permission is considered in isolation, frequently on appeal to heavily lobbied politicians. Both the Conservatives in opposition and Johnson when running for office publicly pledged to bring such development under control. In 2007 David Cameron&apos;s &quot;quality of life&quot; group condemned Livingstone&apos;s &quot;vulgarity of bigness&quot;, complaining that the ugly location of his towers was damaging London&apos;s appearance, its history and its tourist economy. It compared them with the grandiosity of Stalin and Mussolini. The politicians all changed the minds at the first pop of a lobbyist&apos;s champagne. Towers imply civic leadership weak in the face of commercial pressure. They\u00a0are not &quot;vital&quot; to the urban economy, least of all in a low-density city such as London. The last rash of speculative towers such as Centre Point in the 1970s mostly lay empty until rented for government offices. Today&apos;s are not built for people to use but as sleeping bank accounts for funk money. The Shard may well stay largely empty, like One Hyde Park and the palaces of Palm Island, Dubai. The rich may own them,\u00a0but not inhabit them. The truth is, as Leona Helmsley said of taxes, that London planning is &quot;for the little people&quot;. The Qatari and Chinese edifices about to rise along the banks of the Thames are pastiches of the Gulf economy. They will cause widespread outrage. People will ask who on earth let them through.

It would be an exaggeration to liken Arsenal&apos;s arrival in Indonesia to some sort of Beatlemania but equally wrong to underestimate the sheer excitement that their presence here for the first time in 30 years has brought. The evidence was plentiful amid the chaos of Jakarta, where the heat, traffic and security are intense, not least during the club&apos;s welcome press conference. Rammed into the room at the city&apos;s military airport were as many fans as journalists and elbows-out photographers and they gushed at the sight of Ars\u00e8ne Wenger, Theo Walcott and Jack Wilshere, who did not need to work hard for their cheers. The thank yous for coming were effusive. Wenger, having seen a garland of flowers draped around his neck, spoke of pushing new frontiers; the mission to bring happiness and an opportunity for his players to appreciate their popularity in far-flung parts. The chief executive, Ivan Gazidis, noted how Arsenal have more Facebook followers in Indonesia than in any other country and it was difficult not to become caught in the optimism. Pre-season is a time for such like, yet it felt more pronounced here and Wenger warmed to the theme. He detects a freshness about the Premier League, driven by the managerial changes at the Manchester clubs and Chelsea and, more pertinently, an openness. &quot;It feels as though it should be more open,&quot; Wenger said and, as he pondered how &quot;strange&quot; it must be for Sir Alex Ferguson &quot;not to start a season&quot; at Old Trafford, it was clear that he intended to revel in the realigned landscape. &quot;Most of the leagues now are becoming like Scotland,&quot; he said. &quot;In Spain, it&apos;s Real Madrid or Barcelona; in Italy, it&apos;s Juventus or Milan; in France, it will be Paris Saint-Germain or Monaco. At least in England, you have a few more clubs who have a chance at the start of the season.&quot; Wenger feels that Arsenal are one of them, although he held back from any bold talk of the title. Perhaps the recent trophy-less years have scarred him but he was also realistic enough to acknowledge that he and Gazidis had not begun their summer transfer business. Only the France youth striker Yaya Sanogo has joined thus far. He has not travelled to east Asia, where the 16-year-old prodigy Gedion Zelalem was the most eye-catching inclusion. Thomas Vermaelen is ruled out through back trouble; Gervinho, whose days at the club appear numbered, by illness. Wenger&apos;s confidence for the season is located in the club having emerged from the financial restrictions related to their move to the Emirates Stadium and their new-found ability to compete for the very biggest names on the market. He said that Gonzalo Higua\u00edn, Wayne Rooney and Luis Su\u00e1rez were &quot;realistic targets, quality-wise&quot;, even if he did not want to be drawn into the specifics for fear of jeopardising potential deals. The impression was one of a manager who believed that only a couple of injections of genuine quality were required to make his team competitive. &quot;We have one thing in that we created the momentum at the end of last season [with 39 points from the final 16 league games] and for us, the purpose is to transfer that into the new season with a strong start,&quot; Wenger said. &quot;That is the most important target and that will certainly decide how much we will be competing in the Premier League. The second most important target is to bring in players and strengthen the squad. I expect that. &quot;We have better financial resources than the years before and resources that we have created ourselves, which is massively important to us. For years, we were out of the race for the top-level transfers but we are coming back now. It was a very sensitive period, a very difficult period and the challenge was to stay at the top in the Champions League. &quot;But, of course, we want more and I hope in the next two to three years, the club will be competing every year for the Premier League. I also believe that even if we are in a stronger financial position, all of our values have to be the same. We must rely on the quality of our work, our style and the fact we develop our own players. We will only use financial resources to bring in one or two players who will give us something more.&quot; Arsenal play an Indonesian Dream Teamon Sunday at the 88,000-capacity Gelora Bung Karno Stadium, before they push on to Vietnam and Japan, and the local temperature is rising, even if it barely seems feasible.

McIlroy, after all, has made little secret of the fact he struggles in bad conditions. That much was again clear on his most recent appearances in Europe, at the PGA Championship and the Irish Open. Not that things have fared much better for McIlroy in the warmth of the United States, it must be said. The harsh reality for McIlroy is that, for now, he must be grateful for small mercies such as the fine weather set for next week&apos;s Open Championship. The second-ranked player in the world may hold the same position in the betting markets at Muirfield but there is a lack of available evidence supporting such prominence. The venue itself is hardly forgiving of golfing works in progress. McIlroy is unrecognisable from the player who birdied five holes in succession in Dubai eight months ago to end 2012 on the ultimate high. He was the best golfer in the world and challenging \u2013 toppling \u2013 Tiger Woods at the summit of the game. When discussing McIlroy&apos;s subsequent struggles, which culminated in an admission that he felt &quot;lost&quot; before missing the cut in Ireland, it must be recalled that he was not in a particularly happy place a year ago either. McIlroy bemoaned inconsistency after failing to properly challenge for the Open at Royal Lytham &amp; St Annes. He admitted he was low on confidence and struggling before offering a typically positive longer-term outlook. &quot;I think the thing for me is to stay patient,&quot; McIlroy said last summer. &quot;If it doesn&apos;t happen over the next couple of weeks, no big deal. It&apos;s a 20-year career, so I&apos;m not going to get too wound up just over a few weeks. &quot;I&apos;ve got to keep working away, plugging away, working hard and on the right things and eventually it will come around.&quot; McIlroy&apos;s rousing response included a famous win at the US PGA Championship, a key involvement in Europe&apos;s Ryder Cup victory and claiming that Dubai title from under the nose of Justin Rose. McIlroy was the leading money winner on both sides of the Atlantic by the time the season ended. Twelve months on, patience is as vital to McIlroy as ever. His frustration has been clear, so much so at the US Open that he threw one club and fatally damaged another. In the background, a break-up with his management company, worth millions of pounds in a contractual sense, is still unresolved. &quot;Rory&apos;s Rory and I would not be too worried about him at all,&quot; said Shane Lowry, the Irish player with whom McIlroy retains a good friendship. &quot;He didn&apos;t get to world No1 by not being a great golfer. He has not done well recently but he&apos;ll definitely be back soon.&quot; Few people would reasonably doubt he will indeed be back but the issue is when; and whether 2013 can already be considered a write-off year. In a technical sense, McIlroy&apos;s swing is such that when off-plane, as it has been on so many occasions this season, he will block shots right or pull left. The most stern warning over the dangers associated with McIlroy&apos;s lucrative and high-profile switch to Nike equipment came from Nick Faldo who, to date, has been proven entirely correct. The 55-year-old Faldo, who won three Opens (including memorably taking the Claret Jug at Muirfield in 1992) and three Masters titles, has insisted that McIlroy &quot;messed with a winning formula&quot;. &quot;I hope he hasn&apos;t gone too far that it&apos;s damaged his confidence.&quot; Jay Townsend, now a golf commentator, previously riled the Northern Irishman by questioning the work of his caddie, JP Fitzgerald. Townsend believes McIlroy&apos;s Nike switch had a more meaningful impact than the 24-year-old had expected. &quot;I think it is difficult to change the ball and the club at the same time because you don&apos;t have a known value,&quot; explained Townsend. &quot;When you are doing any science project, you always have something with a known value and you change things to see how they react to that. &quot;To do it all at once was a little difficult and I think if he were to do it again, he would probably do things a little differently.&quot; It is too late now for McIlroy to change path. He will make a return to form, but it would rank as a surprise if that happened at Muirfield next week.", "title": "Rory McIlroy faces Open torment without a sensational return to form", "sentences": ["McIlroy is unrecognisable from the player who birdied five holes in succession in Dubai eight months ago to end 2012 on the ultimate high.", "&quot;I&apos;ve got to keep working away, plugging away, working hard and on the right things and eventually it will come around.&quot; McIlroy&apos;s rousing response included a famous win at the US PGA Championship, a key involvement in Europe&apos;s Ryder Cup victory and claiming that Dubai title from under the nose of Justin Rose."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-13T16:21:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/15/football-transfer-rumours-luis-suarez-arsenal", "tags": ["Transfer window", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Ivan Gazidis&apos;s office.

Unable to bring their camera-toting car to the Italian lagoon city, where gondolas and canals stand in for vehicles and roads, the internet firm sent instead physically fit technicians to walk Venice&apos;s alleys wearing a backpack-mounted camera. Google has already added the Antarctic, the inside of the White House and the Great Barrier Reef (underwater) to Street View, which was launched in 2007, but a spokesman said Venice was considered a feather in its cap. &quot;We have wanted to do it for a long time but didn&apos;t have the technology,&quot; said Gareth Evans.

Abbas Yazasanpanah Yazdi, 44, a father-of-two and a naturalised British national, was last seen on the afternoon of Tuesday 25 June leaving his office in Bur Dubai, the commercial heart of the thriving Gulf state. He had just finished giving evidence by video-link to a long running international arbitration tribunal in The Hague involving the United Arab Emirates-based Crescent Petroleum and the National Iranian Oil Company. There is no suggestion that Yazdi&apos;s involvement in the arbitration is connected with his disappearance. Yazdi had been due to return to complete his testimony the following day. He never reappeared. His wife, Atena, fears he has been kidnapped by Iranian intelligence officers and taken to Iran. Yazdi has enjoyed privileged access to certain Iranian politicians. A close childhood friend was Mehdi Hashemi Rafsanjani, son of former president Ayatollah Rafsanjani, who lived in Britain for three years after 2009. Atena Yazdi told the 7Days website in the UAE: &quot;The only thing [the Dubai police] told me is that he seems to be alive. If he is still in the UAE I&apos;m sure the police can find him. If he&apos;s in Iran, it&apos;s completely different. I hope and pray for his safety.&quot; She also told 7Days that her husband had been detained and tortured by Iranian intelligence in 1993. After his imprisonment Yazdi is believed to have fled Iran to the UK, where he ran several businesses, before moving to Dubai. Ten years later, in 2003, Yazdi&apos;s home in London was searched by the Serious Fraud Office in connection with allegations relating to a Norwegian investigation into dealings between the Norwegian oil company Statoil and Iranian companies. Legal papers seen by the Guardian show that the SFO copied the contents of Yazdi&apos;s computers. He was never charged with any wrongdoing. In February this year Iran&apos;s State General Inspection Organisation (SGIO) wrote to the SFO asking to see material relating to Yazdi. The request was granted, even though the UK does not have diplomatic relations with Iran, having suspended the formal ties in November 2011. The document shows that the Iranian officials were told: &quot;We located an Excel file of addresses in Mr Yazdi&apos;s computer. A copy of the spreadsheet is attached marked &apos;Address Book&apos;.&quot; Names and contact details of three British lawyers have also been passed across to the SGIO in Tehran. Asked why such details had been given to Tehran, a spokesperson for the SFO said: &quot;We can neither confirm nor deny SFO interest in this matter. Requests for international assistance are usually dealt with by the Home Office, UK Central Authority, which is overseen by the secretary of state.&quot; A Home Office spokesperson said: &quot;As a matter of long-standing policy and practice, we neither confirm nor deny the existence of mutual legal assistance requests.&quot; Among details on Yazdi&apos;s online contacts book handed over by the SFO to Tehran are the names and addresses of his friends in Iran. Decisions to co-operate with the Iranians are, it is understood, normally taken at ministerial level \u2013 as the SFO statement implies. In a statement to parliament earlier this year the SFO&apos;s International Assistance Unit confirmed that it had co-operated with Iranian officials on criminal investigations. The Law Society said it would be concerned if the private details of British lawyers were being passed to Tehran. A spokesperson said: &quot;The Law Society would have serious concerns if UK agencies were playing fast and loose with personal information of members of the profession. Solicitors, discharging their duty as trusted advisers to their clients, have the right to expect privacy.&quot; A London lawyer who had previously been in contact with Yazdi also told the Guardian he had not heard from him in recent weeks and was worried about his safety. Ali Reza Nourizadeh, director of the centre for Arab and Iranian studies in London and a prominent Iranian opposition figure, said he knew Yazdi and his family. Nourizadeh said he has received information that he was kidnapped and taken to Iran where he was first transferred to Tehran&apos;s notorious Evin prison before being taken to a detention centre belonging to the elite Revolutionary Guards. However, not all those following the case believe he has been abducted to Iran. At least one source suggested he may be hiding in Switzerland. Following the victory of moderate cleric Hassan Rouhani as Iran&apos;s newly-elected president, Nourizadeh said Yazdi was worried Iranian hardliners would act to take revenge on Rafsanjani&apos;s family. Rouhani is believed to be a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Ayatollah Rafsanjani, and Nourizadeh said Yazdi was kidnapped by hardline forces as a bargaining chip.

After Basel and Miami, the leading western art show has invested in the former British colony. Art dealers, collectors and the merely curious enjoyed an artistic &quot;fusion&quot; in late May that mixed bankable western artists with Asian stars. But the east-west paradigm is not the only one at play in the contemporary art market; a pan-Asian shift is under way and local identities are being asserted. The art market, as usually understood by the players in the art world, has moved to Hong Kong to meet Asia, and is being transformed in the process. Unnoticed by the west, the Asia-Pacific region has developed several artistic centres and is now determined to assert its own tastes and preferences, with no regard for what some would call western diktats. This awakening of contemporary art in Asia is backed by abundant regional cash. According to a 2012 study by consultants Capgemini, there are more millionaires in Asia than in the United States. To lure them to the cause of art, quality art fairs have burgeoned since 2007 in Dubai, New Delhi, Hong Kong and Singapore, with the next one, the Sydney Contemporary, due in September. They share a common characteristic, which is that the Asian component dominates. The stars here are not British (Damien Hirst) or American (Jeff Koons and Richard Prince), but Chinese (Liu Wei), Iranian (Farhad Moshiri) and Indonesian (Eko Nugroho). Every country begins its artistic initiation with its own artists. People start out liking what they know \u2013 in other words what they recognise. In Asia, collectors are paying big money to acquire works by artists perceived as national heroes, and consequently propelling artists with only a local reputation and the occasional mention in public catalogues, to stardom. Few people outside Indonesia have heard of Nyoman Masriadi, but in 2008 he sold a painting for $1m at Sotheby&apos;s. For years, countries remained focused on their own artistic scenes, but today mentalities are changing. Collectors are no longer satisfied with pushing up the value of their national treasures but are broadening their spectrum to include the whole of Asia. That is where the novelty lies. Previously, after getting a national collection together, Asian art lovers would eye the west but ignore their immediate neighbours. &quot;Today if you don&apos;t know what&apos;s happening in Indonesia or South Korea, then you&apos;re not going to understand what&apos;s happening in Belgium,&quot; said Hallam Chow, a Hong Kong-based art collector who buys works by Indonesian artists as well as Chinese ones. Some dealers such as Jean-Marc Decrop, who specialises in Chinese contemporary art, expect the Middle East and Far East to draw closer artistically. &quot;Most Indonesian collectors I know are Muslim and do the Hajj pilgrimage. I know at least five who would like to collect art from the Arab world,&quot; he said. He has just opened the first gallery in Hong Kong to bring together contemporary Arab, Iranian and Turkish artists along with young artists from South-East Asia, Tibet and Central Asia. Asian institutions are following suit. In 2012, the Mori Art Museum in Tokyo held an exhibition called Arab Express. One consequence of this interregional dialogue is that the west is no longer the sole reference point for Asian artists who are now equally happy to be exhibiting in Asia. &quot;What&apos;s happening in London or New York remains important of course, but so is what&apos;s happening in Mumbai, Jogjakarta or Tokyo,&quot; observed Philip Tinari, director of the Ullens Centre for Contemporary Art  in Beijing, which hosted the Indian Highway exhibition in 2012. This all takes time. The mainland Chinese did not develop a sudden passion for Indian art after the Indian Highway exhibition, but the seeds were sown. The market will require structuring for them to grow. A well-organised art market is based on a foundation of collectors, experts and art critics as well as museums, galleries and auction houses (in other words a first and second market), in addition to framers, insurers, transporters and even specialised bankers. Only Japan and two of the four &quot;Asian Dragons&quot;, Taiwan and South Korea, currently have all the components of this artistic ecosystem. In South Korea powerful galleries have been forming the tastes of rich buyers for the past 30 years, while in Taiwan collectors are mainly descended from the Japan-influenced elite that emerged during the Japanese occupation (1895-1945) and the Chinese bourgeoisie that fled from the mainland with Chiang Kai-shek in 1949. Elsewhere the situation varies considerably from one country to another, with a massive contrast between the millionaire Chinese artists and the &quot;peasant&quot; artists in countries that are still essentially rural, such as Indonesia and the Philippines. But the curiosity is there. Not all Asian countries have achieved the same degree of maturity but they are all preparing to meet their cultural ambitions by opening museums. Some countries such as Singapore have a policy of supporting art and culture, and even the Chinese government has understood that imperialism can be cultural too. According to the British monthly, The Art Newspaper, the number of museums in China rose from 21 in 1949 to 348 in 1978 and 3,400 today, 175 of which are dedicated to visual art. Many however, are still empty shells. In India things are moving slowly but surely. Contemporary art is still only for a tiny elite and New Delhi&apos;s National Museum of Modern Art has a low visitor rate of 18,000 per year (the Louvre, in contrast, has 10 million). Despite that, Kolkata is planning to open the Kolkata Museum of Modern Art in 2015, a 23,000 sq metre building designed by Herzog &amp; De Meuron that will mainly serve Asian art. That is also the ambition of the M+ Museum of Visual Culture, which is due to open in Hong Kong by the end of 2017 and will be twice as large as London&apos;s Tate Modern. The director, Lars Nittve, intends to devote 70% of his acquisitions budget of $218m spread over five years to Asian artists. The curators of the Guggenheim in Abu Dhabi, also due to open in 2017, will devote 50% of their collection to Asia, in the broadest geographical sense of the word. Asia&apos;s emergence on the artistic scene is therefore more that a mere geographic shift. Western sellers are getting in touch with Asian buyers and this is triggering a radical overhaul reminiscent of the migration of the art markets from the European capitals to New York in the early 20th century and the dominance of the American schools that followed. Asia is as diverse as it is vast and we may soon expect a multitude of Asian schools, art fairs and new collectors endeavouring to show their supremacy to the rest of the world.

McIlroy has endured a difficult year of transitions on and off the course and Faldo claimed the world No2 needed to &quot;concentrate on golf&quot; in the buildup to the Open Championship, which begins at Muirfield on Thursday.. Six years have passed since McIlroy made his Open debut at Carnoustie, when a precocious teenage talent with the world at his feet carded an opening round 68, eventually finishing tied for 42nd. Those carefree days appear long gone and McIlroy has been the subject of intense scrutiny this year owing to inconsistent form. Questions have been asked about his Nike clubs, the result of a lucrative contract with the sports brand, a split from his management company and the amount of time he is spending away from golf. However, on Wednesday he rejected the criticism from Faldo, a three-times Open champion, that his dedication has waned. &quot;I saw he said I should be at the course nine to five,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;I was on the range at 6.15am and got out of the gym at 6.15pm, actually a 12-hour day compared to his eight-hour day. &quot;It is what it is and Nick should know how hard this game is at times. He&apos;s been in our position before and he should know how much work we all put into it. I know he wasn&apos;t trying to get on my case at all, he was just offering words of advice in some way. I think he has to remember how hard this game can be.&quot; Much has happened since McIlroy burst on to the scene with such distinction in 2007. Described then by Sports Illustrated as &quot;a slight 18-year-old whose freckled, cherubic cheeks make him look more like 14&quot;, McIlroy now has two major titles to his name but is in the midst of the toughest period in his career. The 24-year-old is a shadow of the player who ended 2012 with five consecutive birdies in Dubai to finish top of the PGA Tour money list and with a record eight-shot victory at Kiawah Island in the US PGA Championship. McIlroy, who will tee off on Thursday alongside Phil Mickelson and Hideki Matsuyama, failed to mount a serious challenge at Royal Lytham last year but insists he will emerge stronger after a difficult period. &quot;It&apos;s like life,&quot; he said. &quot;You&apos;re going to go through highs and you&apos;re going to go through lows, it&apos;s just about trying to work your way out of the lows. I haven&apos;t played my best golf this year but I&apos;ve showed signs that it is there. It&apos;s just a matter of trying to do that more often. &quot;I know that I&apos;m working on the right things and that I&apos;m doing the right things and staying patient. I know sooner or later it will turn around and I&apos;ll play the golf that everyone knows that I&apos;m capable of and the golf that I know is capable of winning major championships. &quot;The thing I think is &apos;what&apos;s the big deal?&apos; I haven&apos;t had the best six months, but it&apos;s OK. I&apos;m fine, I&apos;ve got a good life so it doesn&apos;t bother me. I&apos;m in a good place and as I said I&apos;m working hard. I feel like I&apos;m working on the right things and sooner or later it will turn around and I&apos;ll be back lifting trophies.&quot; If McIlroy can begin his tournament here in the same manner as six years ago it would be one step on the road to a third major title. Muirfield, however, will present a far different challenge than Carnoustie 30 miles north. The East Lothian course has been watered but remains extremely dry. McIlroy has a new driver in the bag but expects to use it on a maximum of seven holes per round, with players aware that any wayward or overhit shots will fly into deep rough and cause severe headaches. McIlroy, who has been backed by Tiger Woods and Mickelson to turn around his form, will be thankful that the forecast is for fine weather on the Scottish coast as he has struggled to adapt in poor conditions more than once. He may take heart from the list of winners at Muirfield, a course where outsiders have historically struggled and where big names normally prosper. However, McIlroy is trying to ignore any talk about his chances and prefers to wrap himself in a &quot;little bubble&quot;. &quot;I guess the best way is to not read or not listen too much or not watch too much TV,&quot; he said. &quot;I think that&apos;s the best thing, to try to stay oblivious about what people are saying about you, in particular try to wrap yourself in a little bubble. But it&apos;s hard to avoid at times. It&apos;s still a huge buzz. Anytime you come to a major championship or you come to an Open you&apos;re excited. There&apos;s always that extra little bit of buzz that surrounds the tournament and it&apos;s always exciting to get back to the biggest tournaments in the world.&quot;", "title": "The Open 2013: Rory McIlroy tells Sir Nick Faldo he should know better", "sentences": ["The 24-year-old is a shadow of the player who ended 2012 with five consecutive birdies in Dubai to finish top of the PGA Tour money list and with a record eight-shot victory at Kiawah Island in the US PGA Championship."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-17T17:44:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jul/18/white-elephants-10-greatest-in-tempo", "tags": ["Architecture", "World news", "Art and design"], "article": "Sometimes man&apos;s optimism knows no bounds. In a bad way. Take yourself back to 2005, when people would&apos;ve given themselves hernias laughing if you suggested the world was about to be plunged into a crisis that would make the Great Depression look puny. The European property market was at its frothiest, with developers throwing up luxury apartments and offices at the slightest excuse. In Spain they went a bit wilder than most. As a result, when the sun set of this fantasy in 2008, many cities found themselves lumbered with zombie projects. It&apos;s not exactly possible to say that the scarred hulk of In Tempo, Europe&apos;s tallest apartment building, has robbed Benidorm of its understated charm. And the Dubai-esque twin towers are, incomplete, only a bit more of an eyesore than if they&apos;d been finished. But nobody likes a white elephant. And this is what In Tempo has become, as a new bank tries desperately to recoup some of the money originally sprayed at it by lenders Caixa Galicia. White elephants may not be popular, but they can have their charms. The ones that survive into old age can even end up being rather appealing. Let&apos;s take a look at nine more of the greatest wastes of money, time and space in modern history: Bridge to Russky Island            There&apos;s something characteristically Putinesque about this macho gesture, to link the 5,000 inhabitants of Russky Island with their neighbours in the larger city of Vladivostock (population 600,000). The bridge cost more than $1bn and was built by the federal government as part of preparations for the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation summit 2012, which lasted all of two days. Ryungyong Hotel Everyone&apos;s favourite modern-day white elephant, the Ryungyong Hotel, was begun in 1987 and still doesn&apos;t seem to have admitted any visitors. Dominating Pyongyang, it boasts 3,000 rooms, roughly the number of western tourists that visit North Korea in a year. Blenheim Palace     Blenheim Palace, Oxfordshire. Photograph: Alamy    It looks like it came off OK, doesn&apos;t it? But Blenheim was one of those &quot;problem palaces&quot; almost from the word go. In recognition of his achievements on the battlefield, a grateful nation and the queen promised to build the Duke of Marlborough a residence fit for a hero. Precisely what form that would take, and how much it would cost, was left a bit vague. Years of wrangling followed, with construction proceeding in fits and starts and not ending until after the Duke&apos;s death in 1722. New South China Mall If there&apos;s a building that could rival In Tempo for credit-crunch pathos, it&apos;s boomtime China&apos;s deserted giant mall in Dongguan. Opened in 2005, it was expected to welcome 100,000 visitors a day, but remains largely empty. Dongguan&apos;s inhabitants, mainly migrant workers, aren&apos;t yet rich enough to be able spend their Sundays wandering, increasingly hopeless, through claustrophobic corridors of tat. Brasilia     Brasilia's cathedral during its construction in the late 1950s. Photograph: HO/AFP/Getty Images    OK, this is a bit cheeky. But Brasilia, a whole city, is surely a contender for biggest white elephant of them all. Politicians had long dreamed of &quot;opening up the interior&quot; of the country, and planting a new capital in the middle of the Brazilian highlands seemed like a good way to go about it. And while architecture fans marvel at the purity of the vision, this doesn&apos;t change the fact that it&apos;s hundreds of miles from Brazil&apos;s main centres of industry and population. At weekends, those who can vote with their feet and head for S\u00e3o Paulo and Rio. Cincinnati subway The underground train system planned \u2013 and half built \u2013 for Cincinnati was another casualty of the economic storms of the 20s and 30s. Voted for by residents in 1916, the subway&apos;s original $6m budget was shot to pieces by inflation in the aftermath of the second world war. In the end, only 11 miles of the planned 16-mile route was completed, and no trains ever went anywhere. Henri Christophe&apos;s fortress     Aerial view of La Citadelle Laferriere, Haiti. Photograph: Getty    Henri Christophe, the black king of post-revolutionary Haiti, started building Citadelle La Ferri\u00e8re in 1805 to defend against French forces that he believed would try to take the island back. The largest fortress in the western hemisphere, it took 20,000 enslaved workers 15 years to build, and sits at the summit of a 900m peak. Not one of its hundreds of thousands of stockpiled cannonballs was ever fired. It remained unfinished at the time of Henri Christophe&apos;s death: in fact his corpse was pushed into a vat of quicklime used by builders, to stop it from being torn apart by vengeful mutineers. Maginot line The Maginot line was a clever ruse to prevent a German invasion of France which cost around 5bn francs and took 10 years to build in the 1930s. A series of state-of-the-art shelters and fortifications along the shared border, in the event the Germans just went around it, via Belgium. Ten days later they were in Paris. Columbia Road market     Columbia Road Market, from an engraving in the London Illustrated News.

Founded by Lady Burdett-Coutts in 1869, it was intended to provide space for costermongers from across the east end. Street sellers could not be lured into its cavernous gothic precincts, however, and it closed in 1884. It was finally demolished in 1958 after lying derelict for years.

The young man was an entrepreneur whose parents had emigrated to the UK in the 1960s. When he heard I lived in Poland, he said he employs &quot;a lot of Polish people because they&apos;re very cheap workers, the Chinese of Europe&quot;. Born to a Polish mother, I found his contemptuous tone annoying and inquired whether he&apos;d forgotten his parents were probably referred to in similarly unflattering terms when they came to the UK. &quot;When my parents arrived, they couldn&apos;t even find a roof over their heads,&quot; he retorted. &quot;Then, you still had British accommodation signs that read &apos;No coloureds, no dogs.&apos; Polish people don&apos;t have to go through all that, so don&apos;t expect me to feel sorry for them. Today they&apos;re at the bottom of the economic ladder. But in a decade, they will be lording it over the next big immigrant group \u2013 that&apos;s just the way this country works.&quot; I think back to that conversation every time the immigration debate rears its head. Of course, my friend was right when he said that today&apos;s eastern European migrants to the UK don&apos;t face the same kind of bare-faced racist abuse their non-white predecessors used to. But immigration sentiments ultimately boil down to socio-economics. When black South African mobs attack Zimbabwean immigrants in their country, they care little for the fact that those Zimbabweans look like them. What matters is that &quot;they are taking over our jobs because they accept low pay&quot;. Similar sentiments are now being expressed towards eastern Europeans by some Brits. I can see where such anger comes from. I currently work in Poland and if a wave of immigrants from say, neighbouring Ukraine, were to suddenly appear here and offer to do my job for half my salary, hell, I too wouldn&apos;t feel particularly well disposed towards them. Assurances that all this is &quot;good for the economy as a whole&quot; are unlikely to mollify me. But I might eventually change my mind if I were presented with a compelling argument. As of 2013, the EU&apos;s working-age population (15-64) has started falling, and will be smaller by 50 million people in 2060 compared with 2008. Meanwhile, the population aged 65-plus will increase by 67 million. Only today, a report by Britain&apos;s Office for Budget Responsibility warned that rising health, pension and social care costs connected to the country&apos;s ageing population will increasingly put pressure on the public purse. So either Europeans start having loads of children, which is unlikely, or the continent will have to import migrants to work for its pensioners. I have yet to hear of a logical alternative option. Europe is particularly bad at attracting highly skilled migrants. As of 2007, when a European Blue Card was proposed to remedy this, the EU&apos;s highly qualified workforce consisted of 0.9% non-EU workers, as opposed to 9.9% highly qualified foreign workers in Australia and 3.5% in the US. But how many people have even heard that such a programme exists? Moreover, several EU states have refused to sign up for it. It is in Europe&apos;s interest to change this. Many Europeans still assume that those coming here from Africa or Asia are by definition poor and dream of nothing but getting a piece of all those fat welfare cheques. A couple of months ago, about to visit the UAE, I was surprised to discover that while I needed a visa to enter Dubai with a Polish passport, my Nigerian citizenship guaranteed me visa-free entry. Why? Because every day hundreds of Nigerian tourists and businessfolk visit the city and leave some serious money there. The era of the perpetually poor African is over. Of course, respect must be mutual. The relationship between migrant and host society must be one of give and take. Otherwise, everyone ends up feeling short-changed. However, it is up to European politicians to stop being blind to reality and have the guts to tell their citizens the truth, namely that simply being born European no longer guarantees you a comfortable life. Due to its ageing population, alongside rapid development in the emerging world, Europe needs to do what it can to attract the migrants it badly needs today. Because if it waits till tomorrow, well, it might just turn out nobody is interested.", "title": "Even children of migrants forget the truth about immigration | Remi Adekoya", "sentences": ["A couple of months ago, about to visit the UAE, I was surprised to discover that while I needed a visa to enter Dubai with a Polish passport, my Nigerian citizenship guaranteed me visa-free entry."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-18T13:19:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/jul/18/tax-tribunal-avoidance-dp-world", "tags": ["Tax avoidance", "Corporate governance", "Business", "Dubai", "World news", "Dubai World"], "article": "A complex and aggressive attempt to avoid UK tax on an international ports business controlled by the billionaire ruler of Dubai has been thrown out by a tax tribunal, which branded the scheme &quot;an elaborate trick&quot;. The scheme would have secured \u00a314m in tax relief. It was devised in 2004 by P&amp;O, the ports business that was then independent and listed on the London stock exchange. Dubai-owned DP World, which acquired P&amp;O in 2006 for \u00a33.9m, had sought to appeal against the authorities&apos; rejection of the scheme. However, the appeal was rejected yesterday, with the tribunal judge calling it &quot;a scripted game of charades&quot;. DP World is 80% owned by Dubai World, which is controlled by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the prime minister of United Arab Emirates and monarch of Dubai. David Gauke, the UK Treasury minister, welcomed the tribunal decision, saying: &quot;I&apos;m delighted that HMRC has successfully defeated this attempt by a major company to artificially reduce its tax bill by exploiting an extremely complex international financial structure. The government has made it very clear that we won&apos;t put up with aggressive tax avoidance, and we have resourced HMRC to take on even the most complex and convoluted schemes, as this tribunal decision shows.&quot; The chancellor George Osborne and some of his fellow G20 finance ministers will hold a press conference in Moscow to welcome a 15-point OECD plan for action to tackle the growing problem of tax avoidance by multinational businesses. The finance ministers have already said they want to tackle the issue of big business avoidance structures that are a drain on countries&apos; tax receipts and allow larger firms to gain an unfair advantage over smaller competitors. The DP World tax avoidance plan \u2013 known as the &quot;Dear Simon scheme&quot; after a letter at the centre of the case \u2013 sought to exploit complex international treaty rules designed to facilitate global trade by making sure profits are not taxed twice in different jurisdictions. A flurry of transactions P&amp;O orchestrated among UK and Australian subsidiaries in October 2004 sought to create a UK tax credit for foreign tax payments artificially. Such avoidance structures are known as &quot;rate booster&quot; schemes in the tax avoidance industry. &quot;The Dear Simon scheme was designed and implemented for no reason other than tax avoidance,&quot; concluded Sir Stephen Oliver QC, the tribunal judge. &quot;It depended on the alchemy of turning share capital into distributable reserves almost overnight. The trick was written into the script of the charade.&quot; The &quot;Dear Simon&quot; letter, written by P&amp;O&apos;s then group tax manager to accountants, noted that the group had accumulated significant cash in an Australian subsidiary. &quot;The rate of underlying tax on the Australian profits is lower than might be expected,&quot; the letter said. It went on: &quot;\u2026 in order to keep our options open, we propose to put in place now a structure which will enable POAL [P&amp;O Australia Ltd] to receive a dividend from a UK company in the 2004 year, thereby enhancing the rate of tax which would underlie a dividend paid or payable by POAL this year.&quot; DP World is 80% owned by the government of Dubai through its Dubai World investment conglomerate. Among DP World&apos;s major investment projects is the development of the London Gateway container ship port in Thurrock, Essex, which is due to open later this year. Dubai World is behind some of the most extravagant development projects ever dreamed up, including Palm Islands, the towering Burj Dubai and the Arab Sail hotel. Also among its breathtaking developments has been $5bn Dubailand project, a Disney-like enterprise encompassing an indoor ski slope and an animal safari and amusement rides. Dubai World suffered a debt crisis in 2009 which led to a restructuring two years later.

Here is how it can be done. New fuel-efficient aircraft, the use of sustainable alternative fuels and more efficient flight routings mean air traffic could double without increasing emissions. If international carbon trading is added to these factors then emissions would reduce, achieving the global aviation industry&apos;s commitment to halve emissions by 2050. The independent Committee on Climate Change has advised the government that if the UK is to meet its climate change targets then passenger numbers should not increase by more than 60% by 2050. A third runway at Heathrow would deliver only around one-third of this amount. Also, constraining capacity at the UK&apos;s only hub airport is a bad way to tackle emissions. Not only does it lead to wasteful emissions from aircraft circling London waiting to land, it means passengers who want to travel from the UK to China are forced to fly via a European or Middle Eastern hub instead, taking two flights instead of one and flying further for longer. The journey from Newcastle to Beijing, for example, is 1,800 miles longer via Dubai than via Heathrow. From a carbon point of view, the most efficient place for airport capacity is next to the greatest centre of population. For Europe, that is London and the south-east. Britain&apos;s carbon targets are important and we are committed to playing our part in delivering them. But they will be mere window-dressing if they are delivered at the cost of increasing global emissions. It is time for a more sophisticated approach. Colin MatthewsChief executive, Heathrow \u2022 Britain is a trading nation and requires a globally competitive hub airport. Heathrow cannot be that airport. An expanded Heathrow would have horrendous implications for noise and air quality. We must stop trying to fit a quart into a pint pot and look east. On Monday the mayor and Transport for London laid out three options for building a new four-runway hub airport. There are advantages to each of the three schemes but, whether the Davies commission chooses an expanded Stansted, an airport on the Isle of Grain or an island airport in the Thames estuary, those who oppose Heathrow expansion should unite in favour of a viable alternative or they play into Heathrow&apos;s hands.Richard TraceyGLA Conservatives transport spokesman  \u2022 Boris Johnson would turn Heathrow into housing, which would give him happy voters in those areas relieved of noise and pollution. Then he&apos;d build new capacity, and rip up even more land to build the new transport links that would be needed to get people from airport to London. By some amazing stroke of luck, none of those blighted by these proposals vote in London elections. Either he really does have a giant intellect and is stunningly cynical, even for a politician or\u2026 Perhaps others can supply those suggestions.Christopher AireyGood Easter, Essex \u2022 There is already a fully operational third runway just six miles north of Heathrow with most of the buildings necessary to handle passengers. It is called Northolt. It could be connected to Heathrow by a relatively low-cost transport system and become a satellite for domestic and short-haul flights. In 1952, Northolt handled some 50,000 aircraft movements, making it the busiest airport in Europe. Is there any reason why it cannot repeat the exercise and save a lot of money and destruction of homes?Martyn DayTwickenham, Middlesex", "title": "Letters: How an expanded Heathrow would help tackle emissions", "sentences": ["The journey from Newcastle to Beijing, for example, is 1,800 miles longer via Dubai than via Heathrow."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-18T19:59:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/18/the-open-2013-rory-mcilroy", "tags": ["The Open 2013", "Rory McIlroy", "Golf", "The Open", "Sport"], "article": "One hopes Rory McIlroy is as philosophical behind closed doors as he is in front of the cameras. After 18 long and arduous holes that must have felt like Groundhog Day for the world No2 this year, McIlroy emerged to face the music in the same stoic manner he has throughout the most testing period of his career. &quot;I wish I could stand up here and tell you guys what&apos;s wrong or what I need to do to make it right, because I feel like I&apos;ve got the shots,&quot; McIlroy said on Thursday after ending the afternoon eight over par and at serious risk of missing the Open cut for the first time. &quot;It&apos;s just a matter of going through the right thought process to hit them and that&apos;s something that I obviously haven&apos;t been doing recently.&quot; It was the most miserable of days for the Northern Irishman under the sweltering Scottish sun. His opening 79 is one stroke short of his worst round at an Open, which came at St Andrews three years ago, but the sense of inevitability that preceded it made the tortuous demise even more alarming. There was no pride before this fall, no claims that he was confident of lifting the Claret Jug and ending a rut that began with a change of clubs at the beginning of the year. Instead, McIlroy shrugged off questions on Wednesday about his dip in form with refreshing honesty. &quot;I&apos;ve got a good life,&quot; he said. &quot;It doesn&apos;t bother me.&quot; It was perhaps ironic that the man who raised those concerns, Sir Nick Faldo, ended the day matching McIlroy&apos;s total. Faldo may be a three-times Open champion but the 56-year-old rarely features on tour and has almost completely turned his back on competitive golf . McIlroy was only one over through the opening nine after clawing a shot back thanks to an accurate tee shot on the par-three 7th. However, there had previously been warning signs after bogeys at the 4th and 5th and, after sliding a birdie putt tantalisingly past the cup on the 9th, what followed after the turn must rank alongside the worst nine holes he has ever played. A chip left short on the 10th resulted in a bogey before disaster struck at the 379-yard 12th. McIlroy sent his approach over the back of the green and then fluffed his chip out of the semi-rough, the ball rolling agonisingly back to an almost identical position. His response was an over-zealous bump and run that flew 20ft past the hole and a two-putt to follow. Worse was to come. Despite fighting back with a fine tee-shot on the par-three 13th that left a simple finish, his second double-bogey of the day on 15 was inexplicable. McIlroy found a fairway trap from the tee but managed to creep up to the front apron with his approach, only to fire his putt past the hole and watch it slide into a bunker on the opposite side of the green. The last two holes provided two more dropped shots and, having hit just 35% of fairways in regulation, there was almost a sense of relief when the 24-year-old walked off the 18th green to sign for a back nine of 42. &quot;All you&apos;re trying to do is get the ball in the hole in the least amount of shots as possible,&quot; he said. &quot;I can&apos;t really fathom it at the minute and it&apos;s hard to stand up here and tell you what&apos;s really wrong. &quot;I feel like I made a lot of progress over the last couple of weeks and then shooting a round like this is obviously not what you want. You&apos;ve got to go back to the drawing board and think about what you need to do differently or what you need to do better to improve.&quot; The imperious performances of last season seem a distant memory. McIlroy&apos;s record win at the US PGA Championship and victory in the Race to Dubai have been followed this year by a walk-off at the Honda Classic and a 25th-place finish in Augusta. The legal fallout from his split from the management company Horizon Sports is ongoing, while speculation continues to rage that his Nike clubs, part of a lucrative sponsorship deal agreed with the brand, have caused the dip in form. His playing partners, Phil Mickelson and Hideki Matsuyama, fared much better and McIlroy&apos;s display prompted him to concede that a trip to a sports psychologist is perhaps the next step. It may be exactly what is required. McIlroy has worked before with Dr Bob Rotella. &quot;I&apos;m definitely under-thinking on the golf course, maybe over-thinking it off of it,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;It&apos;s just something I&apos;ve never experienced before.&quot; Rotella writes on his website: &quot;one of the reasons I love golf is the never-ending, ever-changing challenge it presents.&quot; For McIlroy, that change cannot come soon enough.", "title": "The Open 2013: Rory McIlroy down and probably out after more misery", "sentences": ["McIlroy&apos;s record win at the US PGA Championship and victory in the Race to Dubai have been followed this year by a walk-off at the Honda Classic and a 25th-place finish in Augusta."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-18T23:17:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jul/19/dubai-releases-britons-tortured-jailed-drugs", "tags": ["Dubai", "World news", "UK news", "London"], "article": "Three British men who say they were tortured in Dubai before being found guilty of possessing drugs have been pardoned under a Ramadan amnesty three months into their four-year prison sentences. Grant Cameron, Suneet Jeerh and Karl Williams were jailed in April for possessing a quantity of synthetic cannabis known as spice. They said they were given electric shocks and had guns held to their heads during a seven-month period when they were held without trial. The London men were pardoned a year after they were arrested when drugs were found in their car while on holiday in the United Arab Emirates. They denied charges of &quot;consumption and possession with intent to distribute&quot;. Cameron is now back in London, while Jeerh and Williams are awaiting deportation from Dubai. In a statement issued through the human rights charity Reprieve, which has been campaigning for the men&apos;s release, Cameron&apos;s mother, Tracy, said: &quot;After a year of waiting, we are deeply relieved and overjoyed to have Grant back home with us after his terrible ordeal. We hope that his friends Karl and Suneet will soon also be safely back in Britain. &quot;Obviously what Grant has been through has been very distressing for him, and the family as a whole. We&apos;d ask that people give him the time, space and privacy he needs to settle back in.&quot; In April Tracy Cameron said her son and his friends had been Tasered and beaten. In Williams&apos; witness statement he said his testicles had been electrocuted during interrogation by the police. The men&apos;s lawyers said they were forced at gunpoint to sign documents in Arabic, which none of them understands. The Emirati police deny the allegations. The Jeerh family was reluctant to discuss Suneet&apos;s case until he had safely returned to the UK. His brother Aneet said: &quot;It&apos;s all up in the air. He&apos;s in better spirits than he was three weeks ago, when there was a big black cloud hanging over them and they didn&apos;t know which way the events were going to turn. &quot;We always knew that they [the Emirates authorities] were not going to admit that they made a mistake. But sending them home is their way of squashing the other issues that have come out of this case.&quot; Reprieve investigator Kate Higham said: &quot;After everything Grant has been through, his release is welcome but long overdue. No one should have to go through what he experienced, and we are glad that he is safely back home.&quot; The men&apos;s allegations of torture were raised by the prime minister, David Cameron, during a state visit in April by the UAE president, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan. This week the sheikh freed the men under an amnesty timed to coincide with the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. A spokeswoman for the Foreign Office said she could not discuss individual cases, but added: &quot;We are aware that the 2013 amnesty list has been announced in the United Arab Emirates and that the local authorities have begun the process of releasing those included. This will continue to come as welcome news for those included and their families. We will continue to provide appropriate consular assistance.&quot; Figures released by the Foreign Office showed that many Britons had fallen foul of the UAE&apos;s tough drug laws. The British embassy in Dubai helped 257 Britons who were arrested or detained on drugs charges in the last year. This represented almost half the embassy&apos;s caseload.

The three proposed locations to the south of the current site were included in a submission to the Airports Commission before last Friday&apos;s deadline, but published on Tuesday to coincide with a meeting with a local consultative committee. West Sussex county council has voted to back the proposed expansion of London&apos;s second airport, giving Gatwick a unique measure of support among those competing for the approval of the commission. However, campaigners and residents groups vowed to step up opposition. Gatwick has drawn up rough plans for runways in three positions to the south of the existing airport. The options at a greater distance from the existing runway allow for more flexible use and more passengers \u2013 up to 87 million a year from the current capacity of 34.2 million \u2013 but at a greater cost in terms of swallowing up surrounding countryside and houses and extending the noise footprint. Gatwick says the maximum number of residents substantially affected by noise would be 11,000 \u2013 less than 5% of the total affected by aircraft noise at Heathrow. Stewart Wingate, Gatwick&apos;s chief executive, said the airport&apos;s submission would strongly argue against the need for a single hub airport such as Heathrow or Boris Johnson&apos;s Thames estuary site, and in favour of expanding Gatwick and then Stansted. He said: &quot;We fundamentally believe in the &apos;constellation&apos; approach. Gatwick getting the next runway will have the airports and airlines competing with one another, and it will provide the same level of connectivity as a mega-hub would. &quot;When we look at Moscow, Tokyo, Beijing \u2013 they are all world cities and are served by a constellation of airports. Mega-hubs tend to be in places like Atlanta or Dubai where the population is less than 2 million. For world cities it&apos;s our strong contention that competing airports is what&apos;s needed.&quot; He claimed Heathrow exaggerated its reliance on transfer traffic, where passengers fly into the airport before switching to long-haul services. But Gatwick has also put forward the possibility of the airport becoming a national mega-hub. In one paragraph of its submission to the Sir Howard Davies-led commission, the airport states: &quot;Construction of a second runway to the south of Gatwick would not prevent a further runway subsequently being developed to the north, if the latter was ever to be needed. A Gatwick southern runway, therefore, provides long-term flexibility, and should the Airports Commission decide that it wishes to investigate in more detail the development of a &apos;mega-hub&apos; in the south-east, then it would be appropriate for the commission to request information and/or submissions about the capability of Gatwick to deliver such a development.&quot; Brendon Sewill, chairman of the Gatwick Area Conservation Campaign, said: &quot;When people begin to realise what is likely to hit them, there will be a tidal wave of public resistance.&quot; He said attempts to match Heathrow had previously ended in bankruptcy or failure, adding: &quot;The plans confirm that Gatwick is too small ever to provide an efficient airport.&quot;", "title": "Gatwick second runway plans revealed", "sentences": ["Mega-hubs tend to be in places like Atlanta or Dubai where the population is less than 2 million."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-23T11:35:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/23/st-nicholas-abbey-crucial-surgery", "tags": ["King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes", "Aidan O'Brien", "Horse racing", "Johnny Murtagh", "Sport"], "article": "Cirrus Des Aigles was the clear market leader on Tuesday for the King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on Saturday following the defection of the favourite, St Nicholas Abbey, who suffered a career-ending injury at Ballydoyle earlier in the day.

With his racing career now over, owners John Magnier, Michael Tabor and Derrick Smith are hopeful their vets can save St Nicholas Abbey for a stud career but Coolmore Stud warned: &quot;The operation to stabilise and repair [the horse&apos;s pastern] will be long and complicated - we will need a bit of luck.&quot; A son of champion sire Montjeu, he was champion two-year-old in 2009 after winning the Racing Post Trophy and was strongly fancied for the 2,000 Guineas the following year, but could finish only sixth behind Makfi, and was not seen again until the following April when he was beaten at The Curragh. He returned to something like his juvenile form when an easy winner of the Ormonde Stakes at Chester and went on to further Group One glory in the Coronation Cup at Epsom, a race he went on to win twice more.

Kevin McGeever also faces charges of making a false complaint about his disappearance, last June. The 68-year-old appeared before Judge Geoffrey Browne at Strokestown district court on Wednesday. He was charged under sections 12a and 12b of the Irish Republic&apos;s 1976 Criminal Law Act. He was taken to Gort Garda station, in Galway, where he was charged with both counts at 10.35pm. He made no reply to either charge. Castlerea garda inspector Padraig Jones said garda\u00ed had no objection to bail but requested a number of conditions. These included an independent surety of \u20ac10,000 (\u00a38,600), \u20ac3,000 of it in cash; he must also provide his own bond, of \u20ac2,500. McGeever was ordered to sign on three times a week, on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, at a garda station to be nominated once the home address was given. He must sign on between 7am and 10pm. The one-time property developer was remanded in custody with consent to bail. His case was adjourned until 26 July at Harristown court. McGeever was not seen for eight months after he was reported missing in County Galway in June 2012. He was found, with an insult allegedly carved into his head, and with long hair, an unkempt beard and long fingernails, on the Leitrim-Cavan border by a woman driving past. The former helicopter-flying, Porsche-driving personification of the so-called Celtic Tiger boom was reported missing from his luxury mansion by his partner last spring. When he turned up again McGeever reportedly told garda\u00ed he had been abducted by three masked and armed men from his mansion in rural Galway in May. He told officers the kidnappers had demanded a ransom for his safe release but he did not know whether one had been paid, it was reported. The property developer said he could not remember what had happened to him since, but, as he was being released, he had been given a mobile phone, and been told to keep it with him at all times.

In 2011, a resident had been trying to meet with me at my ward surgery for several weeks but a family illness, flooding and road closures prevented this. At the third attempt I was asked: &quot;Do you Skype?&quot; Our meeting went ahead that evening over Skype from our respective homes. The key to using technology such as this as a councillor is very simple. Social media, and other new communication devices, offer additional opportunities for you to connect, create networks and build relationships. Keeping up to date with changes to the way people communicate is also important. After all, research estimates that every 60 seconds more than 320 new Twitter accounts are created and approximately 370,000 minutes of calls are being made on Skype. There are a lot of benefits to using Skype to connect with residents. It means you can get in touch with people you wouldn&apos;t normally engage with. Your role becomes more interesting: from my back garden I&apos;ve conducted Skype ward surgeries with residents working in Dubai. There&apos;s also an opportunity to present a more rounded picture of yourself \u2013 your personality, your interests and what you&apos;re passionate about, while learning more about the community you serve. If you are thinking of embarking on setting up an online ward surgery \u2013 here are some tips: \u2022 Get comfortable with the tech. Before you publicise your Skype ward surgery \u2013 do a few test runs with colleagues, friends or family. \u2022 Ask for feedback. This will help you to improve how you come across when using the camera and microphone. \u2022 Get your timing right. In my ward, many people are not at home during the day and so my Skype ward surgeries are held on a Sunday evening. \u2022 Publicise your Skype ward surgery. As with all ward surgeries, you should publicise your Skype ward surgery. I use every opportunity, such as the council&apos;s magazine and online areas. \u2022 Setting up and preparing. You will need to agree the time slot for your Skype chat \u2013 this can be done via telephone, direct messaging or email. \u2022 Prepare as you would for a traditional surgery. Try and find out what issue the resident wants to discuss and set aside time to research background information so you can have an informed discussion. \u2022 Limit distractions. Ensure neither your personal appearance nor your environment has any unnecessary background distractions. \u2022 Schedule follow-up time. A Skype ward surgery is no different to a traditional one. It&apos;s likely to generate further work, which needs to be programmed into your work schedule. Reflecting on my use of different online communication platforms for nearly five years, I also offer a few health warnings: having a presence on the internet will change your workload; I estimate about 40% of my caseload now comes in via online activity. For convenience, most councillors I know use their own personal tech and contracts rather than the local authority issue \u2013 this needs to change. Being active online also invites comments, observations and interactions. Although few and far between, I block any abusive or aggressive tweets or interactions. Skype is another way to build a relationship with residents, perhaps those who previously would not have chosen to engage with me through traditional ward surgeries or the council. It&apos;s a great way to get and stay connected and I would urge you to give it a try.

The Authority also said that it is satisfied that Zarooni, who was banned from the sport for eight years in April, was &quot;solely responsible&quot; for the widespread and systematic abuse of anabolic steroids at his yard, and that &quot;no evidence&quot; has since emerged to suggest otherwise. Following the announcement on Thursday that the BHA&apos;s investigation into the Zarooni scandal has now concluded, Charlie Appleby, the disgraced trainer&apos;s former assistant, has been licensed to run Moulton Paddocks for the remainder of the Flat season. Appleby was one of several Godolphin employees interviewed by the BHA during the course of its investigation, along with Simon Crisford, the operation&apos;s racing manager since its inception nearly 20 years ago, and Oliver Costello, Zarooni&apos;s former head lad. The authority did not interview, or seek to interview, Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai and founder of Godolphin, while Zarooni himself offered no further assistance to the inquiry, despite &quot;several attempts&quot; by the authority to make contact with him. Nonetheless the BHA has concluded that &quot;it is sensible to assume&quot; that Zarooni was solely responsible both for the 15 positive results for anabolic steroids which formed the basis of its original inquiry and for seven further positives which emerged following subsequent tests at the yard. The BHA&apos;s report to Godolphin following the conclusion of its inquiry paints a picture of a huge and complicated organisation in which a number of the basic principles of stable management appear to have been forgotten or ignored. &quot;The fact that several stable employees can administer anabolic steroids to a number of horses over a period of weeks without drawing the attention of the head lad, assistant trainer or veterinary surgeons,&quot; the report says, &quot;suggests something was seriously wrong with the management structure in place. &quot;It is a significant shortcoming that those in senior positions do not seem to have been in a position to have carried out active supervision of those staff more junior than them. In fact, they appear to have been deliberately sidelined by Mr [Al] Zarooni and were not tasked to perform the typical functions one would expect from persons in such roles.&quot; The BHA report also recommends the implementation of a series of changes at Moulton Paddocks following Appleby&apos;s promotion to take over from his former boss. These include the establishment of a management structure with &quot;clearly defined roles and responsibilities for all individuals&quot;, simplification of feeding and medication regimes and close monitoring of recording and storage procedures for medications. In a statement issued with the BHA&apos;s summary of its findings Paul Bittar, the regulator&apos;s chief executive, said that he is satisfied that &quot;the conclusions reached are an accurate reflection of events&quot;. Bittar added: &quot;While we believe the sport&apos;s independent regulation has stood up throughout this process, the BHA is committed to fight against those who attempt to cheat the sport. The BHA&apos;s anti-doping budget has, due to the broader economics of the sport, undergone a significant reduction in recent years and this case highlights the need to ensure we remain at the forefront of world racing in terms of our programme and resources.&quot; In a supporting document to its press release the BHA said that it is &quot;impossible to be 100% certain&quot; how long Zarooni had been using steroids on his horses and that since he had &quot;left the country and was not responding to direct efforts to contact him, it was not considered the best use of the sport&apos;s funds and resources&quot;. However, the authority insisted that the use of steroids in racing is &quot;incredibly rare&quot; and that it will &quot;carry out both announced and unannounced visits [to Moulton Paddocks] to carry out testing in training and monitor how the yard has progressed with the implementation of changes&quot; as a result of its report. In a statement published on Godolphin&apos;s website Appleby said: &quot;Taking on this role as one of the faces of Godolphin, I am very lucky in knowing Godolphin inside out. I am not afraid of the extra responsibility and have great support from everybody within Godolphin.&quot;", "title": "Godolphin criticised by BHA over stable's steroids doping case", "sentences": ["The authority did not interview, or seek to interview, Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai and founder of Godolphin, while Zarooni himself offered no further assistance to the inquiry, despite &quot;several attempts&quot; by the authority to make contact with him."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-25T19:54:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/jul/25/godolphin-british-horseracing-authority", "tags": ["Godolphin", "British Horseracing Authority", "Drugs in sport", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "The scale of the British Horseracing Authority&apos;s failure fully to investigate the doping scandal at Moulton Paddocks in the first few months of this year is summed up in a single sentence from its report to the Godolphin operation, which paid Mahmood al-Zarooni&apos;s wages for three years until his systematic cheating was uncovered in April. The sentence refers to seven positive samples for steroids \u2013 including one returned by Encke, last year&apos;s St Leger winner - which were found when the entire string at Moulton Paddocks was tested for performance-enhancing drugs in the days after Zarooni was ejected from racing for eight years on 25 April. &quot;With regard to the seven further positive samples reported on 20th May 2013,&quot; the report says, &quot;in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it is sensible to assume that Mr [Al] Zarooni was responsible for them.&quot; There are many suitable words to describe the BHA&apos;s assumption fairly but sensible is not among them. Na\u00efve, irresponsible and convenient are all a much better fit because this latest \u2013 and, so the Authority hopes, final \u2013 account of what went on at Zarooni&apos;s stable scarcely advances our knowledge or understanding at all. The seven subsequent positives are in many respects a more significant chapter in the Zarooni story than the 15 which appeared on his charge sheet back in April. Eleven of these horses produced positive samples for anabolic steroids when BHA investigators tested 45 horses on 9 April, while four more were offered up by Zarooni himself on a handwritten \u2013 and supposedly complete \u2013 list of the horses he had &quot;juiced&quot;. This allowed the BHA to depict Zarooni as a lone, rogue operator, possibly warped by the pressure to get results, who suddenly conceived a plan to cheat with performance-enhancing drugs and effectively bullied a handful of his subordinates into carrying it out. It could also position itself as tough, decisive regulator, which had caught and punished the wrong-doer in the space of days and weeks rather than months and years. It seemed extraordinary from the outset that a Classic-winning trainer could turn rotten overnight and then devise and launch the most extensive steroid-doping operation in turf history despite spending almost the entire winter in Dubai. But if the subsequent, wholesale testing of his string had returned no further positives, this leaking wreck of a narrative might just have stayed afloat long enough for everyone to forget about Zarooni and move on. But they did find more positives, for stanozolol, which was Zarooni&apos;s steroid of choice for colts and persists in a horse&apos;s system for up to three weeks. This in turn suggested that there would have been several more, at least, for ethylestranol, which is used on fillies and is out of the system in a week, had the wholesale tests been conducted a fortnight earlier. Zarooni&apos;s handwritten note, in other words, was baloney and the BHA&apos;s account of his activity capsized along with it. The doping at Moulton Paddocks was clearly far more extensive than anyone bar those responsible realised three months ago. This, in turn, made it all the more implausible that Zarooni had launched the doping programme almost overnight or conducted it by proxy from 3,000 miles away. Yet as Robin Mounsey, the BHA&apos;s spokesman, confirmed on Thursday evening, &quot;the only time when Mahmood al-Zarooni was in the country over the entire winter period were [sic] for a few days immediately after 10th March, for the period when the events unfolded as described in the DP [disciplinary panel] findings. He then returned to Dubai after a few days until he came back after [Dubai] World Cup day [on 30 March, barely a week before the BHA testers arrived].&quot; &quot;A few days&quot;, to wreak such havoc, and yet the BHA still maintains that its account of the Moulton Paddock dopings is both credible and as complete as possible, since there is &quot;no evidence&quot; to the contrary. As for what it has been doing for the last three months to turn up such evidence, we have little more than a list of the interviewees, and even that excludes Zarooni himself who, oddly enough, could not be tracked down. It is a shambolic situation but one which the BHA will now attempt to tiptoe away from over the coming days and weeks. As things stand, it will probably succeed.", "title": "BHA and Godolphin still have questions to answer in steroids case", "sentences": ["It seemed extraordinary from the outset that a Classic-winning trainer could turn rotten overnight and then devise and launch the most extensive steroid-doping operation in turf history despite spending almost the entire winter in Dubai.", "He then returned to Dubai after a few days until he came back after [Dubai] World Cup day [on 30 March, barely a week before the BHA testers arrived].&quot; &quot;A few days&quot;, to wreak such havoc, and yet the BHA still maintains that its account of the Moulton Paddock dopings is both credible and as complete as possible, since there is &quot;no evidence&quot; to the contrary."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-25T20:03:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/26/cirrus-des-aigles-king-george-ascot", "tags": ["King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "For a horse who has earned a little over \u00a34m, Cirrus Des Aigles has spent too much time in second place. He has finished first in 16 races but has also been the runner-up in 17, and in 2012, he picked an unfortunate year to be the second-best horse on the planet. It was Frankel first and the rest nowhere, for all that Cirrus Des Aigles ran the great champion to less than three lengths in his last race at Ascot. But there will be no Frankel to upstage him at Ascot on Saturday afternoon, when the day and the moment will be his to seize in the King George VI &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes, the 47th race of his career. Cirrus Des Aigles has replaced Frankel as the highest-rated horse in training, and victory in Ascot&apos;s midsummer showpiece could be enough to keep him there until the final numbers for 2013 are published early next year. If nothing else, this could be the best chance Cirrus Des Aigles will get to stamp his authority on the season because, unlike Frankel, he will never retire to stud. He was gelded early in his racing career, and as a result is barred from running in Europe&apos;s most prestigious middle-distance race, the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe. If he is to win a European Group One at 12 furlongs, Saturday will need to be the day. &quot;It&apos;s the French way to do things, and sometimes the French are a bit complicated,&quot; Corine Barande-Barbe, who trains Cirrus Des Aigles in Chantilly, said this week. &quot;The rules are probably there to make stallions, but sometimes, when the colts are not the best, it is a mare or a filly that wins. &quot;I regret that if you have the best horse in the country, you can&apos;t run in the best race in your country, it&apos;s a pity. Last year he finished second in the world rankings and he could not run in the best race in France. It&apos;s stupid, when even being second to Cirrus Des Aigles can have a big effect on a horse&apos;s value, because he is one of the best in the world.&quot; Barande-Barbe has no regrets about the decision to geld Cirrus Des Aigles in the first place, however, since it was part of the process of harnessing his talent. &quot;You can&apos;t have everything, especially when you are a very little stable,&quot; she says. &quot;Maybe if he were an entire, he would have been sold for a very big price and I wouldn&apos;t have him any more. He&apos;s a racehorse, and his career lasts longer as a gelding. &quot;In his case, he was much easier after being gelded. Before he was much too free. Running and trying to win is the main thing for geldings, they are not troubled by any compulsions. They are easier to handle, they don&apos;t have the problems that males can have, a very logical problem. &quot;When you buy sand, you buy stones, and when you buy meat, you buy bone. You can&apos;t have everything and we have quite a lot with him.&quot; Cirrus Des Aigles is certain to start favourite at Ascot on Saturday following a career-ending injury sustained by St Nicholas Abbey earlier in this week. Should the French gelding bank the first prize of \u00a3604,000, his total career earnings would advance to \u00a34.72m, and either first or second place in the Qipco Champion Stakes in October, a race he won in 2011, could make him the first European-trained horse to pass \u00a35m in earnings. Success would require some improvement on his last run, however, when he was only fifth to Novellist, who re-opposes on Saturday, when making his seasonal debut in the Grand Prix de Saint-Cloud. &quot;He wasn&apos;t at his best there,&quot; Barande-Barbe says. &quot;I gave him a long, long rest after Hong Kong [where he suffered an injury while being prepared for a race in December]. He was always walking, never stopped in the box, but it was a long rest so he needed [the race] at Saint-Cloud. If it had been the week before, I couldn&apos;t have run him. &quot;He&apos;s much nearer 100% now, and he is never at his best in his first race of the season \u2013 his first race is always his worst race. He was beaten first time out before winning [the Sheema Classic] in Dubai [in March 2012], so I&apos;m not worried about that. He gets fit with racing and competition and work. &quot;What makes him so good is his speed. He can be placed at any point in the race, and he could probably win at long distances too as he is so relaxed. I&apos;m always confident in this horse, he just loves racing and he knows much more than me about all this. He is a natural fighter.&quot; The King George &amp; Queen Elizabeth Stakes is part of the Qipco British Champions Series which culminates on British Champions Day at Ascot on 19 October.

But he has used the proceeds from the export of bottles of Duchy Originals water from a Scottish estate close to Balmoral to luxury supermarkets in the Gulf to fund his favoured charities. It is part of a sales drive for the prince&apos;s groceries brand in conjunction with Waitrose which has delivered \u00a310m in profits over the past three years. Luxury Duchy Originals hampers, including bottles of lemon and ginger drinks, are also on sale at the SuperNature grocery 10,000 miles away by sea in Singapore, while bottles of Duchy-branded organic ale made with barley from the prince&apos;s Home Farm at Highgrove are being offered by drinks retailers in Australia and New Zealand. Environmentalists have called for the prince to bring the trade to an immediate halt. &quot;Shipping bottles of water around the world is completely insane,&quot; said Craig Bennett, director of policy and campaigns at Friends of the Earth. &quot;It is absolutely ludicrous when there is perfectly good drinking water in the Middle East. It is very hard to dress up shipping water thousands of miles as helping the environment.&quot; The story has emerged 52 months after Charles made an apocalyptic speech in Rio de Janeiro warning that the world had &quot;less than 100 months to alter our behaviour before we risk catastrophic climate change&quot;. The Royal Deeside water is shipped from Aberdeenshire to branches of Spinneys in Dubai, Bahrain and Abu Dhabi. Waitrose declined to say how much goes to the Gulf because of &quot;commercial sensitivity&quot; but said it was &quot;very small&quot;. One thousand cases sent via the Suez canal would produce an estimated 1.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide. Jeanette Longfield, co-ordinator of Sustain, a campaign for sustainable food policies, said shipping water was &quot;lunacy&quot;. &quot;Once this is drawn to Prince Charles&apos;s attention I would hope he will decide this is not a good idea,&quot; she said. Prince Charles has cast himself as a protector of the environment. Duchy Originals, set up by the prince in 1990 &quot;to promote organic food and farming and to help protect and sustain the countryside and wildlife&quot;, began exporting in earnest after signing the Waitrose deal. It publishes a charter that explains: &quot;We aim for the smallest environmental footprint.&quot; The Prince of Wales&apos;s Charitable Foundation last year gave \u00a3200,000 to the Soil Association, which campaigns to &quot;minimise the local and global ecological footprint&quot; of food. A spokesman for the prince said: &quot;The Prince of Wales is aware that Waitrose is committed to reducing its environmental impact wherever possible. Duchy Originals from Waitrose has so far donated around \u00a33m a year to the Prince&apos;s Charitable Foundation, a grant-giving charity, and to the Prince&apos;s Countryside Fund, which supports Britain&apos;s hard pressed rural communities.&quot; The majority of royalties are generated from the sale of Duchy products in UK supermarkets but profits of around \u00a345,000 came from exports, including some that are air-freighted. A spokeswoman for Waitrose said: &quot;We are committed to reducing our environmental impact. The vast majority of products we export are sea-freighted, with less than 1% of our Duchy Originals from Waitrose exports air-freighted, which makes sense from an environmental and a commercial perspective.&quot; Waitrose said it did not directly supply Duchy Originals hampers to Singapore or Duchy beer to the Middle East.

Charlie Appleby, the replacement for the doper Mahmood al-Zarooni, his former boss, will saddle his first four runners from the yard on Saturday, while Appleby can also look forward to a Group race campaign for Zibelina, the 14-1 winner of the Listed Valiant Stakes here on Friday. Zibelina went into the feature race on the first day of the King George meeting with the lowest Timeform rating of the 10 runners, but she also carried the large &quot;P&quot; that marks a horse with unusual potential, thanks to a 10-length win on her only previous start in a Newcastle maiden. The outcome was not so decisive on Friday, but confirmed Zibelina&apos;s potential all the same as she emerged from a duel with Ultrasonic, a year her senior and a veteran of 13 starts, to win by a length and a half. Andrea Mascolo, representing Godolphin, could confirm only that she will be part of Appleby&apos;s team at Moulton Paddocks, but a move up to Group races looks inevitable. For Ahmed Ajtebi, who rode the winner, this was perhaps a fresh start too. Between 2009 and 2011, Ajtebi was a regular member of Godolphin&apos;s team of jockeys and recorded big-race wins including the 2009 Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile at Santa Anita on Vale Of York. He has faded from view over the last 18 months, however, and had just 41 rides in Britain last year, while this was Ajtebi&apos;s first winner from six rides here in 2013. &quot;I came here for two or three weeks at the start of the season and then went back to Dubai,&quot; Ajtebi said. &quot;I came back about 12 days ago and Godolphin have given me some good rides, so I hope I can keep it going. [Zibelina] was keen on the way to the start, but she picked up very well.&quot; Appleby, who has been a Godolphin employee for nearly 15 years, has four declared runners on Saturday&apos;s cards as he sets out on his training career. His first runner will be Velvety in a fillies&apos; handicap at York, while he is also responsible for Stalactite and Greek War at Newmarket, and Safety Check in the Listed Winkfield Stakes here. The most interesting race on the supporting card here was possibly the fillies&apos; maiden at the start of the afternoon, which included several impeccably bred newcomers, most of whom looked the part in the paddock too. Psychometry, who runs in the blue and white colours of the Niarchos family, was sent off as favourite to make a winning debut, but despite passing most of the field in the straight, she could not chase down Lilyfire, who was also making her first trip to the track. &quot;She had been showing promise and there are plenty of nice options for her,&quot; Roger Charlton, the winner&apos;s trainer, said, &quot;but she won&apos;t be over-raced this season.&quot; St Nicholas Abbey, who sustained a career-ending injury earlier this week, has suffered a setback in his recovery from emergency surgery on a fractured leg. Coolmore Stud, where it is hoped that St Nicholas Abbey will be able to stand as a stallion, said in a statement on Twitter on Friday afternoon that the six-year-old had &quot;a major setback in his recovery during the night, suffering from a bad colic.

Warren Brennan, the founder of the Australian company behind Hot Spot, BBG Sports, believes the combination of infra-red and audio technology would all but eliminate doubt about whether a batsman has edged the ball, either on to his pads or for a catch. &quot;Snicko&quot; is a tool used only for television but Brennan&apos;s English partner, Alan Plaskett, has developed what is called Real Time Snicko, an improvement on the previous technology which furnishes the third umpire with details within seconds rather than minutes. It was the slowness of the old system, rather than its accuracy, that stopped the ICC adopting it. &quot;I have spent the last two months in Britain helping trial Real Time Snicko,&quot; said Brennan from Dubai. &quot;We have tested it in the Champions Trophy and the series against New Zealand as well as the Ashes. No technology will ever be 100% but RTS in conjunction with Hot Spot comes very, very close. When Ashton Agar edged a ball at Lord&apos;s, Hot Spot did not reveal any contact with the bat; Snicko did. &quot;It is a second reference point for the third umpire and one which he would now be able to access within 10 seconds of an appeal. We made a presentation to the ICC five weeks ago and I am meeting officials on Sunday to give them the results of the trial. I am sure they would want an independent evaluation before making it part of the review system but I hope it will become part of DRS before the end of the year.&quot; The first Test of the winter Ashes series begins in Brisbane on 21 November. Hot Spot, which has been used by the ICC since 2006, is not cheap. The four-camera system costs around \u00a37,500 a day, three times more than RTS. The bill is paid by television companies, with the ICC so far reluctant to make a financial investment in the technology that is playing an increasing role in Test cricket. &quot;I think that needs to change,&quot; said Brennan. &quot;Ideally the system would be independent with the third umpire working with a technology operator beside him and not reliant on a television director. The ICC has not put any money into it, something I suspect will not change as long as India holds out against DRS. But, if they were to, I think it would make it easier for the umpires.&quot; India&apos;s objection to DRS has more to do with Hawk-Eye, which they believe is suggestive rather than definitive, rather than Hot Spot. &quot;Technology evolves and improves, never standing still&quot; said Brennan. &quot;Mobile phones are a good example. We are on the second generation Hot Spot, using cameras from above as well as from the side, and within 18 months our British suppliers, Selex ES, will have a new camera with three times the number of pixels that will provide an even higher resolution.&quot; The thermal image on Hot Spot is the result of the friction created when a ball makes contact with a bat but it has been better for spinners with their rotating deliveries than quicker bowlers and it can provide confusing images in the late afternoon because of reflections thrown as the sun drops. &quot;It is why RTS would be the perfect complement,&quot; said Brennan. &quot;It is good for fast bowlers because, with the wicket-keeper standing back, it detects the faintest of nicks.&quot; There have been suggestions that an application of Vaseline to the sides of a bat will disarm Hot Spot but tests have shown otherwise. &quot;Manufacturers&apos; logos, such as metallic reflective stickers, can confuse Hot Spot, which is why the ICC is considering making them part of equipment regulations, but they would not have an effect on RTS,&quot; said Brennan. &quot;What the two technologies do together is eliminate any guesswork and that can only benefit umpires.&quot; There were accusations of bias when Hot Spot did not save Jonathan Trott in the first Test at Trent Bridge, when he was given out leg-before on appeal after the umpire ruled he had got an inside edge. &quot;That was a procedural error that will not happen again,&quot; said Brennan. &quot;The two operators that day were both English but I suspect that going forward they, like the umpires, will have to be country neutral.&quot; Brennan started his sporting career working for Tennis Australia and first became involved in cricket in 2000 when he was employed by Kerry Packer&apos;s Channel Nine in Australia. &quot;For me it is about the elimination of controversy,&quot; he said. &quot;Friends have already told me not to return to Australia after Hot Spot effectively decided the first Test after it showed that Brad Haddin had got an inside edge but it provided the right outcome. &quot;Opinion on social media was polarised: one side believed technology was the way to go and the other felt it was the wrong way to decide a Test match; there was no middle ground. To me there can be no going back. It has to be about helping umpires without reducing them to the role of ball counters and I hope the ICC takes the driving seat.&quot;", "title": "Hot Spot inventor calls for official use of Snickometer in winter Ashes", "sentences": ["&quot;I have spent the last two months in Britain helping trial Real Time Snicko,&quot; said Brennan from Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-27T22:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/jul/28/zarooni-doping-scandal-godolphin-bha", "tags": ["British Horseracing Authority", "Godolphin", "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Drugs in sport", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "It goes with the territory when you spend your life around horse racing. From time to time it is necessary to defend the sport&apos;s integrity against the claim that &quot;it&apos;s all bent&quot;. Until fairly recently it was not too difficult. There will never be a shortage of talking pockets both on track and online, calling out crooks and cheats when they simply backed the wrong horse. But there is good evidence to suggest that form horses are running more consistently than at any time in the past, not least the fact that even the most successful newspaper tipsters can no longer beat blind bets on the favourites. There were roughly 10,000 races in Britain last year. If asked how many there were in which the outcome was genuinely &quot;fixed&quot; \u2013 that is, pre-arranged by those involved \u2013 or a probable winner was deliberately stopped, my guess, which is all it can be, would be in very low double figures, if that. The possible use of performance-enhancing drugs in the sport is a constant and more insidious threat but again, with more than 7,000 post-race tests and only 14 positives in 2012, it would be hard to argue that drug use is rife. Then, in late April, along came Mahmood al-Zarooni, and three months later the British Horseracing Authority&apos;s report into his steroid-doping spree at Moulton Paddocks in Newmarket in the first few months of the year. It would take too long to detail the deficiencies in the BHA&apos;s report all over again but, in summary, the conclusion it has come to is this. One morning in January or February Zarooni woke up in Dubai and decided to start doping his horses, 3,000 miles away in Newmarket, with anabolic steroids. He sourced enough drugs to do a proper job in a stable with 200 horses \u2013 which means many hundred of doses, since steroids must be administered several times a week to have any effect \u2013 and then smuggled them into Moulton Paddocks without anyone noticing. The trainer then launched the most extensive doping programme in turf history, despite spending no more than a few days over the course of the winter in England. For a man portrayed as a manipulative loner who deliberately sidelined those in a position to stop his cheating Zarooni&apos;s communication skills are clearly extraordinary. Zarooni managed to hide what he was up to from the senior staff and management at Moulton Paddocks, despite the powerful effects of these drugs. And but for the unwitting assistance of three very junior members of staff, Zarooni did it all by himself \u2013 from Dubai for the most part. As an account of the biggest doping scandal any of us has seen it is hopelessly inadequate. But it is all there is and all that the racegoers and punters who choose to spend their money on horse-racing, in the belief that it is honest, are going to get. Meanwhile another small part of Zarooni&apos;s legacy will be the horses running from Moulton Paddocks \u2013 up to a dozen, almost all of them fillies, would be my guess \u2013 which were almost certainly in the doping programme and may still be feeling the benefits but came up clean when the BHA finally got round to testing them. Each one of them tears a small, additional hole in the sport&apos;s integrity every time it goes to the track. My dictionary has two principal definitions of &quot;pathetic&quot;: evoking pity and distressingly inadequate. From 25 April \u2013 when the BHA banned Zarooni from racing for eight years at a disciplinary hearing 72 hours after the news of his doping emerged \u2013 to 25 July, when the authority published its risible final account of the whole affair, its conduct has exemplified both. When considering why it has performed so miserably, however, the first definition may be more useful. The BHA has been pitiful because its writ is limited and it cannot, or will not, drag the sport&apos;s biggest benefactors into the grubby business of day-to-day regulation. The procedure itself has limited the embarrassment to Sheikh Mohammed, who personally chose Zarooni as the man to run Moulton Paddocks. Follow the smell of money and you will find where the real power in racing still lies. It is at its strongest around the Jockey Club Rooms in Newmarket&apos;s High Street, where just the paintings on the wall would fetch nine or 10 figures. The Jockey Club, or its members, who include Sheikh Mohammed, Godolphin&apos;s founder, own most of Newmarket and all but a handful of the best racecourses. The BHA owes its existence to the Jockey Club, whose members, quite naturally, tend to see corruption as something that spreads only from the bottom up. The BHA is weak and scared and thus deserving of pity. But the fact remains that, if leading owners cannot even be interviewed in connection with a case as serious as this, then they can never be held to account for the actions of those they employ either. Is it &quot;all bent&quot;? My answer, still, would be an emphatic no. But does racing&apos;s current regulator have the will or the authority to ensure that it stays that way? The final conclusion I draw from the Zarooni scandal is that the answer to that question, sadly, is also no.", "title": "Mahmood al-Zarooni doping scandal goes on tearing at Turf's integrity | Greg Wood", "sentences": ["One morning in January or February Zarooni woke up in Dubai and decided to start doping his horses, 3,000 miles away in Newmarket, with anabolic steroids.", "And but for the unwitting assistance of three very junior members of staff, Zarooni did it all by himself \u2013 from Dubai for the most part."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-28T19:49:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/jul/28/ashes-2013-england-squad-old-trafford", "tags": ["Ashes 2013", "The Ashes", "England cricket team", "Australia cricket team", "Chris Tremlett", "Steven Finn", "Monty Panesar", "Cricket", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "article": "The new Old Trafford (or New Trafford as perhaps it should be known) represents an unknown quantity for England and in selecting a 14-man squad for the third Test, a game which they hope will clinch the series, they have covered most eventualities from pace and bounce to a dry turner. Gone from the squad selected for the second Test are Steven Finn and Graham Onions and in their places come Monty Panesar and, to what must be some disconcertion in the Australian camp, The Beast. Chris Tremlett has biceps that Stuart Broad would be proud to call thighs and, having carefully been nurtured to full fitness over a long period, has finally been brought back into the camp and could play his first Test since the first match against Pakistan in Dubai the winter before last. There is a place for James Taylor, too, who has crafted a hundred against the Australians at Hove over the weekend, although his inclusion is strictly as cover for Kevin Pietersen, who is expected to be fit having recovered from a calf strain. As far as England are concerned, the return of Tremlett is ahead of schedule for the hope had been to harness him for the winter Ashes tour and, given that he is not yet 32, beyond that. Although England have had no direct control over his recovery from a series of injuries, his progress has been carefully monitored along the way. There was talk of him playing for Worcestershire against Australia in their pre-Ashes warm-up, and also as a guest for Sussex, like Taylor, in their current match against the tourists. His reintegration process began in earnest during the Lord&apos;s Test, though, where he participated in practice sessions. The Australians know all about Tremlett. His career was resurrected at the instigation of the England bowling coach David Saker, who ignored the reputation he had gained as being soft and championed his inclusion on the 2010-11 Ashes tour. He came into the side for the third Test at Perth and in that and the remaining two matches took 17 wickets at 23.35 apiece, including the final one of the series on that memorable morning in Sydney. If there is any pace and bounce in a pitch, then at 6ft 7in tall he is capable of exploiting it to devastating effect, getting lift from a good length where others cannot. It is worth noting that at Old Trafford in 2006 Steve Harmison exploited such conditions to take 11 for 76 against Pakistan. If England would be reluctant to change the side that won so overwhelmingly at Lord&apos;s, then, if they foresaw such conditions again, they would be foolish to ignore them. The inclusion of Panesar is belt-and-braces but, unless there is an indication that the pitch will turn from very early on, so that seamers would play little part, or there is some doubt about Graeme Swann (of which there has been no word), it is unlikely he would play. However, as with Harmison, it is worth considering that in three matches at Old Trafford \u2013 against West Indies in 2006, Pakistan in 2007 and New Zealand in 2008 \u2013 he has taken 25 wickets at 16.72, with three five-wicket hauls and one 10-wicket match. If there is bounce and turn, then with his quicker delivery and metronomic relentlessness he is as devastating a spinner as any in the game. In the match against Pakistan he and Harmison took all 19 wickets that went to England bowlers. Panesar last played a home Test in Cardiff to start the Ashes four years ago, a match distinguished by his last-ditch batting determination. Similarly a disappointing series recently against New Zealand, on desperately slow pitches, was characterised by last-wicket defiance, with Matt Prior, to save the series. He remains England&apos;s second-choice spinner, despite that last series, and over the weekend produced some good figures against the Australians at Hove on a flat pitch. The demotion of Finn will surely not come as a surprise to him as he has been unable to reproduce the kind of consistency that marked him out even on the slow pitches during the one-day series in India the winter before last. At Trent Bridge he teetered between good and mediocre and during Brad Haddin&apos;s attempted charge to the line was deliberately singled out for treatment. There was definitely a strong case for him playing at Lord&apos;s, where he has an excellent record, but certainly Alastair Cook has visibly lost confidence in him to make an impact. In no small part this must stem from confusion in Finn&apos;s own mind as to what type of bowler he should be. As far as England are concerned, the pathway is clear enough: they advise him to use a slightly shorter run to gain better momentum, to bowl fast and straight and to use his natural shape into the bat. Apparently he receives counter advice elsewhere including the suggestion that he develop an away-swinger. The great Glenn McGrath has been quoted here before on the subject of receiving similar advice when he first played Tests, before reverting to his real strengths. McGrath is back in Australia now but Finn could have done worse than seek him out.", "title": "Ashes 2013: England cover all bases with squad for new Old Trafford | Mike Selvey", "sentences": ["Chris Tremlett has biceps that Stuart Broad would be proud to call thighs and, having carefully been nurtured to full fitness over a long period, has finally been brought back into the camp and could play his first Test since the first match against Pakistan in Dubai the winter before last."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-28T21:15:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/28/mercedes-win-24-hours-of-spa", "tags": ["Motor sport", "Sport"], "article": "Understandably much of the attention for motor racing fans will have been focused on Lewis Hamilton&apos;s victory at the Hungaroring on Sunday afternoon as the driver took his debut win for Mercedes, of which the team will be rightly proud, but for the car manufacturer another win, completed only an hour after the F1 finished, will have been equally pleasing as the marque took the chequered flag at the 24 Hours of Spa. Somewhat removed from the glamour of F1, this endurance race, part of the increasingly popular Blancpain Endurance Series, is still one of the biggest in GT endurance racing and aptly for such an historic challenge the victory was notable both for the manufacturer and for one of the drivers who saw his chariot to the finish. Since it was first held in 1924 Mercedes have won the 24 here in Spa only twice and the last time was in 1964. The third has been a long time coming, a fact that will not be lost on the race winner Bernd Schneider, born in the very year of that last victory and for whom this win represents the culmination of an extraordinary year at the wheel of the German marque. Schneider took victory alongside his team-mates Maximilian Buhk and Maximilian G\u00f6tz in the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG of the HTP team, having already won this year, in the same model of car, at the Dubai 24 hours, the Bathurst 12 hours and the N\u00fcrburgring 24 hours \u2013 a remarkable achievement for the 49-year-old driver who recently came out of retirement to take part in endurance racing having had a brief, unsuccessful three-year career in F1 but who went on to become a touring car champion \u2013 five times winner of the DTM championship. He had no easy ride completing this grand slam of GT endurance titles either. The morning of the race offered apocalyptic grey skies interspersed with heavy rain and thunder but by the time the flag fell at 4.30pm on Saturday, sunshine offered the chance for the drivers to battle in perfect conditions, a battle that had, by the evening, become a nip-and-tuck affair between Schneider&apos;s Mercedes, the two BMW Z4s of Marc VDS Racing and the Manthey Racing Porsche 911 GT3-R driven by Marc Lieb, Richard Lietz and Patrick Pilet. Exchanging the lead through the night, the BMWs and Porsche had a slight advantage but the former&apos;s challenge ended for one car at 2.30am with an electrical problem and for the other at 5.30am with an engine failure. The Mercedes squad took the battle to Porsche in pace and a head-to-head fight ensued, with Schneider and his co-drivers finally taking advantage after 21 hours when the Manthey team were penalised with a drive through after overtaking before the start-finish line at the close of a period behind the safety car. Engine troubles subsequently reduced the Porsche to five cylinders and rendered it unable to catch the HTP Mercedes which ran trouble free to the flag, completing only 564 laps but still finishing 1min 18sec ahead of their rivals after the full 24 hours. &quot;I did not expect to do a 24-hour qualifying because we were pushing the whole night,&quot; said Schneider, who last won here in 1989. &quot;The last two hours we could be a bit more gentle with the car but up until there it really was flat out.&quot; Although the Mercedes had a slight edge in speed Schneider acknowledged that it alone had not been enough. &quot;The Porsche was a bit better in fuel consumption, which meant its stops were always a bit shorter and so we had to catch up on the track all the time, which made life pretty hard for us because we had to risk more in the traffic to catch them up,&quot; he explained before admitting he was, unsurprisingly, exhausted. Back in Brackley, there will, of course, be celebrations at Hamilton&apos;s first victory but Stuttgart is where the German marque really calls home and it is likely to be Schneider and his team-mates who are toast of the town there.", "title": "Mercedes win 24 Hours of Spa to complete perfect weekend", "sentences": ["Schneider took victory alongside his team-mates Maximilian Buhk and Maximilian G\u00f6tz in the Mercedes-Benz SLS AMG of the HTP team, having already won this year, in the same model of car, at the Dubai 24 hours, the Bathurst 12 hours and the N\u00fcrburgring 24 hours \u2013 a remarkable achievement for the 49-year-old driver who recently came out of retirement to take part in endurance racing having had a brief, unsuccessful three-year career in F1 but who went on to become a touring car champion \u2013 five times winner of the DTM championship."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-28T22:51:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2013/jul/30/reuters-twitter-hacked-syrian-electronic-army", "tags": ["Twitter", "Media", "Internet", "Blogging", "Technology", "Reuters", "Thomson Reuters", "News agencies", "Syria", "World news"], "article": "The Twitter account of Thomson Reuters was hacked on Tuesday in another apparent attack by the Syrian Electronic Army.

Women emerge from their homes one by one. Sitting in the middle of a beaten-earth yard, Sathi carefully places her laptop on a plastic chair, plugs in headphones and launches a session on Skype. The faces of village men working thousands of kilometres from here appear on the screen. &quot;It&apos;s like my brother was standing right there, except I can&apos;t touch him. What&apos;s more he&apos;s put on weight and lost colour since he started work in Iraq,&quot; says a worried Sumita. She keeps saying &quot;As-salamu alaykum&quot; and &quot;Hello&quot;, for fear he might vanish. &quot;It&apos;s a bad connection,&quot; Sathi explains. &quot;It&apos;s a public holiday and everyone wants to call the Gulf states, so it&apos;s busy.&quot; A session costs a fortune, equivalent to about $3 an hour. &quot;But the price includes technical support or volume adjustment,&quot; Sathi adds. Even at this price Skype is a great success. In Bangladesh, population 152 million, only 5\u00a0million people are connected. So 56 &quot;info ladies&quot; crisscross the countryside, dressed in blue and pink uniform and carrying in their bags a laptop, a camera to make films or take wedding snaps, but also tests for blood sugar and pregnancy, and of course some cosmetics and shampoo. Thanks to their PC connected to the &quot;new world&quot; via a USB stick, these women can call up information beyond the reach of village schoolteachers. Internet access is an instrument of emancipation too. The women advise farmers and sometimes even offer\u00a0 legal advice. Information needs these &quot;ladies&quot; to reach its destination, because &quot;browsing the net is like flying a rocket to land on another planet&quot;, Sathi says. &quot;It scares lots of people.&quot; But technology is not only for those who know how to use it; it&apos;s also for those who want to appropriate it. The women swap helpful advice and sometimes spend whole nights solving a technical hitch. The D.net non-profit organisation [PDF], which launched the scheme in 2008, trains the women for three months on how to use the hardware, at centres close to their home. To start their business they need to take out a loan: roughly $650. They make an early start. At 6am Jeyasmin prepares a meal outside her hut, consisting mainly of rice, then takes her daughter to school. When she returns men are already waiting anxiously, eager to check their blood sugar. Ever since Jeyasmin organised a session on this subject, many of the residents think they have diabetes. &quot;Villagers are not generally ready to purchase information, so the ladies sell them accompanying services, like medical tests or natural fertilisers,&quot; D.net head Ananya Raihan explains. A few hours later several teenage women are waiting for Jeyasmin in the shade of a date tree. She shows them a video, with white-coated experts talking and pointing to animated graphics over their heads. &quot;Doctors never come to see us, so we might as well watch them on a PC. But it&apos;s a pity they don&apos;t answer our questions,&quot; says one of the young women. When Jeyasmin takes out her weighing machine, it draws a big crowd. They climb on to the machine, standing tall and not batting an eyelid, for fear of upsetting it. Many of the younger women confide in the info ladies. &quot;They understand our worries and don&apos;t make judgments,&quot; says one of them. Some teenagers even ask the women to buy them underwear, sanitary towels and makeup in town, because generally only the men go to market. The purveyors of information also have what they call their &quot;Facebook secrets&quot;, or indeed the Skype equivalent. After creating a Facebook account, Golapi Akter met a Bangladeshi who lives in Dubai. &quot;There are so many men who live in Facebook,&quot; she whispers. She chats with him every week on Skype and even introduced him to her parents with her webcam. With monthly earnings of about $150 some of the women invest in other ventures. Sathi, for instance, has used her savings to turn her parents&apos; stall into a rural supermarket, setting a whole new trend. It sells first-aid kits, USB sticks, medicine, toys, DVDs and even special kits for repairing mobiles that have dropped into the water on a paddy field. There is a small parking area outside for bicycles. The undertaking has turned out very well and the budding entrepreneur has invested in a generator, so she can show Bollywood movies, even when there&apos;s a power cut. The info-ladies project is still a pilot scheme. It has failed in conservative areas where it is very difficult for women to have a job and where the number of migrants working overseas is too low for the Skype service to show a viable return. In the areas where the business model works, there are plans for the women to be paid to carry out market research. It has also been suggested that they should use tablet computers, which are more dust-resistant than conventional PCs. With this version new recruits would need to find $2,000 to buy into the info-lady franchise.

The Guardian was one of several news organisations to publish a series of stories based on the contents of the files. Below are 10 of the most revelatory: \u2022 The first revelation came in 2010, from a video showing a US helicopter crew laughing as they launched an air strike killing a dozen people in Baghdad in July 2007, including a photographer and driver working for the Reuters news agency. The footage was recorded on one of two Apache helicopters which were hunting for suspected insurgents. They encounter a group of men on the ground, who do not immediately appear armed, and there is no sign of gunshots. But one helicopter crew opens fire, with shouts of &quot;Hahaha. I hit &apos;em,&quot; and &quot;Oh yeah, look at those dead bastards&quot;. As the wounded are helped, one of the helicopters opens fire again, with armour-piercing shells. \u2022 The next tranche of revelations came in July 2010, from documents dating from 2004 to 2009 about the Afghan war. One set raised concerns in the US by suggesting alleged support for the Taliban from Pakistan, particularly that the country&apos;s spy agency, the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), had been collaborating with the Taliban. \u2022 The Afghanistan files also included details of an incident from 2007 in which US marines escaping an attack outside the city of Jalalabad fired their guns indiscriminately, killing 19 unarmed civilians and wounding 50 more. While the aftermath of the attack was plain to military authorities, the files suggested, the incident was referred to in an official report only as this: &quot;The patrol returned to JAF [Jalalabad air field].&quot; \u2022 In October 2010 came a series of revelations about events in Iraq. Chief among these was that US authorities failed to investigate hundreds of reports of abuse, torture, rape and even murder by Iraqi police and soldiers. The reports of abuse, often supported by medical evidence, describe prisoners shackled, blindfolded and hung by wrists or ankles, and subjected to whipping, punching, kicking or electric shocks. \u2022 Another Iraq-related revelation was that the US collated details of more than 100,000 people killed in Iraq following the invasion of the country, including more than 15,000 deaths that were previously unrecorded. The tally goes against previous protestations by the UK and US that there were any official statistics on the death toll connected to the war. \u2022 The largest and most explosive cache of files was revealed in November 2010 \u2013 more than 250,000 classified cables from US embassies, carrying confidential and often blunt diplomatic assessments of US allies and foes. One of the most dramatic of these showed that King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia has repeatedly urged the US to attack Iran to destroy its nuclear programme. The Saudi monarch was recorded as having &quot;frequently exhorted the US to attack Iran to put an end to its nuclear weapons programme,&quot; one cable stated. \u2022 The embassy cables also said that the US is running a secret intelligence campaign targeted at the leadership of the United Nations, including the secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, and representatives from China, Russia, France and the UK. The classified directive, from 2009, demanded details about the communications systems used by top UN officials, including passwords and personal encryption keys used in official communications. \u2022 Other cables painted a hugely unflattering US view of Russia under the leadership of Vladimir Putin, calling it a &quot;virtual mafia state&quot; in which officials, oligarchs and organised crime are bound together by endemic corruption and personal enrichment. \u2022 The cables contained an equally candid view of rampant government corruption in Afghanistan, including details of an incident in October 2009 when the then vice-president, Ahmad Zia Massoud, was stopped and questioned in Dubai carrying $52m in cash. \u2022 On a more intimate note, but of particular interest in Britain, was a cable from Tatiana Gfoeller, Washington&apos;s ambassador to Kyrgyzstan, who recounted an &quot;astonishingly candid&quot; and at times rude performance by Prince Andrew at a brunch with overseas business people in which he railed against British anticorruption investigators, journalists and the French. \u2022 The final tranche of revelations, in April 2011, came from 759 &quot;detainee assessment&quot; dossiers about those held at the Guant\u00e1namo Bay prison, written between 2002 and 2009. They spell out the extent of involvement US authorities believe each detainee has had with al-Qaida, the Taliban or other terror groups. The files showed that some prisoners had long ago been cleared for release but remained detained.", "title": "Bradley Manning trial: what we know from the leaked WikiLeaks documents", "sentences": ["\u2022 The cables contained an equally candid view of rampant government corruption in Afghanistan, including details of an incident in October 2009 when the then vice-president, Ahmad Zia Massoud, was stopped and questioned in Dubai carrying $52m in cash."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-30T16:01:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/jul/30/manchester-city-human-rights-accusations", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Sheikh Mansour", "Football", "Amnesty International", "United Arab Emirates", "Middle East and North Africa", "Human rights", "World news", "Sport"], "article": "English football has been warned it has allowed one of its major clubs to be exploited as a &quot;branding vehicle&quot; by an international regime accused of human rights abuses after a trial in Abu Dhabi, a country ruled by Manchester City&apos;s owner and his brothers, was widely denounced as repressive, involving torture, and &quot;fundamentally unfair&quot;. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have vehemently protested against the mass arrest of 94 people, their alleged torture while in Abu Dhabi jails, a &quot;fundamentally unfair&quot; trial, and long prison sentences with no right of appeal handed down earlier this month to the 69 people convicted. Amnesty said the treatment of the 94 in the United Arab Emirates, where Sheikh Mansour al-Nahyan&apos;s family, rulers of the richest emirate, Abu Dhabi, are dominant, &quot;shows the authorities&apos; determination to crush any form of dissent&quot;. The 94 were tried on charges of plotting to overthrow the UAE government, which remains adamant this was proven against the 69 convicted. The regime, whose army and security services are headed by Sheikh Mansour&apos;s brother, Sheikh Mohammed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi, maintains the 69 were operating as a front for the Muslim Brotherhood, and seeking to impose a conservative Islamist state, including by military means. The defendants, who include lawyers, teachers and academics, say this was a crackdown by an increasingly authoritarian state, after they voiced valid criticisms of the regime, calling for more democracy and freedom of speech. Only a minority of the UAE population has any kind of vote, the ruling families have been in charge for centuries, and in 2013 it remains a crime to criticise the rulers, belong to a trade union or form any organisation not licensed by the regime. Amnesty and HRW have stated that they believe torture is &quot;a systematic practice&quot; in Abu Dhabi and UAE state security jails, and that complaints that these men were tortured, including to extract confessions, have not been investigated. Amnesty said the trial showed &quot;a deeply flawed judicial system&quot; at odds with the &quot;global image the UAE likes to project of itself as an efficient, forward-thinking country, which in many ways it is&quot;. HRW made specific reference to Manchester City, arguing that ownership of the Premier League club is enabling Abu Dhabi to &quot;construct a public relations image of a progressive, dynamic Gulf state, which deflects attention from what is really going on in the country&quot;. Sheikh Mansour bought City in 2008, and has since spent around \u00a31bn of the fortune he wields as a member of Abu Dhabi&apos;s ruling family, principally to buy and pay the multimillion-pound wages of footballers to make City successful. Mansour is among the most powerful group in Abu Dhabi with the crown prince Sheikh Mohammed and their other &quot;full&quot; brothers by Sheikha Fatima, one of the six wives married to the former ruler, Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan al-Nahyan. Sheikh Khalifa, Zayed&apos;s oldest son, one of Mansour&apos;s half-brothers by a different wife, is the UAE president, said to be ailing in health. Mansour is the Abu Dhabi deputy prime minister, responsible for the country&apos;s judges, and sits on the board of key investment funds. Manchester City is run by Khaldoon al-Mubarak, the chairman, a senior Abu Dhabi government and business figure, who works principally for Sheikh Mohammed. Mubarak is the chairman of the Executive Affairs Authority, a strategic government body responsible for advising on Abu Dhabi&apos;s international image. He was deputed from his duties for Sheikh Mohammed to run City shortly after Mansour bought the club, to shape a more dignified direction after the initial frenzy of media coverage which was all about money and considered detrimental by the Abu Dhabi establishment. Mubarak has always emphasised that City is a private business acquisition by Sheikh Mansour, with Mubarak charged to make it profitable, worth more than the \u00a31bn spent, in 10 years. The Premier League club, though, have unquestionably become the most prominent global projection of Abu Dhabi itself, sponsored by four state-owned companies: the airline Etihad, the telecommunications company Etisalat, the investment company Aabar and the Abu Dhabi Tourism Authority. When David Silva, Sergio Ag\u00fcero and Yaya Tour\u00e9 weave their patterns in the Etihad Stadium, the hoardings around the pitch beam &quot;Visit Abu Dhabi, Travellers Welcome&quot; to the 200 countries where Premier League football is viewed \u2013 a great global advert. In an interview with the Guardian in 2009, Mubarak said of the running of City: &quot;This is telling a lot to the world about how we are. It is showing the world \u2026 the true essence of \u2026 what Abu Dhabi is about. There is almost a personification of the values we hold as Abu Dhabi, with the values of the club and the values we would like to stick to.&quot; Nicholas McGeehan, UAE researcher for HRW, describes the country in the light of the recent trial as increasingly &quot;a black hole&quot; for many basic human rights: &quot;In this situation, a Premier League club is being used as a branding vehicle to promote and effectively launder the reputation of a country perpetrating serial human rights abuses,&quot; he said. &quot;That should be of concern to football supporters as well as human rights organisations.&quot; This condemnation of the UAE for a crackdown on citizens criticising the ruling regime is relatively recent. An alliance of seven emirates made in 1971, the UAE&apos;s native Emirati people have generally been considered content with their stable and wealthy way of life. Sheikh Zayed, who died in 2004, was widely revered as a visionary, planning Abu Dhabi&apos;s super-fast development after the oil riches transformed the country from the 1960s, while retaining traditional Sunni Muslim values. Zayed distributed wealth to the wider population and, although democracy has always been outlawed, he famously talked of gradually introducing voting rights: &quot;Moving towards a parliamentary, integrated and comprehensive system in a society liberated from fear.&quot; HRW&apos;s previous concerns have centred on low pay and grim conditions for the people from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and elsewhere brought to the UAE to build its prestige buildings, and work in domestic service. In a series of reports, HRW has highlighted exploitative practices, including burdensome recruitment fees charged to workers before they arrive, low pay of around $8 a day in one of the world&apos;s richest countries, the prevailing system of being tied to one employer, and the prohibition on forming a union or striking for better terms. The government has repeatedly acknowledged the criticisms, and says: &quot;Sweeping reforms aimed at improving working conditions and worker rights reflect the UAE&apos;s commitment to treat all guest workers with dignity and respect.&quot; HRW argues that is not matched by the reality and points to continuing reports of construction workers being deported after going on strike over low pay and dreadful working conditions on projects in the UAE. The Emirati population, which numbers around one million, are still considered by commentators to be largely content, particularly given the country&apos;s stability in a Middle East in turmoil and civil war elsewhere. But internal critics began to find more of a voice two years ago, against a background of the Arab spring, conservative Muslim campaigns and democracy movements in other countries, allied to widespread use of the internet. In March 2011, five Emiratis posted a petition addressed to Sheikh Khalifa, the UAE president. The petition expressed profound respect for Khalifa and the Federal Supreme Council, the law-making organ of state run by the seven emirates&apos; ruling families. Quoting Zayed&apos;s vision of a parliamentary system for &quot;a society liberated from fear,&quot; the petition asked for greater democracy, by: &quot;Electing all the members of the Federal Supreme Council by all citizens in the same manner that is approached in the democratic countries around the world.&quot; The UAE authorities argue it was not the petition itself that led to those posting it being arrested but the continued criticism with which they followed it up. One of the most persistent, Ahmed Mansoor, was kept in jail for eight months before being sentenced to three years in prison for criticising the regime. Immediately after his sentence Mansoor, along with the other petitioners, received a presidential pardon. &quot;I am a liberal secularist and do not belong to any religious group,&quot; Mansoor told the Guardian. An engineer who studied at the University of Colorado and lived in the US for seven years, when Mansoor returned to his native UAE he found its\u00a0lack of democracy and freedom of speech stifling. &quot;I, with another person, initiated the petition, then I was subjected to a smear campaign, arrested for comments deemed to be insulting to the president, and put in jail,&quot; he said. &quot;I lost my job, I have been beaten up twice, so I am paying a high price. But I feel I must talk. &quot;It is a very difficult and ugly feeling when you cannot express yourself because you are in fear of being arrested. The state security apparatus can be very ugly, so people are really afraid to say anything.&quot; The authorities argue there is no connection between that case of the &quot;UAE\u00a05&quot;, and the arrests and prosecution of the &quot;UAE 94&quot; that followed last year. The people arrested were mostly members of a long-established Muslim social organisation, al-Islah, who say they are not fundamentalist but do openly take issue with elements of the country&apos;s rule. They argue that the super-capitalist development has been done without sufficient consultation and is a departure too far from traditional Muslim values, that the ruling family is not\u00a0accountable for how the country&apos;s money is spent, and that freedom is too limited. As they include middle-aged, educated people, they say it is ridiculous to accuse them of believing they could overthrow the regime, given the wealth,\u00a0might and security apparatus of the UAE. Last summer, after the number of people arrested had grown to over 50, the official Emirates News Agency stated that the security services&apos; investigation revealed that those arrested had &quot;set up links with external elements, and had worked in an organised and systematic manner, causing harm to the country and spreading false information, in order to incite others against the country and to distort its shining image before the world&quot;. In July two lawyers who had defended Ahmed Mansoor in the &quot;UAE 5&quot; trial, Dr Mohamed al-Mansoori and Dr Mohamed al-Roken, were arrested. In December, the International Bar Association&apos;s Human Rights Institute issued a statement saying it was &quot;deeply concerned by the worsening situation for human rights lawyers in the UAE.&quot; The British barrister Baroness Kennedy, co-chair of IBAHRI, said: &quot;Disturbing reports of an increasing catalogue of detention, deportation, intimidation and harassment of lawyers by the UAE authorities is creating a climate of fear among the legal profession \u2013 seriously undermining the rule of law in the country.&quot; HRW expressed concerns that the families of most of those arrested did not know where they were for months, and warned there is a close relationship between prisoners held incommunicado and mistreatment. Six of the 94 detainees finally appeared before a judge in Abu Dhabi on 6 September 2012 and were reported by HRW and Amnesty to have appeared &quot;dishevelled, disoriented and distressed&quot;. At the first court hearing on 4 March 2013 in Abu Dhabi, Amnesty and HRW reported that several defendants told the judge they had been &quot;seriously ill-treated during months in detention&quot;. They described prolonged solitary confinement, hooding, sleep deprivation and being subjected to extremes of temperatures. The report said the judge ordered medical examinations of the defendants, so the allegations could be investigated, but both human rights groups say no such investigation has taken place. On 26 June, Amnesty and HRW issued their most serious statement on the case, detailing allegations of &quot;systematic&quot; torture, based on hand-written letters smuggled out of the jails. &quot;The mistreatment described in the letters is consistent with other allegations of torture at UAE state security facilities,&quot; the statement said, &quot;and indicates that torture is a systematic practice at these facilities&quot;. The accounts tallied with previous allegations of torture that HRW had reported in September, along with the alleged disappearance of one of the 94, Ahmed al\u2011Suweidi. Amnesty and HRW said &quot;local activists believe a forced confession from Suweidi forms the basis of the prosecution&apos;s case in the trial&quot;. At the 4 March hearing, Suweidi had reportedly told the judges: &quot;I know that what I&apos;m going to say may cost my life but I deny the charges and I ask the court to protect my life and the life of my family.&quot; On 10 June 2012, another Emirati, Saud Kulaib, tweeted that Suweidi was &quot;being exposed to severe torture under the supervision of a high official&quot;. Kulaib was arrested in December and, according to HRW and Amnesty, held incommunicado for five months, during which time he alleged he was held in solitary confinement, subjected to extremes of temperature and sleep deprivation, suspended by his legs from an iron rod and severely beaten by officers, including having his hand sliced open with a razor\u00a0blade. Other allegations of torture included one detainee saying he was &quot;beaten with a plastic tube all over my body&quot;; another wrote he was tied to a chair and threatened with electrocution. The human rights organisations called on the UAE authorities to provide independent medical examinations of the detainees who claimed to have been tortured, exclude from the proceedings any evidence obtained by torture, and carry out a prompt investigation. Both Amnesty and HRW say none of that has happened. The UAE authorities&apos; response to the torture allegations, which were raised in court, is to argue that the alleged victims should have reported them to the police. &quot;The UAE judicial system ensures that the rule of law prevails and that no person is above the law,&quot; the Ministry of Justice said in a statement. &quot;Therefore anyone can resort to the public authorities to report assault, request protection, or claim compensation and ensure that any person committing any offence or felony is punished under law.&quot; On 2 July, at the Federal Supreme Court in Abu Dhabi, 69 of the 94 were found guilty of plotting to overthrow the regime. Several were given severe sentences, including the lawyers Mohamed al-Roken and Mohamed al-Mansoori, both sent to prison for 10 years. Amnesty and HRW denounced the &quot;mass trial of 94 government critics&quot;, arguing that the convictions were: &quot;Based on a fundamentally unfair trial \u2026 probably violated the right of free association \u2026 was marred by the denial of legal assistance during pretrial incommunicado detention, and allegations of torture.&quot; On 17 July, Katherine Dine, a British government official, wrote to Rori Donaghy, campaign manager at the UK-based Emirates Centre for Human Rights, which is pressing the case of the convicted. Dine wrote that the British government has followed the trial closely, and the foreign secretary, William Hague, had: &quot;Raised the importance of \u2026 ensuring the human rights of all Emirati citizens are fully respected. We along with others, have made clear our concerns about allegations of torture and mistreatment, and some aspects of the way the trial was conducted, such as lack of access to international observers, accusations that defendants could not access their lawyers, and the length of the sentencing.&quot; The UAE authorities have maintained there was due process and a fair trial. Anwar Gargash, the UAE minister of state for foreign affairs, has rejected critics of the regime, arguing they do not give enough credit for the UAE&apos;s achievements, including the &quot;secure and stable livelihood&quot; the UAE enables its residents to have in a trouble-torn region. Gargash explained that the UAE regime does not believe in democracy, with political parties, arguing they descend into tribal division and sectarianism. &quot;There is insufficient evidence that a multiparty system works in the Arab world,&quot; Gargash\u00a0said. He pointed to &quot;gradual&quot; reforms including &quot;limited&quot; elections of the Federal National Council, a consultative body, of which half the members are selected by the regime, half elected by a minority of the Emirati population. &quot;To the critics of the approach, we say that it enjoys the support of the majority of our citizens,&quot; Gargash said. How all this strife and struggle over the rulers by birth of a complex, faraway country ended up washing into the fabric of Manchester City is a story of our times. Whereas Manchester became the world&apos;s first industrial city in the 1800s, Abu Dhabi did not have a paved road until 1961, when its deep reserves of oil began to be exploited. In Manchester at the &quot;Peterloo Massacre&quot; of 1819, 11 people were killed and 600 injured by cavalry when attending a speech by Henry Hunt, a campaigner for adults to have the vote. &quot;All men are born free, equal and independent of each other,&quot; Hunt had declared before the forces charged. Another landmark of Mancunian pride is the city&apos;s struggle for workers&apos; rights, the first meeting of the Trades Union Congress having been held in Manchester in 1868. The two great Manchester football clubs emerged from this industrial tumult and social progress; United formed with the approval of employers at the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway in 1878, City two years later by Anna Connell, vicar&apos;s daughter at St Mark&apos;s church, Gorton, part of an effort to provide some decent recreation in the toughest of neighbourhoods. Manchester suffered catastrophically in the 1980s from the collapse of its industry, with 150,000 jobs lost, particularly in the east of the city, which has never recovered. In a UK and Europe again in economic depression after the banking collapse, the real wealth from the oil and gas-rich Gulf states is eagerly sought, not only in football. The Abu Dhabi cash and Mubarak&apos;s and his other executives&apos; business expertise are transforming not only Manchester City but the stadium that was built with \u00a3127m lottery and local council money for the 2002 Commonwealth Games as a means of regenerating east Manchester. Sheikh Mansour&apos;s money is now building a \u00a3140m training campus on 80 acres of largely derelict land, the most significant private business investment into east Manchester for years. In this meeting, of a desperate UK economy with Abu Dhabi&apos;s fortunes, there is a limit to the UK government&apos;s disapproval over allegations of torture and flaws in the UAE legal system. In November, David Cameron flew to Dubai, seeking to persuade the UAE government to buy 60 Typhoon fighters from UK companies in a deal reckoned to be worth \u00a33bn. In London on 16 July, a fortnight after the 69 defendants were convicted in the UAE, the crown prince, Sheikh Mohammed, was in London, meeting Philip Hammond, the British defence secretary, to discuss &quot;co-operation between the two countries pertaining to military and defence affairs.&quot; Mubarak accompanied Sheikh Mohammed to that meeting. The former Football Association chairman Lord Triesman proposed including in the sports authorities&apos; &quot;fit and proper person test&quot; for club owners consideration of HRW&apos;s human rights reports by country. The Premier League rejected that proposal but says it does ask the government about owners \u2013 and will have been told that the UAE is a trusted ally. &quot;When a prospective takeover is from overseas we confirm that those involved are legally permitted to invest in this country,&quot; a Premier League spokesman said, &quot;and, when appropriate, seek the advice of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office.&quot; The major northern football clubs have flourished on pay TV after so much industry collapsed around them but the Premier League&apos;s economics are such that clubs, Arsenal in the Emirates Stadium apart, struggle to compete against Manchester United&apos;s dominant wealth without a billionaire&apos;s backing. While Arsenal, United and Chelsea are nearing the start of this Premier League season still publicly talking about bids for big-name players, City have quietly spent \u00a387m on four stars for the new manager, Manuel Pellegrini. Fernandinho, \u00a330m from Shakhtar Donetsk, Jes\u00fas Navas, \u00a315m from Sevilla, Stevan Jovetic, \u00a322m from Fiorentina and Alvaro Negredo, \u00a320m, also from Sevilla, have been assembled to renew Sheikh Mansour&apos;s intentions for City to achieve Premier League and European success. The reconstruction has been done with a care to appreciate the fans&apos; loyalty through City&apos;s long-suffering years and to celebrate the club&apos;s heritage and former players in \u00a0ways no previous Manchester owners ever managed. The owner has still been to only one match in five years, instead watching his team&apos;s ascent on television, but the City supporters long ago made clear their feelings about the Abu Dhabi ownership. In 2009, some fans clubbed together to pay for a banner, draped ever since along the stand opposite the directors&apos; box. In huge white\u00a0letters on a sky blue background, it says: &quot;MANCHESTER THANKS YOU, SHEIKH MANSOUR.&quot;", "title": "Abu Dhabi accused of 'using Manchester City to launder image'", "sentences": ["In November, David Cameron flew to Dubai, seeking to persuade the UAE government to buy 60 Typhoon fighters from UK companies in a deal reckoned to be worth \u00a33bn."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-30T16:04:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/30/dawn-approach-duel-on-downs-glorious-goodwood", "tags": ["Glorious Goodwood", "Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "The most thrilling race of Royal Ascot week gets a sequel on Wednesday and there is every reason to hope for more drama when Dawn Approach and Toronado meet again. Nor is this a two-horse race, since Declaration Of War, who won a different Group One at Ascot that same day, also lines up. Dawn Approach (3.05) held off Toronado by a short-head in the St James&apos;s Palace Stakes and there is a school of thought that the runner-up was unlucky. Richard Hughes planned to make his challenge widest of all in order to avoid trouble but was, in the end, carried sideways for a stride or two by the eventual winner, who had himself been bumped. Both lost momentum in the incident and it looked as if it was Dawn Approach, closer to the source of interference, who suffered more. In the seconds that followed it seemed a matter of time before Toronado&apos;s challenge would carry him past but the Jim Bolger-trained chestnut rallied so bravely that he never gave up the lead. He is starting to look a horse of the highest quality, having won eight times from nine starts, four of those wins at Group One level. His sensational Derby meltdown remains the only low point and one unlikely to be repeated so long as he is kept to strongly run races over no more than a mile. All in all he looks a good bet at a shade of odds-against, especially as Tuesday&apos;s rain is less likely to be a problem for him than Toronado. Declaration Of War impressed at Ascot but the balance of his form leaves him a bit to prove against his younger rivals. Trade Storm is probably overpriced at 40-1, especially as his trainer reckons this &quot;gross&quot; animal will be fitter on Wednesday than for his last two starts, but it requires quite an effort of the imagination to see him winning. 1.55 Four times a winner on the all-weather at the start of the year, Broxbourne returned from a three-month break to win well at Ascot on Friday, having apparently had minor surgery in the interim. She stayed on stoutly that day in the style of a horse with more to give and has only a 3lb penalty to shoulder. 2.30 Excess Knowledge ran on well to be third, beaten a length by Mandour, who is probably a Group One horse, on his reappearance. That looks very useful form in the context of a race like this, containing no last-time-out winners, but he is a short price for one who has not won since his maiden. Secret Number has a bit to prove after his disappointing sixth in the Dante but that was his first run in Britain after wintering in Dubai and perhaps it should not be taken at face value. He stayed on at the very end of a 10-furlong race on fast ground at Royal Ascot to be beaten just a couple of lengths and it could be that Wednesday&apos;s conditions will allow him to reproduce the promise of his all-weather efforts. 3.40 Mark Johnston has reached 40 winners for July, so it is easy to look favourably on his Lanark, who produced a career best on his fifth start to make all at Newbury last time. But this is a tougher race on easier ground and he may find it a long way home up the straight, perhaps with Outstrip bearing down on him. Out of a Grade One-winning mare, the Godolphin runner scored on his debut at Newmarket last month, despite appearing to race away from the best strip of ground. Richard Fahey has a chance of a second Group success at the meeting with Parbold, who was runner-up to War Command in the Coventry, though the form of that race has not yet worked out well.", "title": "Dawn Approach to prevail in Duel on the Downs at Glorious Goodwood", "sentences": ["Secret Number has a bit to prove after his disappointing sixth in the Dante but that was his first run in Britain after wintering in Dubai and perhaps it should not be taken at face value."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-30T17:50:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/jul/31/toronado-dawn-approach-sussex-stakes", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Glorious Goodwood", "Richard Hughes", "Sport"], "article": "It was easy for racing&apos;s many cynics to scoff when, for the second time in three years, the Sussex Stakes was marketed as &quot;The Duel on the Downs&quot; but Wednesday&apos;s race absolutely justified that billing as Toronado gunned down Dawn Approach in thrilling revenge for two previous defeats. This, the feature contest of Glorious Goodwood week, was also a significant success for racing&apos;s emergent Qatari interests over their more established rivals from Dubai. Most obviously, it was a fine moment for two men who have had the keys to this place in recent years, Richard Hannon and Richard Hughes, perhaps even the most satisfying that either have enjoyed. Hannon, who is now expected to end his 43-year training career at the end of this season, was moved to tears in the winner&apos;s enclosure, though it would have to be admitted that he has been similarly emotional after quite a few major races in the past five years. &quot;It catches you a little bit,&quot; he said, composing himself. For all those connected with his stable, their faith in Toronado meant this race took on enormous importance after his disappointing display when beaten seven lengths in the Guineas and then his unlucky defeat at Royal Ascot, both races won by Dawn Approach. But the bitterness of those memories will have been washed away in one cathartic rush as Toronado battled past his chestnut rival in the final 100 yards. Given the shortage of excuses for the runner-up, it is now hard to see why the winner should not be regarded as the better animal. &quot;In the Guineas, I thought it was going to be a two-horse race,&quot; Hannon recalled, &quot;and it was like he hit a brick wall.&quot; A palate problem was diagnosed; it had slipped over his windpipe, the trainer says, cutting off the colt&apos;s supply of air. A spoon bit is now used to keep tongue and palate in place, allowing Toronado to show his true quality at Royal Ascot but there was still frustration, as he was bumped in making his challenge. Dawn Approach was also hampered that day but the Hannon camp felt their colt suffered more, arguing he was &quot;knocked out of the picture&quot; about two strides after he had begun to quicken. &quot;I know it was looking a little bit difficult about two out,&quot; Hannon said of Wednesday&apos;s race, &quot;but he&apos;s a horse with a hell of a turn of foot. Hughesie rode him work about four or five days ago and said he&apos;s the best that he&apos;s ever ridden. So I was happy to listen to that. He said he was even better than Canford Cliffs.&quot; Hughes used Twitter to show the strength of his feeling for the horse when, hours before this race, he responded to a Timeform employee who offered odds about which excuse would be used when Toronado was beaten. &quot;Idiot,&quot; the jockey replied. In the aftermath of victory, he said: &quot;On things like Twitter, you can get slagged off but I love my horses. I hate it when people slag them off and Lizzie [Hughes&apos;s wife] knows how much I think of this horse. We were so gutted at Ascot that he didn&apos;t get up. I thought his reputation would be ruined if he didn&apos;t win today, so there was a lot riding on it.&quot; Something else was riding on it: the identity of Toronado&apos;s future rider. The colt&apos;s owner, Sheikh Joaan, recently retained Frankie Dettori to ride all his horses except this one, at which time one of his associates suggested Hughes&apos;s tenure depended on continued success. &quot;I read in the paper that I&apos;d keep the ride if I win the race,&quot; Hughes said. It seems there is no further doubt on the subject. &quot;It doesn&apos;t make sense to put the successful person off a horse like that,&quot; said the Sheikh&apos;s media director, Nasser Sharida al-Kaabi. He added that Hannon would be allowed to decide whether Toronado raced on next year. Such a colt might never retire if the trainer is always allowed to decide such things but Hannon, 68, expects to call time on his own career at the end of this year, handing the licence on to his son. He is not quite ready to say so unequivocally, adding: &quot;We&apos;ll see. It&apos;s not definite. I&apos;m earning too much money, aren&apos;t I?&quot; Hannon mentioned the Jacques le Marois at Deauville a week on Sunday as the next possible outing for Toronado, though he also said there was &quot;no rush&quot;. The French race could come too soon for any horse that took part here, though it also figures on the target list for Dawn Approach. &quot;It was a great race,&quot; said Jim Bolger, who trains the runner-up for Sheikh Mohammed. &quot;Everything went well for us until a furlong down and we got passed by a better horse on the day.&quot; He was prepared to consider the ground as a factor in the outcome but insisted he was not looking for excuses. The third-placed Declaration Of War appeared beaten on merit, lagging two and a half lengths behind the principals. The horse had won a Royal Ascot Group One at this distance but his trainer, Aidan O&apos;Brien, now feels he may be better at shorter. &quot;He has a lot of speed, this horse,&quot; he said. &quot;A race like the Haydock Sprint Cup would be a definite possibility.&quot;", "title": "Toronado beats Dawn Approach to win Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood", "sentences": ["This, the feature contest of Glorious Goodwood week, was also a significant success for racing&apos;s emergent Qatari interests over their more established rivals from Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-07-31T17:41:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/iran-blog/2013/jul/31/uk-open-to-improve-iran-ties-hague", "tags": ["Iran", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Hassan Rouhani", "William Hague", "UK news"], "article": "The British foreign secretary, William Hague, has called his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Salehi, to say that the UK is open to improving London-Tehran ties on &quot;a step-by-step and reciprocal basis&quot;.

Sheila&apos;s 45-year career in cinema culture took her from London and Tyneside to the Middle East, where, in 2004, she helped found the Dubai international film festival, becoming its director of international programming. As well as celebrating Arab film-making, Sheila endeavoured to bring the best of world cinema to Dubai, imprinting on the festival her particular interest in Hollywood and Latin American films. The artistic director of the festival, Masoud Amralla Al Ali, described her as &quot;meticulous, clear, opinionated, professional and passionate \u2026 She dedicated her life to understanding the emerging cinema.&quot; She also had unyielding feminist convictions, championed female film-makers, and actively supported the Palestinian cause. Sheila was born in Thornton Heath, south London, and grew up in north London. During the second world war, her parents, Hilda and Charles, decided against evacuation, and, as Sheila liked to put it, she slept through the blitz. After the war, the family lived in Manchester, Cardiff (where she was a pupil at Cathays high school) and Birmingham (where she attended Kings Norton girls school). Sheila declined a scholarship to study history at Birmingham University and trained as a shorthand typist. It was her experiences as a secretary in engineering factories that helped to politicise her.

In 1979, after co-editing the cinema journal Framework and gaining a degree in Comparative European literature at the University of Warwick, she was made director of Newcastle&apos;s Tyneside Cinema. There she established the Tyneside festival of independent cinema and began a lifelong friendship with one of her award jurors, Julie Christie. She was also founding editor of Writing Women, a journal dedicated to women&apos;s prose and fiction. In 1984, Sheila became head of programming at the BFI&apos;s National Film Theatre (now called BFI Southbank), eventually adopting full-time the role of head of the London film festival (1987-96). As well as her adventurous and groundbreaking programming of world cinema, she was proud of expanding the LFF beyond the exclusive NFT membership ghetto and on to West End screens, crucially extending its public profile. She also showed, for the first time in a mainstream international film festival, new restorations of classic and rediscovered films preserved in archives. After a period as a consultant, festival juror and arts charity administrator, during which time she edited two books, Life and Art: The New Iranian Cinema (1999) and An Argentine Passion: Mar\u00eda Luisa Bemberg and Her Films (2000), Sheila was invited to help establish the Dubai international film festival.

While his accomplice points a gun at staff, the robber fills a sport holdall with expensive watches and heads for the door. Suddenly, he stops and turns. &quot;Desol\u00e9,&quot; he says to the terrified sales staff, &quot;C&apos;est la crise.&quot; (Sorry, it&apos;s the economic crisis). As a film script, the scene would have been cut as overly implausible. Of late, however, real life on the French Riviera has seemed even more unlikely. Last Sunday, in a jewel heist described by police as &quot;absolutely incredible&quot; a lone thief strolled into a diamond exhibition at the luxury Carlton International, on the chic Croisette, and walked out 60 seconds later with $138m (\u00a390.5m) in jewels. Astonishingly, the robber fell as he jumped from a hotel window dropping his loot, but was still able to gather up the most expensive pieces and escape. The daring daylight raid that resonated with Hitchcock&apos;s film, To Catch a Thief, entered the record books as France&apos;s biggest jewel theft. Three days later, the apologetic thief targeted the Cannes jewel store, Kronometry. Police are not linking the robberies \u2013 attributing the latter to nifty opportunists \u2013 but officers say the Carlton robbery bears certain hallmarks of the notorious Pink Panther gang suspected of carrying out two other high profile heists netting around $3 million in the French Riviera in the last two months. The C\u00f4te d&apos;Azur lives up to its double-edged reputation as a playground for the world&apos;s beau monde and what Somerset Maughan described as &quot;a sunny place for shady people&quot;. Luxury yachts moored in the shimmering blue-green Mediterranean are more than a mirage of fantastic wealth. When bored of bronzing, the rich go shopping. Often for diamonds. It is no secret that at the height of summer, the designer and jewel shops here are packed with valuable stock. Interpol believes the Pink Panthers, named after the diamond in the Peter Sellers comedies, is a loosely affiliated gang of 200 jewel thieves from the former Yugoslavia. Since the 1990s, the gang has been linked to dozens of spectacular robberies in 20 countries, including Dubai, Japan, London, Paris, Belgium and the United States, snatching jewels to the tune of some $500 million. Their heists are characterised by impeccable planning, attention to detail, threats of extreme violence and Hollywood-style theatrics. In Dubai, they drove a pair of limousines through a jewellery store window, in Paris, they donned blonde wigs and scarves to rob the Harry Winston store, in St Tropez they wore flowery T-shirts and escaped with their loot on a speed-boat. Coincidentally, or perhaps not, a leading gang member was busted out of a Swiss jail just three days before the Carlton robbery. Milan Poparic, serving a sentence for a 2009 heist, was the third Panther to escape from jail in the last two month. One &quot;Panther&quot;, speaking to journalist David Samuels, who spent a year investigating the gang explained it emerged from the black market created by international sanctions against Serbia during the Balkan wars. It operates using a centralised command which picks targets and assigns crews to carry out jobs. The man told Samuels there were four main Panther groups originating from an original gang of diamond thieves from Montenegro. The thieves in his group had travelled to Italy and seen how people lived there: &quot;Some of us went insane and tried to have everything at once,&quot; he said. The greedy, rash ones wound up with long prison terms; others spent two or three years in Italian jails. The most important, like Poparic, are sprung. With impeccable timing, a new documentary about the Panthers is heading for British television. Smash and Grab is a gripping account of the Pink Panthers based on interviews with two alleged members who outlined its modus operandi. Among the films&apos; claims is that gang members are addicted to beta-blockers to control their stress and paranoia. In Cannes, the spate of jewel robberies has prompted angry calls by police unions for more armed officers on the streets as a deterrent. Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Foncel, national secretary general of one of the main unions, claims promises to increase the police presence have not been kept and says town authorities refuse to meet union leaders, let alone listen to them. &quot;There are 200 police officers in Cannes; 60 of them are sitting behind desks instead of patrolling the streets,&quot; he said. &quot;The authorities worry about delinquents and send the patrols out at night but all recent heists have been in broad daylight. It&apos;s staggering. There&apos;s no logic to it. &quot;What are the authorities waiting for ... serious violence or a death? It&apos;s a dangerous situation and it&apos;s damaging for Cannes, which is getting a reputation as an open window for criminals.&quot; Whoever took them, the Carlton diamonds are unlikely to be found even if the thief is captured, says Vashi Dominguez, of the London-based Diamond Manufacturers. &quot;By now, they&apos;ll have been cut and polished, their shape and size changed without altering the value too much and nobody will be able to trace them back to the original gems,&quot; Dominguez explains. &quot;The thief could walk back into the Carlton wearing them and nobody would be able to prove they were stolen. &quot;I go to a lot of these exhibitions and I am always shocked by the lack of security in Europe especially given the value of diamonds and the fact that they are so portable.&quot; In Smash and Grab, Chief Inspector Yan Glassey of the Swiss Central Brigade, who has long pursued the diamond thieves is interviewed in his office, where a large Pink Panther toy dangles from a noose. &quot;If you take all their crimes together, they are the best thieves in the world,&quot; Glassey says adding that hunting the gang is like a game of cat and mouse. If the brazen robbery at the Carlton Cannes is the work of the Pink Panthers, however, it is clear that in this game the mouse has the upper hand. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 August 2013 to remove a reference to schizophrenia which was inconsistent with the Guardian style guidelines.", "title": "Carlton Cannes jewellery heist bears hallmarks of Pink Panther gang", "sentences": ["Since the 1990s, the gang has been linked to dozens of spectacular robberies in 20 countries, including Dubai, Japan, London, Paris, Belgium and the United States, snatching jewels to the tune of some $500 million.", "In Dubai, they drove a pair of limousines through a jewellery store window, in Paris, they donned blonde wigs and scarves to rob the Harry Winston store, in St Tropez they wore flowery T-shirts and escaped with their loot on a speed-boat."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-02T15:18:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/05/us-embassy-closure-nsa-surveillance", "tags": ["US national security", "NSA", "Middle East and North Africa", "Al-Qaida", "US news", "US politics", "World news", "US Congress", "US foreign policy", "Yemen", "Surveillance"], "article": "US embassies in the Middle East are to remain closed for the rest of the week as supporters of the National Security Agency&apos;s sweeping surveillance powers used the unspecified terror alert to bolster the case against reining in the controversial measures. The closures follow the alleged interception of al-Qaida communications in Yemen, which intelligence committee members in Congress have been told were collected overseas using powers granted to the NSA under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act \u2013 not the bulk surveillance programs disclosed by the Guardian and the Washington Post thanks to whistleblower Edward Snowden.  A privacy group questioned the publicity given to the latest alert after the State Department announced on Sunday evening that the number of embassies and consulates closed &quot;out of an abundance of caution&quot;would be increased, with some remaining shut for up to a week. Rebublican senator Saxby Chambliss said the NSA had identified threats that were the most serious for years and akin to levels of &quot;terrorist chatter&quot; picked up before 9/11. &quot;These [NSA] programs are controversial, we understand that,&quot; he told NBC&apos;s Meet the Press on Sunday. &quot;But they are also very important \u2026 If we did not have these programs, then we simply would not be able to listen in on the bad guys.&quot; Senator Lindsey Graham added: &quot;To the members of Congress who want to reform the NSA program, great. If you want to gut it, you make us much less safe, and you&apos;re putting our nation at risk. We need to have policies in place that can deal with the threats that exist, and they are real, and they are growing.&quot; Most warnings about NSA over-reach have focused on its domestic bulk surveillance program authorised under section 215 of the Patriot Act. Yet several news organizations reported on Monday that the information justifying the latest alert came from an intercepted communication between al-Qaida leader Ayman Zawahiri and the chief of the terrorist organization&apos;s Yemeni affiliate. Such information would have been collected overseas using powers granted to the NSA under section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.  Critics of the NSA surveillance programs pointed out that the latest threat had nothing to do with the bulk collection of domestic phone data. Senator Ron Wyden, the Oregon Democract who has been a longstanding voice against the bulk collection of phone records, said the latest threat was &quot;serious&quot;. But Wyden, a member of the Senate intelligence committee, added: &quot;While I can&apos;t go into specific details, the vice chairman of the Senate intelligence committee noted yesterday that this information was collected using section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, rather than the Patriot Act. I still haven&apos;t seen any evidence that the NSA&apos;s dragnet surveillance of Americans&apos; phone records is providing any unique value to American counterterrorism efforts.&quot; Privacy campaigners criticised the widespread linking of the latest terror alerts with the debate over the domestic powers of the NSA. Amie Stepanovich, a lawyer with the Electronic Privacy Information Center, said: &quot;The NSA&apos;s choice to publish these threats at this time perpetuates a culture of fear and unquestioning deference to surveillance in the United States.&quot; News of the fresh terror alert came as Congress looked increasingly likely to pursue fresh attempts to limit the NSA&apos;s domestic powers when it returns in September. &quot;The NSA takes in threat information every day. You have to ask, why now? What makes this information different?&quot; added Stepanovich. &quot;Too much of what we hear from the government about surveillance is either speculation or sweeping assertions that lack corroboration. The question isn&apos;t if these programs used by this NSA can find legitimate threats, it&apos;s if the same threats couldn&apos;t be discovered in a less invasive manner. This situation fails to justify the NSA&apos;s unchecked access to our personal information.&quot; Late on Sunday, the State Department confirmed the closures would continue for several days.  &quot;Given that a number of our embassies and consulates were going to be closed in accordance with local custom and practice for the bulk of the week for the Eid celebration at the end of Ramadan, and out of an abundance of caution, we&apos;ve decided to extend the closure of several embassies and consulates including a small number of additional posts,&quot; the department said in a statement. &quot;This is not an indication of a new threat stream, merely an indication of our commitment to exercise caution and take appropriate steps to protect our employees including local employees and visitors to our facilities.&quot; Posts in Abu Dhabi, Amman, Cairo, Riyadh, Dhahran, Jeddah, Doha, Dubai, Kuwait, Manama, Muscat, Sanaa, Tripoli, Antanarivo, Bujumbura, Djibouti, Khartoum, Kigali, and Port Louis are instructed to close for normal operations from Monday, August 5 through to Saturday, August 10.

Allardice, who succeeded Dave Richardson when the South African was promoted to chief executive of the ICC last year, is expected to hold talks with England&apos;s team director, Andy Flower, and Australia&apos;s head coach, Darren Lehmann, who are both supporters of DRS in principle, but have been bemused and occasionally infuriated by third-umpiring decisions through the series. However, there will be no changes to the umpiring appointments for the remaining two Tests of the series, or in the use of Hot Spot, the thermal imaging technology which has been at the centre of most of the controversy. That means Aleem Dar, the Pakistani official who failed to spot Stuart Broad&apos;s thick edge in the first Test at Trent Bridge, will return after a two-Test break to stand alongside Tony Hill, who also made a couple of high-profile errors at Old Trafford.

There is no chance of Billy Bowden, the eccentric New Zealander who was dropped from the ICC&apos;s elite panel earlier in the year, being involved until the return Ashes series in Australia in November. The ICC also confirmed that Hot Spot and DRS will be discussed at the next meeting of its Chief Executives&apos; Committee, on 18 and 19 September in Dubai, chaired by Richardson with David Collier representing the England and Wales Cricket Board.

In a narrowly defeated amendment, congressman Justin Amash (a Michigan Republican) and a bipartisan group of over 200 members of Congress recently voted to defund the NSA&apos;s warrantless spying on US citizens. But obscured by the debate over domestic spying is the fact that virtually no one in the United States is questioning the NSA&apos;s total surveillance of the rest of the world. Foreign surveillance programs, unlike domestic ones, are clearly legal and constitutional, but that doesn&apos;t make them good policy. After all, most of the nearly seven billion non-Americans in the world are just as innocent as most Americans. They resent US government surveillance as much as, or perhaps more than, Americans do. To see how foreign resentment over surveillance is hurting US interests, look at the international politics of internet governance. Unsavory regimes have long sought a preeminent role for the United Nations on internet matters. This past December in Dubai, the United States and many of its allies refused to sign a UN telecommunications treaty that would have implicated the internet in part on the grounds that it would have harmed Internet freedom. Led by Russia, some regimes want to split the internet into 193 separate &quot;states&quot; (pdf), managed by national governments, which interconnect according to the rules of a treaty. These countries want such arrangements because they want to more effectively surveil and censor their own citizens. The US State Department always rightly opposed such activities, but now that leaked documents are revealing the NSA&apos;s domestic and global surveillance programs, the United States looks hypocritical. One can come up with all kinds of excuses for why US surveillance is not hypocrisy. For example, one might argue that US policies are more benevolent than those of many other regimes, which is true. And one might recognize that in several cases, some branches of government don&apos;t know what other branches are doing \u2013 also true \u2013 and therefore US policy is not so much hypocritical as it is inadvertently contradictory. Fine. But the fact is that the NSA is galvanizing opposition to America&apos;s internet freedom agenda. The scandal is reinvigorating Russian proposals for the International Telecommunication Union, a UN agency, to take over internet technical standards and management of the domain name system. Brazil insists that the role of governments and intergovernmental agencies in managing the internet be discussed at ITU meetings in November and March. These are not major policy changes, but they now find a more sympathetic ear from the developing countries that make up the majority at the ITU, which conducts business on the basis of one vote per country. In truth, most developing countries don&apos;t care very much about the management of the internet per se. What they really want is more access to the internet \u2013 more foreign investment and more aid to set up internet exchange points. In the past, the United States always offered more development resources as a way to smooth over its hard-line stance on preserving existing Internet institutions. But now, developing countries don&apos;t want US assistance because they assume the equipment comes with a backdoor for the NSA. They are walking straight into the arms of Russia, China, and the ITU, and when the time comes to decide how the internet should be managed, who do you think they&apos;ll side with? This is not to suggest that the United States shut down all of its intelligence operations. After all, other countries spy, and spying \u2013 for better or worse \u2013 is part of international politics. But the United States is one of very few countries with the capability to monitor absolutely everything that is going on in the world. This means that the kind of indiscriminate, total surveillance that the United States is presently engaged in is not strictly necessary, and unilateral disarmament is an option. No doubt the intelligence establishment will dismiss the suggestion out of hand. US intelligence hegemony has its advantages, particularly if you are a US intelligence officer. Yet as the politics of internet governance shows, it also has significant costs. By surveilling harmless and innocent foreigners alongside America&apos;s enemies, the United States is alienating the world and projecting an arrogant disregard for the perfectly ordinary aspirations of billions of people to maintain some semblance of privacy in their personal lives. Eventually, that alienation could destroy the free, global Internet that we all love.

Sources close to the family of Abbas Yazasanpanah Yazdi, 44, say his body has been found elsewhere in the United Arab Emirates. Yazdi, a father of two and naturalised British national, was last seen on the afternoon of 25 June leaving his office in Bur Dubai, the commercial heart of the thriving Gulf state. Concerns about his safety had reached senior ministerial level. Last week the foreign secretary, William Hague, raised Yazdi&apos;s disappearance when he spoke by telephone to his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Salehi. At the time a government official was quoted as saying: &quot;We believe that allegations that elements in Iran might be responsible for Mr Yazdi&apos;s disappearance are plausible, and we are taking them very seriously.&quot; Officers from Scotland Yard&apos;s counter-terrorism command, SO15, have been involved in the investigation into Yazdi&apos;s whereabouts. Yazdi&apos;s body was reported to have been found in Fujairah, one of the UAE&apos;s seven emirates on the coastline of the Gulf of Oman. Ali Reza Nourizadeh, a close friend of his family and the director of the Centre for Arab and Iranian studies in London, said the family were informed on Monday about his death. &quot;Yazdi&apos;s wife, Atena, and the whole family is devastated by the news,&quot; he told the Guardian. Following Hague&apos;s phone call, Iran&apos;s foreign ministry spokesman, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters in Tehran that it had been informed about the issue through media reports and was investigating the details of his case. &quot;The Islamic republic of Iran denies that it was involved in any illegal act in Dubai or any other countries,&quot; he said on Sunday. Yazdi is believed to hold dual British and Iranian nationality. He is understood to have spoken to two MPs in London in the weeks before his disappearance. Yazdi had just finished giving evidence by video link to a long-running international arbitration tribunal in The Hague involving United Arab Emirates-based Crescent Petroleum and the National Iranian Oil Company when he went missing. There is no suggestion that this involvement in the arbitration is connected to his disappearance. Yazdi had been due to return to complete his testimony the following day. He never reappeared. His wife feared he had been kidnapped by Iranian intelligence officers and taken to Iran. Yazdi had privileged access to certain Iranian politicians. A close childhood friend was Mehdi Hashemi Rafsanjani, son of former president Ayatollah Rafsanjani, who lived in Britain for three years after 2009. Atena Yazdi told the 7Days website in the UAE at the time: &quot;If he is still in the UAE I&apos;m sure the police can find him. If he&apos;s in Iran, it&apos;s completely different. I hope and pray for his safety.&quot; Mrs Yazdi moved back to Britain after he disappeared. The UK&apos;s Serious Fraud Office has been co-operating with Iran&apos;s State General Inspection Organisation (SGIO) which was seeking information about him, even though the UK does not have diplomatic relations with Iran. Formal ties between the two countries were suspended in November 2011. Among details handed over by the SFO to Tehran were the contents of Yazdi&apos;s online contacts book. Documents seen by the Guardian show that Iranian officials were told: &quot;We located an Excel file of addresses in Mr Yazdi&apos;s computer. A copy of the spreadsheet is attached marked &apos;Address Book&apos;.&quot; Asked why such details were given to Tehran, a spokesperson for the SFO said: &quot;We can neither confirm nor deny SFO interest in this matter. Requests for international assistance are usually dealt with by the Home Office, UK Central Authority, which is overseen by the secretary of state.&quot; A spokesperson for the Metropolitan police said: &quot;We can confirm that SO15 counter-terrorism command is investigating the disappearance of Abbas Yazasanpanah Yazdi, aged 44 years, on the 25 June in Dubai. We are providing family liaison support at this time. Inquiries continue. &quot;The Met police&apos;s counter-terrorism command on occasion assists with complex investigations which have an international element as they have the most appropriate investigative expertise.&quot; On Thursday, a Foreign Office spokesperson said: &quot;We are concerned by the reports [of his death] and are following up with the Emiratis who are leading the investigation into his disappearance.

The Northern Irishman was in serious danger of missing the US PGA Championship cut, which would have been a second premature major departure in succession, as the heavens opened above Oak Hill. A change of weather triggered an upturn in his fortunes. McIlroy has never made any secret of his distaste for playing in poor conditions. He perfectly illustrated as much yet again here on Friday, taking 39 shots over the front nine which had him flirting ominously with the cut line. The let-up in rain triggered a welcome improvement. McIlroy, who was three over at that stage, bogeyed again at the 1st \u2013 his 10th \u2013 but rallied to birdie four holes thereafter in a back nine of 32. He finished round two on level par and, at least, secure to play the closing 36 holes. McIlroy&apos;s body language is positive again. Sinking a putt from off the 7th green and his approach shot to tap-in range a hole later played their part in that. &quot;It did turn around when the weather turned around,&quot; McIlroy admitted. &quot;It feels good to play in like that when I knew that I had to. All I was telling myself was to be positive, that it was all about attitude. In the same position a few months ago, I wouldn&apos;t be here \u2013 I would be on my way home. &quot;I have to try and get off to fast start tomorrow. I have played the front nine very well over the last couple of days so I have to try and do that again. Something in the mid-60s would give me a good chance on Sunday.&quot; There are flashes that McIlroy is returning to brighter things and, importantly, that he has the fight for battles such as the one confronting him for a brief time here. The 24-year-old&apos;s troubles this year have been more directly linked to concentration than his switch to Nike equipment, even though that change cost him valuable time at the start of the season, but he now looks to have regained some of his on-course focus. If a successful defence of this title is beyond McIlroy, a scenario he isn&apos;t willing to concede, then there are other reasonable targets. He should, for example, look to cement his place for the culmination of the lucrative FedEx playoff series at Atlanta&apos;s Tour Championship. Thereafter McIlroy can target defending the DP Tour Championship he won so impressively in Dubai last November. Should McIlroy end 2013 on a high, it would at least offset much of his turmoil between January and now. Tiger Woods must break with recent habit and make low scores over the closing 36 holes of a major if he is to end his winless run which has currently lasted five years. Woods&apos;s Friday frustrations were summed up by a three-putt for par on the 14th and another one from 10ft for bogey two holes later. In between and again at 17 he impressively picked up shots but the world No1 finished on one over par and therefore 10 adrift of Jason Dufner. Woods struggled throughout his second round with the left-sided pin placements on his way to 70. Phil Mickelson survived the cut, narrowly, at two-over. &quot;This course rewards the players who are playing their best and I haven&apos;t been at my best,&quot; the Open champion said.", "title": "Rory McIlroy improves with weather but US PGA title hopes fade", "sentences": ["Thereafter McIlroy can target defending the DP Tour Championship he won so impressively in Dubai last November."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-09T19:22:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/10/michael-vaughan-hot-spot-drs", "tags": ["Ashes 2013", "Michael Vaughan", "The Ashes", "England cricket team", "Australia cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "article": "Michael Vaughan has repeated his call for Hot Spot technology to be withdrawn immediately from the decision review system (DRS), after its founder, Warren Brennan, admitted that its effectiveness has been undermined by the protective coating players use on their bats.

Sony&apos;s PlayStation Hedge Backfires as Dollar Costs Surge | Bloomberg Detailed piece of analysis on how the weak yen will affect Sony&apos;s bottom line, as the company pays for PS4 components in dollars. However, the company maintains it won&apos;t be repeating the heavy losses of the early PS3 years:  Sony is trying to prevent losses it incurred seven years ago when introducing PlayStation 3. Nintendo led global sales by introducing motion-sensing controllers for the Wii as a new way to play. Microsoft matched the feature with its Kinect peripheral, and won over non-gamers by offering entertainment, such as Netflix and sports, on its Xbox Live service.

Nvidia Shield review \u2022 Reviews \u2022 Eurogamer.net Eurogamer has a detailed review of Nvidia&apos;s entry into the emerging Android console market:   Overall, there&apos;s the sense that the performance of the software - while best-in-class by Android standards - doesn&apos;t quite have the polish to match Nvidia&apos;s hardware. Shield itself is beautifully crafted and highly polished, in stark contrast to much of the 3D library, even those titles Nvidia itself has chosen to showcase. There are no real problems with 2D titles of course, but the vast majority of those games will run just as well on a variety of tablet and smartphone hardware.  This reflects some of the concerns with the Ouya too.

The Jim Bolger-trained, Godolphin-owned 2,000 Guineas and St James&apos;s Palace Stakes winner was eased by his jockey, Kevin Manning, once his chance had gone in Sunday&apos;s ultra-competitive Deauville race, eventually finishing fifth. On Monday Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, Simon Crisford, revealed on the stable&apos;s website: &quot;Jim Bolger told me that Dawn Approach scoped with mucus after the race but he had been fine when tested before he left Ireland on Saturday. [The colt] is now on a course of antibiotics and will be rested until all is well with him.&quot; Meanwhile Frankie Dettori may have been left cursing his luck after he had steered an erratic path on Olympic Glory before a short-head defeat by Moonlight Cloud in the race but the trainer, Richard Hannon, and owner, Sheikh Joaan al-Thani, have been left with the enviable task of plotting a campaign for both the runner-up and his high-class stable companion Toronado. Repeated viewings of the weekend race indicate Dettori&apos;s mount got into enough trouble in running to suggest he might well have prevailed but for being blocked in his initial run and then having to switch at a vital stage. Considering it was Olympic Glory&apos;s first run since he returned &quot;not really right&quot;, according to the trainer&apos;s assistant Richard Hannon Jr, after a disappointing run in the French 2,000 Guineas in May, it could turn out to be the most significant display in a race full of interest. &quot;It could be an exciting second half of the season for both [Olympic Glory and Toronado] but maybe one could go for the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes at Ascot [on 19 October] and the other the Prix Moulin at Longchamp [on 15 September],&quot; said Hannon, who reiterated on Monday that the pair would be kept apart. &quot;We were very patient with [Olympic Glory] after the French 2,000 Guineas as he was not moving right when he came back. However, he is certainly right again now and he is a very good horse. Frankie gave him a lovely ride but, unfortunately, he could not get a run when he wanted it. Dawn Approach died quicker than we had expected, which cost us a length as we had to come around him,&quot; he added. Another three-year-old for whom fresh plans will need to be considered is Mars, who finished third in the St James&apos;s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot but is now to leave Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s yard to join Mike de Kock&apos;s small string at Newmarket. A syndicate including Bernard Cantor, who owns horses with William Haggas, has acquired a majority share in the horse but the Coolmore triumvirate of John Magnier, Michael Tabor and Derrick Smith will retain an interest in the Galileo colt. The South African De Kock has fared well with horses who have joined from O&apos;Brien with Archipenko, Eagle Mountain and most recently David Livingston all winning decent races. &quot;From what I&apos;ve seen this is a serious racehorse and I can&apos;t wait to train him,&quot; said De Kock on his website. &quot;This is a wonderful opportunity to compete at the highest level with a top horse and my thanks go to Coolmore and the syndicate.&quot; De Kock will attempt to win another big race this weekend with Soft Falling Rain in line to make his British debut in the Betfred Hungerford Stakes at Newbury on Saturday after David Livingston beat odds-on shot Telescope at Haydock last Saturday. While De Kock&apos;s team are excited at the prospect of seeing Soft Falling Rain back in action, assistant trainer Steve Jell has warned that the colt will improve enormously for the run. &quot;Soft Falling Rain is coming along nicely but you must remember that he&apos;s had a good few months off since he last ran,&quot; said Jell. &quot;He&apos;s been over here a while now and has been going nicely at home. &quot;We&apos;ll just see what happens on Saturday, we won&apos;t rush into making any future plans until we get this out of the way. &quot;It will be good to see him back in action, he looked very good in Dubai. We just want to see him run a nice race, but all of our horses that we&apos;ve run over here have improved massively after their first run and I reckon that will be the case with him.&quot;", "title": "Dawn Approach on antibiotics after returning sick from Deauville defeat", "sentences": ["&quot;It will be good to see him back in action, he looked very good in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-12T17:40:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/aug/13/middle-east-food-peace", "tags": ["Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Middle East peace talks", "Middle Eastern food and drink", "Life and style", "Israel", "Palestinian territories", "Lebanon", "Dubai", "Judaism"], "article": "Let&apos;s just leapfrog the logistics for a minute, and get to what happened: a Lebanese blogger and her friends visited an Iraqi-Jewish restaurant in Dubai. It was, by her account, a powerful experience \u2013 not just because of the unsurprising excellence of the food, but because it triggered an association with Lebanese home-cooking, and hence a thoughtful examination of collective Arab identity. Tasting a subtle riff on her own cuisine, the blogger, Sophie Chamas, noted: &quot;I am relieved. I did not come here to taste difference. I came here to reclaim a morsel of the collective memories that politics and history have denied me. I came here to reconstruct the Arab, long ago butchered and broken down like an animal carcass into individual, limp parts.&quot; She refers not just to the imposed unravelling of a hyphenated Arab-Jewish identity that emptied the Middle East of its centuries-old Jewish population, but also about a worrying and current sectarianism that might further desiccate the region. This all came about in May, when Dubai played host to a sort of living art exhibition, a pop-up Iraqi-Jewish restaurant created by artist Michael Rakowitz and the Moving Museum (as described, with tantalising food pics, here) The Iraqi-Jewish Rakowitz served up his grandmother&apos;s recipes on plates that this community managed to take with them when they left in the early 1950s. The Moving Museum described this cuisine as &quot;an endangered species, as many of these dishes were specific to the Jewish population and are no longer served in Iraq today&quot;. I share Chamas&apos;s strong reaction to Middle Eastern food: tasting fasoolia (green beans in tomato sauce) in Palestine, or a Lebanese friend&apos;s kousa mahshi (stuffed courgettes) or Egyptian street-side plates of ful medames triggers powerful associations with my parents&apos; kitchen: their anchoring, self-defining passion for Iraqi-Jewish cooking \u2013 their persistent quest for Middle Eastern ingredients during the culinary, er, challenge that was 1970s Britain. It is an instant reminder of Arab roots, a shared preoccupation, a tendency to discuss food for hours: ways of cooking dishes, different ingredients and recipe twists and, of course, which nation comes up with the best versions (usually Iraq \u2013 this is not a bias-free conversation \u2013 or, inevitably if a tiny bit begrudgingly, the Lebanese). Obviously, food is evocative \u2013 and more so for migrants and exiles. It is the bit of culture that lingers even when language and other markers have long faded. Like Italians, Indians, the Chinese and many others, Middle Easterners can be especially emotional about cuisine because it is such a core part of culture. &quot;It is intrinsic to the way of life and upbringing,&quot; says Middle Eastern food writer and legend, Anissa Helou. &quot;It&apos;s part of our life, from childhood. There is no question of nursery food for any Arab child: as soon as I started chewing, I was eating mashed chicken livers, tabouleh, all adult food.&quot; Helou says that cooking is as critical as consuming it; Middle Eastern men and women alike will know how dishes are made \u2013 or should be. More often, we hear about the politics of Middle Eastern food in the context of nationalistic battles over ownership. Israel sparks fury with its ubiquitous postcards of falafel skewered with an Israeli flag and a strapline declaring the pitta-nestled chickpea balls to be their &quot;national snack&quot;. President Obama unwittingly picked that barely-covered scab when it was revealed that he&apos;d be served falafel by the Israeli president on a recent regional trip. Back in 2008 (though it&apos;s a recurring issue) Lebanon accused Israel of draining the Cedar economy by appropriating hummus \u2013 which the Lebanese claim as their invention. But what&apos;s striking about Chamas&apos;s beautiful write-up of Iraqi-Jewish dining in Dubai is that it turns this standard battle on its head. This Lebanese blogger asks: &quot;Will our palettes save us? They, it seems, have not forgotten. They have been spared the amnesiac touch of nationalism(s). We can still recognise ourselves in the cuisines of those we are taught to despise.&quot; Could food really unite rather than divide? What if this strong culinary attachment were actually a way to bring Arab-Jews back into the Middle Eastern family, rather than used as a frontier barrier to ensure that animosity and exclusion persist? As I write that, it feels mawkishly idealistic in the face of a terrible political conflict, between Israelis and Palestinians but involving the whole region, to do with land, occupation and dispossession \u2013 a conflict that insists nationalism should trump every other component of identity. And yet on a personal level, it persists, stubborn and deep-seated: that overwhelming triumph of palate over politics, an instinctive and wonderful connection to a shared culture \u2013 one that, like it or not, irreversibly binds Arab-Jews to the Middle East.", "title": "Could palates, rather than politics, be the key to peace in the Middle East? | Rachel Shabi", "sentences": ["Let&apos;s just leapfrog the logistics for a minute, and get to what happened: a Lebanese blogger and her friends visited an Iraqi-Jewish restaurant in Dubai.", "This all came about in May, when Dubai played host to a sort of living art exhibition, a pop-up Iraqi-Jewish restaurant created by artist Michael Rakowitz and the Moving Museum (as described, with tantalising food pics, here) The Iraqi-Jewish Rakowitz served up his grandmother&apos;s recipes on plates that this community managed to take with them when they left in the early 1950s.", "But what&apos;s striking about Chamas&apos;s beautiful write-up of Iraqi-Jewish dining in Dubai is that it turns this standard battle on its head."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-13T12:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/aug/14/live-racing-august-14-2013", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "11.50am Dettori booked for Nunthorpe Stakes favourite Tony Paley: Frankie Dettori has been booked to ride the ante-post favourite Shea Shea in the Nunthorpe Stakes at York next week. The Mike de Kock-trained six-year-old has been ridden by Christophe Soumillon on his last five starts but the jockey is banned on the day of the Nunthorpe, which has prompted De Kock to secure the services of Dettori. The trainer revealed on his website: &quot;Christophe Soumillon was due to take the ride as usual, but he picked up a suspension in France and failed on appeal. He won&apos;t be available on the day. We&apos;re fortunate to have Frankie available to stand in.&quot; Dettori is due to partner Shea Shea, who won the Group One Al Quoz Sprint in Dubai in March, in a gallop on Thursday morning. De Kock reports Shea Shea in good form ahead of his Group One assignment: &quot;He&apos;s doing well, his coat looks good and he should be at his best for the race. It&apos;s an easier five furlongs than the one at Ascot where he was beaten late by Sole Power, so we&apos;re hoping it will suit him perfectly,&quot; said the South African trainer. Today&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook There probably aren&apos;t too many bad days to be Sir Michael Stoute - perhaps the time when Customs pinched $60,000 off him at Gatwick one Christmas, but even then he got it back by the following spring - and today at Salisbury looks like being a good one. Twice in the past four years, he has landed the Pembroke Cup, a mile handicap, and he fields a fascinating contender in Russian Realm (3.20). His dam, Russian Rhythm, a Guineas winner for Stoute, has only foaled a maiden winner so far but the signs are good that this one can do better than that. Of course, Russian Realm lost all three of his maiden runs, but he looked like a work in progress and showed promise when third at Sandown last year and again when third at Newbury in May, the last time we saw him. In between, he met trouble in running from a wide draw at Chester, having been favourite for a race at the May meeting that Stoute had previously won with Harbinger. The Newbury race was won by Remote, since a Group Three winner at Royal Ascot. The second, fourth, fifth, sixth and seventh have all won since. The handicapper has taken a chance by starting off Russian Realm in handicaps on a mark of 77. He needs to travel a fair bit better to be competitive over this mile, two furlongs short of his last two outings, but it would be no surprise if he looks a lot more like the finished article after almost three months away from the track. He&apos;s 7-4. In the following fillies&apos; Listed race, Stoute fields Mango Diva (3.55), a 6-1 shot, who got within half a length of Hot Snap on her debut at Kempton last year, then was the only one to see which way Montiridge went in a Listed race at Sandown in May. Both those efforts look a fair bit better in light of what those winners have since achieved. In between, Mango Diva won her maiden and she was last seen as a disappointing favourite for the Sandringham at Royal Ascot, when the ground may have been a shade too quick. In any event, she was not the only fancied runner in straight-course handicaps that week to get lost in a big field and some of the others have since shown that their flops were worth ignoring. Mango Diva has already shown form good enough to win this prize and has more scope for better than almost all her rivals. She seems overpriced.

The decision to end financing for Aid Afghanistan for Education, which provides schools for girls and women excluded from government classrooms, came despite a pledge last month to spend more than $200m (\u00a3130m) on &quot;women&apos;s empowerment&quot; as foreign troops head home. Since funds were cut off this spring teachers have been leading classes for free in the hope that the charity&apos;s director, Hassina Sherjan, can cobble together funds to pay their modest $140 monthly wages before they have to find new jobs. It is not the only educational institution to lose US government funds as Washington&apos;s generous aid budget shrinks dramatically. It is down by about 50% from a 2010 peak, and the impact of the cuts is fuelling fears among some Afghans that as Nato soldiers leave their governments are turning their backs on Kabul. The Afghanistan Technical Vocational Institute, which helps combat youth unemployment and a woeful lack of professional skills and training, is another organisation now &quot;running on fumes&quot;, according to its founder and director Sardar Roshan, a former ambassador to Pakistan. His teachers have worked for months without a salary and students chipped in to pay for their graduation this year, after funding ended in 2012. Roshan said promises of a new grant produced only limited cash for &quot;capacity building&quot;. The US embassy denies promising more cash. In 2010 Washington&apos;s development agency USAid spent $145m on Afghan education; this year it has requested less than $100m. Part of the problem that has trapped the vocational school and the women&apos;s education charity is a commitment by all foreign donors to channel more aid money through the government. Their aim is to improve ministers&apos; ability to handle funds, after years of watching the money pass through a virtual parallel administration run by foreign aid organisations. USAid said both organisations were told in advance that their funding would be terminated or cut, and they could compete for $56m of funds in the community-based education project and $35m for technical and vocational education, all distributed by the education ministry. The education ministry intended to fund the vocational institute, said a spokesman, Amanullah Aiman, pointing out that it was built on government land. Technical problems were delaying funds, and the institute&apos;s management was unhappy as there would be less money than USAid provided, he added. He declined to comment on Aid Afghanistan for Education, saying he was not familiar with the organisation. Aid Afghanistan for Education began life as an underground network of classrooms after the Taliban halted all female schooling, and grew to be a lifeline for women whose education was cut off by the Taliban&apos;s ban, by poverty or by early marriage. An annual budget of about $1.5m is needed to pay for 13 schools in nine provinces, totalling more than 3,200 pupils. Some, in rural areas, are the only women&apos;s classrooms for miles. &quot;I am glad that this kind of school exists, because we will not be accepted in other ones,&quot; said Sahar Gul, a girl who was married at around 12 and then chained up and tortured by her in-laws for refusing to work as a prostitute. At the time of her rescue she was illiterate. &quot;I feel a lot of positive change, I am in fourth grade now,&quot; she added, sitting in the sun after morning classes beside classmate Mumtaz, a teenager burned by an acid attack after she refused to marry a militia commander. Nine women from a shelter for abused women study at the school, alongside pupils such as 23-year-old Shaima, forced to drop out when she married and is now a mother of two. The headmistress has been honest with her students about the financial crisis they face. &quot;We are worried, because this is the only place we can study, we are married or too old for other schools,&quot; Shaima said. &quot;Life is meaningless without education.&quot; Sherjan said the lack of funding felt particularly bitter after the US embassy last month unveiled a $200m &quot;Promote&quot; project to support women&apos;s education and employment. She was told her organisation would not be eligible for a grant. Overall the international community has promised about $4bn a year in aid for Afghanistan until 2016, and the two organisations need less than $5m a year to run large programmes with a strong track record tackling two fundamental challenges: education and youth employment. But in a sea of promises, they simply cannot find the hard cash. &quot;USAid says go to the [education] ministry, the ministry says they have no money, go to USAid,&quot; said Roshan with a grim smile. Sherjan, an Afghan American, set up her schools to help girls excluded from the mainstream education system. She is in talks with officials to integrate their 13 schools, but it could take several years. &quot;We don&apos;t come under the ministry structure because they don&apos;t have a programme like this,&quot; Sherjan said from a study displaying a Harvard degree certificate and tributes to the work of an organisation, she left a comfortable life in the US to build up. The US embassy said overage women were not barred from community schools, and other NGOs catered to them with &quot;accelerated learning programmes&quot;, although two of three examples cited were for girls up to age 18, which would exclude most AAE pupils. Sherjan said she would eventually like to wean the project off foreign aid, but the education ministry was not yet willing to absorb the schools and domestic philanthropy in Afghanistan had not kept pace with the dramatic increase in personal wealth. &quot;You really have to educate the private sector \u2026 that social entrepreneurship is maybe a better thing than buying another house in Dubai,&quot; she said. At present, there is a campaign through the crowdfunding website Indiegogo to try to raise the bare minimum to keep the schools functioning. For women&apos;s activists the funding shortfall is being interpreted as another warning sign that even if substantial western aid money keeps flowing, as attention shifts elsewhere, hard-won ground could be lost. &quot;There is no money for programmes such as AAE which have been there for years and are actually sustainable, but they have all these unrealistic programmes,&quot; said Wazhma Frogh, a prominent activist who is also a member of the charity&apos;s board. &quot;If you take the money away from a school which is the only hope for women in the area, how can you say you are committed to the women of Afghanistan.&quot; Mokhtar Amiri contributed reporting ", "title": "Afghan educators struggle for funding as US aid budget shrinks", "sentences": ["&quot;You really have to educate the private sector \u2026 that social entrepreneurship is maybe a better thing than buying another house in Dubai,&quot; she said."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-18T13:36:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/aug/18/wife-briton-abducted-dubai-anguish-reports", "tags": ["Dubai", "UK news", "World news", "Iran", "Middle East and North Africa", "United Arab Emirates"], "article": "The wife of a British citizen who disappeared in Dubai in June and is feared to have been abducted and taken to Iran told the Guardian of her anguish at his disappearance, compounded by what appear to have been false reports that he had been killed. In a statement Atena Yazdi said she knew very little other than that her husband, Abbas Yazdi, had vanished. She and her children, aged 12 and 10, were &quot;struggling to get through each day&quot; with no knowledge of what had happened, she said. Abbas Yazdi, 44, a naturalised British national, was last seen on the afternoon of 25 June leaving his office in Bur Dubai, the commercial heart of Dubai. His family believe Yazdi, who is close to the son of Iran&apos;s former president, Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, was kidnapped by Iranian intelligence agents and could be in detained in the country. Earlier this month Atena Yazdi, 37, was told by British officials that her husband had been found dead elsewhere in the United Arab Emirates, seemingly after being killed during the kidnap attempt. However, the UAE government denied a body had been found, and the family now presumed the report was false and he is most likely inside Iran. In her statement, Atena Yazdi said that while authorities in the UK and Dubai were looking into the case there had been very little information made public, leading to much speculation. She said: &quot;We have very few facts other than that Abbas went missing on 25 June. However, despite this a number of cruel and misleading rumours have been published and broadcast, often where I or my friends or family are wrongly named as the source of such rumours.&quot; Another rumour was that she had been in contact with Iranian opposition groups, Yazdi said, saying this was also untrue. She added: &quot;I am not interested in politics. My only wish is to have my husband home again. It has been one and a half months since I last saw my husband and my children last saw their father, we are struggling to get through each day.&quot; Scotland Yard counter-terrorism officers have been among those investigating the disappearance, while the foreign secretary, William Hague, has raised the case with his Iranian counterpart, Ali Akbar Salehi. British officials have been quoted anonymously as saying the idea that &quot;elements in Iran&quot; might have kidnapped Yazdi was plausible. Iran has denied any involvement. Yazdi, who is believed to hold dual British and Iranian nationality, had just finished giving evidence by video link to an international arbitration tribunal in The Hague involving United Arab Emirates-based Crescent Petroleum and the National Iranian Oil Company. There is no suggestion that this involvement in the arbitration is connected to his disappearance. He had been due to return to complete his testimony the following day but vanished. The UK&apos;s Serious Fraud Office has been co-operating with Iran&apos;s State General Inspection Organisation (SGIO) which was seeking information about Yazdi, even though the UK does not have diplomatic relations with Iran. Formal ties between the two countries were suspended in November 2011. Among details handed over by the SFO to Tehran were the contents of Yazdi&apos;s online contacts book, according to documents seen by the Guardian.", "title": "Wife of Briton abducted in Dubai reveals anguish over false reports", "sentences": ["The wife of a British citizen who disappeared in Dubai in June and is feared to have been abducted and taken to Iran told the Guardian of her anguish at his disappearance, compounded by what appear to have been false reports that he had been killed.", "Abbas Yazdi, 44, a naturalised British national, was last seen on the afternoon of 25 June leaving his office in Bur Dubai, the commercial heart of Dubai.", "In her statement, Atena Yazdi said that while authorities in the UK and Dubai were looking into the case there had been very little information made public, leading to much speculation."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-18T16:48:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/aug/18/real-solution-arlington-million", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "US sports"], "article": "The 31st Arlington Million provided one of the most thrilling finishes since the great John Henry short-headed The Bart in the inaugural running, with Alan Garcia&apos;s mount Real Solution eventually winning this year&apos;s prize. First, though, the Mike de Kock-trained The Apache, ridden by Christophe Soumillon appeared to fight back from well down the field to win a photo finish over Real Solution, trained by Chad C Brown. But it took only seconds for Garcia to lodge an objection and even at the first view it was obvious that Soumillon had hampered Real Solution so badly that the result might have been overturned even if the race had been run in Britain. The stewards had no hesitation in reversing the placings and, if some of those who had been whooping at The Apache&apos;s gameness expressed vocal discontent at his disqualification, there could be no argument about the correctness of their decision. The winning owners were now Kenneth and Sarah Ramsey, whose turf horses have been sweeping America this year rather than Sheikh Mohammed bin Khalifa al Maktoum. &quot;As you can see we were the better horse but he got scared by the screen and shifted out,&quot; said Soumillon, exonerating himself from any blame by suggesting that the giant TV screen may have contributed to the disqualification. There may have been some merit in this claim as The Apache certainly seemed to show great courage in the struggle over the final yards. But there could be no reservations. The rules had been broken and the brave winner had to go down. In behind was Side Glance, who ran a great race for Jamie Spencer and Andrew Balding without ever looking like interfering with the epic battle up front but still provided the first endorsement of the form of the Dubai World Cup in which he finished fourth to Animal Kingdom. Grandeur (seventh), Guest of Honour (ninth), Hunter&apos;s Light (10th) and the vaunted former Argentinian Indy Point (last) never really got involved. But Mull of Killough challenged the front running Little Mike approaching the home turn and looked for a few strides as though he might be good enough before weakening to finish eighth. If this was a slightly unsatisfactory climax to an afternoon of international racing in the Chicago sunshine, there had been no shortage of less controversial excitement in the preceding three Group Ones. Dandino at 4-5 scored the expected victory in the American St Leger for last year&apos;s winning trainer Marco Botti. But this was far from the straightforward success that most of those who dismiss the very concept of an American stayer might have anticipated. Ryan Moore had to show plenty of skill to get himself out of trouble as a hole on the inside closed abruptly in the straight and he had to pull out for a clear run. For a horse who almost got into the habit of finishing runner-up in Britain, however, Dandino showed great resolution to hold off the tenacious Suntracer, who dismantled the theory that American horses cannot get a step beyond 12 furlongs. A relieved Moore said: &quot;I was locked in the whole race but he was the best horse. I thought I&apos;d try to keep it simple but they were on top of me the whole race. Then he picked up like a natural.&quot; The Michael Bell-trained Wigmore Hall, generally reckoned in pre-race discussions to be the only serious danger to the favourite, could produce little in the straight after being held up by Jamie Spencer for a wide bid. &quot;He&apos;s OK,&quot; said Spencer. &quot;He just didn&apos;t stay. It was worth a try&quot;. The afternoon&apos;s second Group One, the 10-furlong Secretariat for three-year-olds, did nothing to disprove the theory that this year&apos;s Europeans are a pretty ordinary bunch. The Jeremy Noseda trained Yeager never offered Moore much hope of a quick double after Dandino, and Visiyani, representing last year&apos;s winning connections of the Aga Khan and Alain de Royer Dupre, failed to get the trip after threatening briefly on the turn. The race was won in impressive fashion by Admiral Kitten for the Ramsey family, presently all-conquering on American turf, who bolted clear early in the straight under Rosie Napravnik and was never threatened from there on. If Moore was disconsolate after the Secretariat, he was jubilant after James Wigan&apos;s Dank, who had been training brilliantly all week, translated the swagger she had been showing in preparation to the nine furlongs of the Beverly D. The local punters sent Marketing Mix off favourite but Dank, with her tongue hanging out and her head tilted to one side, was always climbing over one of the best fillies in America and bolted clear halfway up the straight to win by four and a quarter lengths. Paul Cole&apos;s Gifted Girl, ridden by Tom Queally, pursued daylight gamely to take second, with the American, Ausus, just shading Marketing Mix for third. The winning owner modestly deferred to the absent Sir Michael Stoute when asked whether his star&apos;s next target was likely to be the Breeders&apos; Cup Filly and Mare Turf.

Ashok Vaswani, who has a key role in a new management team charged with altering the culture at the scandal-hit bank, says: &quot;If you are not humble you cannot learn. It is a core value that drives me a lot.&quot; Sitting in a meeting room above a busy branch on Borough high street, London, the 52-year-old is keen to get across the message that he wants to put customers at the heart of everything done by himself and his 30,000 branch staff across the UK. He describes the data recording complaints against the bank as horrendous. There were 381,740 complaints in the first six months of this year. He insists, though, he is cutting out problems such as requirements for customers to send faxes and inform the bank of their travel plans to be able to use a credit card abroad. In the last six months of 2012 Barclays was the most complained about bank in Britain \u2013 by some measures with more than 400,000 complaints. &quot;I want to put the company out there to say we are totally committed to driving these complaints down,&quot; Vaswani said. Referring to Barclays&apos; slogan promoting itself as the &quot;go to&quot; bank \u2013 a line devised by his boss, Antony Jenkins, after he was promoted to chief executive in the wake of the Libor scandal, \u2013 Vaswani said: &quot;What is &apos;go to&apos;? Antony would say it was an emotional connectiveness to the brand. You can&apos;t build emotional connectiveness with a brand if you&apos;ve got so many complaints.&quot; Vaswani joined Barclays in 2010. He knew Jenkins from their work at the vast US banking empire of Citigroup. His arrival in London three years ago came through a globe trotting career with Citi that began when he left India for Dubai in 1987. He arrived in the Middle East with just $14 in his pocket and met the India-born daughter of a client whom he later married. Their daughter was born in Dubai. From there he went to Turkey, Brussels, New York and Singapore, then back to New York. No sooner had he arrived in London than he was running Barclays&apos; African operations. He gained his current role, that of running 1,577 UK branches, and 797 branches elsewhere in Europe, by stepping into Jenkins&apos; shoes when he moved up from retail chief to the top job. He got a Singaporean passport after falling in love with the island city state while running Citi&apos;s Asian operations, a career route that left him returning to New York 15 times a year to visit his wife and daughter who preferred to stay in the US. During the banking crisis, when Citi incurred heavy losses, he was working in private equity with former colleagues from Citi before returning to banking again with Barclays. He says he now intends to publish Barclays&apos; complaints data every three months, twice as often as required by the Financial Conduct Authority, and to outline the key causes of complaints. Payment protection insurance has been a leading cause of customer anger, and has cost Barclays \u00a34bn. The bank had 381,740 complaints in the first six months of the year. Vaswani would rather focus on the numbers without PPI, where complaints were down 46% to 91,215 in the first six months of the year. Vaswani is keen on digital banking, technology and social media. He has ruled out job cuts. As a member of the executive committee he finds his pay does not need to be disclosed. It seems likely he receives about \u00a32m a year. He admits that, as &quot;for any normal person, money is important&quot; but what motivates him, he says, is his desire to improve the banking culture. In a lecture this year to the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies he defined culture as being about &quot;how you behave when no one else is looking&quot;. It a definition that was used by Bob Diamond, the former Barclays CEO ousted during the Libor scandal, and Vaswani admitted that culture could be hard to instil across a large workforce. &quot;This is about looking at the end of the assignment, looking at myself in the mirror and saying I was a trustee for a great company and a great franchise and I did everything humanly possible to make it a better franchise [for the successor],&quot; he says. An only child, his mother, an Indian government official, was his main motivator after his father, a businessman, died when he was six. If his father had lived longer his career path could have been different, he suggests. But it was his mother, he says, who encouraged humility, and it was the opening of his mind to learning that &quot;was the huge thing&quot; she gave him.", "title": "Barclays branch chief vows culture change at scandal-hit bank", "sentences": ["His arrival in London three years ago came through a globe trotting career with Citi that began when he left India for Dubai in 1987.", "Their daughter was born in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-20T16:03:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/aug/21/africa-hip-hop-music-sarkodie-faarow-saigon", "tags": ["Hip-hop", "Ghana", "Africa", "Tanzania", "World music", "Somalia", "Rap", "Music", "World news"], "article": "     Even if it&apos;s filled to the brim with Arab world stereotypes (desert, camel, mysterious transactions on a sand dune, Arab money, belly dance, a dude with a falcon), you gotta LOVE the new Sarkodie video to the single Illuminati (the single itself was released towards the end of last year).

Saigon - Rudia  If you lived in Tanzania in the 90s, as a hip-hop head, the name Deplowmatz (DPT) was without a doubt on your radar. The crew made name with a string of hits including Are you down with the DPT and Take a ride. Produced by Master Jay, they introduced a clean and polished sound driven by 80s smooth funk samples that helped redefine Tanzanian hip hop. The name of the group came from the fact that two members&apos; parents were diplomats, and indeed members Saigon and Dola Soul first met when living in Lagos in Nigeria. If you want to hear a DPT classic, check out the latest African hip-hop radio show for the MJ sample driven Kila siku kila mwaka. After one album release and a couple of hit singles (including a solo venture where Saigon teamed up with P-Funk and Kalamashaka for Au Siyo, which became a big hit on the Kenyan scene), the Deplowmatz became inactive in the late 90s as their members went to study; Saigon moved to UK while Dola embarked on a solo career. Saigon was then heard on a few solo singles recorded in UK, and later in Tanzania after he moved back, but they didn&apos;t have the same impact as the earlier DPT work. We always wondered what would have happened if Saigon hadn&apos;&apos;t have left for UK back then \u2013 another DPT album? Or a solo album by Saigon? Without a doubt, either of those would have claimed its space in the history of Tanzanian hip hop in an era before Bongo Flava.            So to our pleasant surprise, here&apos;s Rudia, a hardcore track produced by Chizen Brain, and a video by Benjamin Busungu (Mambo Jambo) that shows Saigon doing what he does best, spitting on the mic at full energy level.

First is the always-on microphone, which a person can use to activate the device using trigger words, such as &quot;OK Google Now,&quot; to make phone calls or access services and features. The feature is possible through a special, low-power chip developed by Motorola that keeps the microphone on without draining the battery. The always-ready microphone, coupled with the massive amount of data collection, makes the Moto X a valuable target for cybercriminals and cyberspies, who are already heavily focused on developing malware to take control of Android devices.  No need for plastic cups or laser microphones.

It&apos;s far more likely that the people who pirated the game have only one method of finding and installing apps, and that is through pirate sites. One thing that helped me reach that conclusion was the location statistics for the pirated copies. About 95% of the pirated copies are being installed in Russia and China (and of those, mostly China). We didn&apos;t even translate our Google Play store into Russian or Chinese, so it&apos;s almost certain that the pirates just found our app on localized pirate sites. On the other hand, I&apos;m glad our menu design is intuitive enough that you can play the game without speaking English!  Yes, piracy of the Android version of the app (yada yada) but Seznec pulls out far more interesting lessons from the experience. (Thanks #ClarkeViper for the link.) Teens and Mobile Apps Privacy &gt;&gt; Pew Internet &amp; American Life Project  Half (51%) of teen apps users say that they have decided not to install a cell phone or tablet app after they found out they would have to share personal information in order to use it. Younger teen apps users ages 12-13 are more likely than older teen apps users 14-17 to say that they have avoided apps over concerns about personal information sharing (56% vs. 49%). Boys and girls are equally likely to avoid certain apps for these reasons. There are no clear patterns of variation according to the parent&apos;s income, education level or race and ethnicity. One in four teen apps users have uninstalled an app because they found out it was collecting personal information that they didn&apos;t want to share.  There&apos;s hope for the next generation yet.

But Maher al-Assad has in many ways played a more decisive role in the country&apos;s civil war than his elder brother, commanding its most formidable military division as it claws back losses and leading the defence of Damascus against an opposition that remains entrenched on the capital&apos;s outskirts. The question many Syrians are asking, after last week&apos;s revelations of an apparent chemical attack on civilians in rebel-held areas, is what role the president&apos;s brother may have played in the atrocity. Maher has remained a senior member of the Ba&apos;ath party&apos;s central committee and a central pillar of a police state that, despite the ravages of war and insurrection, remains one of the most effective in the world. As the trajectory of Syria&apos;s war has wobbled throughout the past year, opposition gains in parts being offset by regime advances elsewhere, the 4th Armoured Division Maher commands has been a chief protagonist on behalf of the regime.He has acted as division commander since at least 2000, and at the same time leads Syria&apos;s other premier fighting force, the Republican Guards. Both units have been at the vanguard of the war since its earliest days, and were active again last week as loyalist forces launched their biggest operation yet to root out rebel groups from the capital. It was while this operation was under way that thousands of residents of east Ghouta were exposed to what scientists increasingly believe was a nerve agent, possibly sarin. Attempts to pin down who was responsible for the attack are now the subject of a global intelligence effort that has already started to zero in on loyalist military units as the likely suspects. In the days since, Syria has persistently denied having used its stocks of sarin to shell the area. The 4th division has remained relatively unaffected by desertions and defections that plagued other divisions in the first 18 months of the war. Until about then \u2014 18 July last year \u2014 Maher was visibly in charge. Frontline troops saw him often, especially in the hotspots of what was then more an insurrection than the full-blown civil and proxy regional war it is now. In Deraa he personally led a siege by 4th division troops in March 2011, in response to a spark of defiance by a group of schoolboys, who wrote on a mosque wall calling for Bashar to leave. The division left an unambiguous calling card. &quot;He came to see us one weekend down there,&quot; said a former 4th division conscript who fled to Istanbul soon afterwards. &quot;He told us not to shoot at the men with guns, because they were with us. He told us only to shoot at people without guns, that they were the terrorists. &quot;It took me a while to protest at that. He made us shoot at their hearts and heads. And anyone that was shooting high and wide [deliberately] would be beaten, or killed.&quot; In Jordan&apos;s Zaatari refugee camp, only nine kilometres south of Deraa, which is now home to a sizeable chunk of the city&apos;s residents, Maher&apos;s name is spoken of with visceral anger. &quot;His brother is a puppet for Maher and the Iranians,&quot; said Khaled Othman, a plumber from the city, standing in the flap of a UN supply tent. &quot;Maher is the devil. He personally tried to annihilate us just because we defied him. He took pleasure in it, along with his closest officers. Did you see the video of him in the prison?&quot; The refrain is commonly asked in communities that support the Syrian opposition. It refers to a prison revolt in 2008 that Maher was asked to put down; a task he carried out with brutal efficiency, killing many who had taken guards and soldiers hostage, then filming the bodies with his camera phone. The phone video is often showed by supporters of the Assad regime as purported evidence of the strength of the brothers. But between the statesman and the general, it has been Maher who has inspired more fear \u2014 and speculation. His last appearance in public was several weeks before an explosion in a meeting room in central Damascus killed security chief, and the Assads&apos; brother-in-law, Assef Shawkat, who had married their sister, Bushra. Also killed that day was the defence minister and several other members of the inner sanctum. Rumours have circulated since that Maher was also in the room at the time and was wounded. Last year Abdullah Omar, a former press officer in the presidential palace who defected in September, said he had seen Maher visit the palace and he had appeared to have lost part of a hand and leg. The suggestion has not since been confirmed. Turkish officials believe that the younger Assad was wounded that day \u2014 one of the few times that the opposition has got so close to the seat of power. &quot;But he is alive and functioning,&quot; said one senior Turkish diplomat. &quot;And the 4th division is still one of their better units.&quot; In Lebanon, where in more settled times leaders from all sides of politics beat a regular path to Damascus, there has been nothing from Maher for more than a year. &quot;We know his wife is in Dubai along with Bushra,&quot; said the leader of one political bloc. &quot;And we know that Bashar will have a hard time keeping him in his box. If they think they are winning, they will behave without any restraint. And if they did the chemical attack, he won&apos;t be far away from it.&quot;", "title": "Did Assad's ruthless brother mastermind alleged Syria gas attack?", "sentences": ["&quot;We know his wife is in Dubai along with Bushra,&quot; said the leader of one political bloc."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-24T20:43:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2013/aug/27/university-awards-partners", "tags": ["University Awards"], "article": "Leadership Foundation      The Leadership Foundation is committed to developing and improving the management and leadership skills of existing and future leaders of higher education.

If Iraq or Iran were affected by any fallout from a military strike on Syria, the global oil market would rely on extra output from Saudi Arabia, the only member of the Organisation of the Petroleum Exporting Countries with significant spare oil production capacity. &quot;The Saudis could handle most likely scenarios, but the markets will look at the shrinking spare capacity that remains after any disruption is made up, and that would be bullish [for higher oil prices],&quot; said Wittner. The oil price spike was a boost to Shell, whose share price rose almost 4% to \u00a322.25, and BP, whose shares rose by more than 1% at 452p. The wider FTSE 100 index of leading companies fell by nearly 0.5% early on , adding to an already 3% slump since the middle of the month on the back of fears about Syria, allied with concerns that the US would finally halt a long-running government economic stimulus package. Stock markets in continental Europe were also down, as was the Nikkei index in Japan, which fell by more than 2% to 13,264 points, with companies such as Toyota and Sony down up to 3%. The Dubai Financial Market index closed at 2,549.61 points, with Emaar Properties leading the rout. Shares in the developer that built Dubai&apos;s Burj Khalifa, the largest freestanding structure in the world, fell almost 8.5%. Most mining companies based in London, such as Glencore Xstrata, were hit by the political uncertainty, but the price of gold \u2013 seen as a haven \u2013 continued to rise as did the US currency. The dollar strengthened 0.5% against the Japanese yen and 0.3% versus the euro. Ishaq Siddiqi, London-based market strategist at ETX Capital, explained the dangers to the wider economy of higher crude values on the back of foreign aircraft strikes on Syria. &quot;Once filtered through to the real global economy, the increase in oil prices will put a halt to the pace of economic momentum we are currently experiencing in major parts of the world. &quot;It&apos;s plausible that Brent oil prices could be over $120 a barrel in the coming days and, if oil prices spike even higher, it wouldn&apos;t be out of the question for the US Federal Reserve to hold off on tapering stimulus measures this year.&quot; Threats of a $150 oil price take the markets back to July 2008 when Brent briefly traded at US$147.50, the highest intraday price on record. This was the height of the economic boom, which was followed by the autumn collapse of Lehman Brothers and then a full-scale banking crisis. Crude then crashed to $40 but has largely been priced at over $100 since the middle of 2010, despite a relatively slow recovery in the world economy. Prices have been pushed upwards due to a mixture of stronger demand and supply problems.

Doyle&apos;s contract does not officially begin until Sunday, but he will hope to make the best possible start to his new retainer when he replaces William Buick, John Gosden&apos;s stable jockey, on the 2,000 Guineas favourite Kingman at Sandown on Saturday. Prince Khalid&apos;s pink, green and white silks are among the most famous and familiar on the turf, and have been carried by dozens of outstanding performers including Dancing Brave, Workforce and, most recently, the brilliant Frankel. He has not retained a No1 jockey since Richard Hughes decided to ride as a freelance at the end of 2006, but has clearly been impressed by Doyle&apos;s rise to prominence this season with three Group One victories on Roger Charlton&apos;s Al Kazeem. Al Kazeem&apos;s success in the Prince of Wales&apos;s Stakes at Royal Ascot in June was Doyle&apos;s first at the meeting and he followed up with two more wins on the same afternoon. In all, he has four Group One victories to his name, the first coming on Cityscape in the Dubai Duty Free, one of the world&apos;s most valuable turf events, in 2012. Doyle, who is the son of the former trainer Jacqui Doyle, was born into racing and riding and partnered his first winner as a 17-year-old in June 2005. The following year, he rode 76 winners but, after two more solid seasons, the winners, and his strike-rate, started to dwindle. After a disappointing 2009 in which Doyle rode just 28 winners, he went as far as enrolling to train as a plumber, but decided to stick with racing and has been Roger Charlton&apos;s stable jockey since the start of last season, an association which began with Cityscape&apos;s win at Meydan. &quot;It&apos;s a great honour to be asked to ride for such a world-renowned operation like Juddmonte,&quot; Doyle said in a statement. &quot;However, I would not be in this fortunate position if it had not been for such wonderful support from Roger Charlton and his other owners, in particular Mr [John] Deer, who gave me the chance to ride a truly great horse in Al Kazeem. &quot;I hope to repay the faith [Prince Khalid] has shown in handing me one of the best appointments in world racing that a jockey can have.&quot; Teddy Grimthorpe, Prince Khalid&apos;s racing manager, said the owner &quot;has been very impressed with his riding and he wanted to retain a jockey. The first ride that caught the eye was on Cityscape at the Dubai World Cup [meeting]. He has a very good racing brain, he&apos;s cool under pressure and he&apos;s pretty strong in a finish.&quot; Doyle will continue to ride Al Kazeem, who is being steered towards either the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp or the QIPCO Champion Stakes at Ascot, for the remainder of the season. &quot;Cityscape, I suppose, was the start of it and he hasn&apos;t let us down since,&quot; Charlton said. &quot;He&apos;s got a good brain in his head and he&apos;s very relaxed. The big occasions don&apos;t get to him and horses run for him.&quot; In addition to Buick, who will give up the rides on Kingman and the recent Group One winner Winsili, the biggest losers following Doyle&apos;s appointment are likely to be Ryan Moore and Tom Queally, the principal jockeys for Sir Michael Stoute and Lady Cecil respectively. Moore has worn the Abdullah silks 47 times this year, while Queally has taken 37 in his role as principal rider at Warren Place in Newmarket, where Lady Cecil currently holds the licence following the death of her husband, Sir Henry Cecil. Doyle remains an outsider for next year&apos;s jockeys&apos; title at around 40-1, but he is quoted at just 4-5 by Coral to ride a Group One winner for Abdullah during the remainder of the season. His first Group One ride for his new employer is expected to be on John Gosden&apos;s Excess Knowledge in the St Leger at Doncaster on 14 September.", "title": "James Doyle signs as Khalid Abdullah's jockey and will ride Kingman", "sentences": ["In all, he has four Group One victories to his name, the first coming on Cityscape in the Dubai Duty Free, one of the world&apos;s most valuable turf events, in 2012.", "The first ride that caught the eye was on Cityscape at the Dubai World Cup [meeting]."], "publicationDate": "2013-08-29T17:45:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/02/england-eoin-morgan-ireland-odi", "tags": ["England cricket team", "Ireland Cricket Team", "Eoin Morgan", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "Heard the one about the Irishman who will captain England in a one-day international against Ireland at his old club ground? Eoin Morgan will find himself in that potentially tricky situation in front of a capacity 10,000 crowd in Malahide, in the northern suburbs of Dublin on Tuesday. While he was happy to praise the development of the ground in particular, and Irish cricket in general, Morgan refused to go along with the theory that the trickle of players such as him from Ireland to England may be about to dry up. Boyd Rankin, the 29-year-old Warwickshire seamer who has played in three one-day internationals against England in the past six years \u2013 including Ireland&apos;s World Cup triumph in Bangalore in the 2011 World Cup \u2013 may make an ODI debut for England that could be seen as either poignant or provocative. William Porterfield, a county team-mate of Rankin at Edgbaston who is Ireland&apos;s captain, joined his coach, Phil Simmons, the former West Indies opener, at the pre-match press conference in expressing the hope that the steady progress of Cricket Ireland towards the sport&apos;s top table would prevent any further defections. George Dockrell, Somerset&apos;s Dublin-born left-arm spinner, is already thought to be on England&apos;s radar. &quot;Everything being done behind the scenes \u2026 hopefully will mean Boyd is the last person,&quot; said Simmons. Portefield added: &quot;As long as we are producing those players and ticking the box in terms of showing we can host events like this, then that extra revenue means players will not necessarily have to take that step of playing for England. &quot;Hopefully a lot of young Irish cricketers coming through will not have to make that decision. It will be a no-brainer as we will have an international calendar.&quot; However, Morgan, who played 23 ODIs for Ireland before making the switch he had long envisaged soon after the 2007 World Cup, remains unconvinced. &quot;The main factor in deciding whether your aspirations are there is Test match cricket,&quot; he said. &quot;If you have a young, ambitious guy who wants to play Test cricket he&apos;s going to look elsewhere. It&apos;s unfortunate but it&apos;s the nature of playing cricket in Ireland and for Ireland. &quot;If you watch any of the Test matches this summer you&apos;re dreaming if you think anything has changed. The Ashes is everything. The rivalry, the hype and the standard of cricket and how everyone adores and admires the guys playing in it should drive you to want to play cricket.&quot; Ireland have a declared aim of securing Test match status by 2020, having confirmed their status as the most competitive of the associate members of the International Cricket Council by winning the World Cricket League to secure their place at a third consecutive World Cup in Australia and New Zealand in 2015. This will be England&apos;s fourth ODI in Ireland since the first at Stormont in 2006 and, although they are unbeaten, each of the past two victories has been tight under the Duckworth-Lewis method. The forecast is fine and England have again travelled without their star names \u2013 eight of them, as in addition to the five players who are taking a complete post-Ashes break, Kevin Pietersen, Jonathan Trott and Joe Root have been given the Ireland game off before linking up with the squad before the start of the five-match ODI series against Australia at Headingley on Friday. That has led to a little more chuntering about a perceived lack of support from England for Ireland&apos;s international ambitions \u2013 although Warren Deutrom, the chief executive of Cricket Ireland, was at pains to stress the practical help provided &quot;below the parapet&quot;. It could also provide a chance for up to five ODI debutants, including Rankin. &quot;It&apos;s exciting to see him with three Lions on his chest,&quot; said Morgan, who has been cast aside from Test cricket since floundering against Pakistan in Dubai and Abu Dhabi in early 2012. &quot;The opportunity is endless and if he achieves his potential hopefully we&apos;ll see him in a white shirt sooner rather than later.&quot; He does not seem big on diplomacy.", "title": "England captain Eoin Morgan sees no end to Irish emigration", "sentences": ["&quot;It&apos;s exciting to see him with three Lions on his chest,&quot; said Morgan, who has been cast aside from Test cricket since floundering against Pakistan in Dubai and Abu Dhabi in early 2012."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-02T21:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/sep/04/best-city-in-the-world", "tags": ["City breaks", "Travel", "London", "UK news", "London holidays", "United Kingdom holidays", "Europe holidays", "England holidays", "Paris", "France", "World news", "Paris holidays", "France holidays", "New York", "US news"], "article": "For the first time, most of the world&apos;s populations live in cities. Rapid growth in air travel means even more people will be visiting them in the future. So where does the world want to visit, do business, or live? Ipsos Mori has surveyed more than 18,000 people in 24 countries, to find out. The most striking finding from the Ipsos Top Cities research is that there are a handful of &quot;superbrand&quot; cities. New York is the clear leader, but London and Paris, in joint second place, do very well indeed, chosen by large numbers of people as places they want to go. But the world&apos;s public don&apos;t just think about America and Europe. The United Arab Emirates may be home to the tiniest fraction of the world&apos;s population, but punches far above its weight in terms of profile, as witnessed by Abu Dhabi&apos;s fourth place as somewhere to visit. Meanwhile, Sydney&apos;s claims to truly be a &quot;world city&quot; are confirmed. It&apos;s clear that the global public is quite discerning and knows the cities well enough to avoid having to make hasty generalisations. New York is the place to make money. Paris is the best place to spend it. But for us, the surprise star is Zurich, which beats all its rivals in being the place the world&apos;s public would most like to live. London receives a global vote of confidence. It is a genuine all-rounder, appearing in the top five for each question, an achievement only matched by New York. If we restrict our focus to the young, it is London, along with New York, which is the most popular place to live for under-35s all over the world. And when we look at the views of the 11 European countries, London is the continent&apos;s most important city. Together with positive signs for the UK economy generally and in the wake of London 2012, this is both a sign for celebration by Boris Johnson and a prompt: what now needs to be done to ensure London continues to punch above its weight? Will all the people who want to move to London be welcomed or even housed? Three hundred miles away from London, Paris will not be too downbeat. The capital of the world&apos;s most visited country is the clear winner as the world&apos;s favourite place to visit, whether respondents are from Argentina, Australia or Canada. But Paris falls down on its reputation as somewhere to do business, and this will surely worry French policy-makers as they debate what needs to happen to get France&apos;s economy moving more quickly. Just 7% see France as one of the world&apos;s top business locations. It is beaten by Washington, a city not normally associated with the commercial world, as well as Mexico City, Kuala Lumpur, Beijing and Shanghai. Rome is in a similar position, with just 2% seeing it as a business centre, only a tenth the number who rate it a top place to visit on holiday. At the other end of the spectrum are Hong Kong, Beijing and Shanghai, which perform strongly as places for business, but are not seen as attractive places to live. There are also questions to be asked in those cities which, despite their status, size, history and other attributes, have a relatively low profile, at least when looked at on the world stage. Cities in this cohort include Madrid, Istanbul (fieldwork was conducted before this summer&apos;s protests) and Bangkok. President Putin may be disappointed to see Moscow ranked alongside Brussels, in 31st place \u2013 if he wants more tourists he has lots to do. Finally, there are the cities that are just not popular at all. Tel Aviv, Tehran and Karachi are anchored to the foot of the table, and barely trouble the scorer. Some will be surprised to see Budapest, Casablanca and Warsaw occupying the places just above them. What of the future? Well, this is the first survey Ipsos has conducted of this kind, and we look forward to tracking our cities&apos; progress, perhaps adding a few more (such as Dubai) to the field as well. One thing to watch will be the perspectives of different generations, and how they evolve. At the moment, there is a broad consensus between younger and older people on the best places for business and best to visit. But on the best place to live we have an entirely different pattern: for the world&apos;s 50- to 64-year-olds, it&apos;s Zurich, Sydney and Toronto which occupy the top three places. But among the under-35s, it&apos;s London, New York and Paris. Can London hold on to its top slot as this younger generation get older?

In their first match of the new Premier League season, his Arsenal team had been badly beaten on their home ground by a young and generally unrated Aston Villa side. Boos were heard around the ground, the phone-ins and chatrooms seethed with anger, and the next morning&apos;s back pages blazed with headlines reflecting the profound dissatisfaction felt by the club&apos;s most ardent supporters. The following Wednesday, the same squad and their manager travelled to Istanbul, where they played Fenerbahce in a qualifying match for the Champions League, the high table of European football, an immensely lucrative competition to which the top four English clubs are admitted each season, and in which Wenger&apos;s Arsenal have an unbroken record of participation over the last 16 seasons. They won easily. Back in the league the next weekend, they went to Fulham, and won again. Three days later, they completed the elimination of Fenerbahce, and last Sunday they held on to win a fiercely contested North London derby against Tottenham Hotspur in front of their own supporters. On Tuesday, only hours away from the closing of the summer transfer window, Wenger snatched the headlines away from his rivals by spending more than \u00a340m on the acquisition of\u00a0a\u00a0German international midfield player,\u00a0Mesut \u00d6zil, from Real Madrid. Supporters who had been pleading with him to strengthen the team were finally mollified. In the space of two and a half weeks, the 63-year-old Frenchman had regained the standing earned during his early years at the club. Such is the volatility of modern football, and such is the prominence now accorded to managers. The players, with their colossal salaries, are still idolised, but the praise and blame for their performance is now routinely directed towards the man who sits by the touchline, often springing from the\u00a0dugout to pace his technical area,\u00a0whistling and gesticulating his instructions in an attempt to influence the course of the match. Now that the players live in gated compounds, take their holidays in Dubai, cover the few exposed yards from the team coach to the players&apos; entrance with huge headphones clamped to their ears, and communicate with the outside world only as an obligation to broadcasters and sponsors, the manager has become the media&apos;s principal point of access. In\u00a0The Manager, Sir Alex Ferguson claims that this is because journalists, knowing that bad results can lead to a managerial sacking, are constantly on the lookout for a scalp. The real reason is that players, wary of the damage an\u00a0isolated quote can do, choose to talk\u00a0only in bland platitudes, so the manager is licensed to speak freely, not just to explain decisions of selection and tactics but to play a leading role in the soap-opera spats and feuds that keep Sky Sports News and the back pages humming. Among previous generations, a select few, including Matt Busby, Bill Shankly, Brian Clough and Don Revie, enjoyed a high public profile, their sayings quoted and their foibles examined, but the creation of the Premier League ensured that every manager is now a star of\u00a0the show. In the technical area, their presence draws the TV cameras, alert to every nuance of appearance and behaviour: the pacing, the bawling, the monstering of the blameless fourth official, the goal celebration, the reaction to the chanting fans, the post-match handshake. A video game called Football Manager has been in existence for 20\u00a0years, updated each season, with such\u00a0popular success that it is said to have been cited as a contributor to marital breakdown in 35 divorce cases.\u00a0Some of its devotees will be among the readers of The Manager, a\u00a0kind of real-life instruction manual compiled from interviews with some of the profession&apos;s leading figures by\u00a0Mike Carson, a management consultant. Produced at the behest of\u00a0the League Managers Association, Barclays Bank (which sponsors the Premier League) and Deloitte, which keeps a sharp eye on football&apos;s financial affairs, it is neither disinterested nor objective. But\u00a0it does contain an amount of interesting material, despite a few irritating errors and, more serious but less surprising, a disinclination to examine failure as closely as success. There is, very clearly, no single formula for success in the job. The two\u00a0most successful managers in English football history, Ferguson and Liverpool&apos;s Bob Paisley, could hardly have been more different in style and temperament. In the recent past, as Carson points out, Sam Allardyce succeeded at Bolton Wanderers by discovering the value of a scientific approach to recruitment and preparation, while Newcastle United turned the corner after Kevin Keegan, newly installed in his first managerial post, lifted his squad&apos;s spirits and saw an immediate improvement in their results after ordering an overnight redecoration of the dingy, dirty buildings at their training ground. Rustic methods coexist with the sophistication expected of coaches imported from France, Spain, Italy and\u00a0Portugal. Howard Wilkinson, the last Englishman to win the league championship, tells of curing a certain player&apos;s reluctance to pass to his teammates by\u00a0giving him a ball with\u00a0his name painted on\u00a0it\u00a0and telling him to go off and\u00a0train with it by himself. Whereas\u00a0some\u00a0managers prefer to\u00a0keep a distance from their players, Jos\u00e9 Mourinho goes out of his way to make friends with them. Among the foreigners, national stereotypes are sometimes confounded.It is Martin Jol, a Dutchman from a football culture based\u00a0on free expression, who stresses the importance of unquestioning obedience to his tactical commands. Carlo Ancelotti, the most phlegmatic of Italians, speaks of losing his temper occasionally while at Chelsea but being careful to do so\u00a0in Italian so that he would not\u00a0be understood. According to Carson, the average tenure of a manager in English professional football is 16 months. Two of the leading figures in his book, Roberto Mancini and Hope Powell, were sacked this summer, removed from their posts with Manchester City and the England women&apos;s team. &quot;There is something inspirational about Mancini,&quot; he writes. &quot;He is a commander in turnaround, a leader with conviction.&quot; But having guided City to their first championship in 44 years and earned the fans&apos; undying affection, Mancini departed because many of his players detested him. Powell, too, had transformed her team&apos;s fortunes before relationships with some of the players deteriorated, and disastrous results followed. Harry Redknapp epitomises the traditional English manager, a linear descendant of Private Eye&apos;s much-missed Ron Knee. Had he been appointed England&apos;s manager in the spring of 2012, as nearly everyone inside and outside football expected, then Harry&apos;s Games would have been essential reading; as things stand, the\u00a0urgency of John Crace&apos;s survey of\u00a0Redknapp&apos;s eventful career is somewhat undermined by his present role as manager of Queens Park Rangers, whom he failed to save from relegation at the end of last season. Crace&apos;s previous football book, Vertigo, dealt with his experiences as a Tottenham Hotspur fan, and his new work is unashamedly coloured by his view of Redknapp&apos;s four seasons in charge at White Hart Lane, when Spurs made it to the Champions League before the manager was removed to make way\u00a0for a younger man more attuned to the scientific approach. There are no revelations, but the lengthy description of last year&apos;s case at Southwark crown court, in which Redknapp was found not guilty of tax irregularities, is full of\u00a0entertaining observation. Football is changing as the world around it changes, and perhaps Wenger should be allowed the final word, reflecting in The Manager on the impact of social media: &quot;We have gone from a vertical society to a horizontal society where everybody has an opinion about every decision you make, everybody has an opinion on the internet straight away \u2026 one of the most important qualities of a good leader now is massive resistance\u00a0to stress.&quot; \u2022 To order Harry&apos;s Games for \u00a315.19 with free UK p&amp;p call Guardian book service on 0330 333 6846 or go to guardianbookshop.co.uk", "title": "The Manager by Mike Carson and Harry's Games by John Crace \u2013 review", "sentences": ["Now that the players live in gated compounds, take their holidays in Dubai, cover the few exposed yards from the team coach to the players&apos; entrance with huge headphones clamped to their ears, and communicate with the outside world only as an obligation to broadcasters and sponsors, the manager has become the media&apos;s principal point of access."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-05T07:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/sep/05/classic-youtube-best-sports-clips", "tags": ["US sports", "Motor sport", "Extreme sports", "Rugby union", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "     1) Goodbye Gareth Bale, world-record transfer holder, goalkeeper, joker and keep-up failure.

You take me underneath your spell and leave me deceased.&quot; If you made it to the end of that, you might want to brave Part 2. In other transfer news, Manchester United bought some bite in midfield. Here&apos;s Paul Merson and the Soccer Saturday team watching Marouane Fellaini headbutt Ryan Shawcross. Fellaini was late to join up with his Belgium team-mates this week due to his big move and sadly missed out on meeting the team&apos;s doppelg\u00e4ngers. 3) Goodbye Cliff Morgan, commentator on the greatest try of all time. He could play a bit too. 4) We featured Brodie Smith&apos;s trickshots recently, but the trickshot world has since stepped up a level and moved to Dubai. Frisbee trickshots are impressive, but even more so when done in a basketball court \u2013 or an indoor skatepark. Basketball trickshots work best at an airport and these are quite simply the best trickshots ever captured on camera. 5) Loic Duval gave his own wheel a lift around the Interlagos circuit when it came free in the pit lane during last Sunday&apos;s World Endurance Championship race in S\u00e3o Paulo. Duval showed some skill while driving on three wheels, unlike a few of these Reliant Robin racers. It could be worse: Marcos Ambrose faced the indignity of being overtaken by his own wheel while racing in Canberra in 2001. And this poor cameraman took a wheel to the head at a recent German Grand Prix. 6) And finally, here are some goals from around the world: Spain, Sweden, Holland, Macedonia, Brazil and the US. Our favourites from last week&apos;s blog            1) The title says it all: &quot;Super Mario Brothers parkour (in real life)&quot;. 2) Another contender for the greatest ice hockey penalty ever. 3) Legia Warsaw fans show Uefa some love. 4) David James the dockworker. 5) Ice hockey players exhibit an unusual lack of fight when challenged by John Wensink (after the mother of all rows). 6) Why referees are referees. Perhaps Jonas Valanciunas should be a kung-fu fighter.

Before Tuesday&apos;s match against Ireland Ian Bell had partnered Alastair Cook with considerable success in each of the 27 ODIs since Pietersen stunned England by announcing his retirement from the format in May 2012. With both Bell and Cook taking a break between Ashes series, Pietersen is expected to revert to the role he last filled against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates a few months before that brief retirement \u2013 when he scored successive centuries in the last two matches of the series in Dubai. He returned to the ODI team batting at No3 behind Bell and Cook earlier this year in India, when Jonathan Trott was resting. Trott is expected to bat at three in this series behind Pietersen and Michael Carberry, although both he and Joe Root would offer further options at the top of the order. It is all very confusing, partly as a result of England&apos;s rotation policy, and Eoin Morgan \u2013 who will captain the team in the absence of Cook and Stuart Broad \u2013 was not prepared to provide any clarification before the first game, which may anyway be washed out if the grim forecast is correct. &quot;It&apos;s certainly an option,&quot; he said when asked whether Pietersen would open. &quot;Kev&apos;s opened the batting for England before and done well. He also bats in the middle order and is a very explosive player. He&apos;s very versatile in that regard so we&apos;ll be looking at both options.&quot; Morgan agreed that the opening positions may prove the trickiest to fill in this mix-and-match England squad. &quot;Yeah, true, and they&apos;re filling big shoes,&quot; he said of England&apos;s makeshift opening pair, whoever they might turn out to be. &quot;Cooky and Belly have been very successful now for a couple of years and they&apos;ve been a huge part of our success as a one-day team \u2013 and with the two new balls in one-day cricket it makes that role more difficult now. So it&apos;s an important role and one that we recognise needs filling.&quot; James Tredwell is an obvious, tried and tested deputy for Graeme Swann, and Steven Finn and Boyd Rankin are again expected to share the new ball in the absence of Broad and James Anderson. Ashley Giles, the one-day coach, has suggested that Ben Stokes did enough in the victory over Ireland to retain his position as an all-rounder, providing real depth to the batting order at No7 or 8, with Root and Ravi Bopara likely to share the fifth bowler&apos;s role. Jos Buttler caused some worried whispers when he was seen hobbling around Headingley&apos;s Carnegie pavilion after practice with ice on his right ankle but the problem was described as nothing more serious than blisters, and Morgan ruled out the possibility of wicketkeeping cover being required. Australia&apos;s squad for the series also has an experimental look following the loss through injuries of Steve Smith, Mitchell Starc and Ryan Harris, and the surprise omission of David Warner. Their selectors have judged that unlike Cook, Michael Clarke does not need a lengthy break, despite his history of back problems \u2013 and he seemed fresh and enthusiastic after recharging his batteries in the 10 days since the end of the Ashes. &quot;It was a no-brainer for me if I wanted to stay here and play these one-dayers,&quot; Clarke said. &quot;I didn&apos;t take any part in the Champions Trophy unfortunately. That was a shame because I really enjoy playing one-day cricket. I want to perform with the team and lead from the front. I want to see this one-day team get back to where it belongs at the top of the tree and we are going to do everything we can to play our full strength team and hopefully have some success.&quot; Australia are second in the ODI rankings, well behind India but only just ahead of England, who would leapfrog them if they won the series. In the absence of Warner, Aaron Finch and Shaun Marsh are expected to form a new and potentially explosive opening partnership, having savaged Scotland for 246 inside 39 overs in their warm-up game in Edinburgh on Tuesday. That could mean further disappointment for Phil Hughes, who is one of the few players to have stayed for the duration of the tour but lost his Ashes place after two Tests. Mitchell Johnson has already expressed his determination to stake a claim for an Ashes recall through his one-day performances \u2013 Morgan is one of several players hoping to do something similar with England \u2013 but the most intriguing figure in Australia&apos;s team remains Fawad Ahmed, the Pakistan-born leg-spinner who is set for his first high-profile ODI appearance at Headingley, after making his debut on Tuesday in Edinburgh.", "title": "Kevin Pietersen may widen England's World Cup options with role as opener", "sentences": ["With both Bell and Cook taking a break between Ashes series, Pietersen is expected to revert to the role he last filled against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates a few months before that brief retirement \u2013 when he scored successive centuries in the last two matches of the series in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-05T15:16:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/marketforceslive/2013/sep/09/bba-aviation-dubai-aerospace-talks-end", "tags": ["Business", "BBA Aviation"], "article": "BBA Aviation is holding steady despite the collapse of a deal with Dubai Aerospace Enterprise over the weekend.

The woman, Catherine Bury, from Northallerton, North Yorkshire, was killed in the early hours of Monday morning while celebrating her 56th birthday with her mother, Cecille Bury, 87, and her son, Alexander Bury, 24. According to the local authorities, Catherine Bury had an argument with the gardener on Friday during which he threatened her and her family. The reason for the reported dispute is unclear. Catherine Bury and her son reported the gardener&apos;s &quot;death threats&quot; to the local jandarma, Turkey&apos;s rural police. One officer, who wished to remain anonymous, said the suspect was subsequently detained at around noon on Saturday. While suspects can be held for 24 hours under Turkish law, he was released in the early hours of Sunday morning because the police had been unable to find proof that he had committed any crime. Local media reported that the gardener armed himself with a pump-action shotgun after his release and later returned to the villa, where he shot Cecille Bury in the back and seriously wounded Alexander Bury with a shot to the leg. He was then said to have pursued Catherine Bury up three flights of stairs to the top floor of the villa where she locked herself inside the bathroom. After shooting at the lock of the door, he allegedly entered the room and fired four shots at her, killing her. Immediately after the attack, the gardener, who had been working at the resort for six years and is a Dalyan resident, turned himself in to the local police and was arrested. He is reportedly 46 years old and has only been identified by his initials, VA. He was transferred to a prison in Fethiye on Monday and is awaiting trial. Neighbours of Catherine Bury, in the picturesque village of Swainby, near the North Yorkshire Moors, expressed their shock at the news. Stephen Garbutt, who lives in the adjoining bungalow to where Catherine Bury and her son lived, described her as &quot;a real lady&quot;. He said: &quot;I never ever heard a bad word, or a cross word, or anything like that from any of them. How on earth they got into this situation I cannot imagine. I have never known Anne, for want of a better word, in trouble.&quot; He said that his neighbour, who trained as a midwife, had been working for an oil company in Dubai in a health role. Her son, known as Alex, worked at a local hotel, the Cleveland Tontine, after taking a year out of university and was hoping to restart his studies in medicine. Garbutt&apos;s wife, Jennifer, said: &quot;She [Catherine Bury] never offended anybody ... They were a lovely family and this has broken my heart. It has knocked\u00a0me for\u00a0six.&quot; Cecille Bury was released from the Fethiye state hospital on Tuesday. According to a source at the Mugla Sitki Kocman university hospital, Alexander Bury was transferred out of the intensive care unit. The Turkish ministry of culture and tourism said he was in a stable condition at the hospital. It is not clear when he will be released. The reason for the attack is still unclear. Dalyan is a small resort on the river Cayi, famous for its sulphur mud baths, and is a popular day trip for British tourists staying in nearby Fethiye and Marmaris. The ministry of culture and tourism said a full investigation is under way and that the chief suspect was in custody. Turkish TV footage showed detectives searching the property, where balloons and other signs of a celebration were still visible. One woman working in the Dalyan municipality said that local people were devastated by the crime. A Foreign Office spokesman said: &quot;We are aware of the death of a British national in Turkey on 9 September. &quot;We are providing consular assistance to the family at this difficult time.&quot; It also confirmed the hospitalisation of a further two British nationals.", "title": "British woman shot dead in Turkish holiday villa", "sentences": ["I have never known Anne, for want of a better word, in trouble.&quot; He said that his neighbour, who trained as a midwife, had been working for an oil company in Dubai in a health role."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-10T10:49:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/sep/11/american-accused-spying-iranian-amir-hekmat", "tags": ["Iran", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "US news"], "article": "Amir Hekmati, a US citizen accused of espionage and jailed in Iran, has said his televised confession was forced and asserted that he is in fact being held hostage for use in a prisoner exchange and mistreated. In a letter smuggled out of jail and obtained by the Guardian, the 29-year-old former US marine, who was arrested in Tehran two years ago for his alleged links to the CIA, said his confession aired on Iranian state television was made under duress and was used to implicate him in trial. &quot;For over two years I have been held on false charges based solely on confessions obtained by force, threats, miserable prison conditions and prolonged periods of solitary confinement,&quot; he wrote earlier this month. The letter, which has been authenticated by Hekmati&apos;s family, is addressed to US secretary of state, John Kerry. Kerry urged Tehran leaders to release him from prison on the second anniversary of his arrest last month, saying Washington was &quot;deeply concerned&quot; about his detention. Hekmati was picked up by Iranian security officials in August 2011, two weeks after arriving in Tehran from Dubai on a family visit. He holds both Iranian and American citizenship and served as a US marine between 2001 and 2005, at some point translating Persian and Arabic in Iraq. In his letter, Hekmati accuses the Iranian authorities of employing &quot;unlawful tactics&quot; to keep him in prison with a view to swapping him for Iranian prisoners held in US custody. &quot;This is part of a propaganda and hostage-taking effort by Iranian intelligence to secure the release of Iranians abroad being held on security-related charges,&quot; the letter says. Hekmati&apos;s state-appointed Iranian lawyer was told by the authorities that he will be released only if two Iranians held in foreign jails are freed, he writes. &quot;I had nothing to do with their arrest, committed no crime, and see no reason why the US government should entertain such a ridiculous proposition,&quot; he writes, but does not reveal the names of the Iranian prisoners concerned. Hekmati goes on to implore Kerry not to buckle under the pressure of Iran&apos;s demands. &quot;I do not wish to set a precedent for others that may be unlawfully (obtained) for political gain in the future,&quot; he writes. Hekmati&apos;s letter compares his case to that of three Americans detained in Iran in 2009, accused by Tehran of spying but who insist they were simply hiking innocently along an unmarked Iranian border. Prior to his arrival in Tehran, Hekmati reportedly checked in with the Iranian interest section in Washington to ensure that his past work with the US military would not create problems for him during his stay. In December 2011, Hekmati confessed on Iran&apos;s state-run TV: &quot;They told me: &apos;You will become a source of military and intelligence information for the Iranians for three weeks and we will give you money for this and then you will return.&apos;&quot; In January 2012, an Iranian court sentenced him to death \u2013 a verdict later quashed by a higher court. Hekmati is still waiting for retrial. The new Iranian president Hassan Rouhani&apos;s moderate mandate has raised hopes for the former marine&apos;s release. &quot;My hope is that those individuals within the Iranian government who respect rule of law and international ethics will intervene in my case,&quot; Hekmati writes. Hekmati&apos;s family, who were made aware of the letter&apos;s existence ahead of publication, also released a statement. &quot;The Hekmati family is deeply concerned about our son and brother Amir,&quot; it said. &quot;More than two years in detention, much of which was spent in solitary confinement, is far too long. He is not a US spy. He has never been a spy for any country or entity or person. Even if one accepts the assertions by the Iranian officials as true, which we do not, Amir has served enough time and they have punished him enough.&quot; The Hekmati family has repeatedly pleaded with the Iranian authorities to release him, arguing that he needs to be with his father, who has cancer. &quot;We hope President Rouhani and his new government recognise this point. We urge his immediate release.&quot; Iran does not recognise dual citizenship and considers Hekmati Iranian. Tehran and Washington have not maintained diplomatic relations since the hostage crisis after the 1979 Islamic revolution. Full transcript 2013-09-01 To: Mr. John Kerry, Secretary of State, US State Department From: Amir Hekmati SSN: --- -- ---- Dear Mr. Kerry I first of all would like to thank you and your department for your sincere efforts in supporting me and securing my release. My family and I are extremely grateful and appreciate the value the State Department places on U.S. citizens. For over 2 years I have been held on false charges based solely on confessions obtained by force, threats, miserable prison conditions, and prolonged periods of solitary confinement. This is part of a propaganda and hostage taking effort by Iranian intelligence to secure the release of Iranians abroad being held on security-related charges. Iranian intelligence has suggested through my court-appointed lawyer Mr. Hussein Yazdi Samadi that I be released in exchange for 2 Iranians being held abroad. I had nothing to do with their arrest, committed no crime, and see no reason why the U.S. Government should entertain such a ridiculous proposition. I do not wish to set a precedent for others that may be unlawfully (obtained) for political gain in the future. While my family and I have suffered greatly I will accept nothing but my unconditional release. The very same suffering that the 3 American hikers have recently suffered and many others by these unlawful tactics. My hope is that those individuals within the Iranian government who respect rule of law and international ethics will intervene in my case. As someone of Iranian heritage, I hope that the Iranian people will also support me and call on their government to respect my legal rights. Respectfully,Amir Hekmati     Amir Hekmati's letter, Hekmati accuses the Iranian authorities of employing 'unlawful tactics'  to keep him in prison with a view to swapping him for Iranian prisoners held in US custody.

In calm greys, blues and browns with shots of orange and lime, her cosy blankets add colour and warmth to today&apos;s restrained, Scandinavian-style homes. Little wonder they have been snapped up by Skandium, Heal&apos;s and TwentyTwentyOne. &quot;People who buy mid-century furniture tend to like my stuff, but I&apos;m conscious not to design in a &apos;retro&apos; way,&quot; says Pritchard, 42. &quot;Over the years, I&apos;ve become more pared back; in my experience, it&apos;s best not to overwork things.&quot; She designs the blankets in her south London studio, at Cockpit Arts in Deptford, and they are then woven at a small, traditional mill in Camarthenshire, south-west Wales \u2013 family-run and Welsh-speaking. &quot;I&apos;m surprised at how these specialists survive, but I think it&apos;s because they specialise that they do.&quot; In a world where designers themselves often diversify, producing spin-off flasks, mouse mats and duvets, Pritchard&apos;s focus on textiles is refreshing. But this year she has expanded beyond blankets for the first time, designing a small range of cushions and upholstery fabrics, the latter woven by Bute in Scotland. &quot;I hadn&apos;t realised how complicated it would be,&quot; she says. &quot;With cushions, there are more choices to make: different fabrics for front and back, fastenings, scale.\u00a0And you have to factor in wear\u00a0and tear with upholstery, which you don&apos;t with blankets. I hope it doesn&apos;t become too distracting.&quot; These cushions feature new fabrics with robustly British names such as Northerly, Easterly and Signal. Pritchard&apos;s woollens are popular in colder climes, but have recently found an audience in Dubai. Why? She thinks for a moment: &quot;I\u00a0think it&apos;s the air-conditioning.&quot; \u2022 Eleanor Pritchard&apos;s new work is at Design Junction, New Oxford St, London WC1, from 18 to 22 September.

But meet the Birmingham-born 37-year-old and you glimpse some of the steeliness that has turned him into an award-winning design force in just five years. &quot;You have to start at the high end or customers won&apos;t believe you,&quot; he says. &quot;You can&apos;t start in the middle and work your way up.&quot; He is best known for one product: the Crystal Bulb light, a solitary cut-glass pendant in the shape of a lightbulb hung from a brass fitting, an appealing combination of Britishness, nostalgia and bling. It was preceded by his much-imitated Decanterlight: crystal decanters strung with a bulb. (The early models were charity-shop finds, but now Broom makes his own.) Back in June, this was one of four British products included in the Leaders&apos; Bar at the G8 summit: one imagines Angela Merkel talking tax evasion and Syria with Barack Obama, their faces lit by its flattering diffuse light. A background in fashion followed by four years designing restaurants, bars and shops have given Broom an eye for a show-stopper: his Salon collection of punky studded furniture, say, or a bistro chair fitted with strip lights. This month he is launching Carousel, a fairground-inspired pendant; Quilt, a collection of upholstered furniture; and a glass candlestick called Fulcrum, as heavy as a dumbbell. He is also opening his first store, next door to his offices in Shoreditch.

Photograph: Anna Huix for the Guardian    The elegant, handcrafted furniture that has won Russell Pinch countless awards and made his still-youngish name (he turned 40 this year) is part Shaker, part mid-century, and a little bit Georgian. But he won&apos;t be drawn on these historical references. &quot;It&apos;s hard to describe our work,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s quiet: simple forms, rich woods, good craftsmanship and strong silhouettes. We try not to overdesign our furniture. We don&apos;t want it to take over a room.&quot; This decision to be stylish rather than fashionable, \u00e0 la Coco Chanel, means his pieces \u2013 from distinguished armoires to sofas, side tables and desks \u2013 sit well in country farmhouses and industrial loft apartments alike. Pinch loves indulgent details: his latest design, a dressing table, features a &quot;drawer completely hidden within the cabinetry, like a mini-safe&quot;. With his wife Oona, Pinch founded his eponymous company in 2004, after a long spell as Terence Conran&apos;s design assistant. The two men share a love of France: Pinch&apos;s young family spend 10 weeks a year on the west coast, soaking up design inspiration from markets, movies, street signs. &quot;Wherever we travel, we come back buzzing with ideas.&quot; In recent years, he has started designing kitchenware for the likes of Jamie Oliver and US high street giant Crate &amp; Barrel. But his own furniture is his greatest love. He now leaves naming pieces to Oona.

At present, steroids are only illegal in Australia if they are present in a horse&apos;s system on the day of a race, and can be administered without penalty to horses both in and out of training so long as they are &quot;clean&quot; when they compete. From 1 November, however, it will be illegal to give steroids to any horse older than six months, while the ban will take effect from 1 May 2014, to allow any horses which have been treated a six-month period for the drugs, and their effects, to clear. Anabolic steroids boost a horse&apos;s metabolism, promoting muscle growth and general wellbeing, tending to increase both their strength and resilience. In addition to performance-enhancing effects during a race, this can also mean that a trainer will be able to exercise a horse more regularly and strenuously beforehand. These beneficial effects will also persist for weeks or even months after the steroid itself has left a horse&apos;s system. Muscle laid down as a result of the anabolic effect of the drug, for instance, will tend to remain for as long as the horse is in regular work. Differing attitudes to the use of steroids in racing jurisdictions around the world were highlighted earlier this year as a result of the Godolphin doping scandal at Moulton Paddocks in Newmarket, where Mahmood al-Zarooni was found to have used the anabolic steroids stanozolol and nitrotain to dope at least 22 of his horses. Australia has now followed Dubai, which is ruled by Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum, the founder of Godolphin, by introducing strict new rules on the use of steroids following the Zarooni scandal. &quot;The ban on anabolic steroids goes far beyond any other racing jurisdiction outside of Europe and was decided by the ARB Board after lengthy consideration of veterinary and scientific advice and consultation with trainers&apos; and owners&apos; associations,&quot; Peter McGauran, the chief executive of ARB, said on Monday. &quot;The ARB has adopted a zero-tolerance policy to the use of anabolic steroids in competition, training and spelling [pre-training] and will institute heavy penalties for breaches of the ban.&quot; The ban is likely to prove controversial, initially at least, among some Australian trainers. When senior ARB executives suggested in April that stricter regulation of steroids was under consideration, Colin Alderson, the president of the Australian Trainers&apos; Association, said that it would be &quot;a complete over-reaction \u2026 because of one isolated incident in the UK.&quot; Alderson added: &quot;Racehorses need every bit of help. You give a horse a dose of steroids to help it thrive out in the paddock, you can bring it back earlier and start earning some money earlier for the owner.&quot;", "title": "Australian Racing Board announces complete ban on anabolic steroids", "sentences": ["Australia has now followed Dubai, which is ruled by Sheikh Mohammed al Maktoum, the founder of Godolphin, by introducing strict new rules on the use of steroids following the Zarooni scandal."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-16T11:42:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/sep/16/amir-khan-floyd-mayweather", "tags": ["Amir Khan", "Floyd Mayweather", "US sports", "Sport", "Boxing"], "article": "It did not take long for the derision to smack Amir Khan square in the face from the depths of the social media swamp when he placed himself alongside Floyd Mayweather Jr as a &quot;boxing legend&quot;, and began talking up a showdown with the finest pure boxer since Sugar Ray Leonard. But Khan, who has no title and knows another defeat could finish his career, remains strong in his conviction he can come back. He is used to abuse. And he knows there is an excellent chance of the Mayweather fight happening next May \u2013 either in Las Vegas or the UK \u2013 but only if he wins his debut at welterweight, a soon-to-be-inked challenge for Devon Alexander&apos;s IBF title on 7 December. &quot;There are very few places I can go if I lose,&quot; he said in a candid interview in Las Vegas, scene of Mayweather&apos;s demolition of the bewildered Sa\u00fal &quot;Canelo&quot; Alvarez on Saturday night. Khan explained why he deserves to be still mixing in good company, despite a couple of desultory performances since losing his light-welterweight titles to Danny Garc\u00eda just over a year ago. He says he is still searching for the right combination of caution and aggression since leaving Freddie Roach to join Andre Ward&apos;s mentor, Virgil Hunter, which was self-evident in tentative decision wins over Carlos Molina and Julio D\u00edaz, both of them physically smaller fighters. Garc\u00eda demonstrated those very skills on the Mayweather undercard when he survived the physical examination of the knockout specialist Lucas Matthysse to retain Khan&apos;s old light-welter titles over 12 tough rounds. And Molina became a champion on the same bill when he outboxed Mayweather&apos;s prot\u00e9g\u00e9 Ishe Smith to win the IBF light-middleweight title. There is plenty of noise in boxing circles that it is Garc\u00eda who deserves to move up seven pounds and challenge Mayweather at welterweight \u2013 but it is Khan whose willingness to risk all has made him a box-office attraction with Golden Boy Promotions, and they have clout with Showtime, Mayweather&apos;s new paymasters. &quot;I&apos;ve been invited here by Golden Boy because Mayweather&apos;s always talking about fighting me,&quot; Khan says, although there was no such confirmation later from Mayweather, who is still playing cat-and-mouse with the media over his plans. &quot;He wants to fight in England because he knows how many fans he has in Britain. He&apos;s always talking about it, so I believe that. If this Alexander fight happens \u2013 not looking too far ahead, because I&apos;ve made that mistake before \u2013 but this fight will put me to great heights.&quot; As for Alexander, he says: &quot;I think by the end of this week it&apos;ll be done but I don&apos;t know where it will be yet. I don&apos;t think it will be Dubai because it&apos;s taken so long. I&apos;d love to fight there one day but not this time. It&apos;s looking like New York, rather than Vegas. I&apos;d fight anywhere.&quot; Khan is aware he is running out of chances, however. Golden Boy will stay with him only so long. &quot;My whole career I&apos;ve been taking risks. I know it&apos;s a big risk I&apos;m taking because it means everything to my career. But there&apos;s a big prize as well, a big fight at the end of it.&quot; Central to Khan&apos;s problems has been his weight and his search for the right method of reaching optimum strength. He has experimented with a 7,000-calorie regime under Alex Ariza at the Wild Card gym, then the arduous water diet, which requires the consumption of up to 14 litres of water a day and which robbed him of nutrients, and now he has returned to more traditional methods of just eating well and training hard over a long period. &quot;I&apos;ve had big weight issues since the [Zab] Judah fight, really,&quot; he says, reflecting on the last successful defence of his WBA and IBF titles, in July 2011, before he was derailed by Lamont Peterson. &quot;Maybe I just got greedy and stayed at the weight to get into a better position. What messed me up big time was waiting for that fight against [Timothy] Bradley, to become the undisputed champion, but it never happened. Also, I was only fighting twice a year, because Ramadan falls in the middle. When you&apos;re only fighting twice a year, you&apos;re giving your body such a long break in between and it&apos;s even harder to make weight.&quot; Another factor was Khan&apos;s impatience and his eagerness for a tear-up. His relationship with Roach soured when he forgot instructions to duck under Garc\u00eda&apos;s well-advertised left hook, and he admits now it was partly his own fault. &quot;When I fought Garc\u00eda, we were working more on going under that left hook. But when you make 140, your body kind of seizes up. I had to force myself to do those moves. Doing it at 150 [in training] was so easy but, dehydrating myself to 140, my body was cramping up. If I&apos;d have stuck to my boxing of the first two rounds, that would have been perfect. I let him into that fight.&quot; On his relationship with Roach and his new partnership with Hunter, he says, &quot;It helps a lot, having someone fresh telling you something new. You respect him more. When you&apos;re used to someone and he says something, you&apos;re going to be, &apos;Ah well, yeah...&apos; But when you hear something from someone new, you&apos;re going to listen to him and you&apos;re going to stick to it.&quot; Indeed, Hunter has cautioned Khan about his lifestyle, claiming he needs to stay focused, although he does not question his commitment once he gets to the gym. The time for procrastination and doubt is gone. Khan has one chance left, no more.", "title": "Amir Khan eyes Floyd Mayweather fight but he is in last-chance saloon | Kevin Mitchell", "sentences": ["I don&apos;t think it will be Dubai because it&apos;s taken so long."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-16T22:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/18/terry-smith-criticises-socially-responsible-investments", "tags": ["Ethical business", "Banco Santander", "Banking", "Business", "Ethical money", "Money", "UK news"], "article": "One of the City&apos;s best known figures on Wednesday urged those handling pension funds not to put money into socially responsible investments. Terry Smith, a former top broker and now chief executive of his own Fundsmith asset management business, said ethical funds performed badly and were riddled with internal contradictions. Five out of the 17 worst-performing funds in the area he most closely followed were ethical or environmental funds. He advised the annual convention of the Institute of Directors (IoD): &quot;I would not do that \u2013 not if you want to make a success of [your pension investments].&quot; Smith said socially responsible funds required making moral judgments that were ultimately subjective. While a Muslim would not support investment in drinks companies, they would be more relaxed about tobacco firms. Others might take a quite different view, said Smith. A politically conservative agenda was also set out by Graeme Leach, the chief economist and director of policy at the IoD. He said Britain had the opportunity to become a highly successful country like Dubai \u2013 or economically ravaged like Detroit. Countries, like cities, he said, had the chance to recreate themselves or die depending on whether they pursued excessive state spending or competitiveness to grow the private sector. Leach said &quot;excessive statism&quot; was already in evidence and &quot;if we don&apos;t watch out that will swamp the UK&quot;. Ana Botin, chief executive of the British arm of Spain&apos;s Santander bank, also warned about overregulation and the dangers of those with an anti-business attitude. &quot;Low taxes, balanced regulation \u2013 these are not heretical thoughts but the essence of a competitive economy.&quot; She added: &quot;Profit, wealth creation, competition \u2013 these are not dirty words but the lifeblood of a dynamic economy.&quot; The Spaniard also questioned the deep scepticism inside the British psyche, saying there was a tendency for Britons to see &quot;the glass half empty&quot;. Legendary American business leader Jack Welch urged his British counterparts to discover their &quot;generosity gene&quot;. Speaking via satellite link from New York, the former head of General Electric said one of the characteristics of all great chief executives was care for others. Of those who stole ideas, were stingy with wage increases and jealous of subordinates, he said: &quot;That person never went too far.&quot; It was vital, he said, for bosses to create strong teams and that could only come if trust was established with the staff. &quot;The team is what makes the thing work \u2026 you are all in this together \u2026 you have got to tell people where they stand all the time.&quot; He also launched an impassioned attack on existing education structures, which he argued were &quot;hidebound&quot; by old faculty thinking that left them overly expensive and disadvantaged the less well-off. Welch, described by Fortune magazine as the greatest manager of the 20th century, said China was a &quot;true force&quot; in global business and would get stronger once it had established successful brands. By contrast he was pessimistic about the prospects for India, which he claimed was &quot;stalled&quot; by rampant corruption and heavy bureaucracy.

On Friday morning, the makeshift camps will be packed away as Apple opens the doors of its Regent Street and Covent Garden stores for the arrival of not one, but two new handsets. As the gadgets go on sale in nine countries, Apple is venturing into new territory by offering its followers a choice: the slightly lower-priced 5C, in its colourful plastic casing, or the top-of-the-range 5S, with a fingerprint scanner and a souped-up camera. But for most of those who spent a night shivering on the pavements of central London, there is only one phone that matters \u2013 the 5S. &quot;I prefer to buy the better one, not because it is more expensive, but because of the speed, the display, the finger scanner,&quot; said Noah Green, a 17-year-old London student waiting outside Apple&apos;s flagship Regent Street store. Under the porticos of Covent Garden, where the shelter helped draw a larger and less damp crowd, a group of Norwegians sat huddled around their phones and tablets. &quot;It doesn&apos;t come out in Norway until December,&quot; explained 33-year-old Stig Martin Fiska. His group of friends and colleagues flew to London on Thursday, and will head back straight after making their purchases. They admitted that Apple had lost some of its lustre. &quot;It&apos;s lacking a bit of magic now,&quot; said Fiska. &quot;But they are still the best.&quot; With the arrival of the iPhone outshining the Harrods Boxing Day extravaganza as one of the most reported events of the retail calendar, the annual queue is also an opportunity for marketing and money-making. Max fisher, a 17-year-old student from Hendon, was being paid \u00a3100 by a developer to wear a T-shirt advertising their smartphone app \u2013 and was enjoying the camaraderie. &quot;It&apos;s a great experience in itself,&quot; he said. For Michael Roberts, an estate agent from Surrey and number three in line at Regent Street, the plan was to sell his place in the queue. &quot;I&apos;ve already had an offer \u2013 \u00a37,000,&quot; he told technology website Pocket-lint. &quot;He&apos;s some rich guy from Dubai. We exchanged numbers and he said he&apos;ll be back tomorrow morning.&quot; For Apple, the new devices will help Silicon Valley&apos;s richest company reach $90bn (\u00a356bn) in revenues from smartphone sales this year, pushing its overall takings to $170bn, according to Bernstein Research. Apple&apos;s products remain desirable, and it boasts nearly 50% market share of all the phones sold for more than $300, but the company&apos;s insistence on high prices is limiting its ability to reach new customers. Investors now wonder whether Apple will eventually become a niche player in the market it invented in 2007, as it loses share to Samsung and other manufacturers using Android software. Shareholders and shoppers had hoped that the iPhone 5C would be cheap enough to become Apple&apos;s first mass-market handset. But it costs almost as much as its top-of-the-range sister model. In the UK, prices start at \u00a3469 without a contract, just \u00a380 less than the 5S. Mobile network owners, who sell more phones than Apple&apos;s stores thanks to the subsidies they offer in exchange for two-year service contracts, said this week that pre-orders were significantly down on previous years. Only one model, the cheaper 5C, has been available to buy in advance. One network said pre-orders had been just 10% of those achieved by last year&apos;s iPhone 5. Networks said there was high demand for the 5S, which could sell out due to initial supplies being constrained. Ronan Dunne, chief executive of O2 in the UK, added his voice to the debate on whether or not Apple has produced yet more bestsellers on Thursday with a tweet saying: &quot;5C only part of equation \u2013 5S key&quot;. He suggested the flagship model could sell out, saying O2 had the &quot;same supply as everyone else, but will it be enough is the key question&quot;. Sales of the iPhone 5 surpassed 5m in their first week, Apple revealed last year, and with its successor models available in more markets including China from day one, demand will be higher than ever. &quot;We will get the same level of excitement and buzz that we have with the normal launch of an Apple phone and they will sell out quickly,&quot; predicted Gartner analyst Van Baker. He added that the fingerprint scanner might be to blame for supply constraints. &quot;We are hearing they are having a hard time getting the fingerprint sensors produced. The carriers in the US say their allocation on the 5S is very small.&quot; Apple did not respond to a request for comment.", "title": "iPhone 5S and 5C: the queues are there but is Apple running out of juice?", "sentences": ["&quot;He&apos;s some rich guy from Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-20T07:08:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2013/sep/20/urban-exploration-robert-macfarlane-bradley-garrett", "tags": ["Books", "Culture", "London", "Architecture"], "article": "Urban exploration: a\u00a0guide for the uninitiated. Urban exploration, urbex or UE is recreational trespass in the built environment. Among the requirements for participation are claustrophilia, lack of vertigo, a taste for decay, a fascination with infrastructure, a readiness to jump fences and lift manhole covers, and a familiarity with\u00a0the laws of access in whatever jurisdiction you&apos;re undertaking your explorations. Archive and web skills are useful too,\u00a0for acquiring the schematics and blueprints that will inspire and orient you. Among the sites in your sights are disused factories and hospitals, former military installations, bunkers, bridges and storm-drain networks. You should be content on the counterweight of a crane 400 feet above the street, or skanking along a sewer 10 yards under\u00a0the asphalt. The cultural origins of urbex would include, to my mind, Tarkovsky&apos;s Stalker, the fiction of JG Ballard, old-school mountaineering and caving, blasts of steampunk (there is a love of girders, rivets and brickwork), console culture (Bioshock), apocalypse dreams (from Planet of the Apes to The Road), the Mission Impossible films and (inevitably) Guy Debord and his situationist d\u00e9rive \u2013 the randomly motivated walk designed to disrupt habitual movement through the cityscape. It&apos;s quite some gumbo. If urban explorers didn&apos;t exist, China Mi\u00e9ville would have had to invent them. The scene has its subscenes. Just as\u00a0certain climbers prefer granite to gritstone, and certain cavers prefer wet\u00a0systems to dry ones, the explorers have their specialisms: the bunkerologists, the asylum seekers, the skywalkers, the builderers, the track-runners, the drainers. Most people start out in ruins, though: these tend to be the easiest sites to access, and the\u00a0aesthetic payoffs \u2013 the pathos of abandonment, the material residue of\u00a0inscrutable histories \u2013 are rapid. Ruinistas dig &quot;derp&quot; (UE slang for &quot;derelict and ruined places&quot;). Detroit was the world mecca for derp, until it became a city-sized version of Don DeLillo&apos;s &quot;most photographed barn in America&quot;, and it was impossible to see it except through a haze of ruin-porn imagery: HDR stills of dusty ballrooms and atria, with artfully scattered detritus (detroitus) in the foreground.     The hero shot \u2026 Robert Macfarlane at an underground reservoir. Photograph: Scott Cadman    Along from the ruinistas come the adventurers, who are mostly out for the kicks. Photography is important to\u00a0the adventurers too, they specialise in the &quot;hero shot&quot;: the lone explorer seen from behind on the rim of a building or bridge, or heavily backlit (partly to preserve anonymity) and framed in a storm-drain or archway. Such images unmistakably have their origin in Caspar David Friedrich&apos;s icon\u00a0of Romanticism, Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog (1818): the dark frock-coated traveller atop his peak, with the\u00a0mists of unknowing spread out beneath him. Every modern-day mountain summit shot owes a debt to\u00a0Friedrich&apos;s painting, and UE has absorbed and adapted the same image. Then there are the self-styled &quot;guerilla preservationists&quot;, deep into\u00a0heritage theory, and genuinely committed to creating a coherent photographic and textual record of\u00a0buildings that would otherwise crumble unnoticed until a developer arrived to raze all trace of them. Their\u00a0archives are carefully curated on\u00a0websites, their identities disguised with pseudonyms and firebreaks. Up at the avant-garde of urbex are the infiltrators, the &quot;real&quot; explorers, who tend to be more stimulated by systems and networks than by single sites, and who cherish the challenge involved in accessing super-secure locations. Like climbers, infiltrators experience what Al Alvarez called, in his classic essay on climbing, &quot;feeding the rat&quot;. The rat lives inside you, and itfeeds on fear. The more you feed the rat, the larger it grows, the greater its appetite \u2013 and therefore the more fear you must experience in order to sate it. Infiltrators run tracks in the brief gaps between trains, they take dinghies down storm-drains, they lift-surf, and occasionally they die \u2013 in ways that may strike you either as noble, or as liable for a Darwin Award, depending on your attitude to urbex. The culture of urbex is mostly but not overwhelmingly male. Its politics are hard to simplify: libertarian in the main, fringed here and there with a Fight-Clubby anarchism, and in certain people aimed at resisting the rise of surveillance and the privatisation of\u00a0urban space. Like all subcultures, it\u00a0thrives on acronyms and slang. Security guards are &quot;seccas&quot;. &quot;The Fresh&quot; is sewage. Manhole covers are &quot;lids&quot;, and you &quot;pop&quot; them. Sleeping overnight in a site is &quot;going pro-hobo&quot;. Certain terms have been imported from urban design: &quot;Sloap&quot; is Space Left\u00a0Over After Planning. &quot;Toads&quot; are Temporary, Obsolete, Abandoned or Derelict Spaces.     Lightning strike. Photograph: Bradley Garrett    Urban exploration is international, with groups around the world, but it\u00a0is\u00a0too various in its motives and methods to constitute anything like a\u00a0community. A code of honour is broadly adhered to: no criminal damage, no sueing anyone if anything bad happens to you. In the white sandstone under Minneapolis, digging teams work in shifts to open routes into sealed caves. In Toronto an explorer has bolted a pitch and abseiled into the vast tailrace pipe under the Niagara Falls. This year, Russian explorers are on fire, taking the practice to places \u2013 Dubai, Hong Kong \u2013 it&apos;s never been before. Urbex is not for everyone. Let me put that differently: urbex is hardly for anyone. Participation is high in profile but small in number (perhaps 20,000 globally), and the thrills are niche. Not for urbexers the sturm und drang of mountains or the arid elegance of desert exploration. Their epiphanies are mucky, their metaphysics mephitic. The short-term risks are grim: drowning in sewage, falling from girders, gralloched by razor-wire, skewered on scaffolding. Longer-term dangers include respiratory problems from exposure to dusts and gases. I\u00a0know, I know: why would you? Who would? It is a hugely strange scene, and\u00a0\u2013 occasional claustrophiliac with an intermittent taste for decay that I\u00a0am \u2013 I find myself rather gripped by it. \u2766 I met Bradley Garrett at London Bridge early one afternoon. He said he had a great story for me, and he did. &quot;The bridge is hollow,&quot; he said, tapping his foot on a utility hatch two\u2011thirds of the way along. &quot;There&apos;s a\u00a0control room at the north end; if you get into that, you can cross the Thames inside the bridge. Come \u2013 I&apos;ll show you.&quot; We took the stairs by the north end. Partway down, Garrett hopped over the stair-rail and began edging along a narrow skirt of masonry that stuck out from the bridge&apos;s side, 10 feet above a Sloap of concrete, ventilation hatches and aerials. He had his hands flat against the vertical brickwork, and perhaps half a foot&apos;s purchase on the skirt. &quot;Are you happy coming out along this with me?&quot; I wasn&apos;t. It had been raining, the masonry skirt was wet and angled, and I needed to be able to pick my children up from school without crutches. &quot;No matter,&quot; said Garrett, and hopped back over the rail. &quot;We&apos;ll see it\u00a0another way.&quot; We followed the steps until we were under the bridge. There was a steel door, secured with a hunky padlock. Garrett pulled a ring of keys out of his pocket, chose one, had the lock off in about a second, ushered me inside, and closed the door with a soft clang behind us. &quot;That&apos;s some bunch of keys you have there,&quot; I said. I flicked on a headtorch. We were in a control room. Zinc venting, ducts and technicoloured wiring lashed with cable ties. Two wall-mounted dashboards with switches and dials. &quot;So \u2013 if you follow this ducting south out of here, then you&apos;re inside London Bridge,&quot; Garrett said. &quot;Keep going all the way over the river, and you reach a much bigger control room at the south end. Hit the exit bar on the emergency door there from the inside, and you can let in who you want. When we made a film about UE a few years ago, called Crack the Surface, that&apos;s where we held\u00a0the premiere. We had 86 people, a\u00a0generator, a screen, a projector, and a\u00a0lot of beer. It was a great party!&quot; We slipped out and Garrett locked up. Two men in suits gave us puzzled looks but didn&apos;t break stride.     Victorian drain, south London. Photograph: Bradley Garrett    From London Bridge, Garrett took me on a haphazard walk through the City. He had climbed pretty much every major building we passed. He and other explorers have topped out the Shard four times, the Cheesegrater twice, the Lloyd&apos;s Building once (&quot;many CCTV cameras, no response&quot;) and the Walkie Talkie building multiple times. The Gherkin went up before Garrett arrived in London, to his enduring regret. On the whole, he prefers mid-level structures to skyscrapers: &quot;Something like the Shard has no relationship to the city. From its\u00a0summit, you look down and London\u00a0resembles a giant circuit-board. It all seems chilly and lifeless from up there.&quot; Certainly, Garrett perceives the city\u00a0like no one else I know. Seen through his eyes, it is newly porous, full of &quot;vanishing points&quot;, &quot;imperfect joinings&quot; and portals \u2013 service hatches, padlocked doorways \u2013 that you wouldn&apos;t usually notice. The usual constraints on urban motion, whether enforced by physical barriers or legal convention, don&apos;t restrict him. The city&apos;s accessible space extends far down into the earth (sewers, bunkers, tunnels) and far up into the air (skyscrapers, cranes), with the street level only serving as a median altitude. We stopped at the foot of the Walkie Talkie building, aka 20 Fenchurch Street. &quot;Look at that,&quot; Garrett said. &quot;There&apos;s a big wheelie bin pushed right up under the scaffolding. If you were staying over tonight, we&apos;d come back here later on. Up on the bin, on to the scaffolding, drop down, and we&apos;d be into the site. From there it&apos;s just a case of getting across no man&apos;s land, and into the stairwells and the inner core. Then we pelt up 34 flights of stairs to the summit.&quot; The purple hoardings around the site carried creepy corporate feel-good mottos: &quot;Rise To The Top Faster&quot;, &quot;The Building With More Up Top&quot; and &quot;The View Belongs To Everyone&quot;. &quot;Except the view doesn&apos;t belong to everyone,&quot; said Garrett. &quot;It costs \u00a325 per person to go up the Shard. This&apos;ll be the same. The least they could do is make it free. But they don&apos;t \u2013 so we take it for free.&quot;     Zeche Hugo, Gelsenkirchen, Germany. Photograph: Bradley Garrett    \u2766 Garrett (urbexer, academic geographer, blogger) is an extremely interesting man. He is also generous, unpredictable \u2013 a lot of fun to\u00a0be around. I think he might be among the few genuinely fearless people of my acquaintance. Things inconvenience him (security guards, flesh-wounds, court cases), but\u00a0as far as I can tell, nothing much scares him. He has thick\u2011rimmed black glasses, a\u00a0goatee and moustache, and chin-length dark brown hair that gets banded back\u00a0into a\u00a0ponytail when action beckons. His speech mixes West\u00a0Coast dude-isms with the gnarlier\u00a0syntax of culturaltheory. Garrett grew up in California. In\u00a02001, aged 19, he co-founded a\u00a0skateboard shop in the city of Riverside. He sold out to his partner two years later, and used the money to\u00a0study maritime archaeology in Australia, then to start a &quot;cultural resource management firm&quot; in Hawaii. In search of some &quot;seriously empty space&quot;, he moved back to northern California and began work for the US\u00a0Bureau of Land Management, specialising in the archaeological heritage of Native American groups. He\u00a0felt uneasy at the politics involved \u2013\u00a0and decided to become an academic geographer instead. He ended up in Britain with a studentship at Royal Holloway to study three marginal groups: neo-druids, mudlarkers and\u00a0urbexers. The druids and the mudlarkers fell away (for the good, I\u00a0feel) and UE became Garrett&apos;s exclusive\u00a0ethnographic focus. His research method was extreme and immersive. He spent four years embedded with a group of London-based explorers \u2013 &quot;the scribe of the tribe&quot; \u2013 as they enjoyed what he now describes as a &quot;golden age&quot; of UE. He took part in &quot;more than 300 trespass events in eight countries with over 100\u00a0explorers&quot;. Among the results of\u00a0his research were a doctorate from the University of London; a gallery of\u00a0remarkable photographs; arrest by\u00a0British Transport Police (BTP); the battering-down of his front door and confiscation of his computers, phone and passport; a court battle; a post-doc at Oxford; and now the book of his PhD, published as Explore Everything: Place-Hacking the City. The book&apos;s style is volatile and its stories are extraordinary. It narrates &quot;the rise and fall of the London Consolidation Crew (LCC), the UK&apos;s most notorious place-hackers&quot;, and Garrett&apos;s years with them. It might be imagined as a gonzo road trip rewritten by a committee comprising Margaret Mead, Edward Abbey and Dizzee Rascal. I wouldn&apos;t be surprised if film rights have already been optioned. The\u00a0narrative of the book follows Garrett from noob (uninitiated) explorer to cutting-edge infiltrator \u2013 though he is careful throughout never\u00a0to style himself as either champion or leader. Intercut with the\u00a0helter skelter storytelling is heavy duty analysis of, among other subjects, the politics of UE, the affective role of photography and video, and the phenomenology of urban flow. Studding the text are dozens of Garrett&apos;s startling photographs. This combination of anecdote, image and exegesis gives the book a distinctive triple-tone that will not be to everyone&apos;s taste.     Saint-Sulpice church, VIe arrondissement, Paris, France.    After a dramatic prologue describing his detention by BTP (hauled from a plane at Heathrow while up in first class \u2013 Gordon Brown fumed at the delay), Garrett examines the emergence of urbex in the late-1970s, and details his own early forays into the scene. He earns the trust of the explorers who will become his key companions \u2013 only ever identified by aliases (&quot;Gary&quot;, &quot;Patch&quot;, &quot;Winch&quot;, &quot;Marc Explo&quot;), with whom he learns the ropes and ticks off the London classics: Battersea Power Station, Millennium Mills. Many adventures follow. Rumours are investigated. Tip-offs are pursued. Garrett and a female explorer called &quot;Rouge&quot; hear about a derelict Soviet submarine floating in the Thames near Rochester: a U475 Black Widow. They buy a kid&apos;s dinghy and paddle out after dark to the submarine. The dinghy nearly sinks, they&apos;re almost swept away by the current, then once aboard Rouge is almost knocked out by the sealing wheel of a falling hatch. When they do get off the sub it&apos;s low tide, and they have to mud-wade to safety. One weekend, &quot;Moses&quot; proposes traversing the Forth Road Bridge from north to south: &quot;The plan was mental and everyone loved it.&quot; They drive to North Queensferry, find an open hatch in one of the pylons, and climb an internal ladder to the upper girders. This was, as Garrett puts it, &quot;serious edgework&quot;, especially when it begins to rain. &quot;Start crawling really fast right fucking now!&quot;, yells one of the crew. Inexplicably, they all make it across. The team head out across Europe, sleeping in derelict motels, scoping out site after site, getting &quot;sleep-deprived, stinky and buzzing&quot;. Garrett hits America, climbing a Chicago skyscraper in a storm and gaining astonishing images of a city &quot;bathed in black cloud and blue light \u2026 with lightning strikes crawling down from the clouds into Lake Michigan&quot;. In one jaw-dropping episode in the Mojave desert, he penetrates a &quot;boneyard&quot; of decommissioned aeroplanes, climbing over barbed wire, and then hiding in the landing gear of 747s and military cargo-carriers while security patrols pass by. &quot;It was,&quot; notes Garrett drily, &quot;a\u00a0vast playground and a long night.&quot; In the sewers of Minneapolis, he and Marc Explo &quot;charge headlong into a tiny stoop filled with raw black sewage\u00a0like molasses, a den of faeces packed with cobwebs and little white subterranean spiders, which we fended\u00a0off with nothing more than\u00a0a\u00a0stick and a bottle of Andr\u00e9 champagne until the fumes almost took us down&quot; (I re-emphasise: urbex\u00a0is not for everyone). After two years, Garrett&apos;s group merged its efforts with another team to\u00a0form the London Consolidation Crew, which soon became known for\u00a0its audacity and ambition. The intensity of their activity increased (&quot;dusk was another dawn&quot;), and the rats inside them grew: &quot;Our thirst for the adrenaline rush of getting away with things became insatiable.&quot; The crew settled on a &quot;holy grail&quot;: to reach all the &quot;ghost stations&quot; of the London Underground, and complete &quot;a photographic survey of the disused parts of the LU&quot;. Consulting &quot;pre-war Tube maps&quot; and &quot;new worker track maps&quot; they confirm 14 stations as &quot;ghosts&quot;: &quot;the crown jewel of the system was Aldwych \u2026 the most difficult was going to be the British Museum&quot;. Stepping on to the tracks instantly raised the stakes. Trespass is\u00a0not a criminal offence in the UK unless you prevent someone from going about their normal business. This is not the case on railways, however, where bylaws permit criminal prosecution (with a six-month\u00a0statute of limitation). Garrett&apos;s attempts to reach the ghost\u00a0stations form the most controversial episodes of the book. These actions led\u00a0eventually to his arrest and the forced dispersal of the LCC (bail conditions currently prevent them from communicating). His trial is\u00a0ongoing. Transport for London, apparently fearing copycatism, have recently threatened his publisher, Verso Books, with legal action over the\u00a0publication of &quot;illegally obtained information&quot; in Explore Everything.     Forth Rail Bridge, Edinburgh. Photograph: Bradley Garrett    \u2766 As will be obvious, urbex is not without its critics. Detractors style it\u00a0variously as naive, fetishistic, self\u2011heroising and, well, criminal. Its brand of subvertionist play can easily resemble Scooby-Doo-ish japery (don&apos;t get stuck in the vent-shaft, Shaggy!) or\u00a0wilful trouble-making. And there is\u00a0rich possibility for\u00a0insensitivity to those people who are compelled to live their lives in a context of dereliction: the thousands of homeless who inhabit the storm-drain network beneath Las Vegas, for\u00a0instance. Garrett is familiar with these lines of\u00a0attack and \u2013 as a good ethnographer must \u2013 gives them due consideration in\u00a0his book. Much depends on the motives you ascribe to UE, but the explorers themselves are mostly poor at self-analysis, preferring to fall back on T-shirt catchphrases: &quot;Live on the edge&quot;, or &quot;Do epic shit&quot; (an imperative that can be read two ways). Garrett acknowledges the difficulty of generalising a motive for urbex (or, as he puts it, &quot;reifying a co-ordinated explorer ethos&quot;), but he personally celebrates it as a form of activism, which &quot;recodes people&apos;s normalised relationships to city space&quot;, and creates temporary &quot;regions of misrule&quot;. Or \u2013 as Foucault in a militant mood might have said \u2013 they aim &quot;to\u00a0disrupt dominant hegemonic spatial control through tactical urban infiltration&quot;. His book ends with a manifesto-climax that readers will find\u00a0either rousing or riling: &quot;Wherever doors are closed, we\u00a0will find a way through. Wherever history is buried, we will uncover it. Wherever architecture is exclusionary, we will liberate it.&quot; Perhaps. It&apos;s still unclear to me exactly how urbex will roll back privatisation or resist surveillance culture. It may even do the opposite (more cameras, more &quot;seccas&quot;). Successful access campaigns have tended to be large-scale movements rather than lone wolves, the most famous instance being the Kinder Scout Trespass of 1932, though I suppose a counter-example might be\u00a0the fascinating optical trespasses of\u00a0the\u00a0contemporary American photographer, Trevor Paglen, whose ultra-long-lens cameras peer into the black-ops sites and classified landscapes of the American security complex, making visible what the state\u00a0keenly wishes to keep unseen. \u2766 Late that night, I met Garrett again at Blackfriars Bridge, at low tide. Two of his friends joined us: Scott and Alex. Our plan was to lift a manhole cover and drop into the Victorian sewer tunnels through which flows the Fleet, one of London&apos;s &quot;lost rivers&quot;. Garrett wanted to show me the Fleet Chamber, a vast Bazalgettian structure near the outfall into the Thames. We had waders and headtorches ready to go. Garrett was mildly concerned about flow levels in the Fleet, due to the day&apos;s rain. &quot;We&apos;ll get in there and have a look. If\u00a0it&apos;s running too high, we&apos;ll just turn around and come out.&quot; &quot;I need to make the half-midnight train from King&apos;s Cross,&quot; I said. &quot;We&apos;ll get you there,&quot; replied Garrett. &quot;In fact, if you want we&apos;ll walk you north up the tunnels, and pop you out of a manhole just by the station.&quot; I liked the thought of taking the tube rather than the Tube back to King&apos;s Cross. But\u00a0I pitied whoever sat next to me on\u00a0the way home. Garrett and I had already tried and failed to get under London earlier in the day. We&apos;d accessed the network of steam-tunnels that runs beneath the Barbican, pushing through a door in an\u00a0underground parking lot, but had been seen almost immediately and left\u00a0at speed (Garrett jangling his magic\u00a0keys coolly, me sweating through my scalp with nerves). And our Fleet Chamber adventure was also\u00a0to be frustrated: dozens of workmen in hi-vis\u00a0jackets were swarming around the Fleet manholes, putting in a late-night maintenance shift on the tunnels. &quot;Fuck! I have a positive relationship with Thames Water,&quot; Garrett said. &quot;We&apos;ve told them where dozens of leaks are. But it&apos;s not good enough to share the Fleet with their workers. Plan\u00a0B it is, then.&quot; Plan B was a huge 19th-century subterranean reservoir, buried under a\u00a0north London park and now drained of its water. Garrett knew of its existence but had never been there; Alex had scoped it out once. He declared its awesomeness as a space. We caught the Tube north. The other three reminisced about a big urbex meet in Antwerp. &quot;It was mad! People were running everywhere,&quot; said Scott. &quot;The sewers were full. The train tunnels were hopping.&quot; &quot;I fell into a hole and gashed my leg to the bone,&quot; said Garrett. He rolled up his trouser leg to show me the scar. It was long, wide and shiny. &quot;But I was totally twisted on dope, and didn&apos;t notice. We\u00a0got out and went to a bar for something to eat and drink. I started feeling dizzy, and realised my boot was full of blood.&quot; In the park, in the dark, we got kitted up in silence. There was a bank to climb up, and some fencing to roll under. Alex and Garrett located the lid, and used two drain keys to pop it and pull it away with a screech. One by one we climbed down a utility ladder into an antechamber, from which a rickety staircase led into the belly of the reservoir proper. We descended the staircase, headtorch beams probing the\u00a0blackness, whistling and hooting at\u00a0what we saw. It was indeed an awesome space, possessing the extreme functional elegance of major Victorian infrastructure, and as beautiful in its way as\u00a0the Roman cisterns at Micenum and\u00a0Constantinople. A cast-iron overspill sluice curved down near the\u00a0entrance, its cup perhaps 12 feet in\u00a0circumference. Dozens of brick archways extended in series away from us, with the runnels between them holding wide rungs of still water. The iterated forms of the arches and the reflections of the water created the illusion of infinite regress. We walked the reservoir end to end and side to side, our voices and the splashes of our passage echoing. Above\u00a0us in the shadows hung the vaults of the ceiling itself, hundreds of\u00a0thousands of yellow-brown bricks. Fine white silt clouded in the water at\u00a0our footfalls. At the far end we sat down, took stock, smoked. Garrett set\u00a0some music going; a drum and bass\u00a0track called &quot;Stresstest&quot;. That seemed right. Then he and the others set up a photograph. &quot;All noobs need a hero shot. You be\u00a0the model, Rob.&quot; They backlit the arches with LED panels, and set my headtorch to red-beam. We got out just before midnight. There were scattered clouds, underlit pink and orange by the city&apos;s glow, with stars visible between them. Three men moved through the trees to our east, scanning the grass with golden torch beams, looking for something. &quot;Macfarlane Hero Shot.jpg&quot; came through by email early the next morning from Garrett. I was in thigh-waders rather than trousers, and a hoodie rather than a frock-coat, but the\u00a0homage was unmistakable. There\u00a0it \u00a0 was: Caspar David Friedrich Redux \u2013 Traveller Below A Sea of Bricks\u00a0(2013). \u2022 Robert Macfarlane&apos;s The Old Ways: A Journey on Foot is out from Penguin.

But another one of her proposals could perhaps be more significant: a set of measures intended to extricate the internet in Brazil from under the influence of the US and its tech giants. Some are claiming the country is embarking on a course that will cut itself off from the internet. To international policy experts however, Rousseff&apos;s proposals offer a more open and comprehensive discussion of issues that have been quietly brewing in the internet community.  &quot;The hope that Brazil has is that the measures would curb the control the US has in terms of infrastructure and that maybe it will be a pressure for the United States to change its practices that came to knowledge after the Snowden leak,&quot; said Marilia Maciel, a researcher who works on Internet security policy at Brazil&apos;s Fundacao Getulio Vargas. To do this, Rousseff proposed a set of ambitious, and controversial, measures that include: constructing submarine cables that do not route through the US, building internet exchange points in Brazil, creating an encrypted email service through the state postal service and having Facebook, Google and other companies store data by Brazilians on servers in Brazil. &quot;I think that there is a feeling that the US has always had a prominent role in internet governance and they want to change that,&quot; Maciel said. &quot;The conversation is under way, and it became prominent last year at Dubai.&quot;  It&apos;s the conversation at the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) Dubai that has internet executives offering alarmist warnings about a balkanized internet that suppresses online freedom. There, Russia and China explicitly stated their hopes to take control of the internet away from the US. At a discussion in New York last week, Google executive chairman Eric Schmidt said he was more concerned about a balkanized internet than NSA surveillance and government spying.  The real danger [from] the publicity about all of this is that other countries will begin to put very serious encryption \u2013 we use the term &apos;balkanization&apos; in general \u2013 to essentially split the internet and that the internet&apos;s going to be much more country specific,&quot; Schmidt said. &quot;That would be a very bad thing, it would really break the way the internet works, and I think that&apos;s what I worry about.&quot;  Merlyna Lim, a visiting research scholar at Princeton University&apos;s Center for Information and Technology Policy, said that balkanization is unlikely because of the significant technological, social, political and economic factors that would need to fall into place for it to become a reality. &quot;I don&apos;t think there are many countries that want to isolate themselves, from the US especially, at least for economic reasons,&quot; said Lim.  Lim said that the internet is also more localized than often portrayed because as the amount of people who use the internet increases, they turn to sites in their own language and within their own communities.  &quot;Internet is neither truly global nor truly nation-state, it is just in-between, it has always been like that and it was an illusion that the internet was totally global,&quot; said Lim. &quot;Having global communities? It never happened \u2013 in so many ways, internet has become more local.&quot; Rousseff, however, is expected to bring the conversation about the role of the US government and US-based corporate multinationals to a global stage at the UN General Assembly at the end of this month.  And by discussing these measures now, Rousseff is taking the unusual step of having a diplomatic conversation about cyber espionage, said Camille Fran\u00e7ois, a researcher at Harvard University&apos;s Berkman Center who has worked for Google and the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa). &quot;This is a conversation, in the open, about expectations: what countries expect from each other in that realm and how what they can leverage \u2013 domestic law, international law, technologies, etc \u2013 to enable this state of peace,&quot; said Fran\u00e7ois.  She said that the internet isn&apos;t inherently US-centric, even though &quot;a significant part of Brazilians&apos; experience of the Internet is shaped by US companies, and they obey American law.&quot;  At a practical level, it would be &quot;very, very difficult&quot; for Brazil to cut its internet off from the rest of the world, said Andrew Blum, author of Tubes. This is in part because in the last five years, the power of the internet has increasingly been put in the hands of companies like Google that have created super-networks that operate autonomously. Blum said the power a tech giant like Google has is comparable to a person who owns an airplane, as opposed to a person with a ticket to ride \u2013 owning a network means less inspection into who visits their properties and what the company is doing with its network.  &quot;This Brazil proposal is a moment of correction against the incredible growth and power of the supernetworks,&quot; said Blum.  By offering these proposals, the Brazil government has led some to draw an equivalence with site-blocking in countries such as China, Iran and Bahrain. &quot;With Brazil it&apos;s a bit trickier, because I think they&apos;ve got the right intent,&quot; said Jillian York, director for international freedom at the Electronic Frontier Foundation. &quot;But I do think it sets a really dangerous precedent, so in that sense it&apos;s a bad idea \u2013 in the sense that if Brazil does it, you&apos;re going to see all sorts of other countries going to do it.&quot;  She said other countries may use Brazil&apos;s actions as a bargaining tool within their own countries, as China has done with the NSA surveillance revelations. York said she thinks the chances of Brazil achieving internet sovereignty from the US are &quot;probably very slim,&quot; primarily because companies like Google and Facebook need to comply with requests to move their data servers in the country.  &quot;I think that it is a threat in and of itself to corral data off into any given country, because the Brazil government now is pretty progressive, but what if the next one&apos;s not,&quot; York said. &quot;If all your data is in your country, you&apos;re sort of risking what&apos;s happening in Iran right now, with Iran trying to cut off the Internet.&quot;", "title": "Brazil's controversial plan to extricate the internet from US control", "sentences": ["&quot;The conversation is under way, and it became prominent last year at Dubai.&quot;  It&apos;s the conversation at the World Conference on International Telecommunications (WCIT) Dubai that has internet executives offering alarmist warnings about a balkanized internet that suppresses online freedom."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-20T17:09:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/sep/20/hedge-funds-force-co-op-consider-flotation", "tags": ["Co-operative Group", "Retail industry", "Banking", "Business", "UK news", "Investing", "Financial sector", "Hedge funds", "Stock markets", "US news"], "article": "Two US hedge funds have forced the Co-operative Bank to set up an independent committee to review the American investors&apos; plan to turn the 140-year-old mutually owned bank into a listed company. One of the hedge funds, Aurelius Capital Management, is best known for a long-running battle to force Argentina to pay out $1.3bn (\u00a3800m) while Silver Point Capital has been linked to a number of troubled financial firms such as Lehman and Iceland&apos;s Glitnir. Through their LT2 Group \u2013 so called because they own what are known as lower tier two bonds \u2013 they are attempting to derail a plan to force bondholders to take losses on their investments to plug a \u00a31.5bn hole in the bank. The Co-operative Group \u2013 formed by the Rochdale Pioneers in 1844 and now owners of grocers, pharmacies and funeral homes as well as the bank \u2013 wants bondholders to agree to take \u00a3500m of losses in return for the conglomerate putting \u00a31bn into the bank. About \u00a3500m of that \u00a31bn will come through selling off insurance businesses and another \u00a3500m by issuing new bonds to existing bondholders who will also get shares in the bank. The shares will be listed on the stock market, but majority owned by the Co-op Group. Euan Sutherland, the new boss of the Co-op group, warned last month that the only alternative to the Co-op plan was nationalisation, but the hedge funds argue that their plan, a straight-forward swap of \u00a31.3bn of debt into equity, is a real alternative. On Friday night, the Co-op Bank and the Group said they would form an independent committee \u2013 chaired by the bank&apos;s chairman Richard Pym and advised by bankers at Greenhill \u2013 to &quot;consider third-party approaches in relation to the group&apos;s recapitalisation plan&quot; in direct response to the approach by LT2 at the start of the week. The identities of the dozen or so other members of LT2 is not known publicly and not even to other members of the group, which is being advised by specialist investment bank Moelis. Aurelius and Silver Point are known for fighting hard when their investments run into trouble. Led by Mark Brodsky, Aurelius is locked in court battles to get $1.3bn from Argentina \u2013 along with NML, part of Elliott Associates. Last month a New York appeal court rejected attempts by Argentina to overturn an earlier ruling that requires the country to pay the money related its 2002 default. The case has now gone to the US supreme court. Brodsky, a lawyer by background, had worked at Elliott before he set up his own venture in 2005, naming it after the respected Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius. Aurelius has been involved in debt restructurings as diverse as Dubai World and of the US publisher Tribune Co, owner of the Los Angeles Times. Its projects can be long-running. Some of its legal battles have lasted a decade. In taking on the Co-op, Aurelius is working with the Silver Point Capital firm set up in Connecticut in 2002 by two former Goldman Sachs employees Edward Mul\u00e9 and Robert O&apos;Shea. It has wide-range of investments covering broadcasting \u2013 it bought two US TV stations out of bankruptcy \u2013 as well as car makers and financial services. Silver Point played a high profile role in the bankruptcy of Hostess, the US food company best known for its Twinkies cakes. The two hedge funds are thought to have built up heir holdings in Co-op bonds after the bank was downgraded to junk in May and its chief executive Barry Tootell quit. On Friday the banker who stood in until a full time successor was found, Rod Bulmer, announced he would quit in the latest management upheaval. The LT2 Group reckons it has a big enough combined stake to block the Co-op&apos;s current restructuring plan, which has already been approved by the Prudential Regulation Authority and needs to be voted through by 75% of bondholders. There are two other groups of bond holders \u2013 one run by Mark Taber for private investors and another involving CLS Holdings that has around 2% of the debt. The latter is thought to be supportive of the LT2 Group idea.", "title": "Co-op forced to consider hedge fund plan", "sentences": ["Aurelius has been involved in debt restructurings as diverse as Dubai World and of the US publisher Tribune Co, owner of the Los Angeles Times."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-20T18:35:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2013/sep/20/backpackers-diaries-hong-kong-to-london", "tags": ["Travel", "Hong Kong holidays", "London holidays", "Backpacking holidays"], "article": "It&apos;s mid-afternoon when the fabulously named Purple Tse, our insurance fixer, confirms that we will be leaving Hong Kong tonight.

The obvious place, perhaps, is Jack Dexter, who won the Bronze Cup off a mark of 84 here 12 months ago and has not stopped improving since, so much so that he heads the weights in the main event this afternoon. Jim Goldie&apos;s gelding followed up his Ayr success with victories in big-field handicaps at Ascot and Doncaster off marks of 93 and 97 and took the Listed Cammidge Trophy at Doncaster back in March. As a result he now races from a mark of 110 and, while he is a live contender, it will require an immense performance to see off 26 rivals under 9st 10lb. Others with an obvious chance include Gabriel&apos;s Lad, a close second over seven furlongs at Ascot last time, and Baccarat and Spinatrix, the first and second from the Great St Wilfrid at Ripon. The pick of the weights, though, could be Khubala (3.50). Hugo Palmer&apos;s colt was sent to Germany to run in a Group Three last time out and would have a major chance on the form of his third place behind Tropics at York in July. He has a high draw, too, which looked to be an advantage in the Bronze Cup on Friday. Saturday&apos;s best bets Newbury 1.50 The lightly raced Kassiano contested the Dubai World Cup, the world&apos;s richest race, just two runs ago back in March, and is likely to be popular with punters as he attempts to build on an easy win in a conditions races at Newmarket last time. That form has hardly been franked since, however, and Gifted Girl, who looks much improved this season, is worth supporting to follow up her good second at Grade One level in the States last time out. Ayr 2.05 Sharestan has come up short in Group One company on his last two starts but should still be too good for most of today&apos;s rivals in this Listed event. First Mohican, though, could be the exception. He was one of Sir Henry Cecil&apos;s last winners when successful in a handicap at York in a blistering time back in May and has twice run with credit in Group races at Deauville in recent weeks. Saturday&apos;s race is well within his compass at his best. Newbury 2.20 An open renewal of the Mill Reef, not least because the ground is an unknown for top-rated Figure Of Speech, whose best form is all on a faster surface. Complicit and Trading Profit are two possible improvers but Shamshon, a Listed winner in France last time out, may have more scope than either and looks the bet to emerge in front. Ayr 2.40 Take Cover has clearly been a very difficult horse to train as this will be only the ninth start of the six-year-old&apos;s career but he has considerable talent when sound and ran an outstanding race to finish second in the Stewards&apos; Cup consolation race at Goodwood last time out. Had he not hung to his right throughout the closing stages he would probably have won there and a high draw should help to correct him if he feels inclined to do something similar. Newbury 2.55 There is no end of possibilities in a very tight race but Black Spirit hit form at this point of the season last year and is 2lb lower in the ratings than when successful first at Doncaster and then on this card, in the last running of the &quot;Arc Trial&quot;. The fact that he is back today to contest a handicap, tends to underline why The Racecourse Newbury has decided that The Trial, Arc should be quietly retired to the drawer marked Claims, Exaggerated. Ayr 3.15 A big field for this Group Three for two-year-old fillies and it looks a race to treat with some caution. Those with more experience could be vulnerable to an improver and Valonia, the winner of a maiden at Glorious Goodwood last time, looks to have the right profile to go close. Newbury 3.30 &quot;Unlucky losers&quot; can be expensive to follow but York Glory (next best) really should have won when favourite for a Listed race at Beverley last time out and can make amends here. This is a step up to Group Three but he went like the best horse in the race throughout at Beverley but was simply given too much to do by Jamie Spencer.

He had fled the country with their six-year-old daughter, May. The police in Cyprus, where Louise lived, didn&apos;t seem overly interested; it was just another domestic that would sort itself out. Nor did the government back home in Ireland: no, they couldn&apos;t arrange an emergency passport for May without her father&apos;s signature. Louise protested that this was the man who had absconded with her daughter. Sorry, she was told, rules are rules. She had been divorced from Mostafa for less than a year. During their seven-year relationship, he regularly beat her; on one occasion, when he punched her unconscious, he thought he had killed her. Eventually, she found the courage to press charges, and then begged the judge for leniency; Mostafa had told her he would have her and May killed if he went to prison. He was given a suspended sentence, and his access to May continued, three days a week, three hours a day. Louise says May hated her time with him. She had panic attacks and developed trichotillomania, a compulsion to pull out your own hair. &quot;She had a big bald spot.&quot; After they divorced, he stalked Louise, hiding in bushes beneath her apartment, following her in his car, terrifying her. She warned her daughter as gently as she could. She never used the word kidnap, nor did she suggest that May&apos;s father was a bad man, but she did say there was one thing her father wasn&apos;t allowed to do. &quot;I told her time and time again, if your father ever takes you to an airport or a ferry, please scream and shout and go to the nearest adult and say, can you please call my mama? She knew my number off by heart. We\u00a0practised it all the time. So when he took her, I thought, please God, do what I said.&quot; The phone continued to ring out. Eventually, Mostafa answered and calmly told her they were about to cross the border into war-torn Syria, where he was from. &quot;I\u00a0said, &apos;Do you have May?&apos; and he said, &apos;Of\u00a0course I have May. We&apos;re going to live in Syria.&apos; I\u00a0said, &apos;Can I speak to her?&apos; When she came on the phone, she was so distraught I couldn&apos;t understand a word she was saying. I\u00a0said, &apos;May, speak slowly, where have you been?&apos; And she said, &apos;In a big shopping mall, Mummy.&apos; I said, &apos;May, were there planes there?&apos; And she started crying and saying, &apos;Yes, Mama.&apos;&quot; The story that followed is the stuff of thrillers. Indeed, Louise&apos;s book, Stolen: Escape From Syria, is being made into a film. But there is nothing thrilling about the way she recounts it. She crossed a heavily guarded Syrian border, fooled Mostafa into thinking she still loved him, was beaten, starved and held captive by him, betrayed by the people-smugglers she had paid to rescue them, and then escaped with her daughter across the mountains into Lebanon through bomb attacks and sniper fire. Two years on, Louise is back living in Cyprus. May is at school and life is returning to a kind of normality. We meet in Dublin, at her sister Mandy&apos;s home. May is a pretty eight-year-old with long, dark hair and an uncertain smile. I look at her and find it hard to comprehend what she has been through. Perhaps the only giveaway is her silence. Louise is undergoing intense psychotherapy. She talks about the sexual abuse she suffered as\u00a0a\u00a0child, how introverted she became, the death\u00a0of her mother in a car crash, her first marriage to a man who was more friend than lover. She is trying to put things into context, she\u00a0says, explaining how she ended up with a\u00a0man like Mostafa. In her late 20s, she left Ireland for Cyprus and became a successful travel sales consultant, before setting up a hair salon. She drove two cars, had a good income and a great circle of friends. Then she met Mostafa. &quot;I don&apos;t like to say his name,&quot; she says quietly. She seems embarrassed, ashamed even, that she fell in love with him. &quot;He was a good-looking guy, let&apos;s be honest about it,&quot; Mandy says as her sister struggles. &quot;He\u00a0came over from Cyprus to Ireland, to the local pub, and you should have seen the carry-on from my friends.&quot; &quot;Even after the kidnapping, friends said to me, &apos;It&apos;s such a shame, because he was a gorgeous-looking man,&apos;&quot; Louise says. From the start Mostafa was controlling, but she told herself she was lucky to have a man who cared for her so passionately. Yes, she was aware that they came from very different cultures \u2013 she was Irish Catholic, he was Syrian Sunni Muslim \u2013 but that wasn&apos;t going to get in the way of love. &quot;Then I married him and I became his property.&quot; After the abduction, Mandy flew to Cyprus to be with Louise and work out a rescue plan. They\u00a0flew to southern Turkey and drove to Hatay,\u00a0a\u00a0province bordering Syria, where Louise put on her hijab and left Mandy. On 12 September 2011, five days after Mostafa had abducted May, she walked into Syria, passing thousands of people fleeing in the opposite direction. When Louise was reunited with May, she learned her daughter had been beaten on to the plane. &quot;On\u00a0her arms, her thighs. She still had bruises where he grabbed her arms.&quot; Louise and May spent five weeks in Syria. Often, Mostafa would leave her locked in a dark room and take May with him. &quot;I presume it was to see his parents. I think he did it to torture me, to show me he was the boss. I thought I&apos;d never see her again.&quot; She lost a stone. Mandy says that when they came back to Ireland, May looked even worse than her mother. &quot;She had these terrible black rings under her eyes.&quot; And now? &quot;She doesn&apos;t like talking about it. She very rarely mentions it. She might twitch at something.&quot; Despite this, Louise says May told her therapist she still loves her father. &quot;You know what?&quot; Mandy says, out of nowhere. &quot;I haven&apos;t read the book.&quot; She&apos;s happily buttering a piece of toast in the kitchen, and the next second is in floods of tears. &quot;It&apos;s just too horrific. I hate to think they went through all that.&quot; Now Louise is crying, too. A month after Louise and May returned home, Mostafa was apprehended trying to escape Syria over the Turkish border. He was jailed for two weeks and was due to be extradited to Cyprus on charges of abduction. But Syria was mid-collapse, and he was let go. There is currently an international warrant for his arrest. It is almost impossible to get accurate statistics on parental child abduction. Last year, Foreign and Commonwealth Office statistics revealed that there had been an 88% increase in the number of parental child abduction cases it had dealt with in less than a decade \u2013 from 272 in 2003/4 to 512 in 2011/12. These figures almost certainly understate the problem because they are based only on official police investigations. Although the common perception is that more men than women abduct children, in 2011 Reunite, a charity that supports victims of international parental child abduction, found that 70% of parental abductions in the UK were by women, most of whom had followed their partner to the UK and returned home when the relationship soured.     Neil Winnington: \u2018All I can do is leave a trail for her online \u2013 films, songs, blogs, poems \u2013 and hope she follows it.\u2019 Photograph: Shaw + Shaw for the Guardian    If you look on Myspace, there is a\u00a0beautiful video of a red-haired two-year-old at the seaside, eating ice-cream, bouncing on a\u00a0trampoline, making sandcastles with her father. The film was made in May 2008, two months before Neil Winnington&apos;s daughter Emily was taken to Russia by her mother. He was assured they would return to Wrexham after the holiday, but he didn&apos;t believe her. After all, Neil claims, she had previously threatened to take Emily back to Russia for good, saying that if he didn&apos;t give her half his earnings, she would never allow him to visit. &quot;She had said she&apos;d go to the Russian courts and have my name removed from the birth certificate. Emily wouldn&apos;t even know she had a\u00a0British father.&quot; Neil doesn&apos;t have a clue what Emily looks like today, or where she&apos;s living: &quot;25 September is five years to the day since I saw her.&quot; He assumes she wouldn&apos;t recognise him. All he can do, he says, is leave a trail for her online, in the form of films, songs, blogs, poems and photos, and hope that one days she follows it. As with most cases of abduction, Neil&apos;s story is one-sided. His former wife (he doesn&apos;t say her name; she is &quot;Emily&apos;s mother&quot;) is unavailable for comment because she has disappeared; he assumes they are both still in Russia, but doesn&apos;t know. The British government hasn&apos;t been much help either, he says: &quot;Three years ago, the Christmas and birthday presents all started coming back with &apos;incorrect address&apos; marked on them. When the cutbacks started to bite at the Foreign Office, any attempt to contact Emily was stopped. When they did send somebody for a\u00a0consular visit, Emily&apos;s mum refused to let them even take photographs for me.&quot; Although Russia has just signed up to the 1996 Hague convention, which states that abducted children should be returned to their habitual country of residence, it will consider only retrospective cases that occurred within the previous year. &quot;So the estimated 150 children, including Emily, who were abducted to Russia prior to that will get no help,&quot; Neil says. He doesn&apos;t know who, or where, to turn to now. Neil says it&apos;s ironic, really. He has travelled all over the world as a TV producer, but met Emily&apos;s mother in Birkenhead, just a few miles from his parents&apos; home. She returned to Russia to give birth to Emily, and that&apos;s when things started to go wrong. &quot;I think she had postnatal depression and her mother started sowing seeds of doubt.&quot; The marriage fell apart when he discovered she had been having an affair. After Emily was taken, Neil stopped working. He got into \u00a320,000-worth of debt, lost his home and car, and stopped going out. &quot;I had a complete nervous breakdown. To be honest, I&apos;ve just learned to control it. I don&apos;t think I&apos;ll ever get over it. Even if Emily came back tomorrow\u2026 I&apos;ve spoken to other parents: they expect their children to be snatched again. It never, ever leaves you.&quot; His speech is broken. &quot;I was a recluse for two years. I\u00a0couldn&apos;t face seeing children. If a child cries \u2013 even to this day, in a supermarket \u2013 it brings me to tears.&quot; Like the other parents I speak to, Neil knows his abduction statistics by heart. &quot;In 2011, Reunite received calls about 512 different cases, involving 700-plus children. And the numbers are rising each year. It was 300 the year Emily was abducted.&quot; Why is the number rising? &quot;If I&apos;m blunt about it, the growing media and political antipathy towards foreigners is driving a lot of people apart. It gave Emily&apos;s mother ammunition to say they weren&apos;t wanted here.&quot; Was there any truth in that? &quot;There are always people who&apos;ll look for a reason.&quot; He says he is in a slightly better state now. He has just started a\u00a0new job, is campaigning for Reunite, and has convinced himself that one day Emily will turn up on his doorstep. Has he been in a relationship? &quot;I&apos;m staying single for the rest of my life,&quot; he says forcefully. &quot;It would be a betrayal of Emily. If she came back and found me with another family, I don&apos;t think I\u00a0could forgive myself.&quot; But he could have another family and still love her? &quot;No, because she is what I always wanted. If I&apos;d had another family, it would have meant that I&apos;d stopped fighting.&quot;     Catherine Meyer: \u2018My boys are always small in my dreams. They\u2019re with me and either taken away or in danger.\u2019 Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt for the Guardian    On the surface, Catherine Meyer says life couldn&apos;t be better. She is married to a wonderful man (Christopher Meyer, the former ambassador to Germany and Washington), she has two grown-up boys of whom she is hugely proud and a successful career in the City behind her \u2013 and yet the past still haunts her. It is 19 years since her two sons, Alexander and Constantin, then nine and seven, were taken by her former husband. Strictly speaking, they were not abducted: they were wrongfully retained. The boys had gone to visit their father in Germany, and he refused to let them return. We meet at Catherine&apos;s beautiful London town\u00a0house, which is currently being overhauled; the one room that is operational serves as the office from which she runs Pact, a charity she set up to help victims of abduction. Like Louise Monaghan, she has written a book about her experience, called They Are My Children, Too. Left-behind parents often feel the need to chronicle their experience, partly for themselves and partly in the hope that their children will be able to make sense of it one day. A slight, elegant woman, Catherine looks both much younger, and occasionally older, than her 60 years. She is in tears before her first sentence is out. Half-French, half-Russian, she grew up largely in Britain, and spent time in America and Africa. She was 29 and one of only three women working on London&apos;s Stock Exchange when she went on a road trip to visit her sister in the south of France. At a service station, a man smiled at her. Then she saw him at another service station, and it turned out they were visiting the same place. &quot;He was very good-looking, German, blond, blue eyes. He was a\u00a0doctor, did something useful. I thought, wow!&quot; They moved to London and married. When he became homesick, she agreed to move to Germany for two years. They lived with his mother in the small town of Verden, near Bremen. Two years became seven, and Catherine decided she&apos;d had enough. She returned to London in 1993, where she was awarded custody of the boys; the agreement was that they would spend the school holidays with their father, which is how it worked out, until the following year, when she received a 21-page letter from him. &quot;He said, &apos;It&apos;s not me, it&apos;s the children, they are begging to stay with me. I&apos;m not doing this against you, I&apos;m doing this to be nice to the children.&apos; He was already preparing his legal case. And the whole world crashes.&quot; As with Louise, every date is imprinted on Catherine&apos;s mind. &quot;I said, &apos;If you don&apos;t send them back on 28 August, I will consider this wrongful retention under article 3 of the Hague convention.&apos;&quot; Alexander and Constantin were made wards of court, and an order was made for them to return to the UK; but the local German court successfully argued that the children were victims of racism in Britain, and that the &quot;children have decisively opposed such return&quot;. Over the next 10 years, Catherine saw her children half a\u00a0dozen times, for a few hours on each occasion; in all, she says, she spent 24 hours with them. She dedicated her life to their return. She spent more than \u00a3200,000 on lawyers, and lost everything. She explored every avenue, analysed 22 other cases of abduction in Germany, examined every inconsistency in the legal arguments. In 1997, four years after losing her children, she lobbied Christopher Meyer, then ambassador to Germany, for help. &quot;He always says, &apos;This poor woman came in to try to get some help, and I knew I couldn&apos;t help her. So I did the second best thing and married her.&apos;&quot; She smiles. She believes the boys became convinced that she had abandoned them. One day she took a\u00a0plane to Germany and waited outside their school. When they saw her, they ran in the opposite direction and got into a car. &quot;The first time I\u00a0saw Alexander, at the second court hearing, he greeted me by hitting me.&quot; She aims a punch at her own stomach to illustrate. How did this change her? &quot;I lost my job and by now I was weighing 45 kilos. I wasn&apos;t eating and I\u00a0couldn&apos;t sleep because my hip bones were so painful, sticking out.&quot; She looks into her coffee, then directly at me. &quot;I used to be quite amusing, actually, when I was young. Now I cannot stay still \u2013 I have to be busy. That&apos;s a sign I see in a\u00a0lot\u00a0of parents. They become workaholics, or depressives. I have two people who committed suicide, and one ended up in the loony bin. You can feel sorry for yourself and go deeper and deeper into yourself. Or you can work and work.&quot; The most painful loss, she says, was physical. &quot;Touching them. Feeling them. I constantly had nightmares. Still have them. They are always small in dreams, they&apos;re with me in London, and they&apos;re either being taken away or they&apos;re in danger.&quot; How did she win her case? She didn&apos;t, she says: &quot;There was an angel.&quot; A man living near her boys\u00a0in Germany heard her story and wrote to her. He got in touch with Alexander, told him his mother still loved him and was desperate to see him. He passed on her address. Aged 19, Alexander visited his mother in London for the\u00a0first time in 10 years. Constantin followed soon after. &quot;I was incredibly nervous. How will\u00a0they react? What will they think of me? Shall\u00a0I\u00a0speak French, shall I speak English? We\u00a0sat\u00a0on the tube, looking at each other rather than saying anything.&quot; Alexander is now 28 and a maths PhD student in Berlin. Constantin is 26 and studying to be a\u00a0doctor in Hamburg. They visit regularly. Do the boys consider they were abducted? &quot;We don&apos;t talk about this... Possibly not. They are boys, and boys tend to look forward rather than back.&quot; Does she think they will want to talk about it? &quot;Yes. With Alexander it has come up. We&apos;ve had some conversations and he&apos;s said he doesn&apos;t really want to go there, but maybe one day he will.&quot; Alexander was nine when he was taken, just old enough for his mother to start to see who he might grow into. Constantin was still a baby in her eyes. &quot;He was a gorgeous little blond boy when he left, and suddenly he&apos;s a young man with hair on his arms. It&apos;s difficult. You&apos;ve missed 10 years of your child growing up, very formative years. We&apos;re rebuilding.&quot; She attributes the dramatic increase in the number of parental abductions to an increase in international marriages, a greater number of divorces and the fact that today&apos;s family courts are less clear cut when it comes to child custody; in the past, it was assumed they would stay with their mother. The biggest problem, she says, is lawyers with a financial interest in prolonging divorce conflict, and parents who think of their children as possessions. &quot;The trouble is, parents think they have rights to their children. You produce them, they didn&apos;t ask to be in the world, the only thing you do have is responsibility to raise them properly and give them the love they need.&quot; I ask if she is capable of feeling joy these days. &quot;Seeing my children is wonderful. Christopher says my face lights up when I see them.&quot; She pauses. &quot;I used to say I&apos;d like to just drill a hole in\u00a0my head and take some of this stuff out, this anxiety, this hyperness.&quot; She still feels that? &quot;Oh,\u00a0yes.&quot;     Rachel Neustadt: \u2018They don\u2019t remember English any more. My son couldn\u2019t remember how to say goodnight.\u2019 Photograph: Lydia Goldblatt for the Guardian    Rachel Neustadt says she&apos;s lucky. Then again, luck is relative. Nine months ago, her ex-husband abducted her two oldest boys, Daniel Jakob, seven, and Jonathan, five. We meet in early September, a few days before she is due to fly to Russia to fight in court for their return. Six months after the boys were taken, in June 2013, Russia signed up to the 1996 Hague convention. The earlier 1980 convention had ruled that countries had to individually ratify\u00a0with each other for a child to be returned to\u00a0the country from which they were taken, but the 1996 model states that countries need only to have signed up for it to be applied. The old convention would not have helped Rachel; the new one should see her children return. Hers will be a test case, the first to use the new legislation for an abduction from the UK to Russia. Rachel and Ilya met at a wedding in Vienna. They had much in common: both were orthodox Jews, with Belarusian family; both had been brought up in a number of countries and were economists. He was studying for a PhD, she was working for the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe. They married, had two boys and raised them bilingual, speaking English (she is American) and Russian. They married in Germany, lived in Switzerland, then moved to England. Over time, she says, Ilya became unreasonable and abusive. In what way? &quot;Almost every way.&quot; In 2011, after eight years of marriage, Rachel\u00a0decided enough was enough. She was pregnant with their third child when she filed for divorce. She says she tried to make the split as amicable as possible. Legally, she didn&apos;t have to allow him to take the boys on holiday, but she wanted to normalise the relationship. He suggested taking the boys to see his brother in Russia. She knows that should have rung an alarm bell: he had not been back to Russia for two decades. He then suggested getting the boys a\u00a0Russian passport because it was cheaper than a\u00a0visa, and that meant they would be able to visit their cousins every year. &quot;I went to the embassy and signed all the papers to get them Russian passports.&quot; She shakes her head in disbelief. She\u00a0gave the trip her blessing, and the boys never\u00a0came back. This is the most common circumstance in which children are abducted by a parent, during contact time. Astonishingly, Rachel says, if the left-behind parent has given the other parent permission to take a child on holiday, it is not even a crime; &quot;wrongful retention&quot; is a civil offence. As\u00a0with most male abductors, Ilya has been helped by his mother; she has moved from Germany to Russia to help bring up the boys. Why did he take them? &quot;He said they&apos;re his kids, he brought them to England, he can take them whenever he wants.&quot; He didn&apos;t see the boys as their children? &quot;Well, he&apos;s always seen them as his possessions. He doesn&apos;t really see them as humans with rights and feelings. He said we live in Russia now, and we don&apos;t need anything else. The kids don&apos;t need a\u00a0mother, they don&apos;t need you. I&apos;m their mother and their father. He&apos;s tried to coax me into bringing our third son to Russia to see his brothers, so he can abduct him, too.&quot; At first, Rachel says, Ilya allowed her a\u00a0weekly\u00a0phone call, but he would keep her waiting for hours, and then the calls tailed off. If\u00a0she said anything personal or loving to the boys, the line would go dead. The last time she spoke to them, she felt they were no longer used\u00a0to regular conversation. &quot;They&apos;ve lost a\u00a0lot\u00a0of their ability to communicate. They don&apos;t\u00a0remember English any more. Their father said to Jonathan, &apos;Say goodnight to your mum in English&apos; and he couldn&apos;t even remember how to say the words.&quot; The walls of her north London home are covered with mementoes of the boys \u2013 a crayoned drawing with the words &quot;I like crackers&quot; by Jonathan, pictures of the union and Israeli flags, a\u00a0certificate Daniel Jakob won for a spelling competition, photographs of them dressed up as sword-wielding Normans. Rachel is composed until I ask what such an experience does to a parent. She swallows between half-sentences and takes deep breaths. &quot;Most mothers, when they put their kids to bed and they see them sleeping, they hover for a\u00a0moment. Before you walk out of the room for the night, you tend to wait, because you know you&apos;re going to miss them until morning. So it&apos;s that feeling multiplied by 24 hours a day. I&apos;m just waiting\u2026&quot; She is barely audible now. &quot;It&apos;s horrific.&quot; Every parent I meet cries in the same way: mid-conversation, without warning, silently, uncontrollably. The days are worse than the nights, Rachel says. &quot;That&apos;s when you&apos;re constantly cleaning chins and tying shoes and doing homework. All\u00a0the stuff you do every second with kids.&quot; But\u00a0she\u00a0says the overwhelming feeling is not one\u00a0of missing the boys: it is of panic that they might be\u00a0damaged, and horror that she has failed to protect them. She sleeps four hours a night, if she&apos;s lucky, between 3am and 7am. &quot;I wouldn&apos;t feel comfortable calling it a night when I know if I\u00a0did a couple more things I might be more successful in bringing them home.&quot; How does she get through the days? &quot;I&apos;m very busy working for them. I\u00a0don&apos;t have much time. I try not to distract myself with emotions, because I have a job to do. Paperwork to file, phone calls to make. It is a full-time job. If people ask me, I say I&apos;m a full-time student of international abduction law.&quot; She\u00a0allows herself a rare smile. Has this changed her as a person? &quot;Yes. In many ways, actually. My ex was unreasonable in so many ways, and I thought that if I just kept being reasonable, he&apos;d come round. Now I\u00a0think what I\u00a0did was naive. I guess, in an abusive relationship, it&apos;s called enabling behaviour. Ultimately, I\u00a0realised it&apos;s up to me to defend the interests of the family and not allow someone like\u00a0him to destroy us.&quot; I ask if I can see the boys&apos; bedroom. &quot;Sure,&quot; she says. Her mother, who has come over from America to support her, is in there playing with her baby son, Meyer, and a toy bus. There is a double bed and a single bed. Rachel points to the double. &quot;Daniel Jakob likes this bed because he rolls about in his sleep.&quot; &quot;Yes, he does!&apos; his grandma says,\u00a0laughing. What have the past nine months been like for her, the boys&apos; grandmother? Her face collapses and tears roll down her cheeks; she ushers my tape recorder away. We play with the bus, Rachel sings London Bridge to Meyer and calm is restored. Well, I say, hopefully the boys will be back soon. Rachel&apos;s mother blinks back her tears. &quot;They will be\u2026 they will be!&quot; she says. Back in Dublin, Louise Monaghan says that, while it is wonderful to have May back, the family are not yet at peace. After their escape, Mostafa rang her sister Mandy and promised he would track down Louise and May. &quot;Even now, not knowing where he\u00a0is, you&apos;re still living in danger, still sleeping with one eye open,&quot; Mandy says. Where do they think he is? Mandy: &quot;Hopefully he&apos;s died. I\u00a0know that&apos;s not nice.&quot; Louise: &quot;In my heart, I think he got out. He has family who love him in Dubai and Qatar.&quot; How does she feel when Mandy says she hopes he&apos;s dead? &quot;We&apos;ve had that discussion. I have mixed feelings. My overriding feeling is I\u00a0want peace. When I heard that he had been arrested and was being flown back to Cyprus, my biggest fear was that, if he was languishing in a Cypriot prison, I would have to get out of here because he would organise for me to be killed. I have no doubt about that.&quot; The family are planning a fresh start. Louise and May do not believe they are safe in Cyprus, nor Mandy and her family in Ireland. They will move together to a new country, as yet undecided. &quot;New identity,&quot; Louise says. &quot;Change our appearance, change our names, move somewhere else, whatever. If you want to get lost, you can get lost.&quot; Just before going to press, I receive an email from Rachel Neustadt in Russia. While Ilya has argued in court that the boys are frightened of\u00a0London and do not want to live with their mother, the court has ruled that they should be returned to the UK: a landmark decision. Ilya\u00a0has 15 days to appeal. Rachel&apos;s relief is palpable, as is her fear. &quot;I\u00a0wish I could hold my sons in my arms right now, but it is still unclear how to gain access to them. Today is Daniel Jakob&apos;s half-birthday \u2013 he&apos;s seven and a half. We\u00a0have not reached the end of this nightmare, but today&apos;s decision was crucial. I\u00a0have no idea, nor do I want to imagine, how much longer this might take. I suspect we have a\u00a0difficult road ahead of us.&quot; \u2022 To contact Reunite, call 01162 555345 or go to reunite.org.

The first \u2013 white with silver wheels \u2013 crashes through in reverse, while the second \u2013 a black car with a woman at the wheel \u2013 drives head on. The white car pauses briefly as a man in a black bodysuit and balaclava jumps out before the driver hits the gas again. You have to imagine the screeching of tyres as they speed on through the public atrium and reverse the car into the door of the Graff jewellery store. The man in black runs into the shop and another joins him; both are carrying revolvers in one hand and small pickaxes in the other, and have pouches attached to their bodies. The store attendants run for their lives and the men calmly, systematically, start to break through display cases. At each one they seem to smash the glass and grab the jewels in one smooth move. You assume they have done this before. While the security footage resembles a\u00a0movie, really it&apos;s just a typical night&apos;s work for the Pink Panthers \u2013 the most successful diamond-thieving gang in history. At the last count they had committed 341 armed robberies and aggravated thefts around the world, with an estimated value of stolen goods of \u00a4330m. Their exploits have become the stuff of legend, with jobs ranging from London to Tokyo, Geneva to Singapore. The gang, a\u00a0loosely affiliated network of an estimated 200 to 220 people, pull off jobs with precision and style, dressing as golfers for one job, Hawaiian tourists for another, workmen for one more. They can escape by speedboat, scooter or bicycle depending on the location, and take full advantage of soft borders and false documents. They know that as long as they get back home \u2013 to various Balkan countries \u2013 they will be safe, protected by either corrupt or hopeless officials. The Dubai robbery was stunning for the amount they stole ($3.4m), the time it took (in 170 seconds they had left the store, jumped back in their cars and left the building), and the precision of their planning. The gang only drives Audis \u2013 you can&apos;t do a robbery driving a car you don&apos;t know; it&apos;s too risky. But Audi was a make virtually unknown in the Middle East in 2007 and getaway cars have to be found and stolen just hours before a robbery. The S8 is the brand&apos;s flagship high-performing car: so rare was the model in Dubai that one of the cars was stolen in the neighbouring emirate of Abu Dhabi and driven across the border. The thieves reverse-rammed the car so the airbag wouldn&apos;t open on impact and so that the car was in the perfect position to drive away. They planned the timing of the heist (9pm) at the end of the rush hour, knowing that when they fled down the highway the lanes in the opposite direction \u2013 from where the police would come \u2013 would be jammed. They drove to a deserted, unlit patch of land between two mansions \u2013 just minutes away from the royal palace \u2013 and set fire to the two cars. In a now completely unknown third car, they drove calmly into the night with their multimillion-dollar booty. So who are the Pink Panthers? I have been trying to answer that question for three years, since I first arrived in Belgrade to shoot a documentary on them. Armed with two phone numbers, I travelled down to Podgorica, the capital of Montenegro, to try to track them down. My contact had arranged various introductions, and I was told to go alone and with no mobile phone to a deserted war memorial on the outskirts of town. It was a good spot for a meeting: private, discreet, hidden by trees. As I waited, I realised it was also a good spot for a drug deal, a heist or a murder, which was when I got nervous. A beaten-up blue Peugeot estate pulled up alongside me. &quot;Please excuse my car,&quot; said a man in perfect English. &quot;We like to travel quietly down here.&quot; This was Novak, a tall man in his 50s wearing white trousers, a pink polo shirt and a gold tooth. I got into the car and we drove to a local bar. He explained he was an alarms and electrics specialist for the Pink Panthers. He&apos;d been looking forward to meeting me, he said; he loved journalism \u2013 he had been a local fixer for newspaper hacks during the wars of the 1990s. He smuggled reporters in, got them false documents and researched their stories. It was the perfect training ground for his current work: strategic thinking, adrenalin, cash, danger. And also, according to Novak, a moral high ground. There are &quot;no victims to what we do&quot;, Novak told me. &quot;We scare people but we do not hurt them. We only take expensive things from rich people.&quot; It&apos;s the mythology the Pink Panthers try to promote, and he has a point: despite the fact that they terrify the life out of people working in the shop, until last year no one had been seriously injured in a Pink Panthers robbery.     Daylight robbers: (from left) suspects in the Dubai robbery Dusko Poznan, Bojana Mitic and Milan Ljepoja.  Photograph: Observer    My meeting with NOVAK opens doors. A few weeks later I meet Mike at a bar on the coast in the height of summer: he is darkly tanned, in navy shorts and boat shoes. Apart from the scars on his arms, he would walk the Croisette well. He, too, is wearing a pink polo shirt. We joke: it&apos;s the equivalent of a carnation on a\u00a0blind date. &quot;I don&apos;t have a badge that says Pink Panther on it,&quot; he chuckles. &quot;It&apos;s nothing to do with us, this name. But I do like those films\u2026 Everyone in the Balkans knows The Pink Panther.&quot; It was the Daily Mail which named the gang after Peter Sellers&apos;s famous Inspector Clouseau film, after two thieves pulled off the largest jewel heist in British history at Graff, the Bond Street jewellers, in 2003. Within days Scotland Yard had identified a Montenegrin man living in Bayswater. When they raided his London flat they found, among other things, a\u00a0blue diamond ring worth $750,000 in a tub of face cream. Mike is a safe-cracker. He learned his trade while apprenticed as a teenager to a Kosovan criminal in Italy. &quot;Mechanical, numerical, digital ones \u2013 I can crack them all. Digital safes are the easiest: you just dust them and see the fingerprints and you know everything. Numerical ones are the hardest: you have to have very good hearing and a very good memory.&quot; Mike is also very paranoid. This, he tells me, is &quot;a hazard of the job&quot;. He pops Valium like aspirin. The mainstream concept of a\u00a0&quot;mafia&quot; is entirely informed by what we know of the Italian families \u2013 a strict hierarchy, a top dog, initiation ceremonies, and a lot of murder. The Pink Panthers are very different. &quot;We are a network of teams working together,&quot; Mike tells me. &quot;As soon as I got involved I\u00a0became part of the network.&quot; The structure is likened by Interpol to al-Qaeda \u2013 the ultimate contemporary crime gang \u2013 in that it is a\u00a0series of cells that come and go overnight, working independently. They share methods, they share contacts and they share origins, but it is to everyone&apos;s advantage that links are thin. &quot;There is an inner circle,&quot; explains Mike, &quot;who have been doing this a long time, and we call each other family, but there are guys who don&apos;t know who their bosses or associates are. You have to be with them a long time dealing with the bigger jobs. You get tips from your supervisor \u2013 but there is also a wider chain of people. You don&apos;t know where you stand in the hierarchy because you never meet the &apos;boss&apos;. There is no &apos;Big Boss&apos;.Everyone has their specific job to do, so we all depend on each other.&quot; You can&apos;t visit the Balkans without recent history looming large. Many, many people are still furious or bitter or heartbroken, scarred by the vicious, terrible wars. Buildings in Belgrade are still bombed out. Factories lie empty, crumbling as poverty-stricken townsfolk remember the golden days of Yugoslavia. The people who aren&apos;t angry are the ones\u00a0who either got away or made money from that period. The Panthers did both. Mike was a classic example. A boy and teenager under Tito, he grew up in a communist dream: enough to eat, a great education, an excellent athlete and proud of his glorious nation. But after the death of Tito in 1980 Yugoslavia began to fall. Republics began to compete, and a very nasty nationalism became the political weapon of choice. &quot;I was ethnically Albanian, but living in Serbia,&quot; says Mike. &quot;The hatred became visible. Just pure hatred. Everything was cracking open.&quot;     To catch a thief: filmmaker Havana Marking in the CCTV room at the Wafi Mall in Dubai. Photograph: Observer    As Yugoslavia collapsed around them, the fate of the nation became apparent: conflict, militias and a total criminalisation of the state. It was the 1992 UN sanctions against Yugoslavia that really determined the fate of the Pink Panthers. Entire industries in Serbia collapsed, creating a generation of people either forced or willing to take part in criminal activities. Once you have to smuggle food, soap or diesel to make life possible, what&apos;s to stop you smuggling arms, drugs and people to make life profitable? It paved the way for the hugely powerful international heroin, sex and gun gangs that still trade today: the small and mostly localised smuggling routes over the mountains, across lakes and between bays became international pathways. A few years later, diamonds joined the routes. I asked people I met in the region what they thought of the gang. And while almost everyone acknowledged that stealing was wrong, the statement was usually followed by a glint in the eye and a sentiment along the lines of: &quot;You have to admit they are good at it.&quot; One man in a marketplace became passionate: &quot;If I was the government, I would encourage the Panthers to go and hit all the foreign jewellers, under one condition: that they bring the booty home!&quot; He saw the robberies as revenge for the Nato bombings and UN sanctions of Serbia in the 1990s \u2013 &quot;England, America, France, Japan\u2026 they ruined this country.&quot; I had asked Mike about women in the gang. They are usually hardly mentioned in\u00a0the reports of the robberies. I had been told by Interpol officers in Belgrade that they were mere eye candy, irrelevant to the actual job. On\u00a0the contrary, Mike said. &quot;Women in the\u00a0Panthers have to be exceptional. We have\u00a0high requirements of them because they have the leading roles, but you can only have one in each gang. She has to be intelligent. She\u00a0has to be beautiful. And she has to love money very much\u2026&quot; And so Mike introduces me to Lela, a past associate and friend of his. She is extremely pretty, in her 40s and dressed in black from head to toe, with a lot of leather and fur. &quot;Not anyone can do this job,&quot; says Lela. &quot;You must be born to do it. The guys do the majority of the job, but they need a\u00a0woman on their team. Without a woman nothing could be done.&quot; Lela&apos;s job was to scout the target shops before a job. She would enter in the guise of a\u00a0customer and furtively examine everything she could. On leaving, she would meet with an artist who would sketch the plan of the shop \u2013 down to the nearest centimetre. &quot;If I made a\u00a0mistake, they would be doomed.&quot; The surveillance could take months, not to mention a lot of money. &quot;She had to be dressed in the most expensive clothes and elegant jewellery,&quot; says Mike. &quot;She had to have her own chauffeur. She had to be like Madonna!&quot; It also required frequent &quot;transformations&quot; for her multiple identities: &quot;Hairdressers would come to my house,&quot; recalls Lela. &quot;I&apos;d be sometimes blonde, sometimes brunette, redhead.&quot; Sounds glamorous, I say. &quot;No,&quot; she shoots back, &quot;I hated it! I felt like I would lose my identity. Like a doll who was experimented on.&quot; Maybe it&apos;s because she&apos;s been unable to tell her friends and family about her work, but our conversation is beginning to feel like a therapy session. She tells me that she later had a nervous breakdown. For Mike and his team, once they have stolen the diamonds, their job is done. The selling and carrying of diamonds is too risky: you have to pass them immediately to a prearranged contact, who will take them across borders to buyers, often in Antwerp. They know who in advance will buy what and for how much. The Pink Panthers receive around 15% of the value, the courier 5%. Then there&apos;s the fence, the man who disguises the diamond, &quot;legalises&quot; it and resells it back into the market. Mr Green, a Bosnian Serb, is a very small man, with none of the swagger of the previous crooks I have met. He is fed up with the Panthers getting the glory. &quot;They just do the street work,&quot; he tells me. &quot;Without people like me they&apos;d be nothing.&quot; He estimates that he receives 30-40% of the diamond&apos;s market value. Mr Green tells me that he grew up a peasant woodcutter and joined the JSO, an elite Serb paramilitary unit. Led by Arkan, a notorious henchman of Slobodan Milosevic, the militia was feared across the region. He shows me his maroon beret with pride and I start to feel uncomfortable. &quot;I wasn&apos;t on the frontline,&quot; he says, &quot;I was more in the background.&quot; This does not mean a back-office job. He was, he explains, &quot;responsible for the liquidations of the terrorists&quot;. He seems unrepentant about his murderous past. He is the most frightening man I have met. Everyone who was in the special forces has &quot;business contacts&quot;, he explains. Those contacts stretched to West Africa, the home of many diamond mines, and to Antwerp, where Mr Green later set up a diamond business. His team re-cut the diamonds and create new certificates of origin, stating that each stolen diamond was mined in Sierra Leone recently. The diamond is usually untraceable. The Kimberley Process Certification System was set up in an attempt to stop the blood diamond trade. &quot;In the end it just made it easier for us: we simply forge those certificates of origin and create a &apos;new&apos; diamond.&quot; The diamonds of very high value will usually make it back into the legal trade &quot;on the hands of brides&quot;, he tells me, but the smaller ones have become the currency of the global black market. &quot;You can have a pocketful of diamonds and buy a boatful of cocaine. Now any cash payment over \u00a415,000 has to be traced electronically \u2013 but who controls diamonds? No one.&quot; Mr Green is right about one thing: the Panthers do get the press. They drive like stunt men. Their robberies resemble movies. But they also get the heat, leaving the big money and the wider criminal networks untouched. The Pink Panthers&apos; crime spree in its current guise of hit and runs took off in 2000, then taking full advantage of the new systems in the diamond trade. And while they could exploit the soft borders of Europe and their own countries&apos; corruption, the Panthers seemed untouchable for a while. It was only when various European police forces, notably in Monaco, Switzerland and France, connected that the Panthers were first thwarted. In 2007 Interpol created the Pink Panther Working Group. For the first time global police forces were able to share and spread their information. The spectacular Dubai robbery of 2007 was one of their first successful cases. The Wafi Mall heist would have been perfect, but for one mistake: when they burned the getaway cars someone forgot to open a\u00a0window. No oxygen means the fire can&apos;t rage as it should and so Dubai police managed to retrieve a good deal of DNA evidence. With the help of Interpol the DNA was traced to Dusko Poznan, a 30-year-old Bosnian and Milan Lepoja, from Montenegro. Both were wanted for heists in Switzerland and Liechtenstein. In 2008 Poznan was caught after a car crash in Monaco, and Ljepoja after a dramatic police chase on the borders of France and Switzerland. Both are now serving sentences in Liechtenstein and awaiting trial for the Wafi Mall heist. The woman who drove the second car is still at large. The unusual level of cooperation from the police forces, which has coincided with a\u00a0political period of cooperation from the Balkans itself, has begun to have an impact. Since 2007, 189 Panthers have been arrested \u2013 59 were caught last year. With Montenegro and Serbia keen to join the EU, it&apos;s no longer safe back home. &quot;It&apos;s much more dangerous,&quot; says Mike. &quot;The police know all the tricks. We live much quieter lives now.&quot; Mike and Lela have both retired. When I went to find Novak again, he had been arrested. And as the more experienced thieves cut their losses and return to the quiet life, police have identified a new generation of thieves taking over. They have none of precision or care associated with the older Panthers. Detective Inspector Jan Glassey of the Swiss Police Intelligence showed me CCTV from a\u00a0recent robbery in Geneva. The thieves enter with much more violence, they don&apos;t have bags, they drop things, they panic and leave their gun on a table. &quot;It is then that accidents happen,&quot; explains Glassey. &quot;That is much more worrying for us.&quot; Indeed the Pink Panthers have now had their first shooting: a policeman was wounded during a chase in Greece last year. Two men and a woman had been surveilling the jewellery store they planned to rob, but the wigs they were wearing aroused the suspicion of a\u00a0police patrol, who stopped them for questioning. They fled the scene, shooting and injuring an officer, and all three were later caught (although the female accomplice \u2013 who turned out to be a former national basketball player \u2013 managed to break out of prison and is still on the run). You wonder what Mike and Lela would make of it \u2013 getting found out because your wigs aren&apos;t convincing enough. The fact that the thieves were not even caught on the job, but a mere recce, suggests that standards are slipping. But as long as Mr Green and his associates are able to pass stolen diamonds off as new, there will remain a currency in demand throughout the criminal world. And somehow, somewhere, people will be trying to get their hands on them.

The fact that he did simply made success at East Lake, which was worth $11.44m (\u00a37.15m), all the sweeter for the Swede. Two years ago Stenson had cause to wonder where it had all gone wrong while educated golfing observers were bemused by his slip outside the top 200 players in the world. Even in June, at the time of this year&apos;s Scottish Open, Stenson was 31st in those rankings. On Monday morning Stenson should be confirmed as currently the fourth best golfer in the world. A place in the European Ryder Cup team for next year&apos;s meeting with the United States at Gleneagles is all but assured. The level of congratulations bestowed on him for his triumph in Georgia illustrated the esteem Stenson is held in by fellow players and fans alike. Justin Rose was among those who hung around the 18th green to congratulate the first ever European winner of the FedEx Cup. If success in both the Tour Championship and FedEx Cup confirmed Stenson&apos;s professional redemption, there was an unavoidable personal element to the 37-year-old claiming the most lucrative prize in golf, not to mention a Nike sponsorship deal. Stenson, after all, was a high-profile victim of the Allen Stanford fraud scandal. He has always, understandably, been very reluctant to discuss any details and could never be classed anywhere near a poverty line but the received wisdom is that Stenson lost millions in savings and investments. It can hardly be viewed as coincidence that his form took a quick tumble in the aftermath of that horrid affair. In proving that maybe karma does exist, Stenson is now having the time of his life as Stanford continues a life-long prison sentence. &quot;It just shows you should never give up, keep trying hard and good things will happen,&quot; said Stenson. &quot;I have come back from slumps twice in my career.&quot; He offered typical humour to describe precision bunker shots on the 71st and 72nd holes. &quot;I used to live in Dubai. My sand game is quite good.&quot; Starting from a position of three clear of the field on Sunday, some Stenson nerves would have been fully understandable. There was little sign of that at all, however, as he reached the turn in one under par. By the time he sauntered on to the 18th tee, Stenson held a three-shot lead which ultimately proved his margin of victory over Steve Stricker and Jordan Spieth. Stenson did not display any of his heroics of the opening three days in signing off with a 68. He did not have to. &quot;My first two and a half rounds were incredible, really, tee to green,&quot; Stenson said. &quot;It was tougher out there today but I managed to hang in.&quot; For Spieth, the rapid rise to the summit of world golf continues apace. He had a fourth-round 64 at East Lake to endorse further his status as the brightest young talent in the game. &quot;It has been a dream come true,&quot; admitted the 20-year-old Spieth. The lingering image of Tiger Woods from East Lake was not related to on-course brilliance but instead the world No1&apos;s two young children greeting him after the completion of round four. The appearance of Charlie and Sam at events Woods plays in has become a more regular feature this year than ever before. &quot;That&apos;s what life&apos;s all about,&quot; said Woods. &quot;There are more important things in life than hitting a little round ball and putting it in a gopher hole.&quot; Woods finished level par at the Tour Championship, thereby failing to add to his five wins in 2013. Those earlier successes, it seems, have left him with a perfectly content state of mind. &quot;I&apos;m very satisfied,&quot; he added. &quot;I had a number of chances to win some tournaments. I won five, which is, I think, a pretty good year.&quot; Woods also spoke of how happy he was for Stenson. He was far from alone.

Modern day slavery is rampant across the country. If you visit the Souq's on Bank street on a Friday, one can see these laborers and get a first hand response on how they have been abused for years. The guttwrenching part is, none, not even ground breaking evidence nor reports by the International media is going to change the kafala system, the single cause of modern day slavery!      jubbah said:  I work in the Middle East, and see these types of men every day. They chop down trees with axes in 40c heat. They are sent to fix plumbing with a tool kit consisting of nothing more than a spanner and hammer. They sit or sleep beneath blue tarps during tea breaks, visibly baking in the heat \u2026 many expats try to help these poor men by giving them food and water, paying for their bread and juice at the checkout, letting them wash our cars for a few quid, handing them our belongings when we leave, etc. Guilt money? You could say that. But my motivation to come here is the same as theirs. I come from a country that has no work for me.   arjanvogt chimed in on the role of the expat community:  It has always appeared to me that expats consider themselves a different species from immigrants \u2026 they live in their own communities, send their kids to international schools, shop in their own shops \u2026 I am speaking from experience, as someone who has lived in different countries. As a nurse/nursing manager, I have always fallen between the expat and legal immigrant community, a position I am happy with.   Chewda told us about recent wage protests in Qatar:  Some Qatar schools have seen recent industrial action by south asian drivers of a local bus firm protesting about non-payment of wages and wage inequality against regional Arabs with the same jobs. Although their fate is not clear. It is believed all were arrested and are about to be deported   jackmack116a\u2019s comment highlighted the need for migrant workers in Qatar:   The Government&apos;s Qatarisation scheme (to make companies employ up to 10% Qataris) has failed abysmally. So the country will continue to need to employ expats and migrant workers probably for the next 100 years. But what happens when people stop going there because of this modern day equivalent of slavery?   Reaction from Nepal:  Pokhra said:   There are people and organisations fighting against this terrible exploitation. Unfortunately corruption starts in Nepal and Qatar conveniently overlooks how the workers were recruited and how they arrived in country - they are debt bonded by dishonest and corrupt agents before leaving home with debts equaling several times the national average wage borrowed at extortionate rates.Qatar then compounds the misery for gain.   ggguardian said:   Although I hated FIFA&apos;s decision to award 2022 world cup to Qatar, I felt it would be a good thing for Nepal because of increased demands to expand the infrastructure in the region. Our country has been marred with political instability and corruption, and employment opportunities within the country are rare. A major part of our country&apos;s economy is reliant upon remittances received from immigrant workers. As a Nepali citizen, I was aware of the discrimination and harassment immigrant workers faced there but I did not know the severity of this problem \u2026 our government agencies and these consulting companies and recruiters are not held accountable \u2026. Government officials in both countries could do so much to avoid this gross violation of labor and human rights. I do not want my country to wait for Qatari administration to take action because it is never going to happen.              AmitRijal    25 September 2013 8:39pm   This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate It's a shame. Yes, not that much new story for Nepalese people but someone should have shouted it to the rest of the world, seems this story is a bit of it. Nepal is itself in a transition of political instability so from its weakening status and the problematic scene of diplomatic relation, the migrant workers from Nepal are in danger, and in life threatening stage. But, in the name of development, no nation can exploit any workers from the world, they should be sorry for it.And thanks for the revealing it to the rest :)             Guardian contributor     PetePattisson    25 September 2013 7:06pm   This comment has been chosen by Guardian staff because it contributes to the debate You raise a good point. In many cases working conditions, in terms of health and safety on a building site, are worse in Nepal than Qatar, BUT the workers in Nepal do not generally have huge debts they must repay, they have not been deceived about the work they have signed up for, they are always free to leave and find another job, and they are not living in appalling conditions. But it's complicated of course - the main reason Nepalese look abroad for jobs is because there just aren't enough in Nepal. Some figures suggest there is 40% youth unemployment here.      Others discussed the implications for the 2022 World Cup:  jackmack116a said:   Of course the plight of migrant workers in places like Qatar, Dubai etc etc is not new and it is very easy and convenient for us westerners to park it at the back of our minds but I think the media has a duty to remind us every so often that exploitation/slavery or whatever you want to call it, hasn&apos;t gone away. So maybe it&apos;s not new, but it is still nonetheless an important issue and because of the hullabaloo over Qatar getting the World Cup, it&apos;s a story that every footballing nation should have an interest in.   riddlemestupid raised an interesting point about the capacity of countries to host big tournaments:   So only developed countries should host it? I&apos;m South African &amp; the World Cup was one of the highlights of my life. It brought people from all walks of life together &amp; was an event that unified all the races here. It was a welcome change to my daily life which in SA unfortunately, is either black or white. Having said that though, the expense of the stadiums together with the massive construction scandal recently uncovered is a blight. That money could have been spent on the upliftment of the poor via infrastructure &amp; social projects. But, on the other hand, the transport infrastructure created &amp; upgraded is useful for all of us. On balance though, I&apos;m glad we hosted.   And some turned their attention to broader problems around modern-day slavery:  Sandrovic said:   This is a worldwide problem. The exact same thing happens to migrant workers from Uzbekistan, North Korea, Tadjikistan working in Russia, for example. The problem is all the disparities in the world economic system, not just labour markets - disparities artificially created and continued by the existing order enforced by the World Trade Organisation. Change must come from the top down, not from the bottom up.   notmuch said:   The brokers are the ones that are making money by lying and selling bogus contracts to people who have sold land to try and make a living. The worker thinks he&apos;s going to work in a specific trade and is too good to do manual labour the foreman/manager has seen it all before and systematically holds back payment knowing it will have an impact on the workers family and the worker has no choice but to work as a labourer.

Is he your favourite Doctor or just an incarnation that you had a fondness for? I think it took the publishers (Puffin) quite a while to sort out all the practical issues surrounding this series, the rights and permissions and agreements and deals with all the various parties involved - the Doctor Who people, the BBC people, the ebook people etc. etc. etc. The world of Who is very complex. And because the ebook series had been so surrounded in secrecy they couldn&apos;t talk to any authors about writing for it before all the deals were in place. I was one of a group of authors they eventually talked to about kicking the series off, but I didn&apos;t have a fully formed idea for a story at that point and was in the thick of it working on other stuff with deadlines to meet. I would have loved to write the William Hartnell story and kick off the series, but the brilliant Eoin Colfer beat me to it and got the gig. And I really think he did in some style. That left two other doctors who I wanted to write \u2013 Tom Baker and Christopher Ecclestone, but because I had delayed so long in making a decision, TB had also been snapped up. Philip Reeve did a great job on that story (I loved the idea of a wooden space station), and as he&apos;s my favourite children&apos;s author I didn&apos;t hold a grudge, plus it meant that I had a lot more time and could concentrate on getting Ecclestone right. I was actually really pleased to be allowed to do him in the end. In many ways, after William Hartnell, Ecclestone was the most important of the doctors. Coming back after a hiatus of several years was a big challenge and a big risk, but the combination of a well respected writer in Russell T Davies and a well respected actor in Christopher Ecclestone worked brilliantly. I think Ecclestone was an inspired choice and he gave the series enormous authority. For most modern kids he would have been their first experience of the Doctor and their introduction to this amazing world. So it needed to be good.  I really wanted to try and do justice to Russell and what he achieved. I wanted to highlight some of the things that I think he did so cleverly when he brought the series back and pay homage to him. He knew he had to appeal to diehard, old school, Doctor Who fans, he had to appeal to all the sci-fi freaks, he had to appeal to young boys and their mums and dads, and had to appeal to girls as well. He also had to draw in those people who might think they didn&apos;t like Doctor Who or had no interest in sci-fi. So it was important to get a balance between the fantasy, the science, the comedy and the drama without alienating anyone. The character of Rose was the key to this. She was hugely important in tying it all together, giving it a human face and rooting it firmly in family drama. My story is kind of about why the Doctor chose her. Series One of Doctor Who, the only series that Christopher Eccleston featured in, was largely set on Earth and not alien planets like other incarnations of the time traveller. Why did you (in part) set The Beast of Babylon on another world?  There were two reasons that Russell had to set the series largely on earth. One is obviously budget. It&apos;s much cheaper to film in Wales than on the moon. But the other was that, as I said, he wanted to make the series accessible and not scare people off. He wanted to say \u2013 &quot;Look, if you enjoy the likes of (for want of a better example) Coronation Street, you will also enjoy this. It&apos;s not weird and scary. It&apos;s about real people with real human emotions.&quot; That being said, the second episode did take place on a space station packed full of crazy aliens so he could say to the scifi community \u2013 &quot;Look, we&apos;re going to keep you happy, too\u2026&quot; And in the third ep they went back in time. In those opening episodes Russell firmly nailed his colours to the mast.  I had no budgetary restrictions for my story and I reckoned that as I was writing a book I should do some things that you couldn&apos;t do on screen, so, as well as having an entire Babylonian army there is a central twist in my story that is very literary and could only work in a book. I tried to pack as much into it as I could in its relatively short space without it becoming confusing. How much research did you have to do when writing The Beast of Babylon? Did you find any specific stories that you took direct inspiration from and do you have a favourite Ninth Doctor story? I obviously went back and rewatched that first series with Christopher Ecclestone, to remind myself of how it was. A lot has happened since then - we&apos;ve had two more doctors with another two on the way and it was fascinating to watch what Russell did all that time ago and how confident and clever it all was and how it&apos;s all developed since. I also wanted to try and remind myself of how Ecclestone performed so that I could make the doctor and my story as true to &apos;life&apos; as possible and. And, as my story takes place during that very first episode (Rose), I obviously looked at the opener very closely. On top of that I had a lot of fun researching ancient Babylonian history, astronomy and astrology. If I&apos;m ever writing something fantastical I always make sure it&apos;s grounded in reality. I&apos;d always though that the creatures that make up the signs of the zodiac (which come from ancient Babylon) would make a great team of Doctor Who monsters. When did you start watching the show? And who was &apos;your Doctor&apos;? I am quite old, so I started watching the series when William Hartnell was the Doctor. My memory is pretty hazy but I do vaguely remember watching the ancient black-and-white episodes with him. I can more clearly remember some of Patrick Troughton&apos;s episodes - him prancing abut with his flute or whistle of whatever it was, the Yetis... And then I watched it through the Pertwee years, but my own personal favourite Doctor was Tom Baker. He had such a fantastic otherworldly presence and managed to be funny and serious and scary all at the same time (he&apos;s the same in real life as well.) I was such a fan of his that when we needed a character to essentially play God in the Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer version of Randall And Hopkirk Deceased there was only one man I wanted for the job and was very lucky to get him. As a result I ended up making an appearance on his episode of This Is Your Life - something I never dreamt I would do as a kid. It was huge fun and slightly surreal at the same time If you had a TARDIS, where would you travel to, and what would you do when you got there? Well to travel back to any time in the past would be amazing. I was looking at some photographs of me and my friends from the 80s the other day and it looked like another world. We forget how much has changed and how quickly things change.  To go the back to the 60s and see what the world was like when I was growing up and see myself and my family would be amazing. I also love medieval history and it would be a blast to go back and watch the battle of Agincourt. But if I had to choose one place to go it would have to be to the other side of the universe. Statistically there is intelligent life somewhere out there, wouldn&apos;t it be mind-blowing to go and take a look at it? What was your favourite novel when you were young? I used to love reading Greek myths and legends, Viking myths and legends, stories about King Arthur and Robin Hood\u2026 anything, really, in which the hero had a sword. Then I got into Lord of The Rings, but the book(s) I was most obsessed with as a teenager were the Gormenghast trilogy by Mervyn Peake. They asked me to be in the TV adaptation a few years ago but I was too busy filming something else, so couldn&apos;t do it \u2013 which was a real shame. Is there any piece of advice you could give to young aspiring writers? Write, write, write, write, write\u2026 and read, read, read, read, read\u2026 Oh yes, and enjoy it. Where is the weirdest place you&apos;ve been to? What did you do there? A couple of years ago I went to Dubai for a literary festival. It was definitely the weirdest place I&apos;ve ever been. Like something out of a science fiction film. It really was like visiting a city on the moon or Mars or something. It has the tallest building in the world \u2013 which itself looks like something from a sci-fi illustration - and from the top of it you can look out and there&apos;s this city, Dubai laid out below you as if from an aeroplane. It&apos;s not very large and has every type of architecture you can imagine, plus those extraordinary man-made islands in the shape of palm trees. The place might as well have a dome over the top of it to complete the sci-fi picture. It spreads out for a few streets and then just stops dead - after that it&apos;s desert as far as you can see on one side and ocean on the other. It&apos;s like its just been dropped there. It really reminded of one of those sci-fi stories where they take a representative of every country and race on earth and send them in a rocket to a city on another planet.  If you had to travel with one companion from Doctor Who, whom would you choose? Well, just as Tom Baker was my favourite Doctor, Elisabeth Sladen was my favourite companion. I was in love with Sarah Jane when I was a teenager and couldn&apos;t wait for an episode where she climbed up a ladder wearing hot pants (yes, I was very shallow as a teenager). It was so sad when she died but I was very glad that she&apos;d had such a fantastic come back with her own series and had been recognised for being such a great companion. And lastly, what do you think of Peter Capaldi being cast as the Twelfth Doctor? I think it&apos;s a stroke of genius. Steven Moffat must still be chuckling at his coup. Everybody was predicting they would hire some even younger and sexier man, or a woman or a black actor, what nobody predicted was that they would go for someone older and craggier and more Hartnell-esque. Moffat has gone right back to basics and chosen us an older, wiser, more serious Doctor Who with that stern Godlike quality that William Hartnell had. He might even get scary again. I think there will be some fun and games ahead.", "title": "Charlie Higson: 'Statistically there is intelligent life somewhere out there...'", "sentences": ["A couple of years ago I went to Dubai for a literary festival.", "It has the tallest building in the world \u2013 which itself looks like something from a sci-fi illustration - and from the top of it you can look out and there&apos;s this city, Dubai laid out below you as if from an aeroplane."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-27T09:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/29/sheikh-mohammed-inquiry-drugs-dubai", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Godolphin", "Drugs in sport", "British Horseracing Authority", "Sport", "Stansted airport"], "article": "An illegal shipment of unlicensed veterinary goods was seized from a Dubai government private jet by UK authorities at Stansted airport earlier this year, causing Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UK&apos;s leading owner of racehorses, to launch an internal investigation into his equine operations. Thousands of pounds worth of unlicensed products \u2013 including steroidal injections, anaesthetics and anti-inflammatories that have been described as &quot;potentially toxic and dangerous to horses&quot; \u2013 were seized and destroyed by the UK Border Agency and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate on 3 May at 7pm following the arrival of a Dubai Royal Air Wing flight. Sheikh Mohammed is monarch of the gulf emirate, as well as the owner of Godolphin, the country&apos;s largest Flat racing operation. Her Highness Princess Haya, the sheikh&apos;s junior wife and president of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports, has been ordered to conduct a thorough investigation into the seizure at the airport and a separate raid by the VMD last month at Moorley Farm in Newmarket, a location owned by his Darley Management operation, where a number of similar products were found. The Guardian understands Sheikh Mohammed is extremely concerned at the development which comes only months after his Godolphin thoroughbred operation was rocked by the biggest doping scandal in racing history. The shipment seized at Stansted, reportedly labelled incorrectly as &quot;horse tack&quot;, did not include any anabolic steroids. However, there were significant quantities of goods understood to be for use on endurance horses and the VMD, in conjunction with the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, is investigating the matter. A full inventory of the seized products has been seen by the Guardian and forwarded to Godolphin and the British Horseracing Authority. Neither would confirm its accuracy. A spokesman for Princess Haya told the Guardian: &quot;Nobody seems to know in the organisation who is buying what or where. That&apos;s one of the reforms that they want in place. We&apos;re trying to find out what happened, why it happened and to make sure it doesn&apos;t happen again.&quot; Keith Chandler, the president of the British Equine Veterinary Association, said some of the products seized at Stansted were potentially dangerous to horses and should be &quot;kept under lock and key in a safe&quot;, while the VMD stated that the medicines &quot;were not authorised in the UK and had not been imported in accordance with the regulations&quot;. Chandler said: &quot;Some of these medicines are not only toxic if they are misused but they are potentially dangerous to the horses. They really are medicines that should not be on the premises of any horse owner, no matter how experienced. &quot;They definitely should not, under absolutely no circumstances whatsoever, be found on an owner&apos;s premises. There are powerful sedatives and anaesthetics on the list, there are powerful painkillers and one of the products is toxic and dangerous to humans as well. They are clearly being used to treat and medicate horses.&quot; Among the products seized at Stansted were 100 Tildren injections, a substance that is used by vets for horses with bone problems. &quot;This is not just a matter of importing a few horse warmers, this was a considerable operation in terms of importing medicines,&quot; Chandler said. &quot;These medicines should be kept under lock and key in a safe.&quot; Princess Haya&apos;s spokesman insisted that Sheikh Mohammed was unaware of the presence of the pharmaceuticals on the flight from Dubai on 3 May or the raid at Moorley Farm until now. &quot;I can assure you that Sheikh Mohammed was not aware of any such products in the cargo of any Dubai Royal Air Wing flight into Stansted on that date,&quot; he said. It is the second time this year that Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s operations have been engulfed in controversy. In April the disgraced former Godolphin trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni was banned for eight years by the BHA after using anabolic steroids on 22 racehorses at Moulton Paddocks in Newmarket. The BHA insists the Stansted seizure was not related to racing, citing assurances given by the VMD. Sheikh Mohammed said he was &quot;appalled and angered&quot; by Zarooni&apos;s actions, with a swiftly completed BHA report declaring that the trainer acted &quot;autonomously&quot; and that the doping programme was the work of a rogue individual rather than a collective operation. Princess Haya, who will step down as president of the FEI in November 2014 after the conclusion of her second four-year term in the role, sent out a directive on 12 September to the major components of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s equine operation, including Darley and Godolphin, to establish a centralised auditing system in order to maintain control over the purchase and movement of veterinary goods. On Tuesday she will meeton Tuesday Lord Stevens, the former Metropolitan police chief who also headed the FEI Clean Sport Commission, to discuss her investigation. On 7 August the VMD, an agency within the government&apos;s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, seized 124 products from Moorley Farm in Newmarket. Jaume Punti Dachs, a Spanish endurance trainer based at the stable who has trained horses for Sheikh Mohammed and is also a member of the FEI endurance committee, said there was no &quot;wilful or careless wrongdoing at his yard&quot; and that the products were &quot;all substances you can buy in the UK&quot;. However, in a directive seen by the Guardian, Princess Haya has called on all individuals at various organisations within the hierarchy of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s endurance and racing structure &quot;to ensure that there is no breach of regulations&quot;. She wrote: &quot;I wish for all managers to accept the responsibilities that their position bestows on them and to ensure that all efforts are made to protect the good name of the Maktoum family at all times.&quot; Michele Verroken, the director of Sporting Integrity and former head of ethics at UK Anti-Doping, believes Princess Haya must find out which members of the Sheikh&apos;s organisation were responsible for the infringement and &quot;hold them accountable&quot;. She said: &quot;This reminds us that continued vigilance to counter illegal importation is essential to prevent sport being corrupted. Customs and border agencies make a major contribution to the enforcement of sports&apos; rules as well as national laws. &quot;As president of the FEI, Princess Haya, has an important role to pursue the truth, to find who is responsible and to hold them accountable.&quot; The BHA insists there is no link between the seizure at either Stansted or Moorley Farm and the racing industry. Adam Brickell, the BHA&apos;s director of integrity, legal and risk, said: &quot;The BHA was notified of the seizure of veterinary care products, some of which are not licensed for use in the UK. Defra have confirmed to the BHA that they consider there to be no link between the seizure and the racing industry and that the products were not intended for use on thoroughbreds.&quot;", "title": "Sheikh Mohammed starts inquiry after police seize drugs from Dubai jet", "sentences": ["An illegal shipment of unlicensed veterinary goods was seized from a Dubai government private jet by UK authorities at Stansted airport earlier this year, causing Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, the UK&apos;s leading owner of racehorses, to launch an internal investigation into his equine operations.", "Thousands of pounds worth of unlicensed products \u2013 including steroidal injections, anaesthetics and anti-inflammatories that have been described as &quot;potentially toxic and dangerous to horses&quot; \u2013 were seized and destroyed by the UK Border Agency and the Veterinary Medicines Directorate on 3 May at 7pm following the arrival of a Dubai Royal Air Wing flight.", "&quot;These medicines should be kept under lock and key in a safe.&quot; Princess Haya&apos;s spokesman insisted that Sheikh Mohammed was unaware of the presence of the pharmaceuticals on the flight from Dubai on 3 May or the raid at Moorley Farm until now.", "&quot;I can assure you that Sheikh Mohammed was not aware of any such products in the cargo of any Dubai Royal Air Wing flight into Stansted on that date,&quot; he said."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-29T18:04:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/29/sheikh-mohammed-grim-year-godolphin", "tags": ["Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Godolphin", "Horse racing", "Drugs in sport", "Sport"], "article": "Sheikh Mohammed was caught up in the euphoria of Dawn Approach&apos;s victory in the 2,000 Guineas when Clare Balding coaxed him into a live TV interview on 4 May. &quot;I always face certain \u2026 challenges,&quot; he told the Channel 4 presenter, speaking in the aftermath of the biggest doping scandal in racing history that rocked his Godolphin thoroughbred operation to its very core. Just 24 hours earlier a shipment of veterinary goods flown in by a Dubai Air Wing jet had been seized and destroyed at Stansted Airport, 30 miles from Newmarket. The sheikh quickly receded into his entourage when Balding pressed him on the British Horseracing Authority&apos;s decision to ban his former trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni for eight years following his use of anabolic steroids on a total of 22 Godolphin horses. However, five months later his equine operations face further serious questions around doping controls. The Veterinary Medicines Directorate, which made the seizure at Stansted along with UK Border Force and a later raid on Moorley Farm where similar products were found, reportedly acted on prior intelligence. An investigation is continuing but the intended destination of the drugs found at Stansted has yet to be confirmed. The seizure was recorded at 7pm on Friday 3 May, from a private jet. Four private aircraft landed at Stansted on that day and a Border Force spokesman confirmed to the Guardian that the seizure in question was made on a plane that departed from Dubai. It is not known whether Sheikh Mohammed was on board that flight but a spokesman for his junior wife, Princess Haya, insisted the Sheikh knew nothing of the seizure until recently. The BHA remains confident that the finds by the VMD are unrelated to racing and not connected to the training or upkeep of any thoroughbreds. The authority&apos;s response to the Stansted and Moorley seizures was swift and any potential link to racing was quickly denied. Indeed, there is no connection between the illegal shipment at Stansted and the substances used by Zarooni to enhance the performance of racehorses. The trainer was found guilty of using ethylestranol and stanozolol on a number of horses, having sourced the steroids in Dubai and brought them to Britain himself. The products seized at Stansted included certain drugs that are available legally across the world. However, some were brought in significant quantities and were destroyed, said the VMD, &quot;because they were not authorised in the UK&quot;. A source close to Princess Haya, who Sheikh Mohammed has tasked with investigating the circumstances surrounding both the Stansted seizure and a separate raid last month by the VMD at Moorley Farm near Newmarket, claims she is furious at the developments and concerned for her family&apos;s reputation. Her spokesman stated that no one within Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s operation has been contacted by the VMD since the seizure but blamed the drugs&apos; presence on the plane on &quot;an internal reporting error&quot;. A BHA report in June found Zarooni was acting on his own and not under instruction from anyone within the Godolphin hierarchy. However, the two latest incidents suggest that there was either an ignorance of Britain&apos;s licensing rules for the use of veterinary products or a disregard of them. The goods seized at Stansted were incorrectly labelled as &quot;horse tack&quot; and destroyed following the seizure and it is the administration of the powerful sedatives, anaesthetics and anti-inflammatories that raises questions. The Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, who have been liaising with the VMD throughout its continuing investigation into the seizure, is concerned at the possibility that vets operating without a licence may have been intending to use the products on horses. A spokesman said earlier this month: &quot;If an unregistered vet, for example, an overseas vet, or other person has been involved, there could be a breach of the Veterinary Surgeons Act and we would support any police investigations.&quot; It is unknown whether the seizure at Stansted is directly linked to the raid at Moorley Farm last month, when 124 banned products were found by the VMD. The site is understood to be used for Dubai-based endurance horses during the summer, while a number of similar substances that were found on the farm were also seized at the airport. The Spanish endurance horse trainer Jaume Punti Dachs self-published a list of the products that were seized at Moorley Farm and insisted it was a routine visit from the VMD. Punti Dachs, who competed at the European Endurance Championships earlier this month and won the individual category on his nine-year-old stallion Quran El Ulm, is a member of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports&apos; endurance committee. Princess Haya is the FEI&apos;s current president. Since learning of the incidents at Stansted and Moorley Farm, Princess Haya has launched an internal investigation to ascertain how and why these breaches of the regulations were allowed to happen. In a directive to staff, she wrote: &quot;All horse medications destined for import or export, regardless of ownership, have to be registered and authorised at the intended destination.&quot; The statement from her spokesman that &quot;nobody in the organisation seems to know who is buying what or where&quot; raises serious questions about the entire operation, and only a thorough investigation will clear the uncertainty.", "title": "Sheikh Mohammed hit by new blow in grim year for Godolphin ruler", "sentences": ["Just 24 hours earlier a shipment of veterinary goods flown in by a Dubai Air Wing jet had been seized and destroyed at Stansted Airport, 30 miles from Newmarket.", "Four private aircraft landed at Stansted on that day and a Border Force spokesman confirmed to the Guardian that the seizure in question was made on a plane that departed from Dubai.", "The trainer was found guilty of using ethylestranol and stanozolol on a number of horses, having sourced the steroids in Dubai and brought them to Britain himself.", "The site is understood to be used for Dubai-based endurance horses during the summer, while a number of similar substances that were found on the farm were also seized at the airport."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-29T18:14:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/sep/29/bha-sheikh-mohammed-drugs", "tags": ["Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Godolphin", "British Horseracing Authority", "Horse racing", "Drugs in sport", "Sport"], "article": "When it emerged earlier this month that 124 illegally imported veterinary products had been seized in a raid at a property in Newmarket owned by the world&apos;s most powerful racehorse owner, the British Horseracing Authority appeared adamant it had nothing to do with them. &quot;This is a matter for Defra [the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, which conducted the raid],&quot; a BHA spokesman said. &quot;In the view of Defra, there is no link between the seizure and the racing industry and the products were not intended for use on thoroughbreds.&quot; Even then, it seemed quite casual, not least in the context of the Godolphin doping scandal which broke in April. The horses which were found to have been doped with anabolic steroids by Mahmood al-Zarooni, including Encke, a Classic winner, are still serving their six-month bans from the sport. The account given by the BHA, which ejected Zarooni from racing with what felt like extraordinary speed a few days after the first positive tests at his stable, offers a vague and scarcely credible account of how he could have acquired industrial quantities of banned steroids. Nor has it produced a satisfactory explanation of how he then managed, with the help of three junior staff, to dope at least 22 of his horses, and probably more, on a near-daily basis without anyone else realising what was happening. Zarooni did all this, apparently, while also spending all but a few days of the winter in Dubai. Now, as it becomes clear that the structures and accountability in Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s endurance horse operation leave a lot to be desired, the BHA&apos;s breezy dismissal of any possible link with the racing side of the Sheikh&apos;s equine interests appears unwise at best. If, to quote a spokesman for Princess Haya, the International Federation of Equestrian Sports president, &quot;nobody seems to know in the organisation who is buying what or where&quot;, then is it not at least possible that Sheikh Mohammed and his senior employees might have taken their eyes off the ball in the much larger thoroughbred operation too? It is surely a possibility which any regulator should have considered before making what feels like a snap judgment about whether or not such a major seizure of unlicensed drugs at a Sheikh Mohammed-owned property and, as revealed by the Guardian on Monday, a second large seizure of similar drugs from a Dubai government jet, really has &quot;nothing to do with racing&quot;. There are obvious echoes here of the situation at Moulton Paddocks after all, where nobody noticed or suspected what Zarooni was up to. There have been crossing-points between endurance racing and thoroughbred racing before, the most obvious being a man called Mubarak bin Shafya, who trained two big winners on the Dubai World Cup card in 2009 and was subsequently banned for two years from endurance racing after one of his horses tested positive for stanozolol, an anabolic steroid. Zarooni spent a year as Shafya&apos;s assistant before taking over at Moulton Paddocks, where he subsequently used stanozolol to dope the male horses in the stable, including Encke. As evidence of lax procedures and management failure in Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s global operations grows, it seems ever more bizarre that the BHA conducted its inquiry into Zarooni backwards: ban him first, then investigate. The BHA did not seek to take evidence from the Sheikh but relied instead on Godolphin&apos;s racing manager, Simon Crisford. It also tried to track down Zarooni for a further interview, not least because seven of the dopings, including Encke, emerged only after he had been banned for eight years for the initial 15 offences. Since his career was already in ruins and he had nothing \u2013 a reduced penalty, for instance \u2013 to gain by co-operating, Zarooni declined to pick up the phone. So far the only person from outside Godolphin who is known to have addressed Sheikh Mohammed directly on the subject is Clare Balding, whose conversation with the ruler of Dubai on Guineas day at Newmarket was terminated the instant she mentioned Moulton Paddocks. The BHA&apos;s apparent reluctance to get any formal input into its investigation from Sheikh Mohammed himself leaves it open to criticism that it is scared of approaching him. He has, after all, invested more money in British racing than any owner in history and the Newmarket economy might well collapse if he took offence and moved his bloodstock elsewhere, much as the Aga Khan did when Aliysa, his 1989 Oaks winner, failed a dope test. No ruler likes to have his authority undermined by potentially embarrassing questions. Unelected rulers tend to like it least of all. Sheikh Mohammed, the monarch and prime minister of Dubai, is a man who gives orders rather than following them. Yet something seems to have gone very wrong in the Sheikh&apos;s endurance racing programme if a large consignment of unlicensed, powerful drugs can arrive marked as &quot;horse tack&quot; on a private flight from Dubai.

Sheikh Mohammed, the monarch of Dubai and a major international figure in horse racing and breeding, has asked his junior wife, Princess Haya, to conduct an investigation into the seizure, which came to light following a similar raid at Moorley Farm in Newmarket last month, a location owned by the sheikh&apos;s Darley Stud. Thousands of pounds worth of anaesthetics, anti-inflammatories, sedatives and bute \u2013 described as &quot;potentially toxic and dangerous to horses&quot; \u2013 were seized and destroyed at Stansted on 3 May following the arrival of a plane belonging to the Dubai Royal Air Wing. The airport is 30 miles from Newmarket, a global centre for thoroughbred racing and the UK headquarters of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s Godolphin operation, the UK&apos;s leading stable. A month earlier in April, Godolphin was embroiled in the biggest doping scandal in racing history, when one of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s leading trainers, Mahmood al-Zarooni, administered anabolic steroids to 22 horses and received an eight-year ban from racing. The British Horseracing Authority, in a report on the affair, said he had acted &quot;autonomously&quot;. The BHA was contacted by the Department for Food, Environment and Rural Affairs about the May incident and is confident that the products seized at Stansted &quot;were not intended for use on thoroughbreds&quot; and that there is no link with racing. A number of the products are widely available and known to be used for the training and upkeep of endurance horses. Keith Chandler, president of the British Equine Veterinary Association, said some of the drugs seized should be &quot;kept under lock and key in a safe&quot;. He added: &quot;They really are medicines that should not be on the premises of any horse owner, no matter how experienced.&quot; Since the emergence of both seizures, Princess Haya has sent out a directive to all Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s equine operations, including Darley and Godolphin, asking for co-operation in setting up a central auditing system for veterinary products.", "title": "Godolphin stable orders inquiry into drug seizure", "sentences": ["A shipment of unlicensed veterinary drugs intended for use on horses, which was seized from a Dubai government jet at Stansted airport in Essex earlier this year, has sparked a major internal inquiry within the operations of Britain&apos;s biggest owner of racehorses.", "Sheikh Mohammed, the monarch of Dubai and a major international figure in horse racing and breeding, has asked his junior wife, Princess Haya, to conduct an investigation into the seizure, which came to light following a similar raid at Moorley Farm in Newmarket last month, a location owned by the sheikh&apos;s Darley Stud.", "Thousands of pounds worth of anaesthetics, anti-inflammatories, sedatives and bute \u2013 described as &quot;potentially toxic and dangerous to horses&quot; \u2013 were seized and destroyed at Stansted on 3 May following the arrival of a plane belonging to the Dubai Royal Air Wing."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-29T23:33:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/sep/30/crown-estate-sovereign-weath-fund-labour", "tags": ["Sovereign wealth funds", "Pensions", "Property", "Money", "Business", "London", "Eric Pickles", "Asia Pacific", "Royal Mail", "Labour", "UK news", "Politics", "Monarchy"], "article": "Britain&apos;s \u00a38.6bn crown estate should be turned into a sovereign wealth fund to rival government-backed investment funds that have sprung up across Europe, the Middle East and Asia in the last 20 years, a group of Labour MPs will say this week. The MPs will tell the Co-op party&apos;s annual conference on Friday that the crown estate, which comprises vast tracts of land and commercial property across the UK, should be freed up to invest in foreign property and much-needed infrastructure projects in Britain. Gareth Thomas, chair of the Co-op party&apos;s group of 33 Labour MPs, said such a sovereign wealth fund could boost growth and help pay the UK&apos;s debts. Thomas said: &quot;A British sovereign wealth fund could promote co-operation with fast-growing overseas businesses, earning the UK vital income over the long term. &quot;Modernising the rules governing the crown estate could, for example, allow it to invest in up-and-coming property markets in G20 states like China and India or in new technology businesses, helping Britain secure access to innovative ideas developed abroad.&quot; The estate manages the \u00a38.6bn of land and property that the crown owns, but which the Queen does not control and cannot sell. The estate is accountable to parliament, and pays its surplus income to the Treasury to offset the cost of maintaining the royal family. The Treasury said there were no plans to develop a UK sovereign wealth fund to rival the \u00a315bn French and \u00a3875m Italian government funds, though the local government minister, Eric Pickles, is consulting on whether to create a &quot;superfund&quot; from the UK&apos;s assorted state pension schemes, which have amassed almost \u00a3200bn in assets. There are 89 local government pension schemes, with around \u00a3150bn under management; several others, including the Royal Mail pension scheme and the fund for MPs&apos; pensions, have built up assets from investments in shares and bonds. However, pension funds are excluded from the list of sovereign wealth funds, which are expected to generate wealth for the nation as a whole. Thomas said that, with a change in the law lifting restrictions that limit it to property and land in Britain, the crown estate could become a sovereign wealth fund and develop its investment strategy. Last year the estate generated a surplus of \u00a3253m from its investments after making an 11.9% annual return. The bedrock of the estate is the Prince Regent&apos;s London property holdings, built 200 years ago, which run from Regent&apos;s Park through Oxford Circus and Regent Street to St James&apos;s Park. Seabeds managed by the estate are leased to offshore windfarms, and land across the UK is home to many other renewable energy schemes, business parks and factories. The fund was boosted last year by the acquisition of the Coliseum shopping park, in Cheshire, and Silverlink shopping park, outside Newcastle. Lifting restrictions on the estate would, Thomas said, allow it &quot;to begin to explore ventures into overseas property markets, for example in the Asian Pacific region, where eight of the world&apos;s largest 20 property markets are located, including China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and India, or taking a stake in companies set up to bring new technologies to market&quot;. Most of the largest funds rely on oil and other commodity revenues to boost their assets under management. Norway already has a \u00a3460bn sovereign wealth fund generated from taxes on its oil and gas industry. Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and China have also amassed huge wealth in funds that have become active investors in foreign markets, including the UK. It is estimated that government-backed funds account for around $30tr (\u00a318.5tr) of global assets, the same as the estimated $30tr of pension funds&apos; assets. Since the beginning of 2008, which marks the high point for most stock and bond markets, funds registered with the Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute have increased their assets by 59%. Much of the gain is from oil and gas revenues, which soared after the eurozone crisis caused a wholesale price rise.

This is the metric by which Somalis will judge commitments made at a recent conference in Brussels, where international donors pledged \u20ac1.8bn for Somalia. Indeed, before the ink was dry on the compact, many Somali observers took to social media to question the significance of the agreement. Somalia has a complicated relationship with donors. For the past 20 years, most have been located in Nairobi due to security concerns. While there are signs that some are slowly relocating to Mogadishu \u2013 the UN has already started moving in and the UK has re-established an embassy (of sorts) \u2013 frustrations remain with the pace of the shift. Most donors are currently focused on the difficult job of building government capacity and developing institutions \u2013 the fruits of which are hard to observe over the short term, and which is all the more difficult to do from Nairobi. There&apos;s a real need for donors to think outside of the box in Somalia. The government lacks the ability to deliver public services but is deeply suspicious of NGOs, who operate at a distance from the state, limiting opportunities to transfer skills to local government. There is a preference for donors to work more closely with government, to become more flexible and more tolerant of risk and to provide more direct support; in effect, to become more like one of the newer entrants into Somalia&apos;s aid landscape: Turkey. If you ask a Somali official which donor is making a difference on the ground, chances are their answer will be Turkey. While the two countries don&apos;t have a long history of engagement, in August 2011 Turkish President Erdo\u011fen became the first non-African head of state to visit Somalia in almost two decades. At the time Somalia was in the midst of a crisis, with over 3.2 million people in need of food aid. The sharp increase in newborn boys being named Erdogen alludes to the appreciation everyday Somalis felt for this display of solidarity. The increasing and sudden engagement of Turkey in humanitarian relief efforts was noted by then UK ambassador to Somalia, Matt Baugh, who acknowledged Turkey&apos;s capacity to bring its political force to bear and to quickly begin to set the pace for long-established donors in Somalia. Turkey&apos;s aid programme is evolving, but their pioneering modus operandi of having boots on the ground, working side by side with Somalis, advising, coaching and taking risk remains unchanged. They have a growing footprint in the country: building schools, giving scholarships, refurbishing government buildings, and they even provide budget support of $4.5m a month. However, there are two projects that make government officials giddy \u2013 a new 400-bed training hospital and an asphalt factory. Little information is publicly available on either project, but a doctor I spoke to in Mogadishu was convinced the hospital has the potential to revolutionise health services for the poor (though he anticipated challenges with identifying &quot;the poor&quot;). It will be staffed by Turkish doctors and managers who will be closely shadowed by their Somali counterparts, with gradual transfer of full responsibility to the government over the next five years. The laying of new roads has begun this week. Al-Shabaab has also noted Turkey&apos;s role: on 27July a Turkish guest house next to the embassy in Mogadishu was attacked. Security has since been stepped up, but Turkey remains one of a few nations with an embassy outside of the fortified airport, which acts as Somalia&apos;s unofficial &quot;Green Zone&quot;. Turkey is now capitalising on its reputation for getting things done. In September, the Turkish company Favori LLC took over management of Somalia&apos;s main airport from a Dubai-based company, which had its contract terminated early. The specifics of the deal remain unclear, raising some questions, but the government is optimistic. A few days before the takeover, for the first time in 20 years, a Boeing 747 cargo plane landed at Mogadishu airport, carrying equipment for Favori LLC. Many Somalis question the sustainability of Turkey&apos;s development assistance but the country insists it&apos;s here for the long term. Other southern donors are returning with their own ambitious plans. The flexibility, speed of delivery and mix of aid and investment of this rising breed of donors \u2013 which includes China and Brazil, for example \u2013 moving countries like Somalia into an &quot;age of choice&quot;. Last month, after a high-profile visit to China by the Somali foreign minister, the federal government of Somalia signed an agreement for the Chinese to restart development assistance and rebuild some of the country&apos;s landmarks, scarred by war. As security continues to improve in Mogadishu, the aid landscape is likely to get more complicated, but aid that the Somalis can see and feel \u2013 and donors based in Mogadishu \u2013 will continue to win favour.

Dubai is an exception. In the emirate, it is far from unusual for endurance horses and thoroughbreds to be stabled in the same complex, while trainers can also shift between the two disciplines. Ismail Mohammed, who saddled Educate to win the Cambridgeshire Handicap at Newmarket last weekend, was an endurance trainer prior to taking out a licence to train thoroughbreds. Like Mubarak bin Shafya, who now trains thoroughbreds at the Al Aasfa complex, which is owned by Sheikh Mohammed, his time in endurance racing was both successful and controversial. In 2006, the FEI stripped Sheikh Majid bin Mohammed al Maktoum, one of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s sons, of his third-place finish in the 2005 European Endurance Championship after his horse, Orkara, tested positive for guanabenz. The drug can be used to reduce a horse&apos;s heart-rate, which can be a significant advantage in endurance as horses cannot continue from regular stops for veterinary inspection until their heart-rate falls below 64bpm. At the time, FEI regulations held a horse&apos;s rider to be responsible for any substance found in its bloodstream, but since Sheikh Majid was only 17, it was Ismail Mohammed, who trained Orkara at the Al Aasfa stables, who faced disciplinary action. He was banned from involvement in international endurance events for a year, and fined about \u00a32,000. Ismail Mohammed switched to training thoroughbreds, then back to endurance horses and eventually returned to thoroughbreds between 2006 and 2009, and was the top trainer at Dubai&apos;s Carnival meeting in 2007 with 16 winners, including five on a single card. He started to train in Newmarket in 2012, and this season he has saddled a total of 19 winners from 73 runners, a strike rate of 26%. Mubarak bin Shafya, who was banned from endurance racing for two years in 2011 after several of his horses tested positive for stanozolol, continued to train thoroughbreds from Al Aasfa stables in Dubai, where endurance horses are also stabled, through his suspension. Sheikh Mohammed himself has been competing in endurance events for the last 20 years. Pure-bred Arabian horses, which are well known for their stamina, are well suited to endurance racing and its extreme distances, and in addition to a number of individual victories, the Sheikh also led the UAE team to the gold medal in the World Endurance Championship in Arkansas in 1996. Several of his sons have also competed at a high level in the sport. However, Sheikh Mohammed, too, has been banned from endurance competition as the result of a failed drug test on one of his horses. In 2009, Tahhan, a horse he had ridden in endurance events in both Bahrain and Dubai, was found to be positive for both guanabenz and stanozolol, an anabolic steroid. The Sheikh was banned from competition for six months, while Abdullah bin Huzaim, the horse&apos;s trainer, was banned for a year.", "title": "Endurance and thoroughbred racing have close links in Dubai", "sentences": ["Dubai is an exception.", "Ismail Mohammed switched to training thoroughbreds, then back to endurance horses and eventually returned to thoroughbreds between 2006 and 2009, and was the top trainer at Dubai&apos;s Carnival meeting in 2007 with 16 winners, including five on a single card.", "Mubarak bin Shafya, who was banned from endurance racing for two years in 2011 after several of his horses tested positive for stanozolol, continued to train thoroughbreds from Al Aasfa stables in Dubai, where endurance horses are also stabled, through his suspension.", "In 2009, Tahhan, a horse he had ridden in endurance events in both Bahrain and Dubai, was found to be positive for both guanabenz and stanozolol, an anabolic steroid."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-30T18:07:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/sep/30/sheikh-mohammed-dubai", "tags": ["Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Horse racing", "Sport", "Drugs in sport"], "article": "Mubarak bin-Shafya, a former trainer of endurance horses who was banned from that sport for two years for doping with steroids, continues to train thoroughbreds from a Dubai stable complex which is owned by Sheikh Mohammed. Shafya is also a former employer and colleague of the disgraced Godolphin trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni, casting a further light on the frequent links between the two disciplines in Dubai. Shafya was banned from endurance racing in 2011 but has continued to operate a successful thoroughbred training operation from Al Aasfa Stables, roughly a one-hour drive from Dubai City. There is no suggestion that Sheikh Mohammed is involved in any wrongdoing whatsoever but the link with Shafya may cause some embarrassment. During the five-month racing season in the UAE, which takes place at Sharjah, Abu Dhabi, Jebel Ali and Meydan courses, Shafya sent out a total of 11 winners from 95 runners. In March this year Shafya saddled three winners on a card at Meydan, the world&apos;s largest course. Two were owned by Sheikh Ahmed bin Mohammed al-Maktoum, a son of Sheikh Mohammed, and a third was owned by another of the Sheikh&apos;s sons, Sheikh Majid bin Mohammed al-Maktoum, who has also competed at a high level as an endurance rider. Shafya&apos;s most successful racing season by far, however, was in 2009, when he saddled one of the most valuable doubles in racing history. His horses Gladiatorus and Eastern Anthem won the Dubai Duty Free and the Dubai Sheema Classic, jointly the most valuable turf races in the world, on Dubai World Cup night at Meydan in March 2009, adding to a series of other successes during the previous few months. Shafya&apos;s assistant trainer at the time was Zarooni, who had also worked with endurance horses earlier in his career. Zarooni then moved to work with Saeed bin Suroor, at the time Godolphin&apos;s sole trainer in Europe, before Sheikh Mohammed appointed him to take over about half of the string racing under his Godolphin banner in Europe. Zarooni was banned from racing for eight years by the British Horseracing Authority on 25 April this year for doping 15 horses with anabolic steroids at his Moulton Paddocks stable in Newmarket. These included Certify, one of the best juvenile fillies of 2012, who had also been a leading contender for the 1,000 Guineas in early May. Another seven horses, including Encke, last year&apos;s St Leger winner, were later found to have been doped with the steroid stanozolol at the yard, but the BHA has since been unable to contact Zarooni to determine whether these dopings were also his responsibility. All horses which tested positive for steroids were banned from racing for six months from the date of their positive test, suspensions which will start to expire at the end of October. Shafya himself was banned from endurance racing for two years in 2011 after several horses in his care tested positive for stanozolol. He was also stripped of an endurance-riding victory at the European championships in Portugal in 2007 after his horse Zakah Zahara tested positive for a banned substance. At the time, Shafya was in charge of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s endurance racing string based at Al Aasfa. Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s endurance operation is currently the subject of an internal investigation following the seizure and destruction of thousands of pounds&apos; worth of unlicensed veterinary products found on a Dubai Royal Air Wing flight at Stansted airport in May. Sheikh Mohammed denies any knowledge of any illegal products in the cargo. A number of similar products were also found in a raid on Moorley Farm stables in Newmarket in September, which is owned by the Sheikh&apos;s Darley Stud breeding operation. In addition to being the world&apos;s biggest investor in bloodstock, Sheikh Mohammed is also a keen endurance rider, as are several of his sons including Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, Dubai&apos;s Crown Prince. Princess Haya bint al-Hussein, Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s junior wife, is the president of the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Equestre Internationale, endurance riding&apos;s governing body. The FEI banned Sheikh Mohammed from competition for six months in 2009 after a horse he was riding tested positive for a banned substance after an endurance event in Dubai. Her Highness Princess Haya has been asked by Sheikh Mohammed to conduct the internal investigation into the endurance operation, which is believed to involve at least 700 horses in Dubai, Britain and elsewhere. Since 2005, the FEI has considered more than 20 cases involving doped endurance horses from Dubai stables which are owned either by Sheikh Mohammed or other senior members of his family.", "title": "Dubai case raises new questions for Sheikh Mohammed", "sentences": ["Mubarak bin-Shafya, a former trainer of endurance horses who was banned from that sport for two years for doping with steroids, continues to train thoroughbreds from a Dubai stable complex which is owned by Sheikh Mohammed.", "Shafya is also a former employer and colleague of the disgraced Godolphin trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni, casting a further light on the frequent links between the two disciplines in Dubai.", "Shafya was banned from endurance racing in 2011 but has continued to operate a successful thoroughbred training operation from Al Aasfa Stables, roughly a one-hour drive from Dubai City.", "His horses Gladiatorus and Eastern Anthem won the Dubai Duty Free and the Dubai Sheema Classic, jointly the most valuable turf races in the world, on Dubai World Cup night at Meydan in March 2009, adding to a series of other successes during the previous few months.", "Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s endurance operation is currently the subject of an internal investigation following the seizure and destruction of thousands of pounds&apos; worth of unlicensed veterinary products found on a Dubai Royal Air Wing flight at Stansted airport in May.", "In addition to being the world&apos;s biggest investor in bloodstock, Sheikh Mohammed is also a keen endurance rider, as are several of his sons including Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed, Dubai&apos;s Crown Prince.", "The FEI banned Sheikh Mohammed from competition for six months in 2009 after a horse he was riding tested positive for a banned substance after an endurance event in Dubai.", "Her Highness Princess Haya has been asked by Sheikh Mohammed to conduct the internal investigation into the endurance operation, which is believed to involve at least 700 horses in Dubai, Britain and elsewhere.", "Since 2005, the FEI has considered more than 20 cases involving doped endurance horses from Dubai stables which are owned either by Sheikh Mohammed or other senior members of his family."], "publicationDate": "2013-09-30T21:48:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/2013/oct/01/key-stories-of-the-day", "tags": ["UK news", "World news"], "article": "1.

UN general assembly Last week, world leaders gathered in New York at the UN general assembly (UNGA) to discuss development. Member states agreed that a future set of development goals must apply to all countries and be based on the principles of human rights and the rule of law. During the UNGA there were calls for a new way to measure poverty levels, and Mary Robinson, the former Irish president, argued that a &quot;robust&quot; agreement on climate change was needed to ensure sustainable development.

The British Horseracing Authority insists it has sound reasons for believing that neither cache was destined for use on racehorses, even though the seizures have prompted Sheikh Mohammed, a prominent owner in racing, to launch an internal investigation into his operations. To this point, the BHA has simply cited an assurance from the government&apos;s Veterinary Medicines Directorate, which is investigating the two cases, that there was no link to racing. On Tuesday, the BHA&apos;s spokesman, Robin Mounsey, went further. &quot;The VMD contacted us to let us know the seizures had taken place, to give us details of the products involved and to let us know that, in their view, there was no connection with racing,&quot; he said. &quot;At the same time, they gave us their explanation as to why they felt there was no connection to racing. We have a link there, we are bodies with a mutual interest in regulation and we do share information. At the same time, this is their case and we&apos;re not at liberty to offer that explanation on their behalf. &quot;I accept it would be unwise of us to just accept a simple insistence that there was no connection and then bury our heads in the sand but that&apos;s not what happened. &quot;The reason why we have confidence behind that position is that we&apos;re just off the back of a five-month investigation into the racing arm of [Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s] organisation, Godolphin, during which we found no evidence at all of any behaviour that might fit this particular bill. Also, we&apos;re not just walking away from Godolphin. They remain a stable in which we take an active interest and we continue to monitor them, through announced and unannounced visits, and we will continue to assess how they&apos;re getting on with implementing the changes we sought to have them make.&quot; The VMD confirmed that its investigations were continuing but said it could not comment further, nor offer any indication as to the likely pace of progress. The two seizures involved medicines that are not authorised in the UK and which had been illegally imported; one took place at a Newmarket farm owned by the sheikh, where horses for the separate sport of endurance racing are trained, and one took place aboard a Dubai government jet, newly arrived at Stansted. Sheikh Mohammed is the ruler of Dubai. As revealed by the Guardian this week, the Sheikh responded by ordering an internal investigation of his equine operations, to be run by his junior wife, Princess Haya, also president of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports.

That is just one of the difficulties facing Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum and Princess Haya, following the revelation in Monday&apos;s Guardian that she has been called in to examine his equine operations in the wake of two seizures of illegal equine drugs by British government agencies. But it should be said that there is no evidence of the inquiry being intended as window dressing. There was no formal announcement that it was to take place, after all, and it seems extremely unlikely that any findings will be published. The tone that has been struck so far is one of determination that such embarrassments to Sheikh Mohammed should cease. Princess Haya&apos;s spokesman, revealing the investigation, said: &quot;Nobody seems to know in the organisation who is buying what [veterinary medicines] or where. That&apos;s one of the reforms that they want in place. We&apos;re trying to find out what happened, why it happened and to make sure it doesn&apos;t happen again.&quot; In any case, Princess Haya&apos;s qualifications for the task are hard to fault, beyond the possible quibble of her being married to the subject. She has served as president of the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI) since 2006, earning widespread admiration for her abilities and drive, while generating sufficient controversy to ensure that she was challenged by two rivals when seeking re-election in 2010. That was an unprecedented situation for a sitting FEI president, who have generally had something of the figurehead about them; past incumbents include Prince Philip, Princess Anne and a Spanish infanta. Princess Haya won her battle decisively, garnering 72% of the vote, yet she will step down next year at the end of her second term, despite much expectation that the FEI&apos;s statutes would be changed to allow her a third. She will be missed, among other reasons, for her ability to raise enormous sums in sponsorship for previously ailing horsey sports, an ability that almost no successor could hope to match. But she outraged some with what has been described as an authoritarian approach and eventually had to backtrack over her 2009 proposal that limited levels of the anti-inflammatory Bute be allowed. The previous year, she incensed Michael Etherington-Smith, one of the world&apos;s top designers of cross-country courses, by peremptorily ordering a change to one of his fences at a Hong Kong competition. Revealing her decision to step down last week, she said it was &quot;essential to ensure fresh thinking and avoid a sense of entitlement within the leadership&quot;. She had herself introduced a two-term limit for presidents at the start of her tenure. Her announcement followed allegations that she was beset by a conflict of interest in attempting to reduce the incidence of doping in endurance racing in the Middle East. That conflict was said to arise from the fact that so many doping cases examined by the FEI have involved horses from Dubai, where Sheikh Mohammed is ruler. One specialist reporter asserts a Maktoum family link to 24 of 161 doping cases emanating from endurance racing that have been heard by the FEI tribunal since 2005. That tally includes horses who are merely based at stables owned by Maktoum family members and was therefore described as &quot;a misleading statistic&quot; by an FEI spokesperson, who said its rules hold the rider responsible in the first instance, while allowing for others such as trainers to be sanctioned. Sheikh Mohammed was banned from endurance racing, a separate sport to the thoroughbred racing with which British fans are familiar, for six months in 2009, after a horse he rode tested positive for a steroid. Princess Haya stood herself down from the disciplinary process on that occasion. She will conduct her new inquiry in a private capacity and it is thought unlikely that the two drugs seizures will result in any formal action by the FEI itself. In any event, no action will be taken until the conclusion of investigations by Britain&apos;s Veterinary Medicines Directorate, a branch of Defra. &quot;Doping is always going to be a sensitive, complex and difficult issue,&quot; the Princess said in a 2010 interview as she sought re-election. &quot;So many opinions exist about what constitutes doping and what constitutes medication.&quot; That concern was recently echoed in the defensive words of Jaume Punti Dachs, an endurance trainer based at the Newmarket farm owned by Sheikh Mohammed where one of the drugs seizures took place. &quot;These are all substances that you can buy in the UK, under a different trade name, and are standard [in the] medicine cabinet in any stables,&quot; he said. &quot;I know that these medicines are lawfully and legally used in the UK. &quot;However, the make/labels of the veterinary medicines in this case may be slightly different as they were purchased by me outside the UK and the authorities know that. They explained to me after their visit how to source the same medicines.&quot;", "title": "Princess Haya: the woman investigating the Stansted drugs seizure", "sentences": ["That conflict was said to arise from the fact that so many doping cases examined by the FEI have involved horses from Dubai, where Sheikh Mohammed is ruler."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-01T19:37:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/02/lord-stevens-inquiry-sheikh-mohammed-equine", "tags": ["Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Godolphin", "Horse racing", "British Horseracing Authority", "Drugs in sport", "Sport"], "article": "Lord Stevens, the former head of the Metropolitan police, has been asked by Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum to lead an investigation into the sheikh&apos;s entire equine operations and will assemble a &quot;team of experts&quot; to examine seizures of unlicensed veterinary products at Stansted airport and Moorley Farm.

Here is the full text from his speech at the Headmasters&apos; and Headmistresses&apos; Conference. Good morning. I come here as chief inspector with a bit of a reputation for forthrightness. So let me conform to type and do a bit of plain speaking to you today. As chief inspector I am clear about my role \u2013 it&apos;s not just to comment on educational standards, which, of course, I&apos;ll do in December when my annual report is published, but also to use the power and influence of inspection to challenge our education system to do better \u2013 challenge it to rise up the international league tables and to compete with the best jurisdictions in the world. Contrary to some people&apos;s views, I do not agree with everything the secretary of state says. But I am entirely at one with him in saying that there is no option but to compete with the very best if we are going to have a successful economy and, more importantly, a fair and cohesive society. So this is a battle. Our educational Agincourt. A fight for higher standards, and a fight we&apos;ve got to win for all our children \u2013 not just for those who can afford to pay for a first-class education. If we do win the battle, our education system will be viewed by others through the prism of a high-performing state system in every town, city and county in England; as well as, as it often is now, through the prism of a selective, independent but high achieving system of tailcoats and dreaming spires. This ambition is not idle musing from a hopelessly optimistic chief inspector. It is an ambition entirely rooted in my own experience of working in tough schools in the inner city and a belief that all is possible if we have three vital prerequisites \u2013 political will, transparent accountability and, most importantly, great leadership in our schools. We certainly have political will. And no sane future administration is ever going to shift education down its list of priorities. And in terms of accountability, Ofsted is the key driver and lever of national expectations. I am using that lever to raise the bar on standards \u2013 to abolish satisfactory entirely from the lexicon of Ofsted terminology, and to signal unequivocally that mediocrity will no longer be tolerated by our inspection regime. Let me remind everyone that in a more autonomous system, Ofsted is more important now than ever. Good is the only acceptable standard of provision across all the remits we inspect. That has been a tough challenge for school leaders, but I&apos;m pleased to say that they are rising magnificently to it. Which brings me to the third of my prerequisites. Our latest statistics show that nearly 80% of schools in the last academic year were judged good or outstanding \u2013 a massive and unprecedented rise of nine percentage points on this time last year. This means that 600,000 more children are receiving a better education in good schools. There is no question that the best ever generation of school leaders and teachers are incrementally delivering the ambition I talked about earlier. And in many areas, these leaders have a tough, tough job \u2013 dealing with youngsters from homes with few books and even fewer aspirations. These leaders, many of whom I&apos;ve met in my 18 months at Ofsted, are doing their utmost to ensure that their children have the same opportunities as the youngsters you teach \u2013 that they can gain the same skills and qualifications as your students and go to the same universities. These heads in inner city London, Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds haven&apos;t got the time to worry whether their children are climbing trees proficiently. These heads know that gaining academic qualifications is the one route out of poverty and disadvantage. They would find it deeply insulting to believe that some in this room felt that they don&apos;t worry sufficiently about a balanced education for their students. They would feel particularly insulted if this criticism was coming from some educationalists who have the luxury of teaching children from aspirant and often well-heeled homes \u2013 homes that would make damn sure that their children passed their exams, even though the school afforded them the time to climb trees and gaze upon the beauties of life. Indeed, how many inner-city comprehensives have a tree? So we must rally behind our school leaders who are winning the battle. The evidence is all around us. Twice the proportion of pupils leave school with good GCSEs than was the case 20 years ago. A larger percentage of schools are now good or outstanding than ever before. Disadvantaged children now aspire to a university education \u2013 and get one \u2013 in numbers that were unheard of only a generation ago. These are real achievements. But it would be foolish and indulgent to pretend that the battle is won. Too many schools are still not good enough. Too many children are leaving them without good qualifications. Too many in education still believe that satisfactory is acceptable. Well it isn&apos;t. Two trends in particular remain big areas of concern: the huge regional variations in school quality and the persistent blight of underachievement that afflicts far too many of our poorest children. Neither of these is acceptable. They can be overcome. And I think you in the independent sector have a big role to play in helping state schools overcome them. Teaching children from deprived backgrounds is and will remain challenging. But too much of the regional and social variation exists because some schools and local authorities have not learnt lessons from their higher performing peers. There is no good reason why schools in Medway cannot achieve the stellar results achieved by their equally challenged counterparts in Tower Hamlets. There is no acceptable explanation why schools in Hull should lag those of Wigan. The reason they do is too often down to incompetence and neglect. So, how can you join forces with the state school heads who are making such a difference? Wellington speech A few months ago I gave a speech at Wellington College calling for the independent sector to work more closely with state schools. To say it didn&apos;t go down well with some of your colleagues would be an understatement. I think bailiffs have received warmer welcomes. But at the risk of trying the patience of this audience, too, it&apos;s something in which I believe passionately and which I think independent schools cannot ignore. This is not just a question of the responsibilities privileged schools have to disadvantaged ones. It is not just a question of the damage suffered by a society divided into educational haves and have-nots. It is not just a question of the part you can play in mending those divisions, or indeed of the consequences if you do not. It is all of those things, but it also goes to the heart of what a school is. Because to ask the question: &quot;How can independent schools aid state ones?&quot; is also to ask about your mission. Does your mission really encompass the broader view of your role in building a stronger and fairer society? Fundamentally, it is a question about why you do what you do and why you choose to teach. So by all means grumble about another lecture by a pontificating outsider. Disagree with my arguments. Dismiss my points. But also ask yourself this: why did I become a teacher? Let me be presumptuous, and tell you why. I think you all became teachers because you love learning and want to see the next generation learn to love learning. If you became a teacher because you understand that great learning and great educational outcomes aren&apos;t restricted to those whose parents have deep pockets, far more unites us than divides us. If you don&apos;t believe that, then what I&apos;m about to say will fall on deaf ears. If you believe, as so many of your original founders believed, that how you deal with wider society, and how you relate to those children less fortunate than your students defines you as schools, then I have a proposition for you. Reaction to Wellington But let me return to the reaction to my first speech. It didn&apos;t go down well. The widespread acclamation and joy that normally greets a proclamation from Her Majesty&apos;s Chief Inspector of Schools was notably absent on this occasion\u2026 My call for independent schools &quot;marooned on an island of privilege&quot; to forsake their &quot;splendid isolation&quot; and do more for state schools wasn&apos;t met with stony silence as much as stones, at least of the metaphorical variety. I was out of touch, your leaders claimed, ignorant of the growing links private schools have with their state counterparts. And I was unaware of the difficulties they face doing more. Extending the programmes already in place simply wasn&apos;t on. The objections largely boiled down to three: \u2022 Firstly, independent schools do enough already. \u2022 Secondly, even if we wanted to do more our governors and parents wouldn&apos;t let us. \u2022 And thirdly, hinted at though rarely articulated, we&apos;re not sure we&apos;re up to teaching children like these. Let me take each of those issues in turn. Before I do, however, I&apos;d like to address another sentiment occasionally expressed by a few of your colleagues, though I hope not widely shared. At a recent gathering of school business managers, I am given to understand that a prominent member of the Independent Schools Bursars&apos; Association argued that it would be mad for you to extend any help to academies or state schools because they are the competition. The better they did, the more difficult it would be for you to succeed. He could find no earthly reason why you should co-operate with them. Isolation, for this gentleman, isn&apos;t only splendid but desirable. I find that sentiment both disappointing and frustrating. Education should not be a scarce resource hoarded by those lucky enough to possess it. Education is meant to be shared. Its power does not decrease with the giving. It is an economic and social good. Abraham Lincoln said: &quot;The philosophy of the school room in one generation will be the philosophy of government in the next.&quot; Old Abe was such a remarkable figure that it isn&apos;t altogether surprising his views on education are not his foremost legacy. But he did recognise (in an era that predates compulsory education) that schools shape our future society like little else. Nor is the private sector as separate from the state as some in it would like to pretend. You are part of the community. If you treat the state as a rival, do not be surprised if it returns the sentiment. It would be a moral retreat and a tactical mistake to confuse independence with isolation \u2013 haughty detachment can become a very tempting target, a point I&apos;ll elaborate on later. The last thing I want is for independence to give way to isolation. I simply cannot believe that the bursar&apos;s views are held by many of you here today. But if they are, we really are in trouble. Existing supportMore common is the argument that independent schools do plenty already. Rare is the school that doesn&apos;t help in some way its state cousin, according to the Independent Schools Council. And out of touch is the chief inspector that doesn&apos;t realise it. I was indulging in &quot;a typical headline-grabbing stump speech&quot;, said the ISC of my words at Wellington, and &quot;I appeared unaware of basic facts&quot;. It went on to point out that more than 90% of ISC&apos;s 1,200 schools were engaged in &quot;meaningful collaborative work with their state sector colleagues&quot;. I beg to differ. It is true that a few independent schools are engaged in extremely committed and imaginative ways. But for every school like Tonbridge there many more that do very little. According to the ISC, 34 schools currently sponsor or co-sponsor an academy \u2013 less than 3% of its members. A further 5% loan teaching staff to state schools. That is commendable. But for the vast majority of independent schools, the commitment and resource is far less \u2013 a bit of coaching for A-level students; the occasional loan of a playing field. Welcome though I&apos;m sure these are, the effort expended cannot be compared, for instance, to the sponsorship of an academy. I&apos;m sorry to say, but the ISC&apos;s list of activities is hardly evidence of a comprehensive commitment to partnership with state schools. It&apos;s thin stuff. These are crumbs off your tables, leading more to famine than feast. Of course it&apos;s the case that not every school has the resources of a Winchester or a Harrow. But it&apos;s hard not to conclude that too many in the independent sector are far more concerned with issues within their own walls than beyond them. As Lord Adonis has pointed out, so many leading independent schools were founded principally to cater for the poorest in society. Harrow, Eton, Westminster, Charterhouse, Winchester and scores of others were endowed and established with the express purpose of providing an education for the poor. I am calling on you all to renew and deepen that commitment. The ISC also took exception to my plea to be less fixated on opening glittering new campuses overseas and to think what opportunities might lie closer to home. To think less globally and more locally, &quot;less Dubai and more Derby&quot; as I put it. The ISC claimed that growth overseas is &quot;an opportunity to build up bursary funds which [schools] otherwise lack, and so improve the life chances of children in their localities&quot;. If that is indeed one of the reasons for your international expansion let me be among the first to congratulate you. I look forward to seeing the growth of those funds and their liberal expenditure on the genuinely disadvantaged. For those of you unconvinced of the need to trek to Kazakhstan to subsidise the disadvantaged of Kettering and Kidderminster, my challenge to you remains. What are you doing for your local schools? You may discover that it&apos;s far simpler and convenient to deal with opportunities in your own backyard than to go to the ends of the earth to find them.Parents and governors The second main reason given for inaction is the opposition of parents and governors. I appreciate that this can be formidable. As Dr Anthony Seldon, the headmaster of Wellington, has pointed out: &quot;The pace of change \u2026 has been agonisingly slow. [David] Cameron charged a small group of us \u2026 to encourage independent schools down the academy sponsorship path. It has been the most frustrating challenge of my career. The reality is that most governing bodies don&apos;t want to bond with state schools. They put up spurious reasons such as parental objections for masterly inactivity.&quot; Having forked out \u00a330,000 for the privilege of educating their children, I can understand why some parents think that all school resources should be devoted solely to them. However, I also believe that many parents are aware of schools&apos; responsibilities to the wider community and that their children ultimately benefit from being involved in that commitment. There is a hint in Dr. Seldon&apos;s frustration that if governing bodies were more robust, and the arguments for involvement more firmly put, objections could be overcome. So I urge you to persist. But what if parents remain unmoved? What if they are deaf to pleas for the privileged to do their duty? What might you say to parents who think that noblesse oblige is the latest perfume from Chanel? As I&apos;ve said before, independent your schools may be but isolated they are not. They are firmly connected to the wider community. Your pensions, many of the public may be surprised to learn, are subsidised by the taxpayer. Most of your teaching staff were educated at public expense. The independent sector gains 1,400 teachers from state schools every year. Significantly, the vast majority of your pupils will go to universities that pride themselves on being part of the wider community and that depend for most of their income on the state. The universities themselves are acutely aware of those facts. University College London, for instance, has indicated that it will increase the intake of state pupils at the expense of students from independent schools. As you know, other top-flight universities are tempted to follow its lead. Now you may find this unjust. You may find the imposition of quotas crude. You may regard it as an unacceptable case of &quot;social engineering&quot;. As chief inspector I don&apos;t take a view either way. I merely note that those schools that choose to remain aloof from their state counterparts only give ammunition to those who would like to put even stricter quotas on independent pupils&apos; access to our top, publicly-funded universities. And I cannot believe that is a prospect that you or your parents and governors would find appealing. Perhaps the biggest danger for independent schools is if they take the bursar&apos;s view I mentioned earlier. If they insist on seeing state schools as competition, it invites the state to treat them in the same way \u2013 as rivals. Rivals that enjoy unfair advantages crying out to be curbed. But more than all of this, I am concerned some independent schools are missing an opportunity. Ofsted&apos;s evidence shows that collaboration and school to school support doesn&apos;t just benefit the struggling partner. Working with a state school would provide senior leaders with the opportunity to broaden their experience, leading to better motivation and improved retention. Both parties learn from one another. And there is also the enhanced reputation that providing such help brings with it.Teaching beyond the independent sector So we come to the final objection, the one sometimes whispered but not openly spoken: the fear that good as you are at teaching relatively privileged kids, your skills won&apos;t work in more challenging schools. That the kids from the council estates with parents who never had a decent education themselves will be impervious to your best efforts to teach them. I can appreciate your hesitation. But I think you&apos;re being too cautious. Teaching is hard. Teaching in those schools that most need your help, the ones sunk in deprivation or the ones beached by a tide of low expectation, is especially hard. One of the first people I met when I agreed to be head of a really tough school in Canning Town in London&apos;s East End was the caretaker. &quot;Are you flipping mad?&quot; he asked, although he didn&apos;t say flipping. &quot;Even the Rottweilers around here go out in pairs.&quot; It took me years of hard work to get that school where it needed to be. It wasn&apos;t easy and it wasn&apos;t without hindrances. One step forward was often followed by several steps back. I can understand how daunting involvement in state schools might seem to those with little experience of them. The disaffection, the poverty, the lack of aspiration that still blight too many of our state schools is daunting. These challenges aren&apos;t easily overcome. Be under no illusions. Some of our state schools need all the help they can get. You have resources far in excess of those available to state heads \u2013 capital spending at ISC schools was more than three-quarters of a billion pounds last year. You have excellent teachers, many of whom are eager to play a part. You are used to taking the long view unimpeded by temporary distractions.My challenge to you Because daunting as the challenge is, it&apos;s not as if there&apos;s only one way to help. There are several. And they can be tailored to best fit with your strengths. Eton has formally co-sponsored the London Academy of Excellence \u2013 a sixth-form college in Newham, one of the capital&apos;s most deprived boroughs, which has the laudable aim of getting inner-city pupils into elite universities. Winchester has an established partnership with Midhurst Rother College, which this year was judged outstanding. Stowe proclaims good links with state schools and the local community, and Highgate has formed partnerships with 21 nearby schools to offer Oxbridge interview preparation and summer school. This is of real value, but stops short of formal sponsorship. So effectively, this is my Lord Kitchener moment \u2013 your country needs you. ConclusionThere is a perception that the independent sector only does its duty when push comes to shove. That it doesn&apos;t really care about the educational world beyond its cloisters and quads and only reaches out when the Charity Commission, universities or government forces it to act. I think that&apos;s unfair. Some of you are doing excellent work. But I can understand why inaction in other cases can be misconstrued as indifference. Yes, there are obstacles. Parents and governors can be unsympathetic. A few of your colleagues exhibit antediluvian views. Some of them recoil from involvement in environments that can seem alien and daunting. None of these obstacles are insurmountable. With will and persistence they can be overcome. And there are good, hard-headed reasons why they should be overcome. But the fact remains that, frankly, as things stand not enough of you are doing what you could be. Not enough of you are willingly going the extra mile. Search your consciences. Matthew Arnold, he of the dreaming spires and son of the famous Rugby head, Tom, put it well: &quot;We are here on earth to do good to others. What the others are here for, I do not know.&quot; So I&apos;ll finish as I started, with the same question, as a fellow teacher to many others, and ask: &quot;Why did you become a teacher? Why do you do what you do?&quot; Because in your answer I suspect you will find a far better reason to help the disadvantaged and the deprived than any I can articulate. Thank you.

The team bidding for the 2022 World Cup had unveiled the latest money\u2013no\u2013object weapon in its lavish, imaginative, improbable and ultimately successful bid to land the football tournament. Harold Mayne-Nicholls, visiting technical inspector for governing body Fifa, had just delivered a downbeat assessment of the Qataris&apos; chances of bringing the world&apos;s biggest sporting event to a gas-rich country the size of Yorkshire with June temperatures that often top 50C. But then a former World Cup winner, Zinedine Zidane, was unveiled as an official ambassador and immediately lightened the mood as he spoke of football&apos;s ability to build bridges and inspire hope. &quot;Football is for everyone,&quot; the former French international and three-time world player of the year told the assembled journalists and lackeys. &quot;When I think of all the youth of the Middle East, what they&apos;re missing is an event like the World Cup.&quot; That was the pretty wrapping that surrounded compelling personal pitches to the Fifa executive, and, as the body&apos;s president, Sepp Blatter, now admits, &quot;political influence&quot; on committee members to vote for Qatar for economic reasons. The successful bidders have always insisted they broke no rules. Given the chaotic nature of the bidding process and the lack of rigour with which it was governed, that may well turn out to be true \u2013 despite the ongoing efforts of Michael Garcia, a former US attorney for the southern district of New York, to retrospectively investigate. It is thought that Qatar paid close to \u00a32m to secure Zidane as a bid ambassador, plus millions more to recruit others including then Barcelona manager, Pep Guardiola, who finished his playing career in the Gulf state&apos;s professional league. At the time of its World Cup bid, Qatar needed to win credibility among the footballing community and the answer was to spend, spend, spend \u2013 on ambassadors, on overseas football development, on training academies, on youth schemes. Zidane&apos;s unveiling was a tiny, but apt, example of the lavish spending and ambition that not only characterised the controversial 2022 bid but has been woven through an unprecedented trolley dash around world sport. Qatar&apos;s successful attempt to host a competition for which it has never qualified is far from the only significant entrance on to the global sporting stage by this ambitious Gulf state. This is sport as soft power, a calculated attempt to build Qatar&apos;s name through a co-ordinated series of moves to align itself with the biggest and most emotive names in world sport. Just as it reached for the best player in the world when looking for an ambassador to join its team of expensively assembled stars, so it looked to the most famous and most feted club when looking to deepen its influence in Spain. Chiming with their m\u00e9s que un club (more than a club) rhetoric, Barcelona had never had a sponsor on their famous red and blue shirts when they agreed to feature Unicef on their jerseys in a one-off deal in 2006. But in modern football, money eventually talks louder than principles. In 2010, Qatar agreed a deal for its charitable Qatar Foundation to take over the shirt sponsorship, before a deal for Qatar Airways took effect this season that is valued at more than \u20ac30m (\u00a325m) a season for the next three years. In Paris, the links are stronger still. Believing the English market to be overheated, the Qatar Investment Authority (QIA) alighted upon Paris St Germain. Existing French trade links, actively encouraged and fostered by France&apos;s then president, Nicolas Sarkozy, who lobbied the Uefa president, Michel Platini, to vote for Qatar, helped smooth the way. Taking on the club in a deal worth \u20ac100m, the QIA went on to spend almost four times that in just three seasons on stars such as Zlatan Ibrahamovic and David Beckham. An $800m (\u00a3490m) sponsorship deal with the Qatar Tourism Authority, ostensibly to promote the image of the country abroad, will test Platini&apos;s cherished financial fair play rules \u2013 introduced to prevent European clubs running up huge losses but also requiring them to wean themselves off sugar daddies \u2013 to the limit. At the same time another of Qatar&apos;s big global &quot;soft power&quot; projects was making significant incursions into sport. Al-Jazeera television, which is owned by QIA, launched BeIn Sport in France, embarking on a trolley dash for football rights that included Ligue 1, the Champions League and the European Championships. As everyone from the multinationals bankrolling global sporting events to pay-TV platforms pouring billions into sports rights has discovered in recent decades, sport hits emotional buttons and forges deep links in a way that other investments do not. That rationale is now informing the investment priorities of entire governments. In Qatar, which has also invested heavily in expensive property in London and elsewhere, the spending has not been confined to overseas. A steady stream of international football teams \u2013 including an England side that played Brazil in 2009 \u2013 have been enticed to Doha to play exhibition matches. The Aspire academy has state-of-the-art facilities and a slate of perfect pitches used by a procession of big European clubs including Bayern Munich and Manchester United. The academy also takes in promising players from around Africa and beyond in what its Qatari backers claim is a purely altruistic endeavour. Having already landed the World Cup, and having failed at the shortlisting stage to reach the final cut for the 2016 and 2020 Olympics, another bid for the 2024 Games is on the cards. Qatar narrowly failed to beat London to the 2017 world athletics championships. The country&apos;s rulers insist this is more than window dressing. The former emir Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani spoke endlessly about his desire to use sport to inspire his young nation and forge a new identity, and his newly appointed son shows every sign of following suit. Billboards on Doha&apos;s ever-expanding road network would extol the virtues of physical exercise, while London 2012 architect Lord Coe is among those who has bought into the vision. &quot;It&apos;s about nation building, he sees sport as a means to inspire young people in his country and he looks at sport as something that introduces a completely different dimension,&quot; Coe told the Guardian in December at a lavish Doha conference on sport and development. Asked then how all these bits of the puzzle fitted together Hassan al-Thawadi, the chief executive of the Qatar 2022 supreme committee, played down the extent to which there was a masterplan at work. &quot;Everything has different pieces and everyone has different goals. In the end some things are interconnected and other things aren&apos;t. It&apos;s a complicated map. Some aspects are holistic and fit the national vision. Others are private initiatives,&quot; he said. But the line between private initiatives and government is inevitably blurred in a feudal monarchy. The vision is not unique to Qatar and has been pursued to a greater or lesser extent by others in the region.

And Abu Dhabi&apos;s takeover of one of England&apos;s most famous football clubs \u2013 Manchester City \u2013 and its transformation into one of the world&apos;s richest. But Qatar has taken the proposition to a whole new level. It has been an exercise that has brought the eyes of the world upon a tiny Gulf state. Qatar has allied that with some of the most glamorous names in sport, from Barcelona to Beckham. But in the process of attracting the gaze of the world, it has invited global scrutiny on the means with which it is fuelling that furiously paced expansion and its priorities. &quot;There are big opportunities here, elevating one&apos;s presence in terms of seats at global tables and external image, but there are also risks,&quot; observed Stephen Greyser, emeritus professor at Havard Business School, at the Doha conference.", "title": "Qatar 2022 World Cup bid: a monied gameplan beyond one tournament", "sentences": ["See also Dubai&apos;s longstanding agreements to host global golf and tennis competitions and its push to become home to the governing bodies of world sport."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-02T17:12:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/02/lord-stevens-sheikh-mohammed-inquiry", "tags": ["Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Godolphin", "Horse racing", "Drugs in sport", "Sport"], "article": "As a man who has previously investigated the death of Princess Diana, major security incidents in Northern Ireland and irregular transfers in the Premier League, Lord Stevens is well schooled in crises. After answering Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s call to examine his equine operations following two recent seizures of unlicensed veterinary drugs, he is certainly walking into another. The former Metropolitan police chief&apos;s latest task will be up there with his most challenging. After meeting Princess Haya on Tuesday, the 70-year-old will conduct a widespread investigation into all the major components of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s organisation, including the thoroughbred operation Godolphin. The seizure of &quot;potentially toxic and dangerous&quot; goods from a Dubai jet at Stansted on 3 May, as revealed this week by the Guardian, and a later raid at Moorley Farm in Newmarket, have raised serious questions about the Sheikh&apos;s operational structure. With a spokesman for Princess Haya declaring that &quot;nobody seems to know in the organisation who is buying what or where&quot;, obtaining a clear picture of which individuals are responsible for the recent breaches could take time. However, swift action is the order of the day. Lord Stevens, who will appoint a &quot;team of experts&quot; from the private investigations company Quest, must first ascertain the intended destination of the products seized at Stansted and who was responsible for their import. The shipment, containing thousands of pounds worth of steroidal injections, anti-inflammatories and anaesthetics incorrectly labelled as &quot;horse-tack&quot;, contained a number of drugs that were similar to those found during a separate raid at Moorley Farm by Britain&apos;s Veterinary Medicines Directorate, a branch of Defra. Unravelling the chain of events that led to the Stansted seizure will be one way of discovering the scale of the problem within the Sheikh&apos;s organisation, and to what hierarchical level the decisions on imports and exports are being made. Princess Haya has insisted that the Sheikh was unaware of the Stansted seizure until recently. Mahmood al-Zarooni was described as a &quot;rogue&quot; trainer acting &quot;autonomously&quot; when administering anabolic steroids to 22 Godolphin racehorses in April. The impression given by the British Horseracing Authority was that he had no connection to other aspects of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s equine operations, absolving the organisation of responsibility for his actions and suggesting all else was above board. But the recent revelations have suggested there may be serious flaws elsewhere, despite the fact that the products seized at Stansted and Moorley contained no anabolic steroids. Someone, either acting alone or with others, appears to be guilty of breaching the regulations, whether having done so intentionally or not. Lord Stevens will investigate the thoroughbred, endurance and transport aspects of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s operation. Zarooni, understood to be in Dubai, could provide helpful answers to a variety of questions. As could Mubarak bin-Shafya, a former colleague of Zarooni&apos;s who continues to train thoroughbreds from a Dubai stable owned by Sheikh Mohammed despite having served a ban from endurance training because of doping. The BHA has stoutly maintained its stance throughout the latest developments that there is no connection with racing, and on Wednesday reiterated that Godolphin is the subject of increased random testing after the Zarooni scandal. &quot;We welcome the announcement that Lord Stevens has been appointed to carry out a wide-ranging review of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s various equine interests, including the thoroughbred racing operation Godolphin,&quot; said Adam Brickell, the BHA&apos;s director of integrity, legal and risk. &quot;The BHA carried out its own comprehensive investigation of Godolphin earlier this year and we\u00a0would be happy to assist Lord Stevens in his enquiries in any way we can.\u00a0In addition, we have stated that in the light of the prohibited substance breaches earlier this year, the Godolphin operation remains subject to both announced and unannounced visits by BHA officials.&quot; Above all, Lord Stevens will have to ensure that his investigation is transparent and made public. It has been labelled as an &quot;internal inquiry&quot;, yet any damage done to Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s reputation will only be reduced if everything he discovers is laid bare.", "title": "Lord Stevens' 'internal' Sheikh Mohammed inquiry must be transparent", "sentences": ["The seizure of &quot;potentially toxic and dangerous&quot; goods from a Dubai jet at Stansted on 3 May, as revealed this week by the Guardian, and a later raid at Moorley Farm in Newmarket, have raised serious questions about the Sheikh&apos;s operational structure.", "Zarooni, understood to be in Dubai, could provide helpful answers to a variety of questions.", "As could Mubarak bin-Shafya, a former colleague of Zarooni&apos;s who continues to train thoroughbreds from a Dubai stable owned by Sheikh Mohammed despite having served a ban from endurance training because of doping."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-02T18:46:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/gamesblog/2013/oct/03/red-cross-players-accountable-war-crimes", "tags": ["Games", "Technology", "Shoot 'em ups", "Call of Duty", "PC", "PS3", "Xbox", "Controversy", "Culture"], "article": "Don&apos;t shoot the civilians. This is something military games have been telling us for many years. I remember my first go on Taito&apos;s explosive arcade title Operation Wolf \u2013 it was the late-80s and this frenzied blast-&apos;em-up, with its jungle environment and hostage rescue missions, was clearly gunning for a generation of Rambo II fanatics. It even let you control the action with an Uzi-style sub-machine gun bolted to the cabinet. But what it wouldn&apos;t let you do was kill passing civilians: collateral damage of this sort took a big chunk off your health bar.  Of course, this was really more about mechanics than ethics: players were being tested on their reactions and visual awareness, and failure meant a reduction in game time rather than a few moments&apos; reflection on innocent victims. These days, if you accidentally (or otherwise) shoot a civilian or comrade in a military shooter, you&apos;ll probably get a &apos;mission failed&apos; message and a one-way trip back to the last checkpoint. What you won&apos;t get is a military tribunal and a dishonorable discharge.  In a BBC news report earlier this week, however, Francois Senechaud from the International Committee of the Red Cross told a reporter that, due to the increasing verisimilitude between first-person shooters and real-life combat, games should start to abide by the international laws of armed conflict. &quot;Video games that represent contemporary battlefields are very close to reality,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s difficult to make out the difference between real footage and the footage you get from video games.&quot; What the Red Cross wants to see then is the player being penalised for carrying out such actions as willfully killing civilians or torturing enemy combatants, both of which are punishable under international law. A Q&amp;A document posted on the organisation&apos;s website explains:  The ICRC is suggesting that as in real life, these games should include virtual consequences for people&apos;s actions and decisions. Gamers should be rewarded for respecting the law of armed conflict and there should be virtual penalties for serious violations of the law of armed conflict, in other words war crimes.   And importantly it adds:  Our intention is not to spoil player&apos;s enjoyment by for example, interrupting the game with pop-up messages listing legal provisions or lecturing gamers on the law of armed conflict. We would like to see the law of armed conflict integrated into the games so that players have a realistic experience and deal first-hand with the dilemmas facing real combatants on real battlefields.   The ICRC says it is now working directly with the developers of modern military simulations and the BBC report contains an interview with Marek Spanel of Bohemia Interactive, creator of the Arma series, who claims the studio&apos;s games will now be implementing the suggestions.     Arma 2: The Red Cross believes that as video games become ever more realistic, they should also adhere to international rules of warfare.    Feasibility studied The question is, how feasible are the ICRC&apos;s aims and will players really take on board the lessons about humanitarian law? It is difficult to imagine a Call of Duty or Battlefield title in which shooting a civilian leads to a mission where the player is detained in a military prison for several months before being tried and sentenced. But then if the consequences of illegal operations are subsumed into the gameplay mechanics \u2013 i.e. shoot civilian, fail mission \u2013 the player will usually read these instances in ludic terms. Within the action, civilians are are not people who deserve humane treatment, they&apos;re walking fail states to be avoided in the pursuit of success.  We do often see the consequences of player actions being threaded into gameplay, but this tends to be in the adventure genre. Titles like Fable, Heavy Rain, Walking Dead and Dishonored all provide different paths for a player depending on their moral decisions during play \u2013 and because the action is combined with a confirming narrative element, the meaning and weight of transgression can come through. The idea of an action adventure that put the player into a series of defining humanitarian situations allowing the story to spin-off in the player&apos;s moral direction is interesting \u2013 but it&apos;s hugely unlikely in the action cinema world of the modern shooter. Furthermore, the ICRC statement makes clear that it is not interested in other genres \u2013 it is concentrating on combat games that depict and concentrate on contemporary battlefields. So how can players be made accountable for their actions beyond simple gameplay devices? How do you move beyond the simple message, &quot;Mission failed, you have broken international law and will spend the next ten years in prison. Re-start mission?&quot;      Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2: shootouts often occur in areas where civilians are in the line of fire.    Moral dilemmas There have been two stand-out examples. In Modern Warfare 2&apos;s notorious No Russian mission a US soldier is embedded with a Russian terrorist organisation and must take part in a mass killing at an airport. Success means blending in with the terror squad, and it&apos;s up to the player to decide whether that extends as far as shooting civilians. The sequence was brave, but also clumsily handled, exploitative and incongruous; however, it did place the player in a position where many felt they genuinely had to weigh up their moral proclivities with the demands of the gameplay mission. Much more intriguing, though, is the scene in Yager Development&apos;s criminally overlooked shooter, Spec Ops: The Line, where three soldiers are stranded in a wrecked Dubai facing a crowd of angry locals. In a scene reminiscent of the Black Hawk Down incident, they must decide whether to shoot their way out or face death. Although actually, it&apos;s more interesting than that, because the first shot fired sends the group fleeing \u2013 something the player won&apos;t know until they commit to pulling the trigger. And vitally, those who point their gun in the air before firing get the same dispersal effect without casualties. In the heat of the game, facing a furious mob, many players will take the lethal option \u2013 but they sure as hell think about it. It is these sorts of split-second decisions that really suggest something about the complexities of combat. But then, of course, these examples offer more than a mere punishment mechanic \u2013 which is what the ICRC seems to be asking for. If all transgressions automatically lead to failure, it&apos;s a zero-sum game that invites only functional thinking. Players need to be able to live with the consequences of actions in more subtle ways. In both Heavy Rain and Walking Dead, players face lethal moral decisions that don&apos;t end the game, or even have ludic consequences for the player, but yet play on the mind and colour the experience. The game may be over but the choices remain \u2013 and by ending chapter of Waking Dead with a guide to the actions of other players, developer Telltale Games cleverly addresses and confronts the process. Often the most affecting moments are those hidden in momentary or supplementary features. The ability to name characters in titles like Cannon Fodder and XCOM, for example, provided a heightened level of emotional attachment for many players. The way we learn little snippets about the lives of the characters passing through our border gates in Papers, Please. The way that mobile phone hacking lets us see into the personal problems of potential targets in Watch Dogs. In games, moral depth is much more about humanisation than it is about punishment. The latter is too intricately tied in with atavistic gameplay systems for us to extrapolate anything deeper than game over. We are, though, surely heading into an era where gamers will have to take greater responsibility for their actions \u2013 if only because the visual fidelity will be there to splatter our violent failings across the screen in HD detail. In Operation Wolf, accidentally machine gunning a glitching sprite that vaguely resembled a non-military human could be easily divorced from the reality of armed conflict. In Battlefield 5 or Call of Duty 27, it may not be so simple to dismiss the sight of a photo-realistic person lying in the dust, eyes rolling back, limbs spasming.      Battlefield 4  \u2013 the siege of Shanghai level    I don&apos;t even think that&apos;s what the ICRC wants \u2013 it doesn&apos;t want moral doubt to arise purely through aesthetics, it wants designers to think about international law, and about how warfare should operate. It wants developers to say, in this mission you must fly an armed drone over a school where terrorists are known to be hiding, and you must decide whether to open fire. And it wants players to understand the consequences of such an action, not just in terms of the score or progress, but in terms of the real world of warfare \u2013 the one that all military games reflect and fetishise..", "title": "Should gamers be accountable for in-game war crimes?", "sentences": ["Much more intriguing, though, is the scene in Yager Development&apos;s criminally overlooked shooter, Spec Ops: The Line, where three soldiers are stranded in a wrecked Dubai facing a crowd of angry locals."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-03T09:55:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/03/us-iran-talks-threatened-congress-sanctions", "tags": ["Iran", "US news", "US foreign policy", "Obama administration", "Barack Obama", "World news", "US Congress", "United Nations", "European Union"], "article": "Negotiations over Iran&apos;s nuclear program could be undermined by a reluctance on the part of the US Congress to relax a complex network of economic sanctions, according to experts and diplomats monitoring forthcoming talks in Geneva. Meetings between Iran and six leading powers are scheduled to begin in Switzerland in two weeks, following a sustained effort on the part of Iran&apos;s new president, Hassan Rouhani, to mend relations with the west and secure a deal that would ease debilitating sanctions. On Thursday, Wendy Sherman, the US under-secretary of state for political affairs, said Iran could expect some limited relief from sanctions if it took confidence-building steps to allay concerns about its nuclear ambitions. However, the vast network of overlapping US sanctions, which have built up over three decades, cannot be easily unpicked by the Obama administration without the support of both houses of Congress.  &quot;If \u2013 and it is a big &apos;if&apos; \u2013 the president needs to use an easing of sanctions to provide incentive to the Iranians, or to acknowledge a gesture on their part, our feeling is: it will be very difficult for the administration to deliver that,&quot; one senior European diplomat said. Hawks in the House of Representatives in particular are in no mood to compromise. Two months ago, with bipartisan support, the House passed a bill to tighten the economic noose on Iran. The Guardian has obtained a copy of a second draft bill that goes further: approving the use of military force to deter Iran from developing nuclear weapons. The bill states that the US would be &quot;wholly capable, willing and ready to use military force to prevent Iran from obtaining or developing a nuclear weapons capability&quot; and offers &quot;consent&quot; to the president should he wish to take action. Trent Franks, the conservative congressman behind the bill, told the Guardian that it was designed to strengthen the president&apos;s hand during talks and &quot;inject into the discussion the importance of Mr Obama not making a bad deal \u2013 because a bad deal is worse than no deal at all&quot;. Giving evidence before a Senate committee on Thursday, Sherman urged lawmakers to hold off on imposing more sanctions before a meeting with Iranian officials in Geneva on 15 and 16 October. The UK, Germany, France, Russia and China will all participate in the talks, but it is accepted the most important negotiations will be bilateral meetings between Iran&apos;s delegation and the US. Technical experts from all six countries are meeting in the coming days, as a prelude to the talks. Ramin Asgard, a consultant who previously ran the State Department&apos;s Iran desk in Dubai \u2013 the US government&apos;s primary field office monitoring Tehran \u2013 said &quot;a major transformation&quot; would be required on Capitol Hill, which has &quot;gotten used to the narrative of Iran being this threat and negative actor&quot;. It would require a &quot;sea change&quot; in congressional attitudes to get a deal through, he said. The basic contours of an agreement are expected to involve Iran opening up to rigorous inspections, destroying stockpiles of 2% enriched uranium and committing to a civilian nuclear program, in return for sanctions relief, although Iran has indicated it may have new proposals. An early barometer of how serious Iran is, is likely to occur prior to the official meeting in Geneva, when the foreign minister, Javad Zarif, is expected to circulate formal ideas that will form the start of talks. &quot;I hope they present us with some ideas in advance of that so that when we sit down to work we&apos;re not beginning without some grist to the mill,&quot; a senior State Department official said. Any deal over Iran&apos;s nuclear program would be months or even years away, but it would likely be contingent upon the Obama administration selling an Iranian deal to Congress. With EU sanctions closely bound with those imposed by the US, and international companies unlikely to do business with Iran unless permitted to do so by all major powers, other countries will be heavily dependent upon developments in Washington, diplomats say. Suzanne Maloney, senior fellow at the Saban Center for Middle East Policy, at the Brookings Institution thinktank, said US Treasury officials, who have spent years trying to find ways to better enforce sanctions, are scrambling to consider how they might quickly alleviate those restrictions if negotiations with Iran go well. &quot;Even early progress, even minor steps, will require an enormous amount of work on the part of the administration \u2013 work that, as far as I&apos;m told, has not yet been prepared.&quot; Maloney and other officials indicated that the administration does have some room for manoeuvre, particularly under presidential waiver authority, but a final deal would almost certainly need congressional backing. Another diplomatic source said the US administration had control over &quot;significant enough portions&quot; of the sanctions to incentivise the Iranian side. &quot;If they feel they need to offer something, they can \u2013 and they can act on it,&quot; the source said. &quot;Congress will choose how to handle the sanctions it has put in place.&quot; The State Department&apos;s deputy spokeswoman, Marie Harf, said this week that Iran&apos;s desire to improve the economic situation in the country was at the heart of the nuclear talks. &quot;Obviously, sanctions play into that, and we&apos;ll keep working with Congress on the best way to do all of this going forward,&quot; she said. However, it is not clear whether Congress \u2013 and in particular hardline Republicans currently calling the shots in the House \u2013 will back any final deal, particularly within the timeframe of six months being mooted by Iran. The bill that passed the House at the end of July, the Nuclear Iran Prevention Act 2013, which proposes a dramatic tightening of sanctions, is now with the Senate. One provision seeks to reduce Iran&apos;s exports of oil by a further million barrels a day which, if current estimates of its oil sales are believed, would reduce its exports to near zero. It is currently being held at the Senate banking committee, apparently out of consideration for the forthcoming talks, but would &quot;probably get through tomorrow&quot; if it was put to a wider vote, Maloney said. The author of the bill, Ed Royce, the Republican chairman of the foreign affairs committee, responded to Iran&apos;s diplomatic offensive at the United Nations last week by saying that Congress should &quot;double down&quot; on sanctions. Trent Franks plans to introduce his new bill approving of military force against Iran through the same committee next week. Catherine Ashton, the EU foreign policy chief, made clear on Monday she would prefer the US not impose additional sanctions before the nuclear talks. &quot;I would like to get to Geneva with the best possible atmosphere to really have these negotiations,&quot; she said. This week&apos;s government shutdown underscored the influence wielded by conservatives in the Republican-dominated House, and the stronghold rightwingers have over the Republican speaker of the House, John Boehner. Franks said that he and others in the Tea Party caucus would be inclined to disbelieve any Iranian promises made during negotiations \u2013 and would not be easily persuaded of the need to lift or even ease sanctions on Iran any time soon. &quot;I don&apos;t think we would be very amenable,&quot; he said. &quot;I think Speaker Boehner understands the gravity of the situation.&quot;", "title": "Hopes raised for US-Iran talks but opposition in Congress threatens any deal", "sentences": ["Ramin Asgard, a consultant who previously ran the State Department&apos;s Iran desk in Dubai \u2013 the US government&apos;s primary field office monitoring Tehran \u2013 said &quot;a major transformation&quot; would be required on Capitol Hill, which has &quot;gotten used to the narrative of Iran being this threat and negative actor&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-03T17:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/03/kieren-fallon-owner-blocked-derby-ride", "tags": ["Kieren Fallon", "Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe", "Aidan O'Brien", "British Horseracing Authority", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Kieren Fallon will team up with the leading owner Ibrahim Araci at Ascot on Saturday for the first time since the two men were involved in a dramatic high court action on the morning of the 2011 Derby which forced Fallon to watch the race from the sidelines. Fallon will ride the Hugo Palmer-trained Ascription in the Betfred Challenge Cup if connections decide there is enough ease in the ground. It would finally draw a line under a dispute which ended up in the court of appeal when a judge ruled that Fallon should not be allowed to switch to take up an offer to ride for Aidan O&apos;Brien. Fallon had previously signed a \u00a310,000 retainer with Araci, agreeing to ride any horse belonging to the owner if requested. Despite the Araci-owned colt Native Khan being a contender for the Derby, however, Fallon announced his decision to ride Recital. Johnny Murtagh was booked to replace him, but Araci went to court to force Fallon to uphold a clause in his agreement that he would not compete against one of the owner&apos;s horses if he had been offered the chance to ride. The jockey has not ridden for Araci or O&apos;Brien since. Two weeks later, in a BBC interview with the presenter Clare Balding at Royal Ascot, Fallon said that everything was &quot;cool again&quot; with Araci and that he hoped to ride for the owner again in the future. It will have taken more than two years, however, for him to do so. &quot;We don&apos;t want to make too much of it,&quot; Rob Speers, Araci&apos;s racing manager, said on Thursday. &quot;There is top-class racing all over Europe this weekend, Ascription is a very important horse who is rated 109 and hopefully still on the upgrade, we&apos;ve gone for the best jockey available and Kieren fits that bill. He&apos;s a top-class jockey and Ascription&apos;s a very good horse. &quot;To win a handicap like that off top weight, you need everything in your favour but if he gets his conditions, we&apos;re hopeful that he can be very competitive.&quot; Three horses were added to the field for Sunday&apos;s Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe at the penultimate declaration stage on Thursday. As expected, both Treve, the Prix Vermeille winner and current second-favourite, and Leading Light, who took the St Leger at Doncaster in mid-September, were supplemented, along with Meandre, the recent winner of the Group One Preis Von Europa at Cologne. Treve, who was due to be ridden by Frankie Dettori until the jockey fractured an ankle in a fall on Wednesday, will be partnered by Thierry Jarnet, while Gerald Mosse has been booked to ride Leading Light in place of Joseph O&apos;Brien, his jockey at Doncaster, who cannot make the required weight. In all, there are 19 runners still engaged in the Arc, although there is a final chance to scratch before the stalls are drawn on Friday morning. John Gosden&apos;s The Fugue, who prefers fast ground, is the runner whose participation remains in most doubt with going on the soft side of good expected at the weekend. Ray Cochrane, Dettori&apos;s agent, said on Thursday that the jockey hopes to be fit in time for the Dubai Carnival in early 2014. &quot;Frankie&apos;s still in quite a lot of pain,&quot; Cochrane said. &quot;He was still in plenty of discomfort [this morning] and the difficulty is he has done a lot of soft tissue damage around the ankle which affects the tendons and muscle fibres. Sometimes you are better off with a [clean] break. &quot;It&apos;s too early to say when he&apos;ll be back riding, but I imagine he&apos;ll be aiming for the Dubai Carnival. &quot;I haven&apos;t spoken to him about this, but the Sheikh [Joaan al-Thani, who retains Dettori] will have a few nice horses going out there so that will probably be his aim.&quot; The British Horseracing Authority said on Thursday that it hopes to achieve &quot;uniformity&quot; among the main racing nations on the use of anabolic steroids in training when the issue is discussed at the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities annual conference in Paris next week. Earlier this year, Mahmood al-Zarooni was banned for eight years after he was found to have doped at least 22 horses, including last year&apos;s St Leger winner Encke, with steroids at his Moulton Paddocks stable in Newmarket. Both Dubai and Australia have since announced tighter rules on the use of steroids, with Australia due to introduce a blanket ban which includes pre-training facilities from 1 November. &quot;Announcements regarding changes by the authorities in Dubai and, more recently, Australia and New Zealand are welcome and have added momentum to the debate,&quot; Paul Bitter, the BHA&apos;s chief executive, said on Thursday. &quot;The events of this year, together with the inconsistencies that exist across racing nations, have made it apparent that the control and regulation of the use of anabolic steroids in racing is a complex issue.

The Dutchman came to Craven Cottage as the manager in the summer of 2011 to build something exciting and yet, in the face of myriad challenges, the majority of them underpinned by financial restrictions, he has found himself barging through the doors at the last-chance saloon. Jol has his pride and the big-club pedigree, having previously taken charge at Tottenham Hotspur, Hamburg and Ajax. Scrapping at the wrong end of the table, at a club that has not demonstrated the capacity for serious investment during his tenure, is surely not his idea of satisfaction. Fulham do not want to sack him. That much has been made clear this week, in the wake of last Saturday&apos;s tortuous injury-time home defeat to Cardiff City. They want to give him the chance to turn things around. And yet no one is kidding themselves. If results do not pick up immediately, the new owner, Shahid Khan, will have no alternative. The visit of Mark Hughes&apos;s Stoke City on Saturday has assumed do-or-die significance for Jol and it is a quirk of fate that he could be pressed to the exit by his Fulham predecessor, the man who walked out on the club because of what he felt was a lack of ambition. Jol is not a quitter. But when he reflects on his situation, any regrets may mirror those that Hughes felt. It is a truism of the Premier League that you generally get what you pay for and a prime example right now is Arsenal and Mesut \u00d6zil. Jol&apos;s net spend on permanent signings across his five transfer windows at Fulham is roughly \u00a34m. The club have lived within their means, which is commendable on one level but deeply frustrating on others. The decision to lavish \u00a310.6m on Bryan Ruiz from FC Twente in Jol&apos;s first summer seems as though lifted from a different age. Jol&apos;s charge has come to be characterised by the hunt for loans, frees and bargains; for players who have lost sight of their best form but retain the potential to be built back up. He has largely been unable to buy the 24-year-olds that he wants and, consequently, he has looked towards the more seasoned end of the market. This summer, Jol paid fees for Maarten Stekelenburg (\u00a35m), Scott Parker (\u00a33m), Elsad Zverotic (\u00a3300,000) and Sascha Riether (\u00a31.2m to turn the loan into a permanent transfer). He picked up Fernando Amorebieta and Derek Boateng on frees; Adel Taarabt and Darren Bent on loan. There were a glut of players released but at least there were no damaging departures like those of Moussa Demb\u00e9l\u00e9 and Clint Dempsey from the previous summer. They joined Tottenham for a combined \u00a321m. Jol has had to finesse his contacts and persuade players that he knows, and has worked with in the past, to sign. Bizarrely, this has been held against him, as though it is a reflection of a type of short-sightedness. He did not pay over the odds for Stekelenburg, Parker, Taarabt, Bent or Dimitar Berbatov, who joined in the summer of last year from Manchester United for \u00a35m and it is questionable what the alternatives might have been. Berbatov&apos;s 15 league goals last season were invaluable. Jol&apos;s other old boys, who have since left Fulham, have been Mladen Petric, Urby Emanuelson and Eyong Enoh. The former arrived as a free agent; the other two on loan. Only one client of Jol&apos;s agent, Mino Raiola, has completed a permanent move to Craven Cottage during his tenure \u2013 Pajtim Kasami, who signed for \u00a31.5m from Palermo in July 2011. Jol respects the club&apos;s chief executive, Alistair Mackintosh, who has a burgeoning reputation in the game as a tough negotiator and shrewd market operator. He even feels a sense of loyalty towards him. Mackintosh is always positive and it is believed that he is sympathetic to the plight of Jol and the team. The margins so far this season have been fiendishly tight. Khan, who is based in the United States, talks to Mackintosh every day and it is fair to say he is feeling his way into English football and its attendant idiosyncrasies following his takeover from Mohamed Al Fayed on 12 July. He signed off the deals for Parker, Taarabt, Bent and Zverotic, the back-up full-back, and he appears to be taking a prudent line. His business model is in keeping with the Premier League&apos;s other US-based owners. Khan has already toppled one MJ at Craven Cottage, having ordered the removal of the Michael Jackson statue. Everything that could have gone wrong for Jol so far this season has done, apart from the opening day victory at Sunderland. The problems in his team have been exposed, such as the slowness of the defence and the lack of pressing from the front and there have been cruel cuts at virtually every turn. The late winners for Newcastle United and Cardiff, together with West Bromwich Albion&apos;s injury-time equaliser, have deprived the club of a fistful of points and they currently sit above only Crystal Palace and Sunderland. The injuries have been a factor. All of the new faces from the summer \u2013 with the exception of Zverotic \u2013 have been stricken at various stages, with Stekelenburg, who hurt his shoulder at Sunderland, still out and there now being the suggestion that he could require surgery. Kieran Richardson, Jol&apos;s first-choice left-back, has also suffered along with Ruiz and Berbatov. Jol has heard criticism for his lack of faith in youth, despite his promotion from the academy of Alex Kacaniklic and his use of Kasami. He has high hopes for Chris David, Buomesca Tue Na Banga and the 16-year-old England youth striker Patrick Roberts, among others. Jol includes six or seven academy players in first-team training every Monday. The club&apos;s move for Rene Meulensteen has provided a further talking point. Jol recommended that they appoint the former Manchester United No2 as his assistant \u2013 he knows and likes Meulensteen, his compatriot, who was sacked as the Anzhi Makhachkala manager in August \u2013 and the initial contact took place three weeks ago. Meulensteen, who has other offers, turned Fulham down and took himself off to Dubai to consider his options. Khan, Mackintosh and Jol have each attempted to persuade Meulensteen to change his mind and join them. And yet, for Jol, there appears to be a catch. If Meulensteen did sign and Jol could not improve results, Khan would have a managerial replacement already on the staff. Jol is into the final year of his contract and he fights on. His first two seasons at the club were broadly successful, with ninth and 12th-placed finishes but the trenches have been dug for a struggle. With or without Jol, it will not be easy.", "title": "Martin Jol does not deserve to be in Fulham's last-chance saloon | David Hytner", "sentences": ["Meulensteen, who has other offers, turned Fulham down and took himself off to Dubai to consider his options."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-04T10:49:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2013/oct/06/oil-theft-costs-nigeria", "tags": ["Natural resources and development", "Nigeria", "Global development", "Governance", "Royal Dutch Shell", "Oil", "Commodities", "Business", "Oil", "Energy", "Environment", "Oil and gas companies", "Energy industry", "Africa", "World news"], "article": "     The flames roared 20 metres above the Niger delta swamp for 48 hours; 6,000 barrels of crude oil spilled into the creeks and waterways around the village of Bodo and several people died. But although the Nigerian army and navy were stationed just 100 metres from the site of the massive explosion, no one knows \u2013 or will say \u2013 what really happened to Nigeria&apos;s most important oil pipeline around 2am on 19 June. It could have been an accident. The Trans Niger pipeline, which transports around 150,000 barrels a day of crude oil from wells across the Niger delta through the creeks and impoverished villages of Ogoniland and Ogu-Bolo to the giant oil terminal at Bonney, is rusting, nearly 50 years old and known to spring leaks. But it is also one of the most sabotaged pipelines in the world with local communities accused by Shell of making over 20 attempts to tap oil from it in the last year. Company contractors had been repairing one section of the pipeline when the explosion happened but the official investigation team believes that the accident followed a botched attempt to steal tens of thousands of barrels of crude oil. Even as one group of engineers was removing illegal taps on the line, another group is thought to have been installing equipment to allow huge amounts of oil to be siphoned straight into large barges where it would be taken out to sea to waiting tankers bound for Europe and the US. &quot;From the moment I got to the scene [the next day] I was suspicious,&quot; says Catholic priest Father Obi, appointed by Shell to be an official observer for the Bodo investigation. &quot;The scene had been hurriedly deserted. Shell must have known what was going on. The military must have known. Everyone knew there was complicity. I am personally sure that Shell knew that its oil was being stolen. If the managers did not know, then those who they put in charge [of the operation]seemed to know. This [theft] could not have happened without the collusion of the authorities and the military.&quot; Obi is concerned that the official report has still not been published and is threatening to release his own. It all adds up to organised crime stealing oil using the cover of the authorities, he says. &quot;Why was a massive barge able to hold 10,000 barrels of oil being loaded at 2am with crude? Why did another catch fire? Why were excavators there? Why were local observers arrested the next day, their cameras confiscated and memory cards destroyed? Were the thieves being protected by the military? Was the company paying workers to clean up oil spilled in the process of theft they themselves were engaged in? Did Shell know its oil was being stolen from under its nose?&quot; he asks. In a statement, Shell accepted its oil was being stolen when the accident happened but strongly denied any collusion or knowledge of who might be responsible. Shell Nigeria&apos;s managing director, Mutiu Sunmonu, said: &quot;Unknown persons continued to reconnect illegal bunkering hoses at Bodo West even as our pipeline team were removing crude theft points.&quot; But the company has yet to make public its own investigation. &quot;We are not aware of any direct involvement [in the Bodo explosion] but we would take legal action if anything was discovered,&quot; adds a spokesman for the company in Port Harcourt. &quot;One has to understand there is this accusation that the oil industry employees are behind this, but there are thousands of people who have the skills who may have been working with the industry over the years. These people are outside and some of them may be for hire. There is a sophisticated organisation, clearly it is not just local. There has to be a wide network,&quot; says Philip Mshelbila, head of Shell communications in Lagos. The Bodo explosion is significant because it shows how oil theft in Nigeria has reached an industrial scale. It is now undermining Africa&apos;s second-biggest economy and ranks with the drugs trade as the most lucrative crime in the world. According to President Goodluck Jonathan, 300,000-400,000 barrels of oil per day, or more than 10% of all Nigeria&apos;s production, is being lost at a cost to the state and oil companies of around \u00a31bn a month \u2013 more than is spent on education and the health of the nation&apos;s 168 million people. Not only is Nigerian oil theft helping to keep the world price of oil high, it is causing corruption and social disorder, says the president. &quot;The figures are huge. [Oil theft]could destabilise Nigeria. The business is worth billions of dollars a year. It is on an industrial scale, and involves commodity traders, international [criminals] and a whole network of people. There are some allegations that the oil companies themselves are implicated,&quot; says presidential aide Ken Saro-Wiwa, whose father, along with other Ogoni chiefs, was executed in 1995 after a peaceful protest against Shell. Mshelbila says: &quot;We [Shell] are losing 40-60,000 barrels of oil a day. This is just what we know is stolen from the trunk lines. We have to shut down lines, so, taken together it&apos;s probably 300,000-400,000 barrels a day. We are seeing more illegal connections, more frequent shutdowns than one year ago.&quot; According to a report from the foreign affairs thinktank Chatham House, oil is being stolen not just from pipelines but from tank farms, export terminals, refinery storage tanks, jetties, ports, pipelines, and wellheads. &quot;Officials and private actors disguise theft through manipulation of meters and shipping documents. Proceeds are laundered through world financial centres and used to buy assets in and outside Nigeria, polluting markets and financial institutions overseas, and creating reputational, political and legal hazards,&quot; it says. Much of the stolen oil is exported to foreign refineries or storage facilities, says the report, including buyers in West Africa, the US, Brazil, China, Singapore, Thailand, Indonesia and the Balkans. The proceeds appear to be laundered through banks and other channels in various African countries, Dubai, Indonesia, India, Singapore, the US, the UK, and Switzerland. The scale of the &quot;bunkering&quot; has shocked observers. Thirty centimetre pipelines able to transport thousands of barrels of oil a day have been found leading straight from pipelines into the swamps. The Nigerian navy had to sack two admirals for their role in the disappearance of a tanker that had been seized for transporting 11,000 tonnes of stolen crude. &quot;A lot of big-time stealing goes on. You know the oil you are offered is stolen,&quot; says one oil trader in Port Harcourt who asks to remain anonymous. &quot;They give it to you without documents at a cheaper rate. I was offered 50,000 litres today for 55 naira (20p) a litre. But 75 nairais the cheapest you can get it from the government. You know it&apos;s a racket. There is no chance of getting caught because there is no system to catch people. Big business is big politics.&quot; He alleges that the Nigerian military has become deeply implicated in oil theft since an amnesty was declared with militants two years ago. &quot;The military now control the oil platforms, not the militants. People now have to buy oil directly from the military. The military is a chain of command, so I can only assume this goes to the very top. Oil theft used to be about people breaking into pipes. That is not happening any more. If I want to load 200 tonnes of crude, I would have to pay for a lot of security. It is far easier to go straight to the military.&quot; Most of the oil is being stolen by the rich, he says. &quot;It is dishonest for government and the oil companies to blame the poor for stealing the oil. The people in the communities are just the foot soldiers. Clearly this is a sophisticated organisation. Where do people get vessels, the money for bribes and security? It costs millions. What the poor take is very small. The racket goes deep into the security and political systems. Tens of thousands of tonnes of oil is being spirited away every week. All the authorities are involved \u2013 the oil companies, the military, the politicians. There&apos;s plenty of money to be made so everyone is in it.&quot; Research by delta non-government group Stakeholder Democracy Network (SDN) estimates that 75% of the stolen oil is being exported with the rest being refined in illegal &quot;artisanal refineries&quot;. More than 500 of these are known to have been set up in the last five years, taking stolen crude and refining it into a rough diesel for local sale. According to SDN, a medium-sized illegal refinery costs around \u00a33,000 to set up but can earn that back in a few weeks. But the operators need to pay hefty bribes to the police and military, as well as to buy oil tapped off the 1,600km of pipelines that cross the delta. Each tapping point, says SDN, can earn more than \u00a3500,000 a month but its investors must pay armed guards, the military, contractors, local communities and even oil company staff. Delta communities freely admit their role in the theft of oil but blame continuing poverty and pollution for their actions. &quot;The government and oil companies are collecting our oil and we don&apos;t have jobs, or money so we have to collect the oil and refine our own,&quot; says a man in the village of Bolo near where an illegal refinery was set up five years ago. Bolo leaders admit that the military was paid off. &quot;When the refinery was working it used to refine around 10,000 litres of oil a day. It could only operate with the help of the police and military, The pay-off system to the armed forces and police was well organised. It was a plum posting for the military here. Most army have a lifestyle that you cannot explain,&quot; says Mela Oforibika, a lawyer and chief of the Bolo community. &quot;This place was booming. Every house was rented out. Thirty people had jobs. Young men came in who knew the art of distillation. What moral right did I have to stop them? It brought us money. The bars were full, the economy benefited.&quot; But the pollution from the illegal refineries was extreme because no one knew how to safely dispose of the waste residues from the diesel-making process. The Bolo refinery on the small island of Odokian was raided by the military five months ago, possibly because the consortium who owned it refused to pay the authorities for protection. Today, the four-acre site stinks of oil and may never recover. It is saturated with waste oil, the palm trees are blackened by fire and there are no fish in the waterways. Rusting pipes, burned-out oil drums and old metal tanks litter several acres of what was lush farmland. Community chiefs blame the oil companies and government for the pollution rather than the refiners. &quot;There&apos;s a heavy level of unemployment here. People knew what was happening to the environment, but what is the alternative for the young men? The illegal refineries were set up as a direct result of the wickedness of Shell and the oil companies who polluted the waterways and never compensated us. The refineries have been destroyed but they will come back. How long can you keep armies to police these communities? We would never have allowed these [refineries] to come into our area if we had been properly compensated before,&quot; says Boma Ipiurima Asitonka, a Bolo teacher. &quot;You cannot abandon people like this. If there was work here, no one would have made this pollution,&quot; says Oisiekel Tubomie, chief of Bolo youth council. The only solution to oil theft is to give people a stake in the oil, say the chiefs. &quot;We propose that the government sets up and licenses legal, mini-refineries in dozens of villages and sells them oil at cost price so they can profit, provide jobs and diesel for the communities. It would destroy the criminality and end the pollution,&quot; says Oforibika. But this is not an option for the oil companies, who must operate in an increasingly volatile environment bristling with guns. Shell plans to spend \u00a31bn building a new, more secure loop for the Trans Niger pipeline to bypass Ogoniland and areas where its present one is regularly sabotaged. &quot;If the government and the oil companies spent a fraction of what they lose to theft on developing the delta communities, they would not have these problems of theft. As it stands, the oil industry is run by a very small elite for a very few people. If nothing changes, the future here is bleak,&quot; says Oforibika. \u2022 This article was amended on 7 October 2013 to correct the name of the delta non-government group\u2022 This article was amended on 9 October to clarify that Shell is losing 40-60,000 barrels a day, not 60-80,000 as previously stated", "title": "\u00a31bn a month: the spiralling cost of oil theft in Nigeria", "sentences": ["The proceeds appear to be laundered through banks and other channels in various African countries, Dubai, Indonesia, India, Singapore, the US, the UK, and Switzerland."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-05T23:04:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/06/treve-winner-prix-de-larc-de-triomphe1", "tags": ["Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe", "Frankie Dettori", "Horse racing", "Sport", "Treve"], "article": "Breeding matters in Flat racing, not just in the horses but also in those who create and care for them. Treve, who won the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe here by five lengths on Sunday, was born with immense natural talent but she had the good fortune as well to be bred, raised and trained by two generations of the Head family, surely as accomplished a racing dynasty as there has been on the turf, in France or anywhere else. Had bitter misfortune not intervened, it would have been Frankie Dettori soaking up the applause on the way back to the winner&apos;s enclosure. Dettori, the retained rider for Treve&apos;s owner, Sheikh Joaan al-Thani, fractured his ankle when he was unseated before a race at Nottingham last Wednesday. Treve won so easily for Thierry Jarnet, his replacement, that she would almost certainly have done the same for Dettori or any jockey with a licence. Twelve months after being beaten here on Camelot, a ride which effectively terminated his 20-year association with the Godolphin operation, and four months after his return from a six-month ban for using cocaine, it would have been a moment of supreme vindication for Dettori. But it would have distracted, too, from the achievement of Criquette Head-Maarek, who welcomed back her second Arc winner 34 years after the first, Three Troikas, in 1979. Three Troikas, too, was a filly and, again like Treve, a product of the Head family&apos;s stud, the Haras du Quesnay in Normandy. Alec Head, Criquette&apos;s father, trained four Arc winners himself and now has yet another as a breeder. Alec Head, who is now 89, was moved to tears by the occasion as a horse-drawn carriage took Treve&apos;s connections out into the middle of the track for the prize presentation. It was more than just the emotion of the moment, however, that prompted him to insist afterwards that of all the excellent fillies he has bred or trained over more than half a century Treve is the best. This appeared beforehand to be one of the finest renewals of the Arc for at least a decade and, while Treve beat her field with ease thanks to an irresistible burst of speed at the top of the home straight, that is no reason to suggest that it was not as strong as it seemed. The &quot;right&quot; horses finished in the frame, including the Japanese-trained favourite Orfevre, who finished second last year after veering to his right with victory in sight but was simply no match for his younger opponent. Intello, the French Derby winner, was another neck away in third and Kizuna, the Japanese Derby winner, was fourth. Not one horse from this high-class field could raise any kind of challenge to Treve, who started from a difficult high draw \u2013 15th out of 17 \u2013 and could get no cover in the early stages, which left her pulling for her head as a result. If she was wasting energy, it made no difference. &quot;I thought before the race that she had six gears,&quot; Head-Maarek said afterwards. &quot;Now I know that she has seven.&quot; Treve is unlikely to race again this season but she remains unbeaten after five starts and Head-Maarek is more than hopeful that Sheikh Joaan will keep her in training for another season in an attempt to become the first horse since Alleged to win back-to-back Arcs. She is also a reason for Dettori to look forward to next season, when he is expected to make an early start to the campaign at Dubai&apos;s Carnival meeting. &quot;I want to say thank you to Frankie Dettori, as he rode an amazing race on her in the Prix Vermeille [last month],&quot; Head-Maarek said. &quot;I said to save her for today and that&apos;s what he did. I&apos;m sorry he is not here today. &quot;I told Jarnet to hide himself and he took a position on the outside but she&apos;s so good, she&apos;s incredible. To do that and stay unbeaten like that, she&apos;s the best I&apos;ve ever had. When horses are that good, numbers [the draw] make no difference and the ground makes no difference. &quot;He [Jarnet] said that she was travelling so easily that he just let her do what she likes to do and then quicken like she does. &quot;I was scared of the horses behind herbut she is good and, when fillies are good, they are very good. &quot;I&apos;m so proud for Papa, who bred her, and for the Sheikh also, because when he bought her, he said, &apos;I want to win the Arc with her.&apos; I said, &quot;I can&apos;t promise but I&apos;ll do my best and, with a filly like that, the trainer looks good.&quot; Al Kazeem, who stayed on into sixth place from the worst draw of all, did best of the two-British trained runners in the Arc, on an afternoon when not one of the seven Group One events on the card was won by a British yard. The most significant performance outside the Arc itself came in the Prix de la Foret, won by Moonlight Cloud under Jarnet with an extraordinary burst of speed from well off the pace when Gordon Lord Byron, a proven Group One winner, appeared to have opened up a decisive lead inside the final furlong. Freddy Head, her trainer, said: &quot;I knew she was very well and, if it all went well, she would be hard to beat. For the moment we have no plans. &quot;Of course I&apos;d love her to stay in training but, at six, who knows? Nothing is definite. Thierry said she never had a hard race, so maybe she would be as good at six as she is at five. &quot;If she ran again, it would be over a mile in Hong Kong. Mr [George] Strawbridge [owner] is not keen on going to Santa Anita [for the Breeders&apos; Cup].&quot; Head, Criquette&apos;s brother, was on board when Three Troikas was victorious in 1979.

Aliyev took over the oil-rich Caucasus country in 2003 after the death of his father, Heydar, who was a KGB boss and the leader of communist Azerbaijan before becoming president of the independent nation. Western politicians and oil companies have courted Ilham Aliyev due to the vast oil resources of the Caspian Sea, and have turned a blind eye to what critics say are dictatorial tendencies. The fractured and disparate opposition to Aliyev has united ahead of Wednesday&apos;s election to select a single candidate, the academic and former MP Jamil Hasanli, who has pledged to lead the country for just two years and oversee a transition to proper democracy before holding fresh elections. There are eight other candidates running in addition to Aliyev and Hasanli but most are seen as &quot;fake challengers&quot;, broadly supportive of the president. Another more serious candidate, from the Republican Alternative party, was jailed in February on charges described as fabricated. &quot;Our platform is based on allowing people to live dignified lives in a normal, healthy society,&quot; Hasanli told the Guardian in a Skype interview from Baku. &quot;A teacher here earns about 120 euros a month. How can they lead a normal life with this money? Everywhere there is corruption, and it is headed by Aliyev and his family, with their castles in Dubai and their secret bank accounts.&quot; Investigative journalists in Azerbaijan have accused the first family and a coterie of ministers around Aliyevof having links to property abroad and multiple business projects inside the country. Aliyev&apos;s office has denied any wrongdoing but has been unable to dismiss specific allegations, notably that property in Dubai valued at millions of pounds has been bought in the name of his young son. Today&apos;s Baku astounds visitors who knew it a decade ago. Gone are the hulking Soviet buildings, and in their place have sprouted five-star hotels and Dubai-style skyscrapers. Young couples stroll across attractive cobbled squares dotted with fountains and lined with upmarket boutiques. Last year, the city hosted the Eurovision Song Contest amid much pomp and glamour in a purpose-built, 25,000-seat venue. But travel even a short distance, and the centre of Baku is revealed to be an island of wealth in a sea of poverty, where people eke out a living on subsistence wages. &quot;Aliyev said that he created more than a million jobs,&quot; says Hasanli. &quot;This is a lie. Putin said that there are two million Azeris living and working in Russia. That&apos;s half of our working-age population. Why can&apos;t these people find work, bread and a normal life in their own country?&quot; The regime has taken a tough line on dissent, detaining those who protest in Baku and using troops to put down isolated pockets of discontent in the regions. Rebecca Vincent, a former US diplomat in Baku who now works on human rights issues in the country, estimates that there are currently 142 political prisoners. A spokesman for Aliyev dismissed EU criticism of &quot;continued pressure&quot; on the opposition and civil society ahead of the election. &quot;We consider that their views are based on non-objective, one-sided and biased information, distorting the real situation of election process in Azerbaijan,&quot; said Ali Hasanov, insisting that the vote would take place in an atmosphere of openness and transparency. The last presidential elections, in 2008, saw Aliyev gain 88% of the vote, amid widespread allegations of malpractice. The constitution only allowed Aliyev two terms, but it was amended in 2009 to allow him to run again. The political opposition say this amendment was illegal. &quot;It is hard to say what would happen in a free and fair vote,&quot; says Vincent. &quot;Some people think Aliyev has enough support that he would win anyway, and others think he doesn&apos;t. Unfortunately, only the authorities will know the true results, while we will not.&quot; Aside from potential violations on election day, the media coverage on state television has also been skewed in the run up to the vote. &quot;The opposition candidates have been given 18 minutes a week on television, for the three weeks running up to the election, compared to hours every single day for years for Aliyev and his family,&quot; says Vincent. Hasanli said that in the event that he loses the election and believes the vote to have been unfair, he will do everything &quot;according to the law&quot; to protest. He said a protest rally would be organised in Baku as it was &quot;the right of the people&quot; to be able to protest.", "title": "Azerbaijan election marred by claims of corruption as dynasty looks set to win", "sentences": ["Everywhere there is corruption, and it is headed by Aliyev and his family, with their castles in Dubai and their secret bank accounts.&quot; Investigative journalists in Azerbaijan have accused the first family and a coterie of ministers around Aliyevof having links to property abroad and multiple business projects inside the country.", "Aliyev&apos;s office has denied any wrongdoing but has been unable to dismiss specific allegations, notably that property in Dubai valued at millions of pounds has been bought in the name of his young son.", "Gone are the hulking Soviet buildings, and in their place have sprouted five-star hotels and Dubai-style skyscrapers."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-07T15:01:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/07/tanzania-maasai-serengeti-wildlife-corridor", "tags": ["Tanzania", "Indigenous peoples", "Africa", "World news", "Global development"], "article": "Activists have claimed victory in a campaign to stop Tanzania evicting 40,000 Masai pastoralists from their ancestral land to make way for a big game hunting reserve for Dubai&apos;s royal family. Government officials had planned to annex 1,500 sq km bordering the Serengeti national park for a &quot;wildlife corridor&quot; that would benefit a luxury hunting and safari company based in the United Arab Emirates. But campaigners said ministers dropped the scheme after visiting the Masai, who complained that their livestock would be cut off from vital grazing pasture, as well as 18 months of co-ordinated protests that included a global petition signed by more than 1.7 million people. Samwel Nangiria, co-ordinator of the local Ngonett civil society group, said Tanzanian prime minister Mizengo Pinda spent two and a half days with the Masai in Loliondo district late last month. &quot;The Masai said we cannot lose this land at any cost \u2013 this land has been ours for centuries. &quot;The conclusion was that government has turned down the plan to evict tens of thousands of Masai. It&apos;s a big success story, not only for the Masai in Loliondo but also in Tanzania and east Africa.&quot; The Masai will now try to renew their legal rights and end long-running disputes over the land with the assistance of the land minister, Nangiria added. He was not aware if alternative arrangements had been made for the Ortelo Business Corporation (OBC), a safari company set up by a UAE official close to the royal family. &quot;The OBC called last week and wanted a meeting with us,&quot; he said. &quot;They are feeling very threatened, for sure.&quot; Nangiria paid tribute to a &quot;very sophisticated, high level&quot; campaign that was mounted in defence of the Masai with the help of methods old and new. It included a protest march, pressuring international donors to Tanzania, and adverts in the East African newspaper that warned that the Masai would reconsider their support for the government at the ballot box. The international effort was led by the online activism site Avaaz.org, whose Stop the Serengeti Sell-off petition attracted 1,775,320 signatures and led to targeted email and Twitter protests. It argued that the Masai would be robbed of their livelihoods if their land was used for the commercial hunting of prize game such as leopards and lions by UAE royals. Sam Barratt, a spokesman for Avaaz, said: &quot;It&apos;s been amazing. The government did all it could to stop this becoming a national story but I think the confidence of the Masai has grown and grown. We helped get it out internationally and it was tremendously successful.&quot; He added: &quot;This is a nomadic tribe thousands of years old that lives by ancient traditions, but modern technology unlocked their cause to the world.&quot; The Tanzanian government did not respond to requests for comment on Monday.", "title": "Tanzania ditches plan to evict Masai for Serengeti 'wildlife corridor'", "sentences": ["Activists have claimed victory in a campaign to stop Tanzania evicting 40,000 Masai pastoralists from their ancestral land to make way for a big game hunting reserve for Dubai&apos;s royal family."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-07T15:38:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/ceo-dubai-hotel-empire-luxury", "tags": ["Leadership", "Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainability", "Engaging employees", "Climate change", "Hotels", "Dubai holidays", "Waste and Recycling"], "article": "Luxury hotels are oases of opulence, even those in countries affected by climate change with scarce water resources. But, Gerald Lawless, CEO of luxury chain Jumeirah Hotels, a Dubai-based empire founded 16 years ago, explains that promoting sustainability is good housekeeping. Jumeirah recently published its first CSR report. Where does sustainability rank among your priorities? Sustainability is about more than just environmental factors. One of the great advantages we have in the hotel business, particularly in the luxury hotel business, is that each of our hotels is pretty much an individual property and business, as well as being part of the overall corporation. One of the examples we have is here in Dubai, where we work closely with the Dubai Turtle Rehabilitation Project. They care for many hawksbill turtles, which are an endangered species. Distressed turtles are gathered from beaches all around the Arabian Gulf and brought to the Burj Al Arab. There the turtles are nursed back to health by our own veterinarians, marine biologists and curators. When they recover we take them over to the sea water canals that connect the different hotels that make up our Arabian resort, Madinat Jumeirah. A growing number of boutique hotels use CO2-neutrality as a selling point. Is that something that Jumeirah could do as well? We&apos;re currently working on setting our initial targets so that we have a very clear measurement of our carbon footprint. We have many ongoing initiatives, particularly with regards to recycling aluminium, cooking oil, plastic and paper. We also have a system of recycling food waste within Madinat Jumeirah called the Bokashi system, whereby we create fertiliser for the gardens from both liquid and dry food waste. All large hotel companies, and that includes Jumeirah, are very keen to do the right thing with regards to the environment because we appreciate the benefit. It&apos;s good housekeeping anyway, and both our guests and employees are enthusiastic about it. For example, reusing towels and sheets in bedrooms. Originally we felt that asking guests to make the choice was not in line with luxury. It was the guests who took the initiative and told our employees, &quot;please don&apos;t change my sheets today.&quot; . Luxury hotels always provide nice bottles of shampoo and skin lotion. Can you do away with them or would the guests rebel? I think the market is evolving in that regard and certainly you see now in public toilets and washrooms where you have to squeeze the refillable bottles. I think these are very acceptable in public areas, but at this stage, for a luxury hotel, I&apos;d definitely like to keep our special bottles of shampoo. Jumeirah also runs the Emirates Hospitality School. How does sustainability feature on your curriculum? It&apos;s embedded in the subjects, and also forms part of Jumeirah&apos;s training courses. There are also innovations, for example in the area of energy-saving: using steam from laundries to heat water, which is efficient from both the energy and the water-conservation perspective. In fact, the whole conservation effort goes right back into the design of laundry facilities: minimising the use of chemicals, washing at lower temperatures, managing load sizes, recycling heat from other facilities When you build new hotels, is sustainable design something that is an important factor. If it&apos;s more expensive, would you opt for sustainable design? We do it on a case-by-case basis. Our philosophy is that it is better to put the capital in at the design stage to have an energy efficient construction because it&apos;s good for the environment and it&apos;s certainly much more cost-effective for the subsequent operation of the hotel. You&apos;re in charge of a Dubai-based empire. Are sustainability initiatives a harder sell there than in Europe? Sustainability has become a global consideration. Dubai has now issued a code of practice for minimum standards for all new buildings and their sustainability and insulation, which is very similar to the US-based Leed standard, so it&apos;s an easy sell. Owners do get it and very often the countries in which we operate already have pretty stringent regulations and recommendations with regards to building codes to ensure that the hotels are built to the best possible sustainable standards. You travel a lot. Do you offset your plane trips? I don&apos;t and this is something that really intrigues me as someone who is very involved in travel and tourism, particularly with the World Travel and Tourism Council and the World Economic Forum. I think that the airline business is a bit like the hotel business \u2013 everybody stays in a hotel, everybody flies in an airline. But when you look at carbon emissions, the airline industry is down at 1.7%, which is a lot less than the construction industry and less than non-aviation transport. I think everybody becomes very focused on what an airline might be putting into the environment and it&apos;s my responsibility to ensure that I keep a high awareness for the needs for good environmental practices both in my personal and business life. But rather than focusing on personal efforts to conserve energy and keep carbon dioxide emissions to a minimum, I&apos;d prefer to see the British government use some of the excessive amounts of tax they take through airport departure and airline passenger taxes in the UK to address broader environmental issues. I believe travel and tourism on one hand and environmental protection and sustainability on the other can support each other, for example in the labour market, with almost 10% of the world&apos;s labour force working in the sector. And with many entry level jobs available, there&apos;s scope to bring new employment opportunities to rural communities in the locations where hotels establish themselves. If you introduce very serious sustainability measures, are you afraid your customers would desert you? I don&apos;t think our commitment to sustainability diminishes our customers&apos; experience in any way. Instead, we&apos;re delivering more choice. But we don&apos;t have to take away the luxuries of life; we simply find ways of delivering them in a different way. It is important to remember that luxury isn&apos;t just about hedonism; it&apos;s also about recognising the sophistication of your customers, it&apos;s about engaging the customer, so ultimately they feel a lot better about staying with us because they know we have a responsible attitude towards the environment.

The abduction early Thursday comes amid anger among Libya&apos;s powerful Islamic militant groups over the US special forces raid on Saturday that seized a Libyan al-Qaida suspect known as Abu Anas al-Libi. Several groups accused the government of colluding in or allowing the raid, though the government denied having any prior knowledge of the operation. Hours before the abduction Zeidan had met with al-Libi&apos;s family, the Associated Press said. Abu Dhabi-based Sky News Arabia quoted Libyan security sources as saying that Zeidan was seized from the hotel and taken to an unknown destination. Dubai-based al-Arabiya carried a similar report.

Victory on Treve would have been Dettori&apos;s 200th at Group One level, had he not broken his ankle in a fall at Nottingham days beforehand. It would also have been an ideal way to conclude what has been a difficult season for the former champion jockey, who lost his long-standing retainer with the Godolphin operation at the end of last year and then served a six-month ban for testing positive for cocaine.

But he still jogs every day in east London. He talked to Nadeem Badshah about what running means to him and how he keeps himself in shape. I am physically active, walking, jogging and running for at least four hours a day. In the past, it was more running, some jogging, little bit of walking. Now it&apos;s a complete reverse. When I cannot do something, due to bad weather or travelling, I make up for it when I get back into my routine. It keeps my body and mind active. The last race I did was a 10K in Hong Kong in February during which I fell. I got up and finished five minutes faster than the previous year. I had the publicity, self-realisation, it was a fantastic race. As I crossed the line, all the claps and recognition gave me a lot of joy. I also realised it was my last race. My body is not as strong as it was. People who don&apos;t run don&apos;t realise it&apos;s not just about turning up. They forget you need to be strong even for the travel. When I go abroad, people say: &quot;Can we come?&quot; I say: &quot;Yes but I don&apos;t think you will last a day.&quot; I enjoyed being at peak fitness, although it wasn&apos;t easy to stay at the top. But I enjoyed that discipline. I went to my coach Harmander Singh&apos;s house recently. He was exhausted after running a marathon. I was pleased for him but I thought: &quot;I used to do that.&quot; Now I&apos;ve come to terms with the fact that I don&apos;t race any more. I make the best of what I&apos;ve got. I am still covering distances \u2013 although it might take a bit longer now. Running was God&apos;s way of distracting me from suffering mentally from the loss of my wife and son. Running took over my time and thoughts, it was God&apos;s way of keeping me alive and making me what I am today and I&apos;m grateful for that. I had no idea I would live this long and would achieve anything, it wasn&apos;t a plan. I bumped into people like Harmander who helped shape my life and got the best out of me. I am still benefiting from the 14 years of running and am able to enjoy life. Since February, I&apos;ve been to Australia, Las Vegas, Dubai, Denmark, Switzerland, France, and Luxembourg. At the Bournemouth Marathon festival, I was the celebrity starter for the children&apos;s races. I&apos;ve been invited to Washington for an award, and I&apos;ve been invited to New Delhi to start a sports tournament. As long as people remember me, don&apos;t forget what I&apos;ve done, and still there are things to do. It&apos;s more pain than gain, but that pain gives you happiness afterwards. I do not see it as putting myself through torture. Whatever pain and suffering I&apos;ve had, reaped benefits multiple times. Every day when I wake up I rub baby oil on my body to keep me supple. Every day I have linseed and a cup of tea. Before I leave home, I have plain yogurt and two glasses of water. Lunch is one chapatti and daal [lentils] made at the gurdwara with yoghurt. I won&apos;t touch cauliflower, rice, or sweets made of rice as it doesn&apos;t do me any good. At home, I will have whatever is being made with my youngest son and his family. If I don&apos;t like what they&apos;re having, I&apos;ll have toast with jam or honey on it. And before I go to bed I will have a glass of warm milk. I also have ginger curry at least once a week which cleanses the body. If I feel ill or different, I reflect on what has changed in my diet and routine. I am still active, in a better shape than those who are lazy. They are deteriorating, I am maintaining it so who is the winner? Being active is like a medication.

The Saudi-based Arab News reported this week that authorities in Kuwait&apos;s ministry of health have proposed &quot;genetic tests&quot; aimed at detecting transsexuals who wish to enter and work in Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar, where the 2022 football World Cup is scheduled to be held. Medical screening designed to determine the sex of migrant workers has already been in place for some time in some Arab countries but the new proposal specifically targets members of the transgender community. &quot;Undergoing the test will become mandatory for an estimated 289 health centres across the GCC if the health council approves the proposal of tighter controls on gender tests for migrant workers,&quot; Tawfiq Khojah, a GCC health official, told the English-language newspaper. In 2012, Khojah said, more than 2 million expatriates underwent the gender tests. It is not clear how doctors will determine the gender identity of migrants and whether the new tests will include physical checks. Arab News said the medical history of the workers would be used in determining their gender. The London-based human rights campaigner, Peter Tatchell, said the Kuwaiti proposal was unjust and discriminatory towards transgender people. &quot;Excluding expat workers because of their gender identity is immoral and doesn&apos;t make economic sense,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;People should be employed solely on the basis of their personal integrity and their ability to do the job. Trans people make perfectly good, reliable employees.&quot; The new proposal would also violate Fifa&apos;s non-discrimination values and prompts questions about Qatar&apos;s hosting of the 2022 tournament, Tatchell said. &quot;The proposals to test and ban foreign trans employees from the Gulf Co-operation countries will include Qatar and will penalise World Cup construction and hospitality staff from overseas who are trans,&quot; he said. &quot;If these plans get the go-ahead, Fifa should cancel the 2022 World Cup contract on the grounds that Qatar has violated Fifa&apos;s non-discrimination values. It should find a new host city for the 2022 tournament. Discrimination against trans people is incompatible with Fifa&apos;s commitment to equality for all.&quot; Earlier in the week, the Dubai-based Gulf News quoted a Kuwaiti health ministry official as saying that the clinical screening targets gay people. &quot;We will take stricter measures that will help us detect gays who will be then barred from entering Kuwait or any of the GCC member states,&quot; Yousuf Mindkar, the director of public health at Kuwait&apos;s ministry of health, told a local newspaper. Some Arab countries are particularly sensitive to tourists or workers with Aids. &quot;There is no known medical test to detect homosexuality. I wonder what quackery the Kuwaiti authorities plan to invent in their vain attempt to identify gay men. It simply won&apos;t work,&quot; Tatchell said. Unlike in most Arab countries, Iran legalised transsexuality after a 1987 fatwa by the late founder of the Islamic republic, Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. Iran and its Arab neighbours, however, criminalise homosexuality. Despite the legalisation in Iran, the social stigma means that transsexuals there enjoy almost no more immunity than those in the Arab countries. Iran permits more sex-change operations than any other country, except Thailand, and has long subsidised such surgeries.", "title": "Gulf countries consider medical checks to bar transgender expats", "sentences": ["Discrimination against trans people is incompatible with Fifa&apos;s commitment to equality for all.&quot; Earlier in the week, the Dubai-based Gulf News quoted a Kuwaiti health ministry official as saying that the clinical screening targets gay people."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-11T17:30:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/13/leighton-baines-ashley-cole-england-world-cup", "tags": ["England", "Poland", "World Cup 2014 qualifiers", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Leighton Baines was on the dock road in Liverpool, his family with him in the car and listening in on the hands-free when the call came that dashed the dream. Fabio Capello kept it short and simple, confirming the full-back&apos;s services would not be required at the 2010 World Cup in South Africa and expressing hope that they might work together again at some stage in the future. It was all over in 10 seconds. &quot;I was on my way to Toys R Us to buy a trampoline for the kids at the time,&quot; said Baines. &quot;So yes, it was strange.&quot; The ensuing talk of bouncing back in style was inevitable. This week provides Baines with a second chance to reach the finals, with England&apos;s aspirations to qualify automatically for Brazil to be played out against Poland on Tuesday. The Everton defender had mounted a late case for inclusion three years ago and was eventually overlooked by Capello in favour of Stephen Warnock, but his credentials are far more persuasive this time round. Ashley Cole is injured and absent. Baines excelled against Montenegro last week and will hope to prosper against the Poles, where victory will ensure progress. Certainly the numbing disappointment provoked on that journey to a Merseyside retail park will provide ample personal motivation. The 28-year-old ended up watching England&apos;s underwhelming performances at that tournament not, as he first suggested with a smile, on the trampoline at the bottom of the garden \u2013 &quot;I only caught bits of it, looking through the window, as I bounced,&quot; he offered \u2013 but while on holiday in Dubai with the injured Joleon Lescott and his family. There will have been times when both pondered what might have been as their friends and team-mates spluttered towards an ignominious second-round exit. &quot;It does make you doubly keen, remembering that, but World Cups don&apos;t come around very often in any player&apos;s career,&quot; said Baines. &quot;I missed out having got quite close last time, being in the 30-man preliminary squad and then not the 23, and there won&apos;t be too many more of these finals for me at my age. &quot;I am sure I&apos;m as desperate to get there this time as not only the younger lads, who maybe haven&apos;t been to one before, but the senior lads as well. For some it will be their last one. The desire is there across the board. &quot;The disappointment lingers for a while. It was still there when I came back for pre-season that summer, still lingering until I got out playing again and enjoying it. That was the &apos;moving on&apos; point. But, here and now, we&apos;re not allowing ourselves to think about Brazil yet. &quot;The focus is purely on this last qualifying game because of what&apos;s on the line. It is hard to imagine a major tournament without England there, isn&apos;t it? But every now and again that happens and one of the major nations you expect to be there doesn&apos;t make it. &quot;We all remember six years back [the failure to qualify for Euro 2008]. We know and feel that disappointment when it doesn&apos;t happen. So, with that in mind, we all understand what is at stake. I guess, as a by-product of that, you are thinking about the summer because ultimately that&apos;s the goal. &quot;But, fundamentally, the focus is on what&apos;s in front of us now and getting that job done. There&apos;s no bigger carrot to dangle in front of anyone than to say: &apos;Win this and you are going to get to a World Cup in Brazil.&apos;&quot; England have an opportunity on Tuesday, when victory against the side ranked fourth in the section and 65th in the world will confirm qualification without the need for a nerve-shredding two-legged play-off next month. Baines&apos;s aggressive running and whipped delivery will be needed to unsettle the visitors, just as he wounded Montenegro last week. There would have been a logic to play the Evertonian in these critical fixtures rather than Ashley Cole, the veteran who has 105 caps, given the English had to win both games against opponents who had been expected to bank up in massed defence. Cole&apos;s defensive qualities are undiminished but Baines offers that set-piece delivery and added bite in the final third. The older man&apos;s rib injury ensures his perennial understudy will earn a 21st cap \u2013 an eighth in competitive action \u2013 against the Poles. The argument often goes that his tally would have been swollen considerably had he been competing regularly in the Champions League, as Cole does so effectively. Manchester United&apos;s summer desire to secure his services had briefly made that a possibility, even if David Moyes&apos; bidding never reached a level to tempt Everton into a sale. All questions on that subject were off limits on Sunday, a Football Association press officer deflecting anything perceived to be too club-related for comfort. And yet it is Baines&apos;s club form that makes him stand out from the crowd and could yet convince Roy Hodgson that, even if Cole is fit and available, the time has come for change. &quot;It&apos;s a tough one for the manager because, if you were in his shoes, you&apos;ve got such a great player already in Ash and, if it&apos;s not broke, you don&apos;t fix it,&quot; he said. &quot;I just hope he feels he&apos;s got two guys that he can depend on. Ash has this wealth of experience I could never match. That adds weight to his case but hopefully the manager has confidence in me. I feel I&apos;ve pushed [Cole] hard. I&apos;ve no idea if, in the manager&apos;s mind, it&apos;s really close or if he always knows which he prefers, which has been Ash, and if that&apos;s always going to be the case when he&apos;s fit. But this is all I&apos;ve ever known since I&apos;ve been involved. &quot;You try to keep perspective on it but ultimately you are pushing and you want to play. There&apos;s no point in trying to hide that fact and just being happy to be here and toeing that line all the time. It&apos;s not always the case. You want to come and you want to play. &quot;I get on really well with Ash. Maybe it&apos;s not my nature [to be cold towards a rival] but the only influence I can have on anything is by my actions. Hopefully, if I keep doing the right things, my time will come. If it doesn&apos;t, well, I&apos;ll have given it everything I&apos;ve got.&quot; This fixture, if successful, would represent one last heave towards the finish line. Last week&apos;s result, and generally buoyant mood, should help steel the nerves. &quot;We felt we knew the job in front of us and that we were capable of doing it,&quot; added Baines. &quot;There was a definite positive vibe throughout, that will get us through. Now everyone has come back to the squad [after Saturday&apos;s day off] feeling that same positivity. We know we can produce.&quot;", "title": "Leighton Baines outlines desire to seize Ashley Cole's England spot | Dominic Fifield", "sentences": ["The 28-year-old ended up watching England&apos;s underwhelming performances at that tournament not, as he first suggested with a smile, on the trampoline at the bottom of the garden \u2013 &quot;I only caught bits of it, looking through the window, as I bounced,&quot; he offered \u2013 but while on holiday in Dubai with the injured Joleon Lescott and his family."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-13T22:00:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/careers/media-careers-middle-east-opportunity", "tags": ["Guardian Careers", "Career choices", "Media", "Professional development", "Journalism", "Interviews", "Applications"], "article": "I went for it. I packed up my bags and swapped a small-town in Nebraska for Doha, Qatar, to work as a features writer for a magazine. It was as a young journalist&apos;s dream: I interviewed top chief executives, traveled internationally and was encouraged to pitch ideas and make them happen. But it was also a challenge in a region with so many restrictions. The juxtaposition of the wealthy to the poor was often brutally clear and the gender imbalance meant it wasn&apos;t unusual to be followed through busy traffic by a would-be suitor. On the job, I had to cover my shoulders and knees, and restrictions even came into my writing: I had to say &quot;grape beverage&quot; instead of &quot;wine&quot;, and couldn&apos;t mention dating at all. Yet, if you&apos;re considering a media career in the Gulf, I&apos;d still urge you to go for it. It will be one of the most amazing adventures you&apos;ll have. But before you do, here are some things to keep in mind. You won&apos;t be the only Brit abroad The atmosphere in the Gulf is shaped strongly by the number of foreigners in the region. Expats account for more than 80% of the population in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar. The number of Brits emigrating to the region has steadily increased. Since 2007, more than 10,000 people a year have made the move. Phil Tromans, a Brit who emigrated to the region five years ago to work for a range of publucations, says: &quot;Arriving for the first time is very much like heading to university \u2013 you&apos;ll meet plenty of people in the same situation as you, all keen to experience something new, strike out on their own and get ahead in life. &quot;The UAE has a dynamism to it, a get-up-and-go attitude, and attracts people from all over the world who share that drive to get out of their established routines and seek their fortune.&quot; It&apos;s easy to adjust Jessica Davey-Quantick, a previous editor of Time Out Doha, says: &quot;From employers knowing the ropes about helping you get your visa and bank account, to the social life where people are happy to take you under their wing and show you around, it&apos;s very easy to adjust.&quot; &quot;There are some interesting opportunities to be had, and good money to be made for young professionals. Plus, it&apos;s an opportunity to learn so much about a very misunderstood part of the planet,&quot; says Georgia Lewis, who spent five years at What&apos;s On in Dubai and The National in Abu Dhabi. Jump up the career ladder For many, the region is appealing because of the opportunities to develop your career quickly. &quot;I&apos;ve essentially skipped a step in my career,&quot; says Davey-Quantick. &quot;In the Middle East, if you&apos;re eager and willing to work hard, there&apos;s no waiting for someone to retire or spending years slogging away at a junior position. The region is booming. &quot;I&apos;d never worked on a magazine before, but at the age of 23 I was being handed one and told to run with it. By the time I was 25 I was the editor of a major international brand.&quot; It&apos;s not all sunshine Media professionals must be aware of certain press restrictions, however. For instance, in the UAE, although the constitution provides freedom of speech and allows freedom of press, in practice this is often restricted. &quot;It can be a challenging place to work with some draconian labour laws,&quot; says Lewis. &quot;Although there are a lot of talented people working in the UAE, there are also plenty of people who are only there because they have messed up one too many times in their home country. You will encounter episodes of gross unprofessionalism and rank stupidity.&quot; For Davey-Quantick, limitations on what she was allowed to print was often a frustration. &quot;Once you&apos;ve had to Photoshop a pair of shorts longer, so they cover someone&apos;s knees, or had to write the phrase &apos;pitchers of traditional Italian vino-based beverage&apos;, you end up wanting to stab yourself with a sharpie.&quot; But these restrictions aren&apos;t insurmountable. &quot;It is an Islamic country and its laws reflect that. But in five years, I&apos;ve never had any kind of issue at all,&quot; said Tromans. Societal challenges Living in such a different type of society can be hard to deal with, from wealth discrepancies to racial tensions. There is also an undeniable gender imbalance: in the UAE, estimates suggest there are around three times as many males as female. &quot;There will times when either your patience or your conscience is tested and days when you feel you really have done a deal with the devil,&quot; said Lewis. &quot;Plenty of people in the UAE hate their job, from labourers on construction sites, to mistreated housemaids and exhausted taxi drivers.&quot; &quot;In can at times be a maddening place in which to live,&quot; adds Tromans. &quot;But so can London or Edinburgh.&quot; What should you know before you go? I did the whole thing in a whirlwind. I applied, interviewed and flew all within three weeks. I wasn&apos;t alone in this. &quot;In hindsight, I probably gave the whole idea of packing up and going to the Middle East about as much thought as I put into buying a pair of shoes,&quot; said Lewis. But if you want to do things in a more organised fashion, research is the key. &quot;Like any relocation, you have to be sure to understand what you will be getting yourself into. Consider the climate, culture, activities, cost of living, accessibility and transport,&quot; says Deliah Roque, sales and marketing manager of ABODE and Qatar Happening magazines. Lewis adds: &quot;Do your homework first about everything from banking, to renting a flat, road rules and to laws about your sex life or birth control. Check the rules on alcohol and see if you can transfer your driving licence from your home country. When it comes to the UAE, there is no such thing as asking a stupid question.&quot; The odds are, you&apos;ll be sponsored by your company in the Gulf. This essentially ties you to your job and can impact when you can enter or exit the country. &quot;Once you&apos;ve got the basics and you are happy, then read and understand your work contract,&quot; says Roque. Some contracts provide drivers, which many journalists find useful amidst the region&apos;s chaotic traffic. You&apos;ll also want to consider cultural restrictions. While this varies across the Gulf, women are generally encouraged to cover shoulders and knees. In Doha during Ramadan, this rule becomes particularly strict. Likewise, during Ramadan, some companies ask employees to respect the fast by not eating in public.&quot;The best advice I&apos;d give for people considering it would be to just do it, jump in with both feet and see where you land. Taking that risk may seem scary, but it&apos;s totally worth it,&quot; says Quantick. Tromans agrees: &quot;My advice for anyone considering a move to the Middle East would be to go for it. Even if it turns out not to be for you, your home country will still be there if you decide to return.&quot; Working in Doha was one of the most positive adventures I&apos;ve had. Yes, there were challenges. Yet the possibilities, the opportunities, particularly in the media sphere, were undeniable. Danae Mercer is a media professional in London.

That news, it seems, is edging ever closer amid reports in Ireland last weekend that the golfer has finally split from his girlfriend, the Danish tennis player Caroline Wozniacki. When thrown into a year which has seen McIlroy involved in legal cases worth tens of millions of pounds, slide from No1 to No6 in the world on account of missed cuts and absent form, plus the public-relations disaster of a mid-tournament walk off, that is quite a package. Should the Northern Irishman ever decide to write an autobiography, there will be little doubt over the key chapter. &quot;Wozilroy&quot; has been one of the most famous and high-profile partnerships in global sport. But, from the outside, it has not been a scenario best suited to the pair&apos;s careers. When whispers first circulated about an imminent parting of the ways, almost two months ago, McIlroy was said to be as concerned by Wozniacki&apos;s tumble down the world rankings as his own on-course problems. At the Open Championship in July, McIlroy had claimed to be &quot;brain dead&quot; on course. It was an alarming statement. Since then, there have been only glimpses that he will recover some of his brilliance this year rather than regard it as a total write-off. McIlroy has spent much of his recent time either in Belfast with childhood friends, as was the case when he took in Ulster&apos;s Heineken Cup match with Leicester on Friday night, or Dublin, where he was by Saturday. The inclination to follow the WTA Tour at any given opportunity has long since passed, it would seem. McIlroy is nothing if not single-minded. He is not averse to change. In fact he makes a habit of it, as demonstrated by his move from International Sports Management to the Horizon group in late 2011. Now, Horizon itself has been ditched. There has been a distinct cooling of the relationship, too, with his close friend Graeme McDowell. When McDowell married in the Bahamas last month, McIlroy was a notable absentee. Today, Horizon and McIlroy will be represented in a Dublin courtroom as that alliance continues its own messy break-up. As with the McDowell alliance, it is sad that something which worked so well has come to this. The newly-formed Rory McIlroy Incorporated claims it has terminated the golfer&apos;s contract with Horizon under which McIlroy agreed his much-publicised \u00a378m equipment deal with Nike. McIlroy&apos;s commercial appeal is further demonstrated by sponsorship agreements with Omega and Bose. McIlroy believes he has a right to end that Horizon spell because it has taken too high a percentage of his sponsorship agreements. If no settlement can be reached, Horizon is set to counter-sue McIlroy for ending a five-year contract with more than half of it to run; that turn of events, needless to say, would lead to more of the golfer&apos;s financial affairs being made public than he would prefer. Not that money should be of concern to McIlroy. He is already way beyond that stage, regardless of the Horizon outcome. In flying to the Far East this week, he begins a spell which will net him more than US$3m (\u00a31.9m) simply for turning up at the Korea Open, the BMW Masters and for an exhibition meeting with Tiger Woods. The WGC Championship follows that, with McIlroy still to ensure he earns a place in the European Tour&apos;s Race to Dubai final in mid-November. At that event a year ago, McIlroy confirmed his status as then the best player in the world with Wozniacki on hand to tease him at a post-round press conference. Despite his claims to the contrary, it is difficult to imagine more going wrong during the intervening months as has already been the case. Yet McIlroy remains a decent, engaging character despite those who have sought to demonise his personality simply because he has endured a torrid professional spell. In one particularly fierce article, published in the United States, McIlroy was portrayed in what is actually a wholly unfair manner for anybody who knows him. It should be remembered that the root cause for McIlroy&apos;s 2013 problems has been struggles on the golf course, not a switch into an alter ego. That must also be placed against both an exceptional 2012 and McIlroy&apos;s relative youth. Throughout his career, even as an amateur, McIlroy has never been super-consistent. In that playing sense, McIlroy&apos;s superb driving deserted him in the first part of this year. His putting, which had improved dramatically last season, has also regressed. In a technical sense, McIlroy&apos;s swing has a tendency to move off plane \u2013 or line \u2013 which triggers poor shots in both directions and therefore blunts his confidence. Not only will McIlroy know all that, he will be determined to have it fixed by the time a new year arrives. The logical assumption is that such work is tougher when there is too much noise in the background. If there are consolations for McIlroy as he settles in Seoul today; at least for now he is thousands of miles away from distraction, and it would seem impossible to have another year quite like this one.", "title": "Why Rory McIlroy cannot wait for 2013 to finish", "sentences": ["The WGC Championship follows that, with McIlroy still to ensure he earns a place in the European Tour&apos;s Race to Dubai final in mid-November."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-14T12:10:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/oct/15/bruno-metsu-dies-cancer-senegal", "tags": ["Senegal", "World Cup 2002", "World Cup", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "     The former Senegal coach Bruno Metsu has died of cancer at the age of 59.

The 26-year-old was in a Porsche 996 as a passenger when it hit the barriers at the circuit on Tuesday. He had been leading the drivers&apos; championship of the Porsche Supercup series, all of the races for which take place at Formula One events. Edwards is understood to have been killed instantly when the car left the track and impacted with a tyre wall on the outside of turn six at the track in Ipswich, 25 miles west of Brisbane. The driver was extracted from the wreckage, which had caught fire, by emergency services and was taken to intensive care with life-threatening injuries. It is understood it took three hours to remove the driver from the car. Inspector Dave Preston of Queensland police said it had been a difficult operation to get the man out of the mangled wreckage: &quot;The fire and rescue had to do extensive work in relation to extracting and opening the vehicle up sufficiently to remove him. He was trapped for some time.&quot; The driver, who has yet to be named, was a 20-year-old Brisbane man. His family were understood to be trackside at the time. He was pinned from the waist down in the wreckage for three hours after the crash took place at 11.30am, after which he was airlifted to the Royal Brisbane and Women&apos;s Hospital. Edwards was the son of Guy Edwards who competed in Formula One and the 24 Hours of Le Mans during the 1970s and 1980s and was one of the drivers who helped remove Niki Lauda from his burning car at the 1976 German Grand Prix at the N\u00fcrburgring. Sean Edwards won the European GT3 Championship in 2006 and gone on to race in the FIA GT Championship, the American Le Mans Series, the Le Mans 24 hours and the Porsche Supercup and Porsche Supercup Germany series. He finished third in a Porsche in the GT2 class at his very first 24 hour race, at Spa in 2007. Having won the Dubai 24 Hours last year he did so again in 2013 and was also a winner for the Black Falcon team at the N\u00fcrburgring 24 this year and took the Long Beach round of the American Le Mans series in the GTC class. Racing for the Allyouneed by Project 1 team in this year&apos;s Porsche Supercup, he had victories in Spain, Monaco and Hungary and was leading the championship by 18 points with two races at Yas Marina due to have taken place on 2-3 November. He had also recently taken part in the making of the film Rush, recounting the 1976 F1 battle between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, advising on the racing scenes and in some parts portraying his father.

Clinton then attended the Yanks&apos; round-of-16 match in Rustenburg \u2013 which the USA lost 2-1 to Ghana.  Of course, the White House&apos;s involvement was a harmless photo opportunity. But as coach of the Egyptian national team since September 2011, Bradley has experienced a whole new game of political football. &quot;I think in many countries in the world there is a connection between football and politics &quot;, says Bradley, 55. &quot;But when you consider what happened in January 2011 and the role that Ultras played in that, I think that connection is even greater in Egypt.&quot; January 2011 was the start of Egypt&apos;s Arab Spring. A month later, President Hosni Mubarak resigned after 30 years in power. At the heart of the revolution that displaced him were the hardcore fans of Egypt&apos;s two biggest clubs, Al-Ahly and Zamalek \u2013 otherwise known as the Ultras. For many years the Ultras had been involved in clashes with police and security officials. This experience, and their ability to mobilise people through social-media networks, contributed to the ousting of Mubarak. &quot;Before I arrived in Egypt I knew about the Ultras,&quot; says Bradley. &quot;When I was coach of the US we were scheduled to play a friendly in Cairo in February 2011. In the weeks before that friendly, like everyone in the world, we saw what was going on in Tahrir Square and I followed all that. Our friendly was cancelled and I started to read about what the people were trying to accomplish and the role the Ultras played in that.&quot; Fast forward eight months from January 2011 and after being released as coach of the USA, after a 4-2 defeat by Mexico in the final of the Gold Cup, Bradley was appointed coach of Egypt.  &quot;For me, a few things were very important,&quot; says Bradley, explaining his somewhat surprising move to Africa.   Firstly, the passion of football fans in Egypt is amazing and it&apos;s up there with anywhere else in the world. From the first time I arrived everyone I ran into spoke about the national team, they talked about the World Cup in Brazil and how it was a dream for all Egyptians to get to the World Cup. With all the success of the national team in the Africa Cup of Nations they had not been to a World Cup since 1990, so this was really important for everyone.  After only four months in Cairo, Bradley was given a unique insight into the politicisation of football in the most populous Arab country in the world. On 1 February 2012, 74 fans died after violence at a match between Al-Ahly and Al-Masry. At first it looked like a simple case of football violence, the rivalry between two clubs spilling over into chaos and death. But while there are several versions of what went on in Port Said Stadium that evening, certain facts are clear. The Al-Masry fans were heavily armed, with knives, clubs, swords and stones, and police inside the stadium did nothing to prevent the violence, refusing to open the gates to allow fans to escape.

Photograph: Amr Nabil/AP    There are 101 versions and conspiracy theories surrounding the events in Port Said, but there are two main premises. The first is that the authorities instigated the massacre as an act of revenge following the role played by the Al-Ahly Ultras in the the Arab Spring 13 months before. When Port Said happened Mubarak was no longer in power, but elements of his regime remained in positions of authority. The second theory suggests the ruling powers prompted the disaster in order to justify the introduction of further and more rigorous security measures. &quot;Even to this day there are a lot of unanswered questions,&quot; says Bradley. &quot;But I have said all along it was a massacre. There were gates that were locked. The lights went out at a certain point. Many people have been put on trial for the roles that they played. Many of the Al-Masry Ultras were convicted. Some of the security officials at the stadium were convicted, many got off.   Like so many things in Egypt, as the months go by, you never really get to the bottom of what happened. But, at the end of the day, 74 people lost their lives and even now it is still incredibly emotional.  Today the number 74, painted in blood red, can be seen scrawled all over Cairo, from Tahrir Square, where Egypt&apos;s revolution started in January 2011, to the subways and side streets and the Qasr al-Nil Bridge that spans the River Nile. Just like the Nile itself, the Port Said massacre will forever be a part of Egypt&apos;s history. But using the &quot;m word&quot; got Bradley into a heap of trouble. Many people interpreted the American&apos;s description of Port Said as a massacre as a direct criticism of Egypt&apos;s ruling regime. The Egyptian Football Association hastily called a press conference, at which Bradley denied his comments were a criticism of the country&apos;s ruling forces. If Bradley needed an Egyptian lesson in the blurred lines between football and politics, comment and innuendo and right and wrong, that was it. He could well have been tempted to grab his passport and, with his wife Lindsey, get the first one-way ticket back to the US. &quot;The question I have been asked more than any other is &apos;why did we stay?&apos;&quot; says Bradley. &quot;But for me it was simple. When you get involved in something, when you have a goal and when you get to know people and when you are challenging them every day to be part of something and to be committed and to stick with it, even if it&apos;s not easy, I think it&apos;s important that you show them that you are in for the long haul. I don&apos;t think you are a good leader if at that moment you show any weakness.&quot; Bradley attended a peace march in Sphinx Square and the Al-Ahly club memorial and spent time consoling his national-team players:   &quot;The first time I saw the players after Port Said you could see it in their eyes. They told me how the locker room became a hospital as they were treating the injured fans. Some of the players had fans dying in their arms. Several of them said they would retire from football if this was what it meant, but gradually we spoke to them and helped them through their pain. &quot;Little by little, they started to get back to normal and eventually the national team players got their focus back. We had become friends and brothers, and in a strange kind of way, the experience made us stronger.&quot;  Bradley&apos;s words and actions have earned him huge respect in Egypt and, given the myriad political divisions inside the country, you could argue Bradley is now the most popular man in the country.  &quot;Egyptian people are so warm and friendly&quot;, he says. &quot;They really appreciate it if you do something that is seen as good for their country. As national-team coach the recognition factor is huge and everything you do gets noticed&quot;. The results of Bradley&apos;s team have also made people take notice. The Pharaohs have been champions of Africa a record seven times, but their World Cup record has been poor. The last time they qualified for the main event was 23 years ago, in Italy, when they failed to advance from a group containing England, the Republic of Ireland and Holland. This time around, under Bradley, Egypt won all six World Cup qualifiers, the only African side to do so. Such results seem even more remarkable when you consider that Egypt&apos;s domestic league was cancelled after the Port Said tragedy and all the national team&apos;s home matches have been played behind closed doors. &quot;The domestic league was suspended and so the players weren&apos;t getting paid&quot;, recalls Bradley. &quot;It was a tough situation but we made it work because we had to. We took every training camp we could, we organized friendly matches in Khartoum, Sudan, we went to Dubai a few times, we played in Tripoli, Beirut. Over that time we really grew as a group and the more we spoke about it, the more we realized what an incredible dream it would be if we could qualify for the World Cup.&quot;     Asamoah Gyan celebrates his goal against Bradley's USA at the 2010 World Cup. Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP    To accomplish that dream, Bradley&apos;s side will have to beat Ghana over two legs in a play-off. The first will take place in Kumasi on 15 October, with the second leg scheduled for 19 November in Cairo. Given that Ghana were Africa&apos;s most successful team in the 2010 World Cup in South Africa, reaching the quarter-finals and beating Bradley&apos;s USA in the process, you would be forgiven for thinking that Bradley had been dealt another tough hand. But Egypt&apos;s coach isn&apos;t fazed.  The biggest fear for Bradley and the Egyptian Football Association was a play-off against their north African rivals, Algeria. In 2009, when the two sides met in Cairo for a place in South Africa, the Algerian team bus was attacked. Following the match, it was reported that six Algerian fans died. In retaliation, Egyptian interests in Algeria were attacked and diplomatic tensions between the countries became strained. Once again the lines between politics and football became blurred.  &quot;I&apos;m perfectly happy to be playing Ghana,&quot; says Bradley. &quot;Our players respect Ghana but, unlike a match against Algeria or Tunisia, the match will be just about football. There will be no politics and less emotion that can sometimes have a negative affect on the team.&quot; He has other reasons to be cheerful. &quot;The most important thing for me was to be at home for the second leg,&quot; he says. &quot;For us to play in front of our fans, after everything that has gone on, would be an incredible reward for them and the players&quot;. The ongoing security situation in Cairo has led Ghana to request a change of venue, but it seems likely that Fifa will stick to the original plan. If the game does go ahead it will be the first time a match has been played in front of a full crowd in Egypt since the Port Said disaster.  Wherever Bradley turns in Egypt, there is politics in his way. Even the Egypt dressing room isn&apos;t a politics-free zone.  &quot;Inside our team there might be different opinions,&quot; he says.   Politically, not everyone sees things the same way, but nonetheless there is still respect and we are still part of something together and when we step on the field, a united effort by us is a good example for everyone else in Egypt.  Bob Bradley has had everything conceivable thrown in his path during his two-year Egyptian adventure. On 19 November, his team&apos;s destiny will be decided \u2013 and at least, for 90 minutes, it will be just about football.  &quot;We have had a revolution and then a counter-revolution. We had a football stadium disaster that claimed the lives of 74 people. We had the domestic league cancelled. We had the offices of the Egyptian Football Association burnt down. &quot;There isn&apos;t much that hasn&apos;t happened since I got here. But the dream is still alive in what is a historic time for Egypt. Football is about the only thing that unites people in Egypt right now. So for as long as we can still qualify for the World Cup in Brazil we will keep on fighting.&quot; ", "title": "Ex-USA coach Bob Bradley: Egypt, revolution and the World Cup", "sentences": ["We took every training camp we could, we organized friendly matches in Khartoum, Sudan, we went to Dubai a few times, we played in Tripoli, Beirut."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-15T11:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/fashion/2013/oct/15/towie-look-britain-attitudes-essex-beauty", "tags": ["Beauty", "Fashion", "The Only Way is Essex", "Women's hair"], "article": "When The Only Way Is Essex finally reaches the end of its run \u2013 the show is now in its 10th series, so that moment may come soon \u2013 its most lasting gift to society will be the legacy of its stars&apos; grooming habits. Not the vajazzles, nor the male cleavage. The female Towie aesthetic has seeped into the mainstream in more subtle permutations, colouring parts of Britain as lastingly as the Towie tour parties tinge the bathrooms of the Travelodge in Brentwood every weekend with residual fake tan. (This information comes courtesy of a taxi driver who spends a lot of time in the Travelodge reception.) Elements of the Towie look have cropped up all over the British cultural landscape. On BBC1&apos;s 8pm news bulletin, female newsreaders sport Towie-style makeup. Schoolgirls on Educating Yorkshire do Towie hair. The female contestants on the last series of The Apprentice seemed to advocate hair extensions and sculpted brows as a way to advance a career in business. Even Michaella McCollum, from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, one of the two women charged with drug trafficking in Peru in August, can be seen in the harrowing picture of her arrest wearing a hair doughnut from Lauren Goodger&apos;s product range. It is not a stretch to say that the doughnut increases the pathos of the picture. Towie was there, in Lima. To speak of a Towie look, however, implies there is a clear-cut template that can be placed over women&apos;s faces in order that they all be tarred with the same disparaging brush. Amy Childs \u2013 who starred in the show&apos;s first two series, runs the Amy Childs salon in Brentwood and has launched an Amy Childs collection of clothes \u2013 takes the idea of a Towie look as a compliment, at first. Curled up in one of the treatment chairs of her salon, she happily rattles off a checklist. &quot;We always put our eyelashes on. We&apos;ve always got big hair. Obviously spray tan.&quot; But immediately problems arise, and she falters. She is not, at this moment, wearing false eyelashes. Her skin is only lightly tanned. And she thinks all the women who appear on Towie look totally different. &quot;I don&apos;t think we&apos;ve got a typical look. Do you think we have? Honestly?&quot; The honest answer, of course, is that the women in Towie, as Childs says, all look different. But across their different faces elements of their presentation are reiterated so faithfully that it is impossible not to see a coherent argument for a particular aesthetic. Above a hardware shop in Chingford is the flat and studio of Krystal Dawn, a makeup artist who gets Towie star Jess Wright ready for filming. Sitting in her bright, white studio, surrounded by pots of makeup, a picture board full of the Towie faces she has &quot;done&quot;, Dawn itemises the look&apos;s key components. Aside from the obvious hair extensions and tan, &quot;they want thick eyebrows&quot;. (She went with Frankie Essex to get her own tattooed.) Nails are manicured. &quot;They always ask for contouring&quot;, the process by which a face can appear more chiselled, and eyeliner top and bottom. Lashes are thick and dark. Lips are on the quiet side. Dawn, 30, is a student of makeup. She pores over pictures from magazines, Instagram and the feeds of celebrity makeup artists. Growing up in Aberdeen she didn&apos;t care about makeup, but she was &quot;always drawing faces or doodling eyes&quot;, copying pictures out of magazines. She has observed the spread of Towie&apos;s influence. &quot;When I go back [to Aberdeen], I don&apos;t know if it&apos;s because of magazines, but I see a difference. The girls are high maintenance.&quot; Even her mother now owns false eyelashes (or she did until Dawn took them, secretly, disapprovingly). To sit close to Childs or Dawn is to understand first-hand the look&apos;s compulsion. Childs may say she is not wearing much makeup, but her skin is flawless, her green eyes offset by a thick rim of black. It is like looking at a screen where the contrast and brightness settings have been expertly adjusted and everything is perfectly in focus. She is beautiful. And damned, of course, because the Towie aesthetic is roundly mocked. Why, when the tabloids routinely refer to &quot;Towie beauties&quot;, do we smile knowingly at the double meaning: here&apos;s a picture of a &quot;beauty&quot; who is on Towie, and her beauty is of a particular, exaggerated Towie kind?     Part-Towie: the Duchess of Cambridge, Paris Hilton, Mary Berry and Nigella Lawson. Photograph: Rex Features/Guardian composite image    To find out, I have taken a stack of pictures of famous women to Brentwood. Childs and I are sharing a salon bed, with a lot of paperwork between us. Can she tell me which faces are Towie and which aren&apos;t? Top of the pile is Victoria Beckham, who Childs puts unhesitatingly on the &quot;no&quot; pile: she&apos;s &quot;too fashion&quot;. Jennifer Aniston (&quot;too natural&quot;) and Alexa Chung (&quot;too London&quot;) are also nos, as is Hilary Mantel, who has underperforming eyebrows. As we go through the pile, a process of jigsaw identification emerges, in which some women in the pictures are deemed by Childs to display sufficient characteristics of the Towie aesthetic \u2013 the eyeliner, eyebrows, tan or hair \u2013 to be classed as Towie overall. These include such disparate faces as opera singer Katherine Jenkins, US socialite Olivia Palermo and Jane Fonda as Barbarella. Paris Hilton, businesswoman Deborah Meaden and Julia Restoin Roitfeld, model daughter of the esteemed former French Vogue editor Carine Roitfeld, are all classified Towie \u2013 this last a blow to high fashion, one suspects. Roitfeld herself escapes by virtue of her unbrushed hair. Nigella Lawson is not overall Towie but she has Essex eyebrows (&quot;She&apos;s had them HD&apos;d,&quot; says Childs, a service her own salon offers.) The chef Mary Berry is &quot;definitely&quot; Towie. &quot;Essex Nan,&quot; says Childs. Lastly, not wholly Essex but just a &quot;tiny bit&quot; Towie around the eyes, is the Duchess of Cambridge.     Not Towie: Victoria Beckham, Jennifer Aniston, Alexa Chung and Hilary Mantel. Photograph: Rex Features/Guardian Imaging    If any of those Essex &quot;yeses&quot; sound funny, it is because &quot;Towie&quot; is as much a designation of class as description of a look. Historically, makeup was for the wealthy, says Aileen Ribeiro, author of Facing Beauty: Painted Women and Cosmetic Art. &quot;Now it seems that things are reversed.&quot; The spread of nail, lash, blowdry and eyebrow bars has brought high maintenance to high streets all over Britain. Of course, the Towie look isn&apos;t really about, or from, Essex \u2013 and not just because it can be seen on Geordie Shore or Made In Chelsea too. For decades, young women have been going out on Saturday night showing many of the hallmarks of the look, which has since converged with a globalised ideal of beauty that holds LA and Bollywood among its reference points. If you traced the made-up Towie face on a timeline, it would probably pass back through Katie Price via the Spice Girls to the late 50s or early 60s. Barbie at launch in 1959 is Towie plus lipstick (though later Barbies are not). Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra (1963) is almost carbon-copy Towie. Elizabeth I would be on the timeline too, for the vigour with which she recoloured her face and even \u2013 very much in the spirit of Towie &quot;contouring&quot; \u2013 painted blue veins on it. So would the beauty celebrated in the poems of Ovid, which, with its milky-white skin, rosy lips and blond hair was as homogenous as the Towie look is perceived to be. And, as Maria Wyke, professor of Latin at UCL points out, &quot;a lot of people in the ancient world aren&apos;t going to be blonde&quot;, in the same way that a lot of people in Towie aren&apos;t naturally dark. Makeup is always about transformation of one kind or another, but the Towie look celebrates many kinds of transformation in one package. A malleable face suggests a power to control and reshape that extends well beyond appearance into lived experience.     Kim Kardashian: her Instagram shows the power of 'contouring' with makeup. Photograph: Instagram    The epitome of this belief is a photograph posted by the US star Kim Kardashian on Instagram last September, and which Dawn, in Chingford, has studied. She finds it on her phone. Kardashian is showing off white streaks of highlighter and smudges of bronzer before the application of foundation, and the lines are so stark that her face looks like a diagrammatic representation of another face. A line of highlighter narrows the nose; bronzer sharpens the jaw. It is as close as makeup gets to surgery. It is a small step from the pliancy of facial features to suggesting compliance in other ways, and it is easy to see why many people see the referents of the Towie look as Barbie or pornography. The natural-coloured lips fit with this reading \u2013 a door you can walk through without worrying about getting paint on your jacket. But I think the pliable face is better read as a metaphor for mobility \u2013 social, economic and racial. The reason Childs doesn&apos;t care if people look at her and see false lashes, breasts and skin colour is because she takes their observation as economic opportunity. &quot;People say to me: &apos;What fake tan have you got on? What eyelashes do you use, Ame?&apos; It&apos;s not offensive. It&apos;s about me making a brand of myself and what sells.&quot; She sees herself &quot;totally&quot; as a businesswoman not a celebrity, she says. Poppy King, who founded Lipstick Queen, is another businesswoman who has made a name for herself in the world of beauty. An Australian who grew up in a home of creatives in Melbourne, her face is the photographic negative of the Towie aesthetic. Her skin is pale, her lips bright red, her hair short. She dislikes the Towie look, believing it to be derived from pornographic representations of women (an association explored by Natasha Walter in her book Living Dolls, which begins in a nightclub in Essex). None the less she still admires the beauty industry for having &quot;always offered women an ability to transcend their economic [situation]&quot;. She says: &quot;It is one of the few areas that women can get into and, through a career, be able to transcend their circumstances.&quot; Really what the Towie look is all about is a kind of migration through aesthetics \u2013 to fame, wealth, social mobility, a better Saturday night and, perhaps, something other. &quot;I think it&apos;s about a really exotic look, or what [the women] perceive to be exotic,&quot; says Ruqaiya Mian, a 20-year-old beauty junkie and student of middle eastern politics at the University of London&apos;s School of Oriental and African Studies (Soas). &quot;You didn&apos;t see a lot of ultra-tanned people 10 years ago.&quot; To support her view, in Superdrug this summer Solait Dark Tan was outselling light tans three to one. &quot;It&apos;s about looking &apos;ethnic&apos;,&quot; says Mian. Childs does not agree with this idea. Neither does Hannah Ostrowicz, another makeup artist who has worked with lots of the women who have appeared on Towie \u2013 Lucy Mecklenburgh, Lydia Bright, Gemma Collins. (However, Ostrowicz has recently moved to Dubai, partly because she sees &quot;similarities between Towie and Bollywood. That smoky eye is a niche of mine.&quot;) Dawn believes there is truth in Mian&apos;s assertion about &quot;exotic&quot; aspirations. &quot;What I use on the [Towie] girls is probably what Beyonc\u00e9 would use on herself,&quot; she says. &quot;The colours I use on them are mixed race.&quot; Dawn has a two-year-old son who is half-Moroccan. When she goes to Jess Wright&apos;s house to do her makeup she takes her son with her. &quot;Jess always looks at him, and says: &apos;That&apos;s the perfect colour! That&apos;s the colour I want!&apos;&quot; Dawn believes some sort of convergence is taking place \u2013 when she worked on a beauty counter in Selfridges many dark-skinned women asked for products to lighten their faces, and she knows many Caucasian women who darkly tan. The meeting point is a colour she calls &quot;caramel&quot;. Coincidentally, &quot;caramel&quot; is the colour that Ellie, who performs makeovers at Childs&apos; salon, says customers tend to ask her for. Chimamanda Adichie also uses it to describe characters of colour in her latest novel, Americanah. None of this is about race, of course, it is only about colour. The nonspecific ethnicity implied by &quot;caramel&quot; echoes in a way that troubles Emma Dabiri, a visual sociologist and teaching fellow at Soas. Of mixed Irish and Nigerian parentage, she was called &quot;Emma Cadbury&quot; at school in Ireland \u2013 because it half-rhymed with her name and, handily for the name-callers, linked dark skin to chocolate. &quot;I think there really is something going on here,&quot; she says. &quot;The mixed-race body has become a place of convergence \u2026 a homogenised ideal that everyone is trying to achieve.&quot; As Dawn points out, in 2010 a research study found mixed-race people were perceived to be the most attractive in Britain. The 2011 census indicated that the fastest-growing group of people in the country consider themselves to be of dual heritage. Many of the celebrities mentioned by Dawn \u2013 Childs, Ostrowicz, Geordie Shore&apos;s Holly Hagan and Lauren Goodger, formerly of Towie \u2013 are mixed race or white or Latino women who have borrowed so extensively from black culture to have become racially ambiguous. The celebrity that Dawn most liked sketching from magazines back in Aberdeen was J-Lo \u2013 also the singer Goodger most liked watching as a 15-year-old. Beyonc\u00e9, Selena Gomez, Kardashian, Mariah Carey, Nicole Scherzinger, Eva Longoria, Nicki Minaj and Christina Aguilera are the names that crop up alongside Victoria Beckham, occasionally Kelly Brook and, for Ostrowicz only, the Lord of the Rings. &quot;White women have borrowed a lot from black culture in terms of beauty,&quot; says Hannah Pool, who used to write a column on black beauty for the Guardian and now curates the Southbank Centre&apos;s Women of the World festival.&quot; She itemises features that are also on Childs&apos; and Dawn&apos;s lists of Towie identifiers. &quot;For years, extensions were a black woman&apos;s hair secret \u2026 Now lots of white women are also happy to pay to have another woman&apos;s hair on their head. The whole subculture of extreme manicures came from a black fashion subculture too. It comes from an appropriation of what&apos;s considered to be the good bits of being from somewhere else,&quot; she says. &quot;But it bears no relation to the politics or history of what dual heritage might mean. It&apos;s a false idea of what somewhere else is.&quot; Perhaps the only way is not Essex after all, but a generic somewhere else, and makeup is a route to that place \u2013 a non-specific ethnic middle ground, a melting pot of foundation, bronzer, highlighter, whitener and fake tan.

It\u2019s curated by Alexie Glass-Kantor, one of Australia\u2019s most well regarded curators, newly appointed as executive director of Sydney\u2019s Artspace after a successful seven-year tenure at the helm of Melbourne\u2019s Gertrude Contemporary. Glass-Kantor has an impressive CV and a long list of curatorial projects to her credit, the latest of which was her co-directorship with the Art Gallery of NSW\u2019s Natasha Bullock of Parallel Collisions, the 2012 Adelaide Biennial of Australian Art, and City Within the City, a show of Korean contemporary art as her swansong at Gertrude. It\u2019s unlikely Glass-Kantor would have known that her return to Sydney would be heralded by a show with Schwartz, a commercial space with a penchant for high-concept exhibitions, but perhaps as a mission statement You Promised Me \u2026 is an indication of things to come. Featuring six international artists and one Australian, the idea of You Promised Me \u2026 is to put into dialogue work by artists whose practices \u201caddress instances of agency, resistance and vulnerability in the face of interpersonal and political authority\u201d. This translates into as work that is, on first glance, decidedly ambiguous. Walking around the space it\u2019s striking how much the individual pieces conform to the familiar styles and riffs of contemporary art but come together in a cohesive way \u2013 unlike, say the recent Primavera show that was similarly staged in a single room but looked like a hodgepodge of random stuff.     Heman Chong: Cover (Versions). Photograph: the artist and Anna Schwartz Gallery    Quite how that happens is a little difficult to unpick at first. The room is dominated by\u00a0Laurent Gasso\u2019s\u00a0huge sculpture that bears in neon the words \u201cvisibility is a trap\u201d. It\u2019s the first and last work you see in the show \u2013 you literally have to walk around it \u2013 and it simply means that what you see isn\u2019t necessarily what is meant. Ming Wong\u2019s video\u00a0Persona Performa (Actress\u2019 Entrance)\u00a0sits next to it, a ghostly video collage of model\u2019s bodies and faces moving toward the camera, which in turn sits next to Jane and Louise Wilson\u2019s long line of images False Positives and False Negatives (2012), photographs of the artists\u2019 faces painted with a kind of camouflage that confuses surveillance cameras. The images are overlaid with frames from security footage of the Mossad assassination of a Hamas leader in Dubai in 2010. Sitting in front of these images, on a concrete pillar, is a bronze replica of a camera that belonged to Vladimir Shevchenko, a Soviet filmmaker\u00a0who recorded images of Chernobyl. His camera became so irradiated it had to be buried \u2013 the Wilson\u2019s bronze version is a tribute to the denial of seeing. In Heman Chong\u2019s Cover (Versions) the artist uses the rectangular format of the paperback, creating a series of paintings that look like a vast array of book covers, complete with title and author\u2019s name overlaid on an abstract, patterned background. They bring to mind the stylish reissue book covers commonly used by publishers, and Chong\u2019s facsimiles are convincing. But there\u2019s a bigger project behind this work and the random textless paintings inserted into the sequence are the clue: this is more about an idea of abstraction and what it means for painting as an object. We may well regard a book as being something substantial \u2013 the weighty tomes of philosophy and literature found within \u2013 but could we say the same for a purely abstract painting devoid of text? In this case, you can\u2019t really tell a book by its cover because it&apos;s a painting. Haegue Yang\u2019s large installation Strange Fruit \u2013 a forest of silver stands adorned with lights and plastic plants \u2013 remains utterly unapproachable, even with a portentous explanation of its meaning in the catalogue. The siting of Susan Jacob\u2019s delicate Ded Reckoning next to Yang\u2019s work does neither any favours, while Jesse Jones\u2019s video Predicament of Man (2010), similarly makes little rational sense, even with an explanation of its process. It does however have a undeniable presence \u2013 a long pan over the Australian desert with images flashing in the edit like a throwback to Eduardo Paolozzi collages, and a soundtrack with an eerie fragment of music repeating over a three-minute loop. Although Grasso\u2019s Visibility is a Trap towers over the exhibition, it is Jones\u2019s work that I find most compelling \u2013 which is perhaps an insight into Glass-Kantor\u2019s success as a curator. As much as we might want contemporary art to \u201cmean\u201d something, and do so deliberately, it\u2019s also an aesthetic experience that connects to an irrational, emotional state; that goes beyond language to the experience of seeing.", "title": "You Promised Me, and You Said a Lie to Me \u2013 review", "sentences": ["The images are overlaid with frames from security footage of the Mossad assassination of a Hamas leader in Dubai in 2010."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-16T02:21:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2013/oct/16/middle-east-sustainability-media-retail", "tags": ["Media & Tech Network", "Environment", "United Arab Emirates", "Dubai"], "article": "Most in the west would probably regard the Middle East as lagging behind on sustainability. The stereotyped view is one of flashy over-consumption to match a glut of wealth from oil production. The story I heard on the ground was rather different. Ibrahim Al Zubi is head of sustainability at Majid Al Futtaim Properties (MAFP), which develops and manages some of the shopping malls the new Middle East is famous for, such as the Mall of the Emirates, which houses more than 500 retail brands. More than 100 million people visit MAFP malls every year. Al Zubi previously worked for the government and is associated with educational campaigns to raise awareness of issues such as climate change, as well as spearheading the development of unique and progressive standards. &quot;Our region is unique,&quot; Al Zubi told me. &quot;A lot of best practices have been absorbed from somewhere else, but the hybrid approach is always the best. Singapore would be the closest comparison \u2013 Dubai is setting the example for others to follow.&quot; The malls of the Middle East are famous for their gleaming modernity, their luxury stores and opulence. What is less well known is that construction in the Middle East is taking a lead in sustainability standards. One of MAFP&apos;s competitors, Msheireb, has a regeneration project in Qatar that will contain the largest cluster of LEED (green building standard)-certified buildings in the world: a total of 100 buildings all targeting gold and platinum status. Besides attention to individual buildings, the whole development is angled to catch a prevailing northwest breeze, creating a comfortable microclimate. Al Zubi told me that the region has gone from playing catch-up to setting a lead. MAFP&apos;s Mall of the Emirates is not only a top 10 global mall in business terms, it is also one of the only malls in the world with a LEED gold award. It helps that the region is booming again, after a hiatus during the credit crunch. But Ibrahim also told me that it is &quot;different from 10 years ago&quot; \u2013 the environmental standards have become perceived as an integral sign of quality and, crucially, they have been adapted to local conditions. What is &quot;eco&quot; for a building in (cold and wet) Great Britain may not even be relevant in (hot and dry) Dubai. LEED (from the US) and the BREEAM standard (a UK equivalent) form a basic international reference point for development in the region. But Middle East governments, Al Zubi explained, have also developed their own standards to reflect local conditions, needs and challenges. Abu Dhabi has developed PEARL, and Qatar has QSAS, part of which has already been made mandatory. That&apos;s a fairly straightforward account, but Al Zubi warned me against oversimplification: &quot;It takes a lot of research to understand the region properly.&quot; The work of governments in setting these standards has provided a common base for defining quality, he said. His time in government was &quot;more like working for an NGO&quot;, and governments had applied the standards first to their own buildings. In the United Arab Emirates, &quot;all new government buildings must be at least two-star&quot; \u2013 this in turn has helped to create a local green building market, boosting skills and training. The other important factor, Al Zubi told me, was private-development companies such as MAFP being family-owned: &quot;It is never just profit, or just passion; it is always both.&quot; Perhaps, though, he added, we would have heard more of this passion from the region if there had not been a stringent culture of modesty. As Al Zubi pointed out: &quot;Qatar gave over $11bn to foreign aid last year, [but] you would never hear them making a song and dance about it. A lot of that kind of thing is not captured. It&apos;s one of the things the family companies do right, keeping a low profile. You won&apos;t see any annual reports detailing how many orphans we have helped \u2013 &apos;showing what you have done&apos; is not the Muslim way.&quot; Al Zubi pointed out that with 60% of the population under 30 and high unemployment in some countries in the region, creating jobs is actually the number one priority for a family-owned company such as his. The mall they are developing in Lebanon will create 2,000 jobs in retail alone.  And on the social side of sustainability, Al Zubi said there had been rapid moves to make sure health, training and worker safety are in accordance with the highest standards \u2013 something the region has been criticised for. Al Zubi said the key goal that governments and companies such his are aligned on is the need to foster entrepreneurship. Previous generations could rely on safe jobs in government or corporate-style companies, but the prospects of a new generation will depend far more on entrepreneurship. The governments in UAE have committed to awarding at least 10% of all their own contracts to SMEs, and Al Zubi told me that many are expecting a small business and entrepreneurship boom across the region. Boosting this local culture of entrepreneurship, Al Zubi told me that the result was something like a reverse brain drain, bringing people with education and experience of best practices from elsewhere in the world back into the region.

These two 30-somethings from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) have created a local hit TV series that began as a social media dare, morphed into a YouTube series and has garnered 250,000 followers from around the world on Google+. The series, called Peeta Planet, became the third most viewed, locally-made production on broadcaster Dubai One this spring and has already been commissioned for a second series. The next step is selling the show internationally. The brothers&apos; journey is a story that includes both a very creative use of social media and important financial and production help from Twofour54, a media campus created five years ago in Abu Dhabi to attract international media companies and to nurture the development of local media skills and talent. Peeta Planet uses a social media following originally built up by the brothers to design a better shawarma shop, another of their ventures, Wild Peetha. A social media influenced holiday morphed into an online travel show with the brothers taking advice from their audience about what to do and where to go, and along the way they have broken down some of the stereotypes about what a traditionally dressed Arab man is like. The next step for the brothers was turning the online show into a full-blown TV series, which happened this year. &quot;TwoFour54 gave us the money to make our first TV pilot and they have also have given us a lot of support and advice,&quot; says Mohamed Parham al Awadhi. &quot;They have taken an active role in helping us become a production company.&quot; The Middle East is not known for creating international-standard TV productions, but the region&apos;s attractive young demographics, high mobile penetration and some savvy government investments are starting to have a positive impact. &quot;Broadcasters here are used to buying content internationally because the quality of local production was not on a par, but that is starting to change,&quot; explains Parham al Awadhi. Five years since opening its doors, TwoFour54 now has 240 companies employing about 3,000 people. &quot;We had the state broadcaster and several other entities but as an independent industry, media didn&apos;t really exist here five years ago,&quot; says Wayne Borg, chief commercial officer of TwoFour54. &quot;It&apos;s been a real proof of concept that we have been able to attract both big international players as well as smaller startups.&quot; One reason that Abu Dhabi is growing as a hub is because of the disruptions in countries like Syria, Egypt and Lebanon. &quot;It&apos;s a safe haven in an uncertain region where people can come and make programmes and focus on that and not be worrying about political instability,&quot; says Jonney Steven, head of Middle East and North Africa for Twofour Arabia, a wholly-owned subsidiary of UK indie Twofour Group and the first UK independent producer to set up a permanent office in the UAE. &quot;They want to work with people who understand the region and have a local presence. To win business here now you have to have a local presence. The oil-rich UAE has been keen to develop other business areas and media seemed like a good bet given the fact that 60% of the population in Arabic speaking countries is under the age of 25 years old \u2013 an attractive demographic for advertisers and media companies. Mobile phone and tablet penetration in the Arab world is also well over 200% for target age groups. It&apos;s one of the reasons why French games maker Ubisoft, the creator of global franchises like Assassin&apos;s Creed, opened a production office at Twofour54 a year ago to work both on the Arab versions of its franchises as well as to create new games. Now with 30 people on staff, about 10 of whom are Arab, Ubisoft has ambitions to nearly double its head count in the next 12 months. &quot;I had to start by importing people from outside this region because the level of expertise we need is not here yet,&quot; says Yannick Theler, the head of the local office of Ubisoft. The idea behind the Twofour54 campus is to provide a place where Emeratis and other Arabs can come and learn about media creation through courses and internships, all with the prospect of a local job at the end. Theler is taking advantage of a game design course created by Twofour54, last month offering internships to 10 graduates of the most recent course. &quot;We know we need to have different expertise to be successful in this region and so by being part of the Twofour54 media hub we are close to other media companies and a media culture that we can take advantage of to grow,&quot; he said. At a TV industry lunch earlier this month, the CEO of Twofour54 Noura al Kaabi underlined how serious the UAE is about developing a local media hub, outlining a new 30% rebate on any media service performed in the UAE, including post production. &quot;We don&apos;t have Bollywood or Hollywood but we have superstars on YouTube and the local dynamic is driven by young people as well as from the regulations and financial structures we have put in place,&quot; she said. As to freedom of expression, al Kaabi had this to say: &quot;There are certain cultural rules, for example we don&apos;t allow R-rated films and in terms of religion we don&apos;t want any conflict. We think it is better to keep politics and religion away from media so we can have a creative environment where you can express your ideas with respect.&quot; The next five years promises more growth, with Twofour54 already planning four new studios to be opening by second quarter of 2014. &quot;As the demand dictates, we&apos;ll look to expand accordingly,&quot; said Twofour54&apos;s Borg.

Amir still has to serve around half of the suspension that was imposed on him in early 2011 for his involvement in corruption uncovered by the News of the World during Pakistan&apos;s series in England the previous summer, when he made a big impression at the age of 18. But Pakistani media have reported that their cricket board will argue at the ICC that Amir, who served a three-month jail sentence in England in the winter of 2011-12, should be able to resume training at the National Cricket Academy in Lahore, and possibly to play in domestic cricket before his five-year ban is up. The ICC meeting is also expected to hold further discussions on the Decision Review System, although the chances of Real Time Snicko being incorporated in time for the return Ashes series in Australia now appear remote, following Channel Nine&apos;s decision to dispense with Hot Spot. Pakistan offered a reminder of their depth of natural talent by completing a seven-wicket win over South Africa in the first of a two-Test series in Abu Dhabi, inflicting a first defeat on the Proteas for almost two years. After establishing a first-innings lead of 193, they restricted South Africa to 232 in their second innings, despite a defiant 90 from AB de Villiers, with Junaid Khan finishing with three wickets and Saeed Ajmal reinforcing his position as the world&apos;s leading spinner with four for 74. That left Pakistan needing only 40 to win and, although they wobbled worryingly to seven for three, losing two wickets to Vernon Philander and one to Dale Steyn, the captain Misbah-ul-Haq steered them home with an unbeaten 28 from 26 balls, sealing the win with his second six. The result maintained Pakistan&apos;s formidable record in the United Arab Emirates, where they crushed England 3-0 in early 2012. If they can complete a series victory by avoiding defeat in the second Test in Dubai, it will increase the pressure at the top of the official World Test Rankings. Pakistan started the series in sixth place but were only four rankings points behind fourth-placed Australia. Meanwhile the Australian coach, Darren Lehmann, has restored the former Australia fast bowler Craig McDermott to the coaching set-up before the Ashes series. McDermott resigned from his role as Australia&apos;s bowling coach in May 2012 almost a year to the day since he was appointed. But the Queenslander will come back into the fold as Test bowling coach before the opening Test in Brisbane in December. &quot;There is obviously a huge focus on regaining the Ashes this summer and I&apos;ll work as hard as possible to prepare our bowlers for the challenge ahead,&quot; said McDermott.", "title": "Pakistan will ask ICC to cut Mohammad Amir's five-year spot-fixing ban", "sentences": ["If they can complete a series victory by avoiding defeat in the second Test in Dubai, it will increase the pressure at the top of the official World Test Rankings."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-17T18:31:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2013/oct/19/gordon-ramsay-still-excited-by-perfection", "tags": ["Gordon Ramsay", "Chefs", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "article": "&quot;The world&apos;s got smaller, and my life is still a nightmare,&quot; says Gordon Ramsay, summing up how things have changed for him \u2013 or not \u2013 over the past 10 years. A decade ago, Ramsay had three Michelin stars at his flagship restaurant, one star at Claridge&apos;s and had just relaunched the Savoy Grill with chief protege Marcus Wareing. He&apos;d also opened his first restaurant overseas, in Dubai, and was about to appear in Kitchen Nightmares and Hell&apos;s Kitchen, TV shows that would make him a household name in Britain. Although he would go on to open restaurants on five continents and become an international celebrity \u2013 as likely to be seen hanging out with the Beckhams in LA, where he has a home, as in any of his kitchens \u2013 the 46-year-old remains influential in the UK, and not just through the three Michelin stars Clare Smyth holds at Royal Hospital Road. Jason Atherton and Angela Hartnett wouldn&apos;t be expanding their respective empires quite so rapidly had they not witnessed their former boss&apos;s ability to juggle kitchen and boardroom. With the public debts, closures and split with his father-in-law and business partner, Chris Hutcheson, in the past, Ramsay is eager to emphasise his robustness (&quot;strong as an ox, skin thick as a rhinoceros&quot;) as well as the health of his 23 restaurants which are now spread across five countries [we met before his Manhattan restaurant, Gordon Ramsay at The London, lost both its Michelin stars]. &quot;I&apos;m still excited about perfection,&quot; he assures me, though he can&apos;t help but keep expanding his business interests: his &quot;lighthearted&quot; new Italian, Union Street Caf\u00e9, has just opened in Borough, and he plans to open London House in Battersea later this year. There will also be two new openings in Hong Kong: a brasserie kitchen and a steak house by the harbour. He seems to be working just as hard as he was a decade ago. &quot;I&apos;m working smarter, but nowhere near as hard. Fuck me, no.&quot; He alludes to a major restructuring of Gordon Ramsay Holdings in 2011 which afforded greater autonomy to the individual restaurants, taking pressure off central office. It seems to be working out: this year&apos;s financial results, according to Ramsay, are the group&apos;s best ever. &quot;I&apos;ve started looking out for myself,&quot; he insists. &quot;It&apos;s a long game.

There had been suggestions of Real Time Snicko being introduced as an additional aid after the International Cricket Council&apos;s board meeting in London, and Giles Clarke, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board, had demanded in the immediate aftermath of the series at The Oval that the bad light regulations must be changed. But the only reference to either issue in the official statement released on Saturday after the meeting was that the board &quot;noted the discussions [of the ICC&apos;s chief executives committee last month in Dubai] on a number of issues, including maintaining the current playing conditions for ODI cricket and bad light, and the Decision Review System (DRS)&quot;.

He never needed eye makeup for his roles. So when dark rings began to develop, he knew it was something more than lack of sleep. &quot;I wondered whether it was a virus or something innocuous,&quot; he said. &quot;Then in 2009 I was doing a mini-series and noticed it was getting really bad. Because of my profession I could slap some makeup on, but if I had a shower, they would turn purplish, so I\u00a0began to think something was amiss.&quot; It was more than three years before York discovered he was suffering from the rare and potentially fatal condition amyloidosis. In spite of his connections and access to the best medical care, things became steadily worse as the hunt for answers took him down one wrong path after another. Amyloidosis is caused by the abnormal production of insoluble proteins that clump together in different parts of the body, eventually causing vital organs to shut down. Because it is unusual (there are only 500-600 cases diagnosed in the UK each year) and the signs and symptoms are different in each person, it is very hard to recognise. York, 71, spoke about the long and difficult road to diagnosis on a visit to London, where he performed in a charity reading at the Old Vic and visited the Royal Free Hospital, the leading centre in the world for the research and treatment of amyloidosis. It is the only hospital that offers a scan to locate and quantify all the amyloid deposits in the body. Professor Sir Mark Pepys, director of the Wolfson Drug Discovery Unit at the Centre for Amyloidosis and Acute Phase Proteins, who invented the scan, is now working with GlaxoSmithKline on a drug he hopes could clear the amyloid deposits from the body. Late diagnosis is far from unusual and can have dire consequences. Although median survival for Pepys&apos; patients is now eight to\u00a010 years, 20% arrive with irreversible organ failure and do not live so long. York had ignored the rings until he and his wife, photographer Pat York, went to Washington for Barack Obama&apos;s inauguration and stayed with a close friend, the biologist William Haseltine. &quot;He said, &apos;What the hell is wrong with your eyes?&apos; Go back to LA and have an eye examination. Because of the weight of his authority, I did,&quot; said York. The ophthalmologist said he had Fabry&apos;s disease \u2013 a disturbing but incorrect diagnosis which proved to be,\u00a0said York, &quot;the first of many&quot;. He tried to carry on as normal but increasingly felt tired and ill. The turning point came when he agreed to give a talk on a cruise organised by National Public Radio. &quot;We picked up the boat in Dubai and I started to feel really bad. Everything was swelling up and it was very hot outside and very cold on the boat and I began to feel so wretched that I don&apos;t know how I did my lecture. Two weeks after that Pat found me comatose on the floor. I&apos;d passed out and was rushed to hospital and they couldn&apos;t determine what it was.&quot; He went to the Cedars-Sinai hospital in LA, where doctors decided he had multiple myeloma, a type of bone marrow cancer, also with a poor prognosis \u2013 only 37% of patients survive five years after diagnosis. The treatment did not help. York credits his wife with the eventual breakthrough. She got in touch with Dr Robert Kyle at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, the multiple myeloma pioneer who is also an expert in amyloidosis, to which it is related. A\u00a0long email correspondence began. Kyle, 84, no longer sees patients, but introduced the couple to doctors at the Mayo, where tests confirmed amyloidosis. In July last year, York underwent an autologous stem cell transplant \u2013 a procedure involving the removal of some of the patient&apos;s own immature blood stem cells from the body, followed by high-dose chemotherapy to get rid of diseased or damaged marrow. The treated stem cells are then reinjected into the body. It is a risky procedure but\u00a0the actor sailed through. The rings under the eyes are still there, but York says he no longer feels ill and tired. The scan at the Royal Free last month showed most of the deposits had gone, although some remain in the spleen, and his voice and heart muscle have been affected. &quot;I&apos;ve been reprieved,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t know about cured because it can come back. It&apos;s like night and day to get your enthusiasm back, to be able to travel. I&apos;m not looking normal \u2013 I could put makeup on but I don&apos;t see the point. This is me now and when people ask about it, I&apos;m able to tell them.&quot; Not everyone has the manners to ask. The Globe, a US tabloid, ran a picture of York last year with claims from two cosmetic surgeons that he&apos;d had surgery. York wrote to the journalist offering her the true story and she replied in a one-line email: &quot;Happy you&apos;re feeling well.&quot; The couple hope the rings below his eyes will eventually disappear. In the meantime, he jokes, he is available for parts for men in dark glasses of a certain age \u2013 lots of mafia bosses.", "title": "Michael York's battle with amyloidosis", "sentences": ["&quot;We picked up the boat in Dubai and I started to feel really bad."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-20T18:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/shortcuts/2013/oct/21/hinkley-point-nuclear-power-station", "tags": ["Nuclear power", "Energy", "Environment", "EDF Energy", "Energy industry", "Business", "France", "China"], "article": "Rejoice! Britain&apos;s first new nuclear power station in a generation is to be built at Hinkley Point in Somerset, and David Cameron could not be happier. &quot;This is a very big day for our country,&quot; he said yesterday, &quot;the first time we&apos;ve built a new nuclear power station for a very long time.&quot; There is only one snag: &quot;we&quot; are not building it at all. Thanks to an amazingly cushy 35-year deal agreed with the government, the plant to be known as Hinkley C is the responsibility of a consortium largely split between the French energy giant EDF and two Chinese setups, the China General Nuclear Power Group and the China National Nuclear Corporation. EDF is 85% owned by the French government; the Chinese state owns all of the latter two companies. Nationalisation, it seems, is back \u2013 only it&apos;s a new kind, whereby it is overseas governments who get to buy up our national assets. Just look at the evidence. At the last official count, a third of British infrastructure was overseas-owned \u2013 but what&apos;s particularly interesting is the amount of government money involved. EDF \u2013 it stands for \u00c9lectricit\u00e9 de France \u2013 already owns two British coal-fired power stations, eight UK nuclear plants and a couple of British wind farms. Germany&apos;s Deutsche Bahn is a 100% state-owned railway company, and since 2010, it has also owned Arriva, which controls an array of British bus services as well as the majority of trains that run in Wales, and a whole load that serve Birmingham (prior to buying Arriva, DB had already bought the Chiltern main line, overground services in London and Tyne and Wear Metro). DP World owns 60 or so ports across the planet, including the Port of London and the Port of Southampton \u2013 and is controlled by Dubai World, an investment company that acts on behalf of Dubai&apos;s government. The state-backed China Investment Corporation owns nearly 10% of Thames Water and a similar-sized chunk of Ferrovial, the Spanish-owned conglomerate that has a big stake in the airports at Heathrow, Southampton, Glasgow and Aberdeen. Those airports are also 20% owned by Qatar Holding, which slings money around on behalf of Qatar&apos;s rulers. Oh, and just to bring things up to date, among the big investors that bought thousands of shares in Royal Mail were sovereign wealth funds whose money comes from the governments of Kuwait and Singapore. The Hinkley Point deal is traceable to a memorandum of understanding on infrastructure investment, agreed by the governments of China and the UK in 2011, and boosted by George Osborne&apos;s recent trip to Beijing (where he announced that another state-owned Chinese company is to get involved in Manchester airport). There will, it seems, be much more of this stuff \u2013 not least, perhaps, when it comes to the new high-speed rail line that will run between London and Birmingham and beyond. Among the firms who are interested in a piece of that particular action are the state-owned China Railway Group, though while in China, Osborne said talks about all that were &quot;for another day&quot;. Strange, perhaps, that the same Tories who warn of the perils of government intervention in the economy and our supposed loss of sovereignty to the wicked old EU should be going down this road, but there we are: state ownership is obviously fine, so long as it&apos;s someone else&apos;s state that&apos;s doing it.", "title": "Hinkley Point nuclear power station: a new type of nationalisation", "sentences": ["DP World owns 60 or so ports across the planet, including the Port of London and the Port of Southampton \u2013 and is controlled by Dubai World, an investment company that acts on behalf of Dubai&apos;s government."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-21T15:31:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/21/coop-group-bank-us-hedge-funds", "tags": ["Co-operative Group", "Retail industry", "Banking", "Business", "UK news", "Hedge funds"], "article": "American hedge funds have forced the Co-operative Group to relinquish control of its banking arm in a deal that raises concerns about its ethical approach to business for 4.7 million customers. After months of intense talks with two US hedge funds, the UK&apos;s largest mutual \u2013 and owner of pharmacies, grocers and funeral homes \u2013 was forced to cede majority control in the bank as it battles to plug a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall. The latest twist in the attempts by the Co-op to stave off nationalisation of the bank means that the group, formed by the Rochdale Pioneers in 1844, will be left with a 30% stake when the bank is floated on the stock market rather than the 75% it had originally hoped for when the rescue deal was first announced in June. The Unite union&apos;s national officer, Dominic Hook, said the inability of the mutual to keep control of the bank was &quot;a tragic day for the UK&quot;. He added: &quot;This is dreadful for the staff, customers and the wider banking industry. This may mean customers will have even less choice on the high street and means we will have yet another finance company seeking shareholder returns over better banking.&quot; The loss-making bank was forced to admit it had incurred another \u00a3105m of losses caused by mis-selling products including payment protection insurance. Euan Sutherland, the former boss of the retailer B&amp;Q who became chief executive of the Co-op in May, said the renegotiated deal was a good one for the group and its bondholders even though it had forced the group to redraw its original plan. &quot;This is the first bank to be rescued and to survive as a standalone entity without taxpayer money,&quot; Sutherland said. But the dramatic change in the ownership of the bank, which is likely to take place later this year, led to concerns about cultural change in the bank, its future approach to its ethical stance and the job prospects of its 10,000 staff. It is also a blow to the government, which had been hoping mutuals would create vast new challenger banks on the high street. Co-op Bank had spent a year negotiating to buy 631 branches from Lloyds Banking Group before abandoning the ambitious scheme in April when its problems began to emerge. Sutherland&apos;s predecessor, the Co-op veteran Peter Marks, who led the proposed takeover of the Lloyds branches, will face questions from the Treasury select committee of MPs about when he knew about the losses in the bank. Many disgruntled customers of the bank took to Twitter, one saying: &quot;Closing my account tonight after 23 years run by members for members you have let us down.&quot; Another said: &quot;I think I&apos;d rather you&apos;d have taken taxpayers money than to sell out to Corporate Vultures!&quot; The hedge funds that have scuppered the Co-op&apos;s original plans are known for their activism at troubled companies. Aurelius Capital Management, best known for forcing Argentina to pay out on its debts, and Silver Point Capital, linked to distressed groups such as Lehman, are thought to have amassed their stakes in the bank&apos;s bonds after it was downgraded to junk in May. They had been fighting for a bigger a stake in the bank and in convincing the Co-op to reduce the group&apos;s stake to 30% they are also taking bigger losses on their bonds. The bondholders are now expected to put \u00a31bn into the bank \u2013 compared with \u00a3500m previously \u2013 while the Co-op will now inject less than the \u00a31bn it had originally been stumping up to prop up the bank. Led by Mark Brodsky, Aurelius has been involved in debt restructurings as diverse as port owner Dubai World and the US publisher Tribune, owner of the Los Angeles Times. Silver Point Capital is run by two former Goldman Sachs employees, Edward Mul\u00e9 and Robert O&apos;Shea, and has a wide range of investments covering broadcasting \u2013 it bought two US TV stations out of bankruptcy \u2013 as well as car-makers and financial services and was involved in the bankruptcy of Hostess, the US food company best known for its Twinkies cakes. The Co-op Group is thought to be ready to make a concession to 15,000 private investors \u2013 who were &quot;very elderly and vulnerable&quot;, it had been warned. It is expected to swap their bonds for new ones that continue to pay them regular income streams rather than handing them shares. Trading in bonds has been temporarily suspended. The precise details, which are still being hammered out, are likely to be revealed in the coming days. Sutherland said customers should not be concerned about the changing structure of ownership. The Co-op Bank has been a plc for some time but it is fully-owned by the mutual group which is now relinquishing total control. For the first time Sutherland said the bank&apos;s ethical approach would be embedded in its articles of association. &quot;This bank will remain the Co-operative Bank. We are embedding the co-operative principles in the constitution of the bank to guarantee this,&quot; he said. But Andre Spicer, professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School, doubted that the bank would maintain its ethical stance in the long term. &quot;History suggests that once a mutual bank is privatised it drops the focus on doing good to focus on doing well for shareholders. Many ex-mutuals became some of the worst offenders in the lead-up to the financial crisis . The number of staff the Co-op employs is likely to drop as management search for efficiencies. Staff who remain are likely to find themselves loaded down with various restructuring efforts. Despite assurances by the new owners, the Co-op is likely to have a more commercially focused culture.&quot; New management had been hired for the bank only as recently as May when a former veteran of HSBC, Niall Booker, was appointed as chief executive. He is expected to stay as part of the deal. Richard Pym, the former boss of Alliance &amp; Leicester and now the chairman of nationalised parts of Northern Rock and Bradford &amp; Bingley, was also appointed as chairman for the Co-op Bank. The pair had been part of the independent committee set up by the Co-op Group to review the approach from the hedge funds. While a deal has been hammered out in principle, the details will need to be voted on by bondholders. As part of the attempt to raise the \u00a31.5bn ordered by the Bank of England, the Co-op asset management division has been sold off and the insurance arm is also on the block.", "title": "Co-op Group loses majority control of banking division", "sentences": ["Led by Mark Brodsky, Aurelius has been involved in debt restructurings as diverse as port owner Dubai World and the US publisher Tribune, owner of the Los Angeles Times."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-21T20:02:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/oct/22/co-op-bank-ethics-ethical-consumerism", "tags": ["Co-operative Group", "Retail industry", "Banking", "Business", "UK news", "Hedge funds", "Financial sector"], "article": "&quot;The conversion of Co-op Bank into just another bank owned by professional investors has the potential to fundamentally alter the bank&apos;s ethos and culture,&quot; says the BBC&apos;s Robert Peston \u2013 and obviously, that threatens to be a hilarious understatement. Twitter is filling up with posts that suggest the loss of a dear friend, and another win for the most venal kind of capitalism; the Unite union reckons that what has happened is &quot;dreadful for the staff, customers and the wider banking industry&quot;. If you are one of those people \u2013 like me \u2013 who has long thought that banking with the Co-op amounted to a small stand against the chicanery and stupidity of Finance Capital, you are likely to be feeling ever-so-slightly dazed. The two hedge funds that have played the lead role in forcing the wider Co-op group to give up control of its banking arm are Silver Point Capital and Aurelius Capital Management. They lent money to the bank, and now their bonds are to be converted into shares \u2013 which, at a stroke, seems to imperil many of the ethical credentials that gave the Co-op Bank its unique selling point. As it stands, for example, thanks to an ethics policy introduced in 1992, the bank is pledged not to assist &quot;any business whose core activity contributes to global climate change, via the extraction or production of fossil fuels&quot;. It does not take long to discover that among its many investments, Silver Point \u2013 which was founded by two alumni of Goldman Sachs \u2013 has holdings in the American petrol company Sunoco, and Sun Coke Energy, &quot;the largest independent producer of high-quality metallurgical coke in the Americas&quot;. As far as Aurelius is concerned \u2013 and I stand to be corrected here \u2013 fossil fuels do not seem to be a direct issue, but Co-op customers are likely to feel at least a frisson of unease about, say, this &quot;distressed debt&quot; specialist&apos;s extensive dealings with those well-known practitioners of business ethics the government of Dubai. In other words, despite assurances that the Co-op group will now be &quot;embedding \u2026 co-operative principles in the constitution of the bank&quot;, things already look very messy indeed. How does anybody build anything remotely co-operative into a business now majority owned by standard-issue investment companies? Moreover, some very important aspects of the bank that have seemingly combined ethics with creditable customer service are now looking fragile, to say the least. Thousands of redundancies are said to be inevitable; how long the admirably efficient and responsive call centre in Stockport \u2013 as against an outsourced version in some suitably low-wage territory \u2013 will last is anyone&apos;s guess. By way of warning, a Guardian piece quotes Andre Spicer, a professor of organisational behaviour at Cass Business School, who says this: &quot;History suggests that once a mutual bank is privatised it drops the focus on doing good to focus on doing well for shareholders. Many ex-mutuals became some of the worst offenders in the lead-up to the financial crisis.&quot; They certainly did: Northern Rock springs to mind, along with Bradford and Bingley. Rather than being itself a mutual, the Co-op bank was wholly owned by the mutualised Co-op group \u2013 which, as most of its account-holders seemed to believe, was good enough. It meant that the bank had strong links with the labour movement, along with decent bona fides not just on climate change, but also on the arms trade, tobacco, and more. A Guardian news piece from 2006 reports the Co-op Bank losing \u00a310m of business thanks to its moral qualms, which included a refusal of help to a firm that made furry sporrans. The story of the bank&apos;s demise is simple enough: a steady-as-she-goes business model was nudged to one side by hubris. The die was cast when the Co-op Bank merged with the Britannia Building Society in 2009, and thereby took on a great deal of bad debt: in 2012, \u00a3351m of the bank&apos;s \u00a3469m losses were traceable to assets once held by Britannia alone. By that point, the bank&apos;s plan to take over former branches of Lloyds was starting to come to grief, and the ambitions of the Co-op&apos;s then-CEO, Peter Marks, were already looking very ill-advised. &quot;People have lost trust in the financial services sector. Now we can provide a big bank, a challenger bank, that people can really trust,&quot; he said. So much for that. Ethical consumerism, once again, has turned out to be a crock. Ben And Jerry&apos;s gets eaten by Unilever; Innocent Drinks by Coca-Cola; The Body Shop \u2013 if it was ever truly &quot;ethical&quot; \u2013 gets bought out by L&apos;Oreal. And now the bank founded as the very embodiment of proletarian self-help and a different model of business ends up being run by hedge funds. To use a slightly dodgy analogy, standing one&apos;s moral ground in the midst of free-market capitalism might be a delusion akin to the idea of Socialism In One Country: if you believe in the usual left-liberal bundle of causes, politics is probably the best arena to pursue them, rather than fixating on what you do with your money. And me? I&apos;m a bruised Co-op customer, and I&apos;m staying put, largely because switching accounts long ago proved to be a huge headache. But what the hell: I buy my electricity from SSE, my train tickets from the First Group and my petrol from Texaco. I will now stop feeling smug when I reach for my royal-blue Co-op debit card: as Paul Weller once put it, the world&apos;s insane, and we&apos;re all to blame in a way.", "title": "Farewell Co-op Bank ethics \u2026 we'll miss you | John Harris", "sentences": ["As far as Aurelius is concerned \u2013 and I stand to be corrected here \u2013 fossil fuels do not seem to be a direct issue, but Co-op customers are likely to feel at least a frisson of unease about, say, this &quot;distressed debt&quot; specialist&apos;s extensive dealings with those well-known practitioners of business ethics the government of Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-22T12:27:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/23/horse-racing-tips-thursday-october-24", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Carlisle 1.50 Milan Bound 2.20 Pendra 2.55 Upswing 3.25 The Friary 3.55 Finding Your Feet 4.30 Markem 5.00 Twice Lucky (nap) 5.30 Dubai Sonnet Ludlow 1.40 Aglaophonos 2.10 Julie Prince 2.40 Ashdown Lad 3.15 Danandy 3.45 Oyster Shell 4.15 Toubeera 4.50 Daneva 5.20 Makari Southwell 1.30 Forgotten Symphony (nb) 2.00 Douglas 2.30 Turf Trivia 3.05 Deep Trouble 3.35 Piper Hill 4.05 Moon Trip 4.40 Truckers Steel 5.10 Di&apos;s Gift Wolverhampton 5.40 Daring Dragon 6.10 Dustland Fairytale 6.40 Cape Of Hope 7.10 Unknown Villain 7.40 Great Fighter 8.10 Wakeup Little Suzy 8.40 Granule 9.10 Soul Intent", "title": "Horse racing tips: Thursday 24 October", "sentences": ["Carlisle 1.50 Milan Bound 2.20 Pendra 2.55 Upswing 3.25 The Friary 3.55 Finding Your Feet 4.30 Markem 5.00 Twice Lucky (nap) 5.30 Dubai Sonnet Ludlow 1.40 Aglaophonos 2.10 Julie Prince 2.40 Ashdown Lad 3.15 Danandy 3.45 Oyster Shell 4.15 Toubeera 4.50 Daneva 5.20 Makari Southwell 1.30 Forgotten Symphony (nb) 2.00 Douglas 2.30 Turf Trivia 3.05 Deep Trouble 3.35 Piper Hill 4.05 Moon Trip 4.40 Truckers Steel 5.10 Di&apos;s Gift Wolverhampton 5.40 Daring Dragon 6.10 Dustland Fairytale 6.40 Cape Of Hope 7.10 Unknown Villain 7.40 Great Fighter 8.10 Wakeup Little Suzy 8.40 Granule 9.10 Soul Intent"], "publicationDate": "2013-10-23T17:53:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/23/economic-recovery-london-two-speed-britain", "tags": ["Economic recovery", "Economics", "Restaurants", "Business", "London", "UK news"], "article": "All being well, Ed Martin will bring a new restaurant into the world next month. Mind you, the serial restaurateur has had a few hold-ups with his latest venture. By rights, One Canada Square should already be serving up cep and truffle tagliatelle and Scottish lobster at \u00a338 a plate to bankers and lawyers in London&apos;s Canary Wharf. But there have been delays \u2013 the latest being an Italian quarry not delivering a consignment of deep green Verde Imperial marble. Builders, eh? Even if he hasn&apos;t got all of his marble, Martin&apos;s new eatery looks top ticket. The fixtures and fittings alone cost \u00a32m, while the menu boasts a special &quot;raw bar&quot; section of venison carpaccio and wild bass ceviche to cater to the modern, carb-phobic financier. But his pride and joy is the tower shooting out of the downstairs bar, with its three pillars of wood and marble. &quot;Look!&quot; he says. &quot;It symbolises business and dynamism and aspiration.&quot; I look and, to my untutored eye, it symbolises Dubai. One Canada Square will be the 11th restaurant opened by Martin and his brother, Tom. But this one is especially satisfying, as it&apos;s in exactly the same tower as the pair were going to open in 2008. Then came the crash. Just as Martin was about to sign the lease on this and another site in Chelsea his bankers at Halifax-Bank of Scotland revoked the funding. &quot;Our entire business was set back by two years,&quot; he says. &quot;Now it&apos;s like we&apos;ve come full circle.&quot; Finance may have been a struggle; but trade at Martin&apos;s restaurants, all in central London, has hardly suffered. Apart from what he describes as a &quot;blip&quot; in 2009, customers have spent more year upon year. &quot;I know it&apos;s been a grim period nationally,&quot; says Martin. &quot;But on our figures, it&apos;s as if London never suffered a recession.&quot; Or rather the London of bankers, lawyers and media folk who can afford to go to swanky restaurants. In fairness, he&apos;s not alone: the website Hot Dinners calculates that 62 independent restaurants opened in the capital in the first 10 months of 2011. Over the same period in 2012 it was 137. And by the end of October this year, there will be another 152 restaurants. The restaurant index tells you a lot about the kind of recovery Britain is enjoying. Ever since summer began, the coalition has enjoyed good economic news. After three years of flatlining, the upturn has caught economists and politicians off guard. Even senior figures in Downing Street admit to surprise. &quot;Not so long ago, when economic figures were coming up, we&apos;d try and bury them with other announcements,&quot; says a senior aide to David Cameron. &quot;Now they&apos;re the centrepiece of the diary.&quot; Yet the recovery has so far been enjoyed by a relatively small number of people in a few patches of the country. Analysis of official statistics by the Centre for Research on Socio-Cultural Change (Cresc) at Manchester University backs up Martin&apos;s hunch: London and the south-east have come roaring out of the crash, and now account for a greater share of growth than they did even during the boom. Nearly every other part of the country has got relatively worse off. And while the typical worker is going through the longest squeeze in living standards since the 1870s, top-earning households are comparatively better off than they were before the crash. And as you might infer from the restaurant index, the growth appears to be fuelled by the kind of credit and consumption boosters that ministers swore Britain would avoid this time around. George Osborne moved into Downing Street in spring 2010 promising a recovery built on business investment, exports, and the &quot;march of the makers&quot;. That&apos;s not what the Office for National Statistics describes in this month&apos;s Economic Review: &quot;Recent growth has been concentrated in household expenditure rather than in investment \u2026 some of this latest increase in expenditure has arisen as a result of higher household borrowing&quot;. To learn what a recovery centred on the capital and driven by credit looks like, talk to a central-London estate agent. When he picks me up in an office BMW, Guy Gittins is refreshingly straightforward about what&apos;s been driving recent sales in his patch of Kensington and Chelsea: easy credit. First on his list is Funding for Lending, Osborne&apos;s scheme to get banks to make around \u00a370bn of cheap loans. That credit was meant to boost small businesses; but as Gittings reports, the money has largely gone into mortgages. &quot;We&apos;re now seeing competitive lending between banks. Couple that with City boys and girls feeling more secure in their jobs and with Help to Buy helping the bottom of the market, and Londoners are starting to buy in London again.&quot; The result is prices that even he sometimes thinks are dubious. He mentions a two-bed basement flat that two years ago would have gone for \u00a31.2m. &quot;It&apos;s just gone on the market for \u00a32m.&quot; To listen to Gittins, the recent fuss over foreign purchasers sticking their money in bricks-and-mortar shoeboxes in the capital is well behind the curve. Foreigners dominated the top of the housing market immediately after the crash \u2013 he quotes the example of a Singaporean customer who would buy a \u00a34m home in London every year \u2013 but no more. We drive past a block of 60-70 flats that now go for \u00a32m apiece, despite having only &quot;a small gym, a small pool&quot;. &quot;That entire development could come on the market tomorrow and I&apos;d sell them all by Christmas,&quot; he reckons. Although now in Chelsea, Gittings comes from Chester &quot;and I go back home a lot&quot;. What do his friends and family make of him selling houses they could never afford at prices that even he sometimes thinks are a bit daft? &quot;They might start off thinking prices are mad, but they&apos;ll be convinced by me. I&apos;m passionate about the market&quot;. Going by the Cresc analysis, one of the regions that has suffered most has been the East of England, an area that begins at Watford and spreads all the way out to Cromer and Southend. Its share of growth has slumped from 9% during the boom to 5.6% since 2007. Smack in the centre of the region is Sudbury in Suffolk. Less than 90 minutes from London by train, but just a bit too far to be commuter belt. When BBC newsreader Fiona Bruce visited this summer, she reported on a &quot;recession-hit town&quot; with &quot;forlorn empty premises&quot;. The truth is a bit more nuanced than that: Sudbury has reportedly one of the busiest Waitroses in the country; but a payday loan shop has just this year opened up too. And while it may have the same number of charity shops and empty premises as any other market town in austerity Britain, in pretty Sudbury they stand out a mile. Nor is it the kind of place you&apos;d expect a foodbank. Indeed, the local Conservative MP, Tim Yeo, recently denied on local radio that there was one in his patch. But Andrew Stewart-Darling has run one for years, and reports that requests for food bags have more than doubled since April. Even so, visitors try to come through the back door, so not to be seen by their neighbours. &quot;There&apos;s a woman who lives in a village outside Sudbury, and every week she walks with her trolley for four miles, picks up her food bag, and wheels it all the way back again.&quot; The bank has got so busy that it&apos;s moving to bigger premises. In the same week that Martin serves his first meals at Canary Wharf, Stewart-Darling will open a new drop-in centre. &quot;I know the politicians must be punching the air about this recovery, but I get angry at the injustices I see here.&quot; Sudbury still feels like a town in the shadow of a recession. It&apos;s not only the closed pubs and clothes shops advertising massive discounts. The local LEAP adult education centre used to teach recreational classes for those who wanted a hobby. Once the crash came, however, it began offering vocational training. When I arrive, an employability class is in full swing: 10 adults brushing up computer skills. What do they want to do? Shopwork; forklift driving; childcare. Do they think there are jobs for them? The chorus comes back: &quot;No&quot;. Simon chips in: &quot;I&apos;m a single parent with a daughter, and the only things I can get are temporary contracts&quot;. Twenty-two year old David tells the class about the local manager who advised him that even with a forklift-driver&apos;s qualification, the only way he&apos;d get a job is to work for free. Even with an English degree, Luke Cresswell, 25, shares that hopelessness. He&apos;s been out of university for nearly two years and would ideally be providing training for youngsters. But cuts means there are no jobs, so he&apos;s doing further training. He shares a bedroom with his elder brother. The house is owned by his father who, just this week, saw six workmates laid off \u2013 while the rest were told to work harder. &quot;My dad&apos;s done everything right, worked all his life and bought a house. But if one of us left, the other two wouldn&apos;t be able to pay the bills&quot;. But things are about to get better, aren&apos;t they? The economy&apos;s on the mend. &quot;It doesn&apos;t feel like it to me or my family. It&apos;s not a recovery for us. I think even to use that word feels quite cruel.&quot; Additional reporting by Sophie Robinson-Tillett", "title": "Two-speed Britain: is the recovery restricted to London?", "sentences": ["&quot;It symbolises business and dynamism and aspiration.&quot; I look and, to my untutored eye, it symbolises Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-23T21:22:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2013/oct/24/dubai-desert-green-renewable-energy", "tags": ["Renewable energy", "Energy", "Environment", "Dubai", "World news", "Water", "Solar power"], "article": "Dubai, the Arab emirate often compared to a teenager because of its youth, breakneck growth and profligate use of resources, is to dramatically change its ways in an attempt to show the world that it can develop into an environmentally mature nation in just a few years. The indoor ski-resort, the manmade islands, the world&apos;s tallest building, the chilled sand and Armani hotels are not about to disappear, but the non-stop construction party which has seen the small fishing village on the edge of a stony desert turn into into a super-city of twisted glass towers and giant malls in under 50 years, may finally be over. In place of Dubai&apos;s legendary excess and endless boom years comes a sober report from the state of energy on Wednesday, charting the new energy direction which the young city must take if it is to continue flourishing. It must make strange reading for the average Dubai expat or emirati, normally used to being able to keep the air conditioning full on day and night and emit huge amounts of carbon. Over the next 15 years, the emirate intends to cut its energy and water demand by 30%, retrofit 30,000 buildings to save energy, switch a quarter of the enormous government car fleet to run on compressed gas and keep the temperatures in many buildings at a modest 24C. Power subsidies will be slashed and new incentives offered to instal solar heating and electricity. But that is just the start. As of last week, Dubai could generate just a fraction of the solar power of Britain or Germany despite the fact that it receives a nearly-guaranteed 10 hours of sun a day. That changed on Tuesday when Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, ruler of Dubai, switched on phase one of a solar power plant 50km out of the city, as part of Dubai&apos;s bid to host the 2020 World Expo. It will have a capacity of only 24MW to start with, but in the next 15 years will grow into a monster 1GW plant covering 20 sq km of desert. &quot;The physical potential of solar energy in Dubai is enormous. It&apos;s possible it could provide more than twice Dubai&apos;s current electricity consumption&quot;, says Graeme Sims, British regulator of the water and electricity authority. By 2030, says the energy report, Dubai will have cuts its carbon emissions by 29%, switched 30% of its $100bn a year economy to renewable energy, &apos;clean coal&apos; and nuclear, and initiated a plethora of energy- and water- saving initiatives. It may be too late for the Dubai coastline which has been trashed by strings of housing developments, but the authorities believe they can avoid having to desalinate 8bn gallons of water a year, turn waste into energy, curb pollution and recycle water. Dubai grew up ecologically in 2008 when the recession hit and the property market crashed, says Ivano Iannelli, a former Italian diplomat who directs the Dubai carbon centre of excellence, and helped collate Dubai&apos;s green master plan. Then, over just a few weeks, dozens of giant projects were halted and property values bombed. British expats living a luxury lifestyle but fearing prison for their new debts, dumped their Ferarris and 4x4s at the airport with the keys still in them, and as many as 2,500 people a week reportedly fled the boom town. The crash, says Iannelli, gave the Dubai government the chance to rethink its direction. &quot;Success is no longer recognised in short-term strategies, but the long-term. Now we have a road map for the next 20 years,&quot; he says. &quot;Never before did we have the technology to address the challenges of sustainability. The recessions certainly made us think,&quot; says Saeed Mohamed Al Tayer, chief executive of Dubai Electricity and Water Authority. Waleed Salman, a member of the Dubai supreme council of energy, says: &quot;The ideas have evolved. We have bigger targets. This is organic growth. We learned after the financial crisis to do things better. The new growth will be a new way.&quot; On the horizon, he says, is the possibility of Dubai becoming the world&apos;s first &quot;smart&quot; city, where all energy use can be monitored and controlled. &quot;We have everything in place in term of infrastructure.

The annual conference is organized by Swift, a member-owned cooperative made up of more than 10,000 banking and financial institutions around the world. I worked with Innotribe, Swift&apos;s initiative to enable collaboration in financial services, to put together a workshop aiming to help participants better understand and value human capital.  First, we created fake countries that all used different forms of currency exchange \u2013 and different measurements of economic success. Some of the countries based their economic value on their gross domestic product, while others used a more reputational definition of value in which wealth was built via positive impact on others.  To win the game, participants had to increase the wellbeing of all countries. But we didn&apos;t tell people this rule before the game. Instead, participants worked to increase their resources \u2013 while facing challenges \u2013 by interacting with other players, keeping in mind the way their countries perceived value creation. As facilitators of the game, we secretly awarded more points to participants helping others to flourish, and \u2013 by keeping that rule secret \u2013 gained key insights into how participants viewed their roles.  Perhaps unsurprisingly, participants who wanted to collaborate tended to represent countries focused on external metrics of wealth, such as reputation, while other players \u2013 those from countries focused on GDP or other inward-focused metrics \u2013 said they felt bothered by those who wanted to collaborate.  Their reactions were understandable given that their goals were based solely on growing fiscal wealth. But the world is changing, and GDP is no longer the only factor that determines wealth.  As salesforce.com&apos;s Rangaswami told me:   &quot;Customers expect us not just to hold on to their data, but to come back to them with value added knowledge or relationship capital as well. These have become more important than they&apos;ve ever been, and banks need to recognize these currencies beyond just financial capital. This requires a rediscovery of relationships that leads to a revolution of trust with customers.&quot;   Trust was a key topic at Sibos. That&apos;s not surprising: the personal data economy has arrived, in which consumers fully understand the fiscal and intrinsic value of the information linked to their identity. They know their data is a currency, so this data has to be managed and valued in a way that benefits individuals as well as banks and other businesses, amidst a core currency of trust.  Organizations willing to embrace the Trust Revolution will reap the benefits of the mutually valued human capital that results. Citing the trust being created by peer-to-peer (P2P) businesses such as Uber, which directly connects drivers with consumers, Innotribe co-founder Peter Vander Auwera said the rise of P2P mobile payment systems is disrupting traditional banking in the same way. &quot;The world needs a new kind of bank,&quot; he said.   &quot;The bank of the future will be a humanizing bank, where I am not my device and where the focus is on relationships, intimacy, depth and human connection supported by technology.&quot;   Some of these P2P networks \u2013 such as Kickstarter - already are overcoming regulatory barriers that keep keep individuals from seeking funding from traditional financial institutions, Khurana Harpreet, who heads global client innovation for IBM in North America and Europe, said in an interview:   &quot;Self-regulated institutions will come to the point where they rival big banks, and these things will become part of who you are \u2026 Whether it&apos;s five or ten years from now, they&apos;re going to be a real force to reckon with.&quot;   It&apos;s critical for financial institutions to also view their employees as key players in the Trust Revolution. After all, while many while a lot of banks and organizations are worried about disruption from startups, employees actually pose a more likely threat, according to Haydn Shaughnessy, author of The Elastic Enterprise: the New Manifesto for Business Revolution.  When leaders don&apos;t work to foster trust among teams, employees often take this as a lack of respect for their work, said Shaughnessy, who writes about enterprise innovation in a popular Forbes column.  &quot;If you don&apos;t nurture the people that want to change your organization from within, they&apos;ll do it from without, by attacking you,&quot; Shaughnessy told me. &quot;Companies need to stop saying no to employees who could take their ideas elsewhere.&quot;  John C Havens is the founder of\u00a0The H(app)athon Project and author of the upcoming book,\u00a0Hacking Happiness \u2013 Why Your Personal Data Counts and How Tracking it Can Change the World", "title": "Modern banking now runs on the human capital of trust", "sentences": ["&quot;For banks to reinvent themselves, they have to appreciate and understand human capital again \u2013 that went missing,&quot; said JP Rangaswami, chief scientist of salesforce.com and &quot;wise man&quot;, at the recent Sibos Conference in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-24T20:24:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2013/oct/25/new-boom-home-tuition", "tags": ["Home schooling", "Work & careers", "Arts funding", "Culture", "Money", "Work-life balance", "Education", "Schools"], "article": "&quot;Earn \u00a3800 a week\u00a0tutoring in Kazakhstan,&quot; read one email I received earlier this year. Another began, &quot;Do you fancy going to the Bahamas for three months?&quot; Summers in St Tropez, Hong Kong and\u00a0Tuscany were also up for grabs. Some may dismiss these emails as spam. In fact, they are a few of the &quot;international opportunities&quot; offered by\u00a0Bright Young Things, a British agency specialising in &quot;private bespoke tuition&quot;. In Kazakhstan the successful applicant would be provided with &quot;accommodation 10 minutes from the\u00a0family home&quot;; on a Hong Kong placement, a tutor would have to settle for &quot;the (spectacular) family home&quot;. Such assignments require at least four hours of work a day \u2013 teaching English, for example, or preparing children as young as five for entrance exams to a\u00a0British private school. Private tutoring is that rare thing: a booming British industry, in demand at home and abroad. Some agencies have even expanded overseas \u2013 Holland Park Tuition and Education Consultants opened a Dubai office in October last year. The online education resource EdPlace estimates, not entirely convincingly, that British parents spend as much as \u00a36bn a year on\u00a0private lessons for their children. A\u00a0recent Ipsos Mori poll for the Sutton Trust found that 24% of all young people in the UK have received private tuition at some point; in London, the figure rises to 40%. Across the country, and especially in the capital, agencies have sprouted in the hope of benefiting from this boom. Some have prospered. But more significantly, tutoring has become a\u00a0career \u2013 and for young people working in the arts, it is increasingly a second career, supplementing their creative endeavours. As a young journalist who has just started working freelance, I recently joined these ranks. Last month I attended a\u00a0training day alongside postgraduate students, former teachers and recent graduates at a loose end \u2013 as well as young writers, actors and journalists. Few had formal teaching qualifications. Almost all had degrees from Oxbridge or\u00a0other elite universities. At a time of high unemployment, hiring freezes and unpaid internships, it&apos;s not hard to see the appeal of a job paying between \u00a325 and \u00a340 an hour (and even more at some high-end agencies). For me, tutoring promises to be a\u00a0far more dependable source of income than writing, for which\u00a0it will leave plenty of time. It is\u00a0also livelier and less solitary \u2013 and, unlike many forms of casual labour, intellectually stimulating. For young adults in the creative industries, tutoring has become a long-term means of supporting their other work. &quot;Virtually all of my friends who are working creatively in the arts tutor,&quot; says Edward Kiely, a comedian who has been tutoring for almost two years. He tutors between 17 and 19 hours a week, which is enough to support his writing and performing. &quot;I never thought that there&apos;d be enough out there for it to be a\u00a0full source of income,&quot; he says. Tutoring has become a kind of inadvertent private subsidy for the arts.\u00a0Until recently, an aspiring novelist might have signed on or worked as a\u00a0copywriter, and a drama school graduate might have turned to temping or waitressing. Now, if they have a\u00a0good\u00a0degree (typically at least a 2.1), especially if it&apos;s from a Russell Group university, they have an option that offers higher wages for fewer hours. They might then put their savings towards taking a play to the Edinburgh Fringe \u2013 where, after months of hard work, they will be lucky to break even. This is, in some ways, a return to earlier centuries: Christopher Marlowe and James Joyce were both private tutors, while it has been claimed that the philosopher Thomas Hobbes conceived his masterpiece Leviathan while tutoring the future Charles II. In Victorian Britain, educated women whose families were unable to support them \u2013 like Jane Eyre, or Becky Sharp in Vanity Fair \u2013 worked as governesses, teaching the children of wealthy families, and they were prized overseas. Perhaps that was what Chris Martin and Gwyneth Paltrow had in mind two years ago when they were said to be advertising for someone to teach their children French, Spanish, Ancient Greek and Latin for \u00a360,000 a year. Few tutors today work full-time for a\u00a0single family. More common are residencies \u2013 like some of those offered in Bright Young Things&apos; emails \u2013 when a tutor goes to stay with a family, joining them in their home or on holiday. Philip Womack, a novelist and journalist who has been tutoring for a decade, once accompanied a family on a trip to India, where they stayed in a Portuguese fort. It was &quot;absolutely wonderful,&quot; he says. &quot;We did three hours tutoring in the\u00a0morning and then went to the beach in the afternoon.&quot; At British country houses, where Womack has done a number of residencies, the routine is similar: &quot;Three hours in the morning and then go for walks in the afternoon.&quot; For the super-rich, an alternative to having a full-time tutor is to hire lots of\u00a0them, each teaching different ages and subjects. Rachel Goss, an actor, describes the situation in one mother&apos;s home: &quot;There&apos;ll be three tutors milling around, and she&apos;ll want them all Saturday. &apos;Come and go as you please, log the hours.&apos; It&apos;s thousands of pounds a week that she&apos;s paying in tuition.&quot; Womack used to work as one of a wealthy Russian family&apos;s 13 tutors, all of whom were given an iPad at one point &quot;for no reason I could see&quot;. After a period of intensive tutoring, Josh Brown, a former tutor, was thanked with a VIP ticket to the Champion&apos;s League final, worth thousands of pounds. Yet a willingness to pay large sums does not guarantee co-operation on the part of the parents or their children. One\u00a0of Kiely&apos;s clients had &quot;enormously high expectations for the tutor,&quot; he says, &quot;and no expectations for the two children I was working with&quot;. Over a few weeks, the son&apos;s behaviour in lessons deteriorated to the point where he &quot;alternated between singing Gangnam Style incessantly and hitting the ground near me with a wooden sword&quot;. When Kiely complained to the agency, the mother sacked him. As a tutor, Goss frequently encounters &quot;disrespectful&quot; clients: &quot;Often there&apos;s this attitude that if they&apos;re paying you X amount then you&apos;re theirs for the hour,&quot; she says.     \u2018Almost all of my friends in the arts also tutor\u2019, says comedian and tutor Edward Kiely. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    This is no different from what tutors might experience as employees in any organisation, but as tutors they are hired for their academic and social credentials. An influx of clients who have moved to the UK to educate their children is seen as an important factor in\u00a0the current tutoring boom, and over half of Keystone Tutors&apos; students in the UK have at least one parent who was born outside the UK. Such clients often want someone who has studied at Oxford or Cambridge, for whom &quot;you almost embody a kind of British cultural authority,&quot; says James Miller, a novelist who has tutored since 2005. &quot;But also you&apos;re sort of a servant \u2013 you&apos;re on a par with the nanny.&quot; If the hourly rates are tutoring&apos;s main\u00a0attraction, the independence and flexibility it allows are also important. Although agencies play a key role in finding clients and processing payments, tutors are essentially self-employed. For Jackson Gordon, a songwriter, his work as a musician is entrepreneurial \u2013 &quot;you are your own boss&quot;. To work in a conventional office job alongside that &quot;is such a weird clash of values&quot;. With tutoring, hours can be negotiated: &quot;Once you&apos;ve built a relationship with your families, they&apos;re usually up for tutoring on a week-to-week basis,&quot; says Henry Eliot, a writer who also edits a magazine about London. For musicians or actors who might have to travel for a\u00a0concert or attend an audition, such flexibility makes it easy to keep two careers going. Some question whether it is too easy\u00a0\u2013 and whether such flexibility is in students&apos; interests. However dedicated some tutors may be to their clients, others will abandon them if a creative opportunity arises. &quot;I know actors who don&apos;t blink twice at tutoring someone for six weeks, getting an acting job and just dumping the clients,&quot; says Daniel Armstrong, an actor and director. Keystone Tutors no longer hires actors or directors for that reason. But Simon Davis has managed to find clients who accept that for periods he will be in rehearsals and unable to tutor. &quot;They enjoy or are flattered by the fact that I&apos;m a theatre director,&quot; he says. &quot;Sometimes they&apos;ve been donors or financial supporters of the work I&apos;ve done.&quot; This points to the appeal, for some, of\u00a0a tutor with creative credentials. &quot;These parents do not want their kids to\u00a0be philistines,&quot; says Armstrong. &quot;They&apos;re the kind of people who go to the opera themselves or admire the Royal Shakespeare Company, and genuinely want to pass this on to the kids.&quot; He has offered to take his students on theatre trips outside of usual hours, and plans to invite one 10-year-old student to see a play he&apos;s\u00a0working on. Whether creative people make better \u2013 or more creative \u2013 tutors is a matter of\u00a0debate. Will Orr-Ewing, the founder and director of Keystone Tutors, thinks writers are well suited to teaching English. Otherwise, he says, &quot;the disposition of a teacher and the seriousness with which they go about it is far more impactful than their hobbies or what they may want to do with their life&quot;. Yet\u00a0a tutor&apos;s lessons can be shaped by\u00a0their other work. When teaching creative writing for 11-plus exams, actor and comedian Celeste Dring finds she draws from her experiences of writing comedy: &quot;It enables me to give them a\u00a0bit more practical advice that they can\u00a0try to apply to see if it helps them to\u00a0write in a way that&apos;s more creative and more interesting.&quot; Last year, while working on a documentary about mazes and labyrinths around Britain, Eliot studied mazes with his tutees. The inspiration can also go in the other direction: experiences from tutoring have made it into art. This can be difficult to detect \u2013 Gordon got the idea for a song when he misheard what a\u00a0student said \u2013 but it&apos;s also proved critical. In Lost Boys, Miller&apos;s first novel, which was published in 2008, a number of wealthy London adolescents disappear from a public school. The idea came from observing his tutees: &quot;I saw in these kids a lot of frustration because on the one hand, their lives were so privileged, and on the other, their lives were so intensely managed,&quot; he says. &quot;You could just sense a need for rebellion lurking deep within.&quot; Other tutors echo these concerns over the levels of pressure their students \u2013 many of them still at primary\u00a0school \u2013 are under, stoked by a\u00a0combination of their parents and their schoolmates. And although some tutees attend state schools, many tutors I\u00a0spoke to expressed misgivings about work that tends to aid already privileged, wealthy people. &quot;You&apos;re further enhancing the educational capital of people who already have the\u00a0cards stacked in their favour,&quot; says\u00a0Kiely, although he adds that &quot;there\u00a0is such a\u00a0massive divide between state and\u00a0private that tutoring is relatively negligible.&quot; The Sutton Trust poll estimates that 31% of students from better-off families have had some private tuition, compared to 15% from less well-off families. Not-for-profit organisations such as the Manchester-based Tutor Trust offer free tuition to students from poorer backgrounds. The Trust trains its tutors, who work a free hour for every six they are paid, and connects them with disadvantaged schools around Manchester. Despite their reservations, most of my interviewees said they enjoy tutoring and are grateful for the opportunities it has given them. The alternatives, for Davis, would have been ushering and bar work, &quot;which would have been damaging to my career&quot; because they require more time for less money. Perhaps some will follow their US counterparts, for whom tutoring can be a career. Keystone Tutors hopes so: it has started to hire full-time tutors who sign a contract and must give a month&apos;s notice. They work 17 hours a week \u2013 a mixture of teaching students in Hong Kong online in the morning, and students in London in the afternoon \u2013 for which they can be paid \u00a335,000 a\u00a0year, without the occasional fallow periods common in tutoring. Others would give up teaching if they could afford to, but accept they might have to wait a while. For myself, as a freelance journalist just starting out, it&apos;s hard to imagine being able to manage without an additional source of income. Many tutors will continue to pursue these two careers in tandem, but Kiely sounds a word\u00a0of warning. Although parents have occasionally come to see him perform comedy, he tends not to encourage it. &quot;It could affect your professional reputation if you&apos;re inviting people along to see you in a wig and a ski suit dancing wildly on stage, or smashing eggs into your face,&quot; he says. &quot;Having a tutor is seen as shoring up a child&apos;s path in life. And I don&apos;t think that necessarily sits well with very silly, personally degrading comedy.&quot; Some names have been changed", "title": "The new boom in home tuition \u2013 if you can pay \u00a340 an hour", "sentences": ["Some agencies have even expanded overseas \u2013 Holland Park Tuition and Education Consultants opened a Dubai office in October last year."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-25T18:17:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/25/south-africa-ball-tampering-de-villiers", "tags": ["AB de Villiers", "South Africa cricket team", "Pakistan cricket team", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "AB de Villiers insisted South Africa had done nothing wrong after his team were penalised for ball tampering as they pushed for victory late on day three of the second Test against Pakistan in Dubai. The umpires, Ian Gould and Rod Tucker, were forced to change the ball and apply a five-run penalty, after they deemed the condition of the ball had been changed. The South Africa captain, Graeme Smith, was called over by the umpires at the end of the 30th over \u2013 two overs after tea \u2013 and informed of the decision to enforce the penalty. No South Africa player has yet been charged, but TV replays appeared to show a player \u2013 believed to be the all-rounder Faf du Plessis \u2013 rubbing the ball against the zipper on his whites.

We want to swing the ball as much as we can. We try and get it to reverse, putting more sweat on one side and things like that. But we don&apos;t cheat. It&apos;s as simple as that.&quot; De Villiers particularly spoke up for his team-mate Du Plessis, who was also brought into the on-field meeting between Smith and the match officials. &quot;I know Faf very well,&quot; the 29-year-old added. &quot;He is the last man on the field who will try anything like that. It is part of his responsibility to shine the ball, in order to get it to swing, and look after it. It is not an easy job and I thought he did a very good job of it.&quot; Further sanctions could be applied on top of the five-run penalty, with an ICC spokesman saying that any player reported for ball tampering by the umpires would be subject to a hearing in front of the match referee. Under the ICC regulations the umpires are obligated to report the incident to match referee David Boon, who is expected to call a hearing.

It is a good choice. The porticoed confines of an imposing property described by Sir Nikolaus Pevsner as England&apos;s &quot;most splendid 19th century mansion&quot; once regularly housed the visiting Duke of Wellington, Benjamin Disraeli and Charles Dickens, not to mention Edward VII and his mistress Alice Keppel, who regarded it as a favourite trysting place. The Scotland striker loves Wynyard&apos;s evocative atmosphere, the way the place brings the past to life yet, as Fletcher settles into an armchair and admires the vaulting ceilings, the conversation swiftly turns to a figure very much of the 21st century. Five weeks after his sacking by Sunderland, Paolo Di Canio still polarises Wearside opinion. Only last April the Italian celebrated a potentially relegation averting 3-0 win at Newcastle United with a typically dramatic knee slide. But it is Gus Poyet who will occupy his old dugout when Alan Pardew&apos;s team visit the Stadium of Light on Sunday. Six months ago Fletcher, then recovering from major ankle surgery, watched events from St James&apos; Park unfold at home. &quot;I almost couldn&apos;t believe what I was seeing,&quot; he says. &quot;It was a good day.&quot; In light of subsequent events many Sunderland supporters now regard that victory as a cruel mirage. Although Di Canio secured Premier League survival last May, the new campaign has been an unmitigated disaster. Badly missing Fletcher, who had barely returned to action before succumbing to a nasty shoulder injury from which he has only just recovered, the team have collected one point from eight games. Some observers blame Roberto De Fanti, the club&apos;s director of football and his summertime importation of 13 overseas players, but, speaking openly and objectively, the star striker points the finger of blame at his old manager. &quot;When I came back into the first-team squad after being injured it was a shock to see how intense everything was,&quot; says Fletcher, whose amalgam of penalty-area ingenuity and incision seem Poyet&apos;s best hope of implementing a successful rescue mission. &quot;Not the training \u2013 it was hard but anyone can do hard training \u2013 it was the intensity of the atmosphere. &quot;It was just weird. You had a little laugh and you had the feeling the head teacher was going to tell you off. To be scared to say anything in case the manager had a crack at you, it&apos;s not nice is it? It was intimidating.&quot; &quot;He [Di Canio] can&apos;t deny he didn&apos;t want us to smile and laugh in training, but at every other club I&apos;ve been at laughter&apos;s been a big part of things, of creating togetherness.&quot; Having spent the early part of his childhood on British Army bases across England and Germany, Fletcher \u2013 whose soldier father died of cancer when he was 10 \u2013 is no stranger to strong discipline, but believes professionalism and fun are not always mutually exclusive. He was suitably incredulous when, working on a wobble board in the gym during the final stages of rehabilitation from the ankle operation, he was ticked off for laughing. &quot;I&apos;m a bit of a joker,&quot; acknowledged the \u00a312m signing from Wolves, who scored 11 goals in 28\u00a0Premier League appearances last season. &quot;I was in the gym doing my balance work and obviously you weren&apos;t allowed to laugh and balance at the same\u00a0time.&quot; Even so, there is a nagging sense that Sunderland and Di Canio both blew a wonderful opportunity. If the latter&apos;s man-management proved self-destructive, his coaching was widely acknowledged as excellent, while few would deny that, following a period of sustained mediocrity, the club&apos;s mindset needed overhauling. The problem was that the former West Ham and Lazio striker dived in two-footed. &quot;He wanted the best for the club and his training and stuff was right,&quot; says Fletcher. &quot;It was right what he was doing \u2013 but he was doing it in the wrong way. He could have become a good Sunderland manager, the fans loved him. &quot;He&apos;s not a bad manager, you can&apos;t say that because he kept us up last season, but he was a bit too much. You wanted to take a step back and stand at arms length when he was talking to you because you didn&apos;t know how he was going to react. He was all hyper: his arms were everywhere. He said the right things sometimes, it was just the way he said them which wasn&apos;t right. You can&apos;t speak to the boys like that, they&apos;re not kids, they&apos;re adults.&quot; It grated that Di Canio&apos;s strict disciplinary regime was largely applauded by supporters wearied by seasons of underachievement. &quot;Sometimes we felt: &apos;Let&apos;s get the fans in so they can see what it&apos;s like and then they can make a decision,&apos;&quot; Fletcher reveals. &quot;But we couldn&apos;t do that.&quot; Ultimately, in a show of unity which perhaps surprised the former manager, the players complained to De Fanti and Margaret Byrne, Sunderland&apos;s chief executive. &quot;Paolo said there was no togetherness but, even with all the new foreign players, this is one of the closest-knit teams I&apos;ve played for,&quot; Fletcher says. The afternoon before Di Canio&apos;s dismissal, a group rebellion in the dressing room following a defeat at West Bromwhich Albion prefaced regime change, although the episode rather floated over Fletcher&apos;s head as he received treatment for the shoulder injury. &quot;I was with the doctors, on gas and air, so the lads told me later,&quot; says the 26-year-old who, finally fully fit again, will relish Sunday&apos;s expected duel with Newcastle&apos;s Steven Taylor. &quot;&apos;Tayls&apos; is a good lad but our fans will be happy if I upset him,&quot; he says, smiling. &quot;They&apos;ve got a good team but so have we; it&apos;s just we need to start winning. &quot;We know we&apos;re good enough to stay up but the position we&apos;re in, we need to win. The boys know that. Gus Poyet knows it. With every game we lose it&apos;s going to get harder and harder. We need to put it right now. Sunday&apos;s a massive game for both clubs: Newcastle don&apos;t want a repeat of what happened last time and we need three points.&quot; After proving the outstanding individual in Burnley and Wolves sides relegated from the Premier League, even someone with a disposition as sunny as Fletcher&apos;s could be forgiven for tiring of life at the wrong end of the table. But the boyhood Liverpool fan remains sanguine: &quot;Every club I&apos;ve been at has been in a relegation battle. I&apos;m used to it by now but I know we can turn our season around.&quot; Starting his first Premier League job Poyet lacks similar front-line experience, but his key forward has already invested considerable faith in the former Brighton manager. &quot;He&apos;s been brilliant, first class, more like [Di Canio&apos;s predecessor] Martin O&apos;Neill in the way he works,&quot; says Fletcher. &quot;He&apos;s given the boys a buzz again. The difference between him and Paolo is like night and day. &quot;His staff are great; Charlie Oatway, the first-team coach, is a character. He lifts the boys in the mornings when he comes into the changing rooms. We never had that in the last regime. It was just the manager, nobody else really spoke. It wasn&apos;t nice before but there&apos;s a bit of banter about the place again. And Gus Poyet&apos;s given Bardo [Phil Bardsley, exiled by Di Canio after two well-documented indiscretions] a fresh start, which we were all pushing for.&quot; Not that yet another new beginning under a third new manager in little more than a year on Wearside was quite what Fletcher envisaged upon leaving Wolves. &quot;Sunderland&apos;s a massive club but part of coming here was about Martin O&apos;Neill,&quot; he concedes. &quot;Playing for Martin was a massive thing, but then I was on a beach in Dubai recovering from the ankle when I got a text saying he&apos;d been sacked.&quot; Six turbulent months beckoned but, bolstered by the birth of his daughter, Darcy-Mae, seven weeks ago, a move to a new house three weeks ago and Poyet&apos;s arrival, Fletcher senses a bright new dawn approaching. &quot;Everything&apos;s sorted now,&quot; says the striker. &quot;All I need now is for us to get a win.&quot; Steven Fletcher wears Umbro Geometra 2 Pro boots", "title": "Steven Fletcher: 'Paolo Di Canio didn't want us to smile or laugh'", "sentences": ["&quot;Playing for Martin was a massive thing, but then I was on a beach in Dubai recovering from the ankle when I got a text saying he&apos;d been sacked.&quot; Six turbulent months beckoned but, bolstered by the birth of his daughter, Darcy-Mae, seven weeks ago, a move to a new house three weeks ago and Poyet&apos;s arrival, Fletcher senses a bright new dawn approaching."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-26T22:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/27/can-the-burqa-be-stylish", "tags": ["Islamic veil", "Fashion", "Life and style"], "article": "When Sheikha Raya Al-Khalifa moved from her home country of Bahrain to Qatar a few years ago to marry her husband, her friends were anxious. &quot;They immediately said: &apos;Oh no, you&apos;re going to a country where you&apos;re going to wear the abaya!&apos;&quot; recalls Sheikha Raya, laughing at the memory. We are sitting in the lounge of a luxury hotel in South Kensington, London, sipping on glasses of iced water. Sheikha Raya is draped from head-to-toe in a black abaya. Her hair is covered but her face is visible and impeccably made-up. Her nails are painted bright red. A chunky gold necklace hangs from her neck. Her 4in heels are Valentino &quot;Rock Stud&quot; pumps. Despite her choice to dress in a garment associated with religious and patriarchal subjugation, the 29-year-old Sheikha Raya does not in any other respect look like an oppressed woman. &quot;When people make comments about &apos;covering up&apos;, they&apos;re not understanding,&quot; she says. &quot;It&apos;s not this forced-upon-us thing. It&apos;s a reflection of what is part of our culture.&quot; Sheikha Raya is one of a new wave of young women across the Middle East and beyond who are seeking to redefine traditional Islamic dress \u2013 the abaya (cloak), the niqab (the face veil), burqa (whole body covering) and the hijab (the head and shoulder scarf) \u2013 as a means of female expression. These women insist that they do not equate modest dressing with persecution, but that wearing an abaya can be a statement both of individual choice and style. It is a stance that continues to divide opinion. In September, the deputy prime minister, Nick Clegg, ignited a national debate after saying he did not think the full veil was appropriate attire for airport security or the classroom. Shortly afterwards, a government review was launched into health-service guidelines on veils to ensure that patients had &quot;appropriate face-to-face contact&quot;. At the same time as the politicians were debating the issue, the Victoria and Albert Museum hosted a high-gloss event on the eve of London Fashion Week to showcase the work of three female Qatari designers, all of whom took the traditional Islamic dress as their starting point. On the catwalk, richly embroidered abayas were teamed with futuristic Philip Treacy headdresses and Asprey handbags.     \u2018I am wearing the abaya as a gown and it\u2019s not about showing skin\u2019: Farheen Allsopp.  Photograph: Suki Dhanda for the Observer    Farheen Allsopp, a businesswoman and former model who co-ordinated the Fashion Exchange initiative, says the aim of the event was: &quot;To celebrate the abaya as a garment of style and modesty much like the kimono and sari have been with Japanese and Indian cultures. In my view, the abaya is a garment of expression rather than of oppression.&quot; She gestures to her own chic outfit: a sheer black abaya worn over American Apparel leggings, Sergio Rossi heels and cinched in at the waist with an Alexander McQueen belt. &quot;I am wearing it as a gown and it&apos;s not about showing skin, it&apos;s about showing how elegantly you carry something,&quot; she says. &quot;You can use different fabrics, different silhouettes.&quot; Both Sheikha and Farheen insist they are increasingly frustrated by the &quot;patronising&quot; western attitude that assumes a woman must be incapable of acting assertively if she is wearing the abaya or the niqab. &quot;Just because we wear the abaya, we&apos;re not sitting at home doing nothing,&quot; says Sheikha. &quot;Don&apos;t get us wrong.&quot; It&apos;s a point of view that leaves many in the west feeling distinctly uneasy. And the notion of the abaya or niqab as a fashion statement still has the capacity to provoke enormous controversy.     Covering up: a controversial advert for Diesel. Photograph: Diesel    When Nicola Formichetti, the artistic director for clothing label Diesel and Lady Gaga&apos;s former stylist, developed a recent advertising campaign featuring a\u00a0tattooed woman wearing a niqab and nothing else alongside the tagline: &quot;I am not what I appear to be&quot; there was an outcry. &quot;The key issue is whether a woman is required to wear the abaya by law,&quot; says Leila Ahmed, a professor of divinity at Harvard University and the author of A Quiet Revolution: The Veil&apos;s Resurgence, from the Middle East to America. &quot;If they are free to choose, you could certainly argue the bikini is no more sexist than the abaya: they are both constructions of the female body.&quot; Of course, in less repressive states such as Qatar and Dubai, women are more able to make their own choices than in, say, Saudi Arabia, where the strict dress code requires a\u00a0woman to show only her hands and eyes. But even if something is not enforced by law, can wearing the abaya or the niqab ever truly be an act of empowerment? In her bestselling feminist memoir, How to be a Woman, Caitlin Moran claims the idea of choosing to wear a veil is an illusion. &quot;Who are you being protected from?&quot; she writes. &quot;Men. And who \u2013 so long as you play by the rules, and wear the correct clothes \u2013 is protecting you from the men? Men. And who is it that is regarding you as just a sexual object, instead of another human being, in the first place? Men.&quot; But Professor Ahmed argues that female clothing from all cultures, religions and ideologies, has some kind of sexist underpinning. &quot;I think all dress is symbolic and often very sexist in most societies,&quot; she says. &quot;It is true that the abaya keeps the male gaze away. I think in other eras it was one of the explanations why western men who first went to Muslim societies were so offended by it, because they couldn&apos;t see the woman underneath; they didn&apos;t have access to women&apos;s bodies.&quot; In Paris, an underground graffiti artist called Princess Hijab has taken to the streets in recent years and spray-painted veils and hijabs over fashion models depicted on advertising billboards. The question implicitly being asked is whether hiding a face behind a\u00a0niqab is any different from hiding one behind make-up and air-brushing in a high-gloss poster celebrating consumerist mores. Indeed, Sheikha Raya insists that wearing the abaya in the name of style actually removes the need to be competitive with other women about appearance or designer labels. It is, she claims, an egalitarian garment that can be liberating simply because you don&apos;t need to think about different outfits throughout the day. &quot;I take my child to school at 6am, I do my errands, I get an unexpected call to go to a business meeting, I have a formal dinner at the end of the day and for all of which I&apos;m wearing my abaya,&quot; she says. &quot;If you&apos;re in the west, you have to go and change or do your hair. I think the latter is more of a restriction.&quot; With the emergence of the Gulf States as economic centres, a new wave of designers is already seeking to capitalise on their spending power. In 2011, Reuters reported that women from the Middle East have become the world&apos;s biggest buyers of haute couture. Riccardo Tisci at Givenchy did a\u00a02009 collection based on Bedouin robes and traditional Arabic headgear while Alessandra Rich, a British designer whose creations have been worn by Samantha Cameron, used a series of her high fashion abayas in a photoshoot for Vogue Italia. Many of Valentino&apos;s autumn/winter haute couture gowns display a\u00a0distinctly Islamic influence (including a\u00a0floor-length, long-sleeved agate and chartreuse gown) and the designer Stephane Rolland famously has a\u00a0vast client base across the Middle East \u2013 in August, he opened his first pret-a-porter boutique not in Paris, Milan or London but in Abu Dhabi. In 2010, the same year that the French government banned the veil, Chanel&apos;s creative director Karl Lagerfeld praised the burqa because: &quot;I find it picturesque.&quot; A year later, when Nigella Lawson went swimming in Sydney sporting a burkini (swimwear originally designed for Islamic women), sales of the item rose by 400%. Lady Gaga often wears items of Islamic dress on stage \u2013 including a neon pink burqa. The women I speak to argue that simply because they might choose to dress modestly does not automatically suggest they are not fashionable, nor does it imply a disapproval of more revealing clothes \u2013 it is still possible for a woman to wear as little as she likes and not to deserve objectification or misogyny. In fact, many Islamic feminists argue that endlessly debating the worthiness or otherwise of wearing the veil or the abaya dehumanises the individual woman and detracts attention from more pressing issues such as jobs and education. Can an abaya or a niqab ever be separated from its religious heritage and viewed purely as a fashion statement? Sheikha Raya points that the Gulf state economies have grown rapidly over the past few decades as the oil industry has expanded. Consequently, the region: &quot;has had to modernise very, very quickly, in a fraction of the time it took the rest of the world.&quot; The suggestion is that, although the economy might have undergone a fast-paced change, cultural and religious history will take some time to catch up. &quot;I grew up in America, where women didn&apos;t get the vote until the 1920s,&quot; explains Sheikha Raya. &quot;In the west, women are still not being paid an equal wage. Maybe we should look at this gender inequality as a global issue rather than concentrating on what people are wearing in their own culture. Because we&apos;re happy. We&apos;re definitely not oppressed.&quot; That might not mean much to the woman in Saudi Arabia who is forbidden from learning to drive or the schoolgirl in Pakistan who is shot in the head purely because she wanted an education. But what voices like Sheikha Raya, Farheen Allsopp and Leila Ahmed are saying is that the debate shouldn&apos;t just be about a veil or a cloak. It should look deeper. &quot;I think the whole issue of &apos;Islamic feminism&apos; is very complicated because it tends to erase [the fact] that Muslims are like other people,&quot; says Professor Ahmed. &quot;They might be secular, they might be very religious, they might wear the hijab or not. There are the same kind of issues if you are a Jewish feminist or a Christian feminist or a Muslim feminist.&quot; A woman, then, is more than just the clothes she wears or the fashions she chooses to follow. That goes for any culture \u2013 with or without the blinged-up abaya.", "title": "Can the burqa be stylish?", "sentences": ["&quot;If they are free to choose, you could certainly argue the bikini is no more sexist than the abaya: they are both constructions of the female body.&quot; Of course, in less repressive states such as Qatar and Dubai, women are more able to make their own choices than in, say, Saudi Arabia, where the strict dress code requires a\u00a0woman to show only her hands and eyes."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-26T23:05:11Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/oct/27/sport-news-in-brief", "tags": ["Sport"], "article": "GOLF Guthrie joined at top as Dyson is disqualified Luke Guthrie finally surrendered the outright lead at the BMW Masters on a day when one of his rivals was disqualified before play began in Shanghai.

Yet the Northern Irishman offered effusive praise towards golf as an Olympic sport after defeating Tiger Woods in an exhibition match in China on Monday. McIlroy has previously admitted to being so uncomfortable over his likely upcoming choice of whether to represent Great Britain or Ireland at Rio in 2016 that he may withdraw from the selection process altogether. Speaking after his one-stroke victory over Woods at the Blackstone course on Hainan Island, he offered a more positive outlook. &quot;I think the inclusion of golf in the Olympics is a great thing,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s great for the growth of the game. It gets countries like China interested in golf. And not just to develop Olympic champions, but just being an Olympic sport, it means something; it means something just more. &quot;You know, you are going to see a lot of new people and new countries and junior golfers come into golf because it&apos;s an Olympic sport. I think golf can only gain from its inclusion in the Olympics, and, you know, I think it&apos;s a great thing.&quot; McIlroy&apos;s mood would, of course, have been boosted by his 67 in the lucrative shootout with Woods. McIlroy has slipped to No6 in the world but the introduction of a new ball and driver to his bag have lifted him to his most confident point of this troubled year. &quot;I obviously love both of them,&quot; said the 24-year-old of the softer-covered ball and more-forgiving driver. &quot;It&apos;s much better,&quot; he added. &quot;I&apos;ve seen a lot of promising signs over the past few weeks in practice and also in competitive play. I still have four tournaments left until the end of the season and I would love to finish 2013 strongly and get a little bit of momentum going into next season. &quot;But I think, as I showed out there, I&apos;m hitting the ball well. Tee-to-green, the game was very solid, and if I can just get the putter going a little bit more, and get a few more putts to drop, then in these last four tournaments I can hope to contend and maybe pick up a win or two.&quot; McIlroy&apos;s first objective is to earn a place in the 60-man field for the European Tour&apos;s Race to Dubai finale in a fortnight&apos;s time. He currently lies 62nd in the rankings. Despite the defeat, Woods is still thought to have pocketed more than McIlroy from the exhibition match; US$2m against $1.5m. Yet there was embarrassment both for Woods and the organisers as the world No1 \u2013 who, like McIlroy was wearing a microphone on the course \u2013 was heard swearing on several occasions. Television commentators even had to apologise about bad language emanating from Woods on the 17th hole. Afterwards, Woods cited illness as the cause of his frustration. &quot;Obviously you can hear, I probably don&apos;t sound my best,&quot; Woods said. &quot;But it&apos;s nice that it was warm out there. That certainly helps. I&apos;m hoping that my fever broke and that I&apos;m going to start feeling a little bit better.

In a speech to the first meeting of the World Islamic Economic Forum to be held outside a Muslim country, the prime minister will also unveil plans by the London Stock Exchange to launch the first Islamic Market Index. Cameron will tell more than 1,800 political and business leaders, who have travelled to London for the ninth meeting of the forum, that Britain aims to secure a slice of global Islamic investments, due to reach \u00a31.3tn by next year. Britain hopes that the index will help identify Islamic finance opportunities. The government moved on Monday night to offer assurances that the Islamic bond, or Sukuk, and the Islamic index would not encourage investments that discriminate against Israel. Boris Johnson was forced to order Transport for London to rewrite the contract for the Emirates Thames cable car in the summer amid fears that Israeli companies could have been blocked from involvement in the project. The United Arab Emirates does not recognise the state of Israel. A government spokesman said: &quot;The government&apos;s decision to issue a Sukuk compliant bond is about making sure Britain is open for business \u2013 we will not open one door at the expense of another. While the Treasury is still working on the practicalities, we can confirm that the government would never exclude a supplier on nationality grounds.&quot; The Sukuk bond will comply with Islamic law and investment principles that prohibit lenders from charging interest. The prime minister will say that London is already the biggest centre for Islamic finance outside the Islamic world. But he will also say: &quot;Today our ambition is to go further still. Because I don&apos;t just want London to be a great capital of Islamic finance in the western world; I want London to stand alongside Dubai as one of the great capitals of Islamic finance anywhere in the world. There are some countries which naturally look inwards, pull up the drawbridge and refuse to recognise that the way the world is changing affects their future success. But Britain will not make that mistake.&quot; Cameron will say that his government aims to become the first outside the Muslim world to issue an Islamic bond next year. He will say: &quot;For years people have been talking about creating an Islamic bond outside the Islamic world. But it&apos;s just never quite happened. Changing that is a question of pragmatism and political will. And here in Britain we&apos;ve got both. &quot;This government wants Britain to become the first western sovereign to issue an Islamic bond. So the Treasury is working on the practicalities of issuing a bond-like Sukuk worth around \u00a3200m, and we very much welcome the involvement of industry in developing this initiative which we hope to launch as early as next year.&quot; On the Islamic index he will say: &quot;The growth of Islamic finance means that there is an increasing demand for new ways of identifying Islamic compliant business activities. Again the City of London is leading the way \u2013 this time not just in Europe, but right across the world. &quot;Today the London Stock Exchange is announcing the creation of new indices. These not only identify companies that meet traditional Islamic investment principles but also use the most advanced techniques on the planet to screen financial ratios and enable investors to identify opportunities with lower volatility.

The Open Data Institute has announced the launch of 13 international centres, known as &quot;nodes&quot;, each of which will bring together companies, universities, and NGOs that support open data projects and communities. The nodes will be based in the US, Canada, France, Dubai, Italy, Russia, Sweden and Argentina, with two extra US nodes Chicago and North Carolina. Three further UK nodes are to open in Manchester, Leeds and Brighton. The new ODI nodes will variously operate at local and national levels. Each one has agreed to adopt the ODI Charter, which is a open source codification of the ODI itself, and embodies principles of open data business, publishing, communication, and collaboration. The ODI is a non-for-profit organisation that has so far helped set up more than a dozen open data-based startup companies in the UK, generating income, research and training. It has also created a certificate for open data allowing all users to access information on many areas such as healthcare, transport, peer-to-peer lending, and energy efficiency. The UK ODI secured \u00a310m funding over five years from the UK innovation agency, the Technology Strategy Board, $750,000 from global philanthropic investor Omidyar Network created by eBay founder Pierre Omidyar. It aims for long-term sustainability through match funding and direct revenue through memberships and supporters. With the new global network announced at the ODI&apos;s first annual summit at the Museum of London on Tuesday, CEO Gavin Starks said: &quot;I have been amazed at the energy and enthusiasm of people looking to align around a global network of ODIs \u2026 the speed at which we have been able to collaborate, and the shared thinking about the approach and the scale of the potential. We have borrowed from the design principles of the web itself to bring people and organisations together, and will use open data both to collaborate with each other, and as the primary output of the network.&quot; Berners-Lee and Shadbolt described their motivation for the ODI: &quot;We recognised there was a great opportunity to enhance transparency, improve efficiency, and create social, environmental and economic value. The best way that open becomes the new default is demand: from businesses and organisations, both public and private, from individuals and corporations. There is nothing so powerful as an idea whose time has come.&quot;     Sir Nigel Shadbolt (left) and Sir Tim Berners-Lee co-founders of the Open Data Institute which announces 13 international 'nodes' at its first annual summit. Photograph: Rex Features    Big data specialists MastadonC joined the ODI startup programme in December 2012 and has been one of ODI&apos;s particular success stories. MastodonC offers an open source technology platform for clients in a zero-carbon structure. It analysed NHS prescribing data with Open Health Care UK and Ben Goldacre, the doctor and writer behind BadScience.net. Its study revealed a potential \u00a3200m of NHS savings after analysing prescribing patterns for statins, drugs used to prevent cardiovascular problems. It also worked alongside the Department for Climate Change and the Energy Saving Trust, managing data from a project to retrofit more than 100 homes, from which it revealed emissions savings of between 60% and 85%. The ODI also helped produce a report, Show me the Money that provided a comprehensive snapshot of the UK peer-to-peer lending (P2P) market. It also became the first financial data published with an open data certificate. As a result of the research, loan company LendInvest lowered its minimum investor-led level from \u00a350,000 to \u00a310,000. Transport API (built by another startup, Placr) created a single source of public transport information for developers that includes timetable, live departure and disruption information from open data sources data to Transport for London, CityMapper, and more than 300 developers. Digital startup CarbonCulture has worked with No 10 Downing Street, Tate Modern and Cardiff Council to measure and report on their carbon and energy performance. Francis Maude, minister for the Cabinet Office, said: &quot;The Open Data Institute \u2013 the first organisation of its kind \u2013 grew out of our belief in the power of open data to foster innovation, drive economic growth and create prosperity. The fact that only one year on, cities and countries around the world want to adopt the ODI model, is evidence of how quickly the open data revolution is spreading. The establishment of ODI nodes in UK cities will help embed an open data culture in communities, and bring the economic benefits of new and innovative data-led businesses that will help the UK compete in the global race.&quot; With its new global network, the ODI aims to replicate such achievements internationally. Waldo Jaquith, founder the new US-wide ODI, said: &quot;&apos;The US has a vibrant, fast-growing open data ecosystem. The ODI provides a model that can help to catalyse and connect the organisations, governments, businesses, and individuals who are doing brilliant work with open data. As a nation, we have the resources, tools, and people that we need \u2013 they just need to be connected and given a helping hand. It&apos;s time to bring the ODI model to the US.&quot; Currently facing criticism over in the NSA spying scandal and the furore of long-term surveillance of foreign allies, Barack Obama in fact became a pioneer for the open data movement on his first day in office in January 2009 by issuing a memo on the Freedom of Information Act to federal departments. The data.gov website was set up in May 2009, thousands of datasets were released, and many other countries release data.gov websites in the same year. His statement said: &quot;In the face of doubt, openness prevails&quot; and talked of &quot;accountability through transparency&quot;. On the overall subject of accountability, ODI co-founder Shadbolt, who is also professor of artificial intelligence at Southampton University, said: &quot;There will be times when we have to hold government to account, to call out poor data practice, to highlight the precarious state of data assets in both the public and private sector.&quot; The ODI uses the term &quot;nodes&quot; after Berners-Lee&apos;s revolutionary step in 1989 in creation of the world wide web. At the time he proposed that &quot;HyperText is a way to link and access information of various kinds as a web of nodes in which the user can browse at will.&quot; The ODI aims to be catalyst for change as much as Berners-Lee&apos;s 24-year-old invention.", "title": "Web inventor's open data organisation announces new global network", "sentences": ["The nodes will be based in the US, Canada, France, Dubai, Italy, Russia, Sweden and Argentina, with two extra US nodes Chicago and North Carolina."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-29T07:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/29/india-mumbai-population-rail-accidents", "tags": ["India", "World news", "Rail transport", "Urbanisation", "Population", "Global development"], "article": "At the height of the Mumbai rush hour getting on to a train is like trying to find somewhere to sit in a rugby scrum. On the platforms anyone wearing spectacles carefully puts them away. Travellers take a big breath and push forward into the tightly packed crowd, finally gaining a toehold on the running board, their bodies leaning outwards. To survive for up to four hours a day crushed into their compartments, passengers come prepared and groups of friends form. Some sing, others play the stock market or cards. The best organised take turns occupying seats. &quot;We spend so much time and we know each other so well we even organise picnics at the weekend,&quot; says Yogesh Sapkale, deputy editor on the magazine Money Life. Mumbai is India&apos;s most populated city and with 7.5 million riders a day its trains are the most overloaded in the world, as even the Ministry of Railways acknowledges. Rail traffic has increased sixfold in the past 40 years, but capacity has only doubled. Meanwhile the city&apos;s population, estimated at 20 million, has soared. It is twice as dense as New York. It is so difficult to build new railway lines in such a densely occupied space that one of the few ways of increasing capacity is to add carriages and run trains faster. For Mumbaikars trains are an essential means of transport. During the rush hour the only alternative would be to take a car, travelling at under 8km/ph on barely serviceable roads, particularly during the monsoon. The jammed traffic moves so slowly that enterprising spirits broadcast adverts from loudspeakers mounted on three-wheelers. It would be quicker to walk but the distances are too great, the urban area stretches 120km from north to south. Mumbai is on the verge of seizing up. Built on a peninsula, it can only develop northwards. But its original centre and economic heart is at the southern tip, a cul de sac where property values are rocketing. To find affordable homes, the middle classes have no option but to invest in residential complexes north of the city, with poor links to the centre. So the rail network really is a life line, though 10 to 12 riders perish every day. Some climb onto train roofs and are electrocuted, others fall off overloaded carriages or are crushed by engines as they scuttle across the tracks. Despite the 20 to 25 accidents registered daily trains always run on time. They are so punctual that a television journalist was able to broadcast live for two hours overlooking an injured rider lying between the rails in the middle of a station. Meanwhile about 20 trains thundered over the victim. AJ More heads the railway police team in charge of accidents in an area encompassing seven stations. In his cramped, mouldy office the shelves are stacked high with files on victims, wrapped in white fabric like corpses. He has neither a telephone nor a computer, just a camera to photograph bodies lacking identity papers or a cellphone. One in three victims are cremated or buried without identification being possible. &quot;The deceased are often rural migrants and their family has no idea they have disappeared,&quot; More explains.     Workers take a break during the building of Mumbai's  Bandra-Worli sea link. Photograph: Indranil Mukherjee/AFP/Getty    The injured sometimes succumb long after the accident. Trapped in the traffic, ambulances arrive late or simply return to base. Some do not even bother to turn out. &quot;Recently a paramedic came to see me with\u00a0a complaint. Out of the $12 he was paid for transporting the victim, the station manager demanded a $2.50 commission,&quot; More says with a sigh. Samir Zaveri, who was severely injured by a train 24 years ago, campaigns for passengers&apos; rights. By dint of persistence and litigation he forced Dadar station to open a medical centre to give injured passengers first aid, saving many lives. He has also campaigned for more compensation paid to victims&apos; families, currently about $9,500. &quot;Why should a rail fatality be worth less than someone killed in a plane crash?&quot; he asks. Accidents numbers are still rising, and stations now have their own undertakers. At Mumbai Central station Shankar Naidu transports corpses as a sideline. His porter&apos;s uniform, a grimy red shirt far too large for his skinny frame, serves as a pyjama too, for he sleeps at the end of a platform.When the public-address system announces that the railway police need a porter for an accident he hurries over. He is paid $1.50 for each dead or injured passenger he takes to the hospital. &quot;Mostly the bodies are already rotting, because accidents go unnoticed or aren&apos;t reported,&quot; Naidu says. Death has become a routine affair on the railways. &quot;Tomorrow morning a young wage-earner will kiss his wife and children goodbye before leaving for work, and I&apos;ll pick up the bits on the track because he was determined to catch an overloaded train for fear of losing half a day&apos;s wages,&quot; Inspector More says in despair. &quot;It&apos;s the price to pay for living in Mumbai.&quot; Megacity with a transportation headache to match By the end of the year, a monorail transit system and an 11km elevated metro line should be up and running in Mumbai. &quot;This is one of the biggest infrastructure challenges. It is easy to build rail and metro in an open area, but in a congested area like Mumbai city, it was a huge challenge,&quot; Maharashtra state chief minister Prithviraj Chavan said during trials of the new system this summer. Land purchases in such a populated conurbation immediately run into public opposition and litigation can last for years, not to mention the demolition or movement of religious buildings, always a sensitive issue in the country. The promoters of a project must also deal with the regional and national authorities, and work around existing infrastructure. For example, it took five years for the national ministry of railways to approve construction of a bridge to carry the 6.5km Santacruz Chembur link road across a suburban railway line. It is no easier to dig underground railway lines. In Mumbai, much as elsewhere in India, the maps of the sewage system are unreliable and large numbers of illegal wells slow the progress of work. The metro line connecting eastern and western districts of the city is finally due to open three years behind schedule. Unfortunately it will not have a huge impact as it will only carry several hundreds of thousands of riders a day. So what is the solution? Given the difficulties hampering the construction of roads and railways on dry land, planners are advocating new infrastructure out in the bay. The Bandra-Worli sea link, a bridge connecting the western suburbs to the central business district, was opened in 2010 and has relieved congestion in part of the city. The city authorities have even considered a gigantic bridge to connect the peninsula to the mainland. There is also talk of ferries between the north and south of the city. But few proposals have come to much. According to the Centre for Research on Sustainable Urban Development and Transport Systems in New Delhi, Mumbai only invests $200m a year in infrastructure, whereas it should be spending 15 times more. Well-off residents in north Mumbai, reluctant to travel by train or endure the traffic jams, are increasingly avoiding the city centre altogether.

Look around your cities and you&apos;ll see their nautical envy in every detail, from balcony decks with cruise-liner balustrades to sail-like canopies and the beloved porthole window. Since Le Corbusier plastered images of gleaming ocean liners across the pages of his manifesto in 1923, urging architects to give their buildings the same sleek dynamism, he has been taken at his word. Some have interpreted it too literally: from Dubai&apos;s Burj Al Arab hotel to Portsmouth&apos;s bizarre Spinnaker Tower, there are entire buildings designed like sails, looking ready to make a break for the high seas. Perhaps this maritime yearning comes from the fact that the boat represents everything the building is not. It is lithe and lightweight, free from the clumsy constraints of bricks and mortar. Their wires and rigs, bulwarks and pinrails, embody an escapist fantasy, removed from the slow and heavy things that weigh down the architect&apos;s life of earthbound drudgery. So what happens when the designer of buildings gets to dream up an actual boat? Recent evidence suggests it might not be such a good idea. Zaha Hadid     'Storm-damage chic.' Photograph: Blohm and Voss/Rex    Countless breakfasts were unduly dislodged earlier this month when images of Zaha Hadid&apos;s superyacht burst on to our screens. Completing her collection of oligarchs&apos; accessories \u2013 which already spans everything from weaponised jewellery and challenging footwear, to stealthy hideouts in the forests of Russia \u2013 the queen of the curve has now applied her love of convoluted geometries to a floating gin palace. Like a captured creature writhing in a tangle of ectoplasm, the 128-metre &quot;concept yacht&quot; is enveloped in a globular casing of interwoven sinews which frame big open holes \u2013 giving the ship a certain storm-damage chic. &quot;Whereas traditional yacht designs adhere to a strict horizontal order,&quot; trumpeted the press release from boat-builder Blohm+Voss, &quot;Hadid has created an intense connectivity between the various decks and elements of the design.&quot; Or maybe someone sneezed all over the model before it was sent to the printers. Can&apos;t afford the superyacht? Fear not, the mothership comes with a &quot;family&quot; of five 90-metre baby yachts, for the aspiring tycoon. Norman Foster     A midget by comparison ... Norman Foster's Ocean Emerald superyacht     A midget by comparison, Norman Foster&apos;s 40-metre Ocean Emerald was unveiled in 2009 as part of the YachtPlus fractional ownership programme \u2013 for those who dream of the Abramovich lifestyle but can only stump up \u20ac1.87m for the chance to spend 30 nights a year aboard the vessel. Like a leaping dolphin caught mid-flight, the ship&apos;s flanks arch upwards from bow to aft in a continuous curve, housing five spacious suites in its bowels. But if this is a dolphin, it is one that has had blacked-out windows and vents punched clumsily through its sides, giving it more the look of the backside of a data storage shed than a marine mammal.     'More Premier Inn than Ritz?' ... inside Norman Foster's yacht    Inside, it is a Foster gesamtkunstwerk \u2013 you can dine using Foster-designed cutlery and crockery while reclining on Foster-designed fabrics and being waited on by staff in Foster-designed uniforms. All that&apos;s missing is Norm himself. The interiors are muted beige affairs with a proliferation of white leather \u2013 although it is evidently a bit more Premier Inn than Ritz: &quot;Light wood effect deckheads, faux leather and marble veneer give the impression of luxury,&quot; say the manufacturers. If I&apos;m paying \u20ac24m, I expect the real thing thanks. Renzo Piano     More like it ... Renzo Piano's Kirribilli MAS60 yacht    This is more like it. A boat by a man who knows about boats \u2013 based in the port of Genoa, the Italian architect even builds them himself. The smallest of all the superyachts at 18 metres, the Kirribilli is more convincing than many of Piano&apos;s buildings, which often fall the wrong side of naff when they try too hard to be like boats. &quot;Nautical details are good details,&quot; Piano told me when we met last year in his Astrup Fearnley Museum in Oslo, designed like a great sail crashing into the harbour, strapped down with endless amounts of rigging. &quot;They have to be good, because they must survive the sea.&quot; They just don&apos;t make much sense bolted on to the facade of an art gallery. In the Kirribilli, all is forgiven. Modelled on the J Class, which competed in the America&apos;s Cup in the 1930s, it is designed around the functional requirements of going fast in water \u2013 as you might expect a yacht to be. While other architects opt for embellishment, Piano&apos;s form is stripped back, leaving smooth, seamless surfaces, with a flush deck and simple interior, designed to allow a view of the structure from aft to fore. John Pawson     'An ode to whiteness' ... John Pawson's B60 Sloop. Photograph: Jens Weber/John Pawson architects    Piano&apos;s yacht may be stripped back, but no one can out-minimal the self-styled king of minimalism himself. John Pawson&apos;s yacht designed with naval architect Luca Brenta, is an ode to whiteness. Its simple white sails hang above a white carbon-fibre hull, enclosing a shrine to wipe-clean whiteness within. Pawson&apos;s role was mainly confined to the interior, where his trademark handleless cupboards and drawers provide the now ubiquitous modern kitchen game of find-the-door and its accompanying parlour trick of do-I-push-pull-or-slide-it? A pair of plain day beds line either side of the galley living room, offering a dose of monastic asceticism for the over-indulged oligarch, looking for the simple life at sea. There are no doubt plentiful pleasure caves hidden behind the white walls and wooden floors, furnished with gilded jacuzzis and Pawson-designed waiting staff \u2013 but you&apos;ll be lucky if you can ever find them.", "title": "Battle of the superyachts: architects go overboard", "sentences": ["Some have interpreted it too literally: from Dubai&apos;s Burj Al Arab hotel to Portsmouth&apos;s bizarre Spinnaker Tower, there are entire buildings designed like sails, looking ready to make a break for the high seas."], "publicationDate": "2013-10-29T14:27:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/29/cameron-britain-infrastructure-foreign-ownership", "tags": ["David Cameron", "Politics", "Business", "UK news", "Energy industry", "Islamic finance", "Economic policy", "Economics"], "article": "Britain should not be afraid of selling off more of its major national infrastructure to foreign owners, David Cameron has said. The prime minister dismissed concerns about letting overseas governments own big buildings, energy projects and football clubs as he spoke at an Islamic investment conference in London. He made the case for foreign ownership a week after the government said it was happy for a stake in new nuclear power stations to be sold to a Chinese state firm. Speaking to 1,800 delegates, he said opening up the market to overseas investors helps create wealth and promised the UK would not &quot;pull up the drawbridge&quot; like other countries. &quot;I know some people look at foreign companies investing in our businesses, financing our infrastructure or taking over our football clubs and ask \u2013 shouldn&apos;t we do something to stop it?&quot; he said. &quot;Well, let me tell you, the answer is &apos;no&apos;. One of Britain&apos;s unique selling points is its openness and this openness is a vital part of how we ensure our country is a great success story in the global race. &quot;Foreign investment creates wealth, jobs and growth.

During the conference, Cameron also pledged to make London one of the world&apos;s &quot;great capitals of Islamic finance&quot; by unveiling a Treasury plan to create a \u00a3200m Islamic bond by early next year. The Sukuk bond will comply with Islamic law and investment principles that prohibit lenders from charging interest. In a speech to the first meeting of the World Islamic Economic Forum to be held outside a Muslim country, he also revealed plans by the London Stock Exchange to launch the first Islamic market index. Speaking at the conference, he said: &quot;I don&apos;t just want London to be a great capital of Islamic finance in the western world; I want London to stand alongside Dubai as one of the great capitals of Islamic finance anywhere in the world. There are some countries which naturally look inwards, pull up the drawbridge and refuse to recognise that the way the world is changing affects their future success.

You&apos;re coming over to London to DJ at a festival. Does it feel strange to take up DJing at 67? I love it. I love it! When I was first asked to DJ, I\u00a0think four years ago, I thought: &quot;No way, no way \u2013 I&apos;m a composer.&quot; But when I first started out, I was a DJ. I\u00a0was a composer and a singer and would go out at weekends with my tape and sing and then play some records. I had a contract with a disco dance organisation and would make 400 or 500 marks for the weekend. Then 18 months ago, a friend who works at Louis Vuitton asked me to do about 15 minutes DJing on a catwalk show for the men&apos;s winter fashions, and I liked it. Then Elton John&apos;s Aids Foundation asked me to DJ in Cannes for a benefit and I liked that too. Then Red Bull asked me to play in New York. It had a discotheque, but it was too small, so it moved it to a bigger one, and I had about 1,200 people. it went from there. I played in Japan: I think there were about 10,000 people there. Then I went to Mexico City and, according to\u00a0the promoter, there were 40,000, although I think it was less. I\u00a0play mostly my own songs. I\u00a0just finished a new track with Donna Summer [who died last year], which she recorded about three years ago, just a little demo, but I&apos;ve cut it up and added some new chords and stuff. Then I have two new instrumentals as well. You started out playing bass and guitar and making schlager, German bubblegum pop. What drew you to the\u00a0synthesiser? I did one or two bubblegum songs (1), which I\u00a0loved by the way. But I heard the album of Walter Carlos called Switched on Bach, and was intrigued that it was all done with a computer, with a synthesiser, so I researched and found an acquaintance, a classical composer, who had one of the modular Moogs, the big ones. I think it was the second Moog out. He had a great engineer, who knew how to connect the cable, so that was my intro into the synthesiser world. I think Son of My Father (2) was the first pop song with a synthesiser. You also made an experimental synthesiser album, Einzelganger. I think it was in &apos;75. I&apos;d completely forgotten about it, but I listened to it a year ago, and thought: &quot;Wow, this is not too bad, I had some interesting sounds.&quot; I guess I wanted to do something new. I liked all those guys: Klaus Schulze, Kraftwerk, Tangerine Dream, Jean Michel Jarre. It wasn&apos;t a commercial success, but I guess it got me a lot of experience working with a synthesiser and some effects.            Reading this on mobile? Click here to view. And then you met Donna Summer \u2026 In Munich. She was not famous, but she was part of the musical Hair, which they performed in Germany. She spoke German quite well. Pete Bellotte, my co-producer, and I needed some backup singers with real English, no accent, and so we found her and the two other girls, I forgot who they were, and we were really impressed by Donna. We said, if we have a song that she can do, we will call her, so we had the idea of doing a song called The Hostage (3), and that&apos;s how it started. Summer claimed that her entire 1977 double album Once Upon a Time was recorded in one three-day session, without sleep, and that she was hospitalised with exhaustion afterwards. Is that true? No! [thinks] Maybe she sang it in three days. But it took us about two weeks. That&apos;s to compose, write the lyrics, record and mix, which compared to today is pretty fast. You survived the disco backlash remarkably well. Well, I was lucky to have that song, I\u00a0Feel Love. Alan Parker, the director of Midnight Express, loved it. There&apos;s a thing in Midnight Express where the kid is running away from the police, and Parker just said: &quot;Giorgio, give me a song in the style of I Feel Love, like with the bassline and things, and make it work for that scene. The rest, you use the synthesiser, just do whatever you want.&quot; That was scary, because I had never done soundtracks before, but it went well and I got my first Oscar, (4) and that opened up a new life in the film business. There&apos;s a story that you attempted to collaborate with Bob Dylan, which seems a bit unlikely. That&apos;s right. It was actually Sylvester Stallone who asked me to ask him to sing a song for a Rambo movie. So I composed a song. I wanted him to write the lyrics, of course. I went to see him in Malibu, where he had a beautiful house. He listened to it about four times. I&apos;m not sure if he didn&apos;t like the music that much, or if he wasn&apos;t interested because of the nature of the movie, which was totally anti-Russian, anti-communist. I think he didn&apos;t feel like being involved with a movie such as Rambo. It was nice to meet him, and it could have worked, but it didn&apos;t work out. Why did you wind down your musical career in the late 80s? I wanted to get into art. I did some neon stuff. I worked in, not computer-generated, but computer manipulation of pictures. Oh God, I did so many things. I did a car. I\u00a0was involved with a sports car called Cizeta-Moroder, which was the first 16-cylinder car, beautiful. I think we sold about eight cars, and then in 92 the economic crash came and we had to close the shop. (5) Then I started to play golf and, you know, having a nice life, half-retired. I worked for a year on a short movie where I used only pictures, only photos, for which I won an award at the Festival in Palm Springs. I designed a bottle of cognac. So I did a lot of things, except music. You also designed a pyramid. Yeah. In Dubai. I worked with two famous architects and we came up with the idea of a residence that was a very high pyramid, hollow inside, and probably a little bit too high for the time. There was a lot of interest, but then the Sultan of Dubai decided to do the Burj al Arab hotel (6) instead, so I guess his attention went to that project. You&apos;ve said your appearance on the Daft Punk album Random Access Memories put you &quot;back in business&quot;. Suddenly a lot of people want to work with me. I&apos;ve done a song with Avicii. I&apos;ve worked with David Guetta. I just spoke to Nile Rodgers, who is reviving Chic, so I&apos;m going to collaborate with him on one song, and hopefully we will talk about him playing on one of mine. I&apos;m producing kind of an underground group from New York called Class Actress. I&apos;m starting on that when I get back from London. So, I have a lot of stuff going on right now.

The World Service documentary gained extraordinary access to members of\u00a0the world&apos;s most prolific network of jewellery thieves, responsible for more than 340 armed robberies across the world worth more than $330m in loot. Havana Marking meets safe cracker Mike in a beach bar on the coast of Montenegro; he&apos;s wearing a pink polo shirt. &quot;I don&apos;t have a badge that says &apos;Pink Panther&apos;,&quot; he laughs. But his stories are Marking&apos;s key to unlocking the secrets of a gang that rose from the chaos of wartime Yugoslavia to conducting headline-grabbing heists in Dubai, London, Tokyo, Paris and beyond. Through him, she meets Lela, now retired but once employed to scout out targeted shops, while playing at &quot;being Madonna&quot; with her own driver, designer wardrobe and hair stylist to seem credible. &quot;I was extremely good-looking at the time, I\u00a0had to look very powerful,&quot; she says, as the two explain how they lured a Spanish shop owner to fall in love with her, so the gang could bash through his wall into the jeweller&apos;s next door. &quot;I didn&apos;t go to seduce him, but my very appearance contributed to his joy.&quot; Said shop owner gave Lela a job, despite the fact that she spoke no Spanish. Weeks of planning later, the gang made off with a safe filled with jewellery, money &quot;and a fake penis \u2026 a dildo? I bet they didn&apos;t declare that to the police.&quot; With all the high-octane thrills this documentary delivers, it&apos;s easy to forget that Marking is dealing with serious, hardened criminals \u2013 such as Green, the murderous Bosnian Serb paramilitary turned diamond dealer \u2013 and only touching on the work of detectives such as Jan Glassey, in Geneva. The Swiss intelligence officer had made it his life&apos;s mission to catch the thieves and Marking notes the stuffed pink panther toy hanging in\u00a0a\u00a0noose in the corner of his office. It\u00a0was, he says, a joke present from his colleagues. One that probably serves as a reminder of how close he has come to completing the job: since 2007, 189 panthers have been arrested and jailed. Meanwhile, Mike admits the glamour and the protection once afforded to the criminals in the Balkans is slipping.

Andrew Edis QC told the Old Bailey jury that the clandestine relationship had come to light when police found a computer in a cupboard at Brooks&apos;s London flat on the day of her arrest in July 2011, containing a letter, written by Brooks to Coulson in February 2004, indicating that they had been having an affair for at least six years. The letter, said Edis, was &quot;elegant, intelligent and well-written&quot; and evidently composed in reply to an attempt by Coulson to end the relationship by introducing new rules to limit their contact, something which had caused her &quot;a great deal of grief&quot;. Brooks and Coulson sat side by side in the dock, staring without expression into the well of the court as Edis read the jury a section of the letter in which Brooks wrote: &quot;The fact is that you are my very best friend. I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you. We laugh and cry together\u00a0\u2026 In fact, without our relationship in my life, I am really not sure how I will cope. &quot;I&apos;m frightened to be without you but, bearing in mind &apos;the rules&apos;, you will not know how I am doing, and visa versa [sic] \u2026 Obviously I can&apos;t discuss my worries, concerns, problems at work with you any more.&quot;     Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson attend the 2007 launch of Piers Morgan's book Don't you know who I am? in London. Photograph: Richard Young/Rex Features    Edis said that the jury needed to know about the clandestine relationship because the two former editors face charges of conspiracy to hack phones. &quot;The first question, therefore, is how well did they know each other? How much did they trust each other? The fact that they were in this relationship, which was a secret, means that they trusted each other quite a lot with at least that secret. That&apos;s why we are telling you about it,&quot; the prosecuting QC said. At that time, Coulson had been married to his wife Eloise Patrick since 2000, and Brooks had been married to the TV actor Ross Kemp since 2002. Brooks was editor of the Sun, and Coulson was editor of the News of the World; previously Coulson had been her deputy at the News of the World, when she edited the Sunday tabloid between 2000 and 2003. The affair between the two former editors was disclosed on the day that the court heard detailed allegations that Brooks and Coulson had used illegally hacked voicemail messages to expose the extra-marital affairs of Labour ministers John Prescott and David Blunkett and of the trade union leader Andy Gilchrist. The jury was shown a leader column published by the Sun under Brooks&apos;s editorship which described Gilchrist as &quot;a lying, cheating, low-life fornicator&quot;. The whole day&apos;s proceedings focused on just one of the seven counts on the indictment which alleges that Brooks, Coulson, Stuart Kuttner, the newspaper&apos;s former managing editor, and Ian Edmondson, the former news editor, conspired to intercept voicemail messages. All four deny the charges. The prosecution had disclosed the affair in the context of the hacking of the phone of Milly Dowler, the 13-year-old Surrey schoolgirl who went missing on 21 March 2002. The jury was told on Wednesday that the News of the World&apos;s specialist hacker, Glenn Mulcaire, has pleaded guilty to intercepting her voicemail.     Glenn Mulcaire. Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images    Edis argued that, although Rebekah Brooks had been on holiday in Dubai during the key week of the Dowler story in April 2002, the nature of her relationship with her deputy, Coulson, was among a number of factors which made it &quot;simply incredible&quot; that she had not been aware of the hacking of Milly&apos;s phone. He said notes kept by Mulcaire showed that he had been tasked to target Milly on 10 April by the former news editor Neville Thurlbeck, who has pleaded guilty to conspiracy to hack phones. Mulcaire had found a message from a recruitment agency, which appeared to invite the missing girl to go for a job interview at a factory in Telford, West Midlands. In fact, the jury heard, the message had been intended for somebody else with a similar name and similar phone number. Believing they might find Milly alive before the police, the News of the World on 12 April had sent a team of reporters and photographers to the factory. When the visit yielded no sign of the missing girl, Edis said, Thurlbeck and the managing editor, Stuart Kuttner, had both attempted to persuade Surrey police to co-operate on a story and had told police explicitly that they were in possession of voicemail. The News of the World then published a story on 14 April that quoted verbatim the message from the recruitment agency, though that had been removed from later editions. One of the reporters who was sent to the Telford factory had claimed his expenses for petrol under the heading &quot;Milly Dowler answer phone messages&quot;.     Milly Dowler: it is now considered unlikely that Glenn Mulcaire had been responsible for deleting the missing girl\u2019s voicemail messages. Photograph: Surrey Police/PA    &quot;This phone hacking does not seem to have been much of a secret,&quot; Edis told the jury. &quot;Was it only the editor who didn&apos;t know it had happened?&quot; He said that from Dubai, Brooks had stayed in regular contact by text and phone with Coulson. &quot;It is highly likely that if they were talking about work, they were exchanging confidences and discussing difficulties. The point of that letter is that what Mr Coulson, who was on deck as editor that week, knew, Mrs Brooks knew too.&quot; The jury were also played a tape-recording made by David Blunkett in August 2004 when, as home secretary, he was visited in his office by Coulson who tried to persuade him to confirm that he had been having an affair with a married woman, Kimberly Quinn. Coulson argued that the fact that she was married meant that any newspaper would want to publish the story. Coulson told Blunkett: &quot;I&apos;m extremely confident about the information.&quot; He refused to say how he knew. Edis said Mulcaire&apos;s notes and audiotapes that had been found in a News International safe showed Coulson&apos;s source in fact was the hacking of messages left by Blunkett.

Photograph: Martin Argles for the Guardian    The jury heard that in their efforts to expose Prescott&apos;s extra-marital affair, the News of the World had offered Lord Prescott&apos;s lover Tracey Temple \u00a3100,000 for her story, hacked the phone of Prescott&apos;s special adviser Joan Hammell, and also hacked the phones of two rival journalists, Dennis Rice and Sebastian Hamilton from the Mail on Sunday, in an attempt to steal their story.

A largely procedural event, the conference aim was to update a global telecoms treaty last negotiated in 1988. But from the outset, the event was marked by intensive political and commercial lobbying, particularly on behalf of the US. Ambassador David Gross, a lawyer and government co-ordinator for communications policy, led a well-funded and powerful campaign in the months leading up to the conference. Google, Microsoft, Cisco, Comcast and AT&amp;T were all on board, and the US press ran on-message examinations exploiting anti-UN feeling, concerns about Chinese or Russian control of the internet and warnings that certain proposed revisions were for the benefit of dinosaur telecoms firms. After two weeks of complex negotiations, the treaty failed. The US saw the failure as a victory, claiming that the internet has never needed UN regulation and that the treaty was not consistent, in the words of US delegation head Terry Kramer, &quot;with the multistakeholder model of internet governance&quot;. The US was joined by the UK and others, including most of Europe, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Japan, India and Kenya. The US claimed that the treaty attempted to extend its telecoms remit to &quot;grab control of the internet&quot;, which one critic said would see the internet develop conflicting standards and competing jurisdictions on a par with the European train system. Countries which unsuccessfully supported the revised International Telecommunications Regulations claimed the opposite; that the treaty enables standardisation, as it has done historically with dialling codes and consistent phone keyboards. They argued that the lobbying was more about protecting a western-dominated, US-centric internet administration. In the wake of the revelations over the extent of international surveillance conducted by America&apos;s National Security Agency, the aggressive US strategy around internet governance seems to have had a different agenda. Richard Hill was one of the key players at the UN&apos;s International Telecommunication Union and co-ordinated the ITR conference, but has since retired. He told the Guardian that at the time, he had thought US pressure was based on defending its commercial interests. &quot;Many countries are not comfortable with what they perceive as the dominant role of the US,&quot; he said. &quot;In Dubai, many people were wondering why the US was making so much fuss about such treaty provisions that were in fact inoffensive from a legal point of view. Why were they expending so much political capital for so little? At the time, many thought it was a question of principle. After the revelations concerning the NSA surveillance, it seems reasonable to infer that the US did not wish to agree to anything that might limit its surveillance programmes \u2013 and having to co-operate with other countries might have such an effect.&quot; Hill said some countries appeared to support key changes to the treaty, but then rejected them at the crucial final stage. Now with the Snowden revelations public, many countries are questioning the agenda of the US and argue that, because of its aggressive lobbying at the Dubai conference, the fallout has been exacerbated, says Hill. Leading the charge against the US is Brazil, which voted for the revised treaty in Dubai. President Dilma Rousseff has accused the US of breaching international law, and announced plans for a national secure email service, an alternative internet infrastructure that will mean data cables are not routed through US soil, and updates to the marco civil legislative bill to tighten domestic cybersecurity. Rousseff also this month met with Fadi Chehad\u00e9 \u2013 a man the US had &quot;vetted&quot; to run Icann, the organisation which oversees internet addresses \u2013 and came out of the meeting having agreed to host a summit on internet governance in Rio in April 2014. &quot;The trust in the global internet has been punctured,&quot; Chehad\u00e9 said after the meeting. &quot;Now it&apos;s time to restore this trust through leadership and institutions that can make that happen.&quot; The accusation of internet imperialism is something the US fiercely defends, but it has its roots in the creation of the internet, and before it Arpanet, which was established between four US universities in 1969. The ethical and administrative bodies that oversee the internet are diverse and almost deliberately complicated, and present a forest of acronymed organisations including technical standards (IAB, IETF and W3C) and regional domains (AFRINIC, LACNIC and APNIC). Icann is symbolically important and retains a link to the US government. The two have an &quot;affirmation of commitment&quot;, but the US government&apos;s National Telecommunications and Information Administration has granted Icann the key Iana contract since 1999. This contract involves managing the database that connects domain names, such as .com, .org and .co.uk, to their numeric address. There are only 13 authoritative root servers globally, but one principal at the centre which is then mirrored. This central root server is administered by Verisign, and is held at its base in Dulles, Virginia \u2013 one of the most symbolically important computers in the world. Companies outside the US were not allowed to compete for the Iana contract, and having this central component controlled by the US government \u2013 with changes to top level domains passing through the US department of commerce \u2013 has long been been a point of contention. The Iana contract is likely to be high on the agenda at the Rio internet governance summit next April. The outcome of this heated response to the Snowden revelations is unpredictable, says Hill. The average internet user will see little difference. But it is conceivable that Icann will further look to distance itself from the US, and could assert that a new server outside the US should become the authoritative root server. If the US resists, and two competing servers begin to compile increasingly different records of internet addresses, it could signify a true split in the global internet network. In the worst case scenario, some websites could become inaccessible to people in other parts of the world. In reality, there are far too many commercial interests for that to happen. There is increasing pressure on the US government by its own technology companies to be more transparent about its surveillance and move to heal the rift in consumer confidence of companies such as Google and Facebook. Brazil is likely to push for plans to remodel Icann, which would include a more global, legal framework. Milton Mueller, an internet policy professor, helped to draft proposals for Icann transition in 2009, and though the model still stands, the ground has shifted for the US government. &quot;There is no indication that official US policy toward hanging on to the Iana contract has changed,&quot; he said. &quot;However, when the so-called multistakeholder internet organisations that the US purports to defend all unambiguously call for an end to that, the US position is de-legitimised.&quot;", "title": "NSA furore has roots in US internet imperialism", "sentences": ["In November 2012, more than 2,000 civil servants and IT specialists from across the world gathered in Dubai for the World Conference on International Telecommunications.", "&quot;In Dubai, many people were wondering why the US was making so much fuss about such treaty provisions that were in fact inoffensive from a legal point of view.", "Now with the Snowden revelations public, many countries are questioning the agenda of the US and argue that, because of its aggressive lobbying at the Dubai conference, the fallout has been exacerbated, says Hill.", "Leading the charge against the US is Brazil, which voted for the revised treaty in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-01T17:09:27Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/01/breeders-cup-mile-wise-dan-win-again", "tags": ["Breeders' Cup", "US sports", "Sport", "Horse racing"], "article": "Wise Dan is something of a dichotomy.\u00a0There\u2019s the Wise Dan who arrived back at his barn, veins pulsing, muscles flexed, after his first white-knuckled spin on the Santa Anita turf course this year. This is the same Wise Dan who prompted Damien Rock, his crimson-faced, decidedly enervated looking exercise rider to exclaim upon their return that he could barely pull him up. \u201cThank god that\u2019s over,\u201d Rock added, with the same relieved look reserved for involuntary adrenaline junkies. Then there\u2019s the Wise Dan who takes his afternoon stroll with the minimum of fuss, nibbles quietly at the grass and stands patiently to attention while a parade of photographers click away. This is the same Wise Dan who, in the words of his groom, Reeve McGaughey, loves children, dogs and strangers \u2013 and not necessarily in that order. Both Wise Dans have turned up at Santa Anita this year, and Charlie LoPresti, Wise Dan\u2019s trainer, is delighted. \u201cI thought that after the long trip here [to Santa Anita, from Kentucky], I was afraid that he\u2019d be knocked out, but he isn\u2019t. Not a bit. He wasn\u2019t as bright as this last year, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d That Wise Dan, Horse of the Year and the firm favorite for Saturday\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup Mile, is perkier than last year is bad news for his competitors. It\u2019s hard to envisage him winning the race any more emphatically than he did one year ago. But LoPresti\u2019s observations regarding Wise Dan\u2019s rude health hold some weight. On his first full day at the track, out for his morning stroll, Wise Dan was more intent upon demonstrating to the world press his wellbeing than he was preserving any pep after what should have been a tiring cross-country trip. \u201cThere was this photographer trying to take pictures of [Wise Dan] while he was bucking and kicking around the tow ring,\u201d said LoPresti this week as he watched a perfectly composed, waxed gleaming Wise Dan stand for photographs beneath a polished blue Sistine ceiling of a California sky. \u201cI said to this guy \u2018cos he was standing real close, \u2018don\u2019t stand there if you want to keep a hold of that camera.\u2019 He had a death wish.\u201d Then there was Thursday&apos;s workout.\u00a0In the optimistic words of LoPresti beforehand, it was a chance for Wise Dan to \u201chave a nice gallop on the turf.\u201d In the tired words of his exercise rider, Rock, after the workout: \u201cI pulled up cotton-mouthed. My forearms were burning. When I set off, he was pretty tough for a quarter of a mile, then he relaxed down the straight. But when he saw the pony again when I was trying to pull up, he took off again. He was just gunning for that pony.\u201d Strong? Yes. Enthusiastic? Absolutely. But Wise Dan has mellowed over the years. As a six-year-old, Wise Dan is now \u201cpretty straightforward\u201d to train, according to LoPresti. Rewind the clock four years and \u201cstraightforward\u201d would only have been used to describe Wise Dan if preceded by the words, \u201canything but.\u201d Admits LoPresti:  \u00a0\u201cHe was difficult to begin with. We had all sorts of trouble with him. He had me tearing my hair out.\u201d      Wise Dan during workouts at Santa Anita Park, Thursday, October 31, 2013, in preparation for this weekend's Breeders' Cup horse races. Photograph: Mark J. Terrill/AP    Wise Dan was headstrong, bullish. So much so, Morton Fink, Wise Dan\u2019s owner, told LoPresti to drop him into a $30,000 claimer after his racecourse debut when he ran with the choke out and finished a dismal fifth. LoPresti dissuaded Fink from doing so, and Wise Dan quickly racked up a number of wins, including a victory in the Grade III Phoenix Stakes at Keeneland as a three-year-old. Nevertheless, his behavior in the mornings had failed to improve \u2013 was desolving, if anything. \u201cWe were still having real problems with him. He would run off, run to the outside rail training. They were getting scared of him \u2013 no one was brave enough to give him the long rein that he needed to settle.\u201d This is where Rock steps in to the picture. \u201cI\u2019ve been working for Charlie for about two years. When I first got on [Wise Dan], he\u2019d come back after a winter off,\u201d said Rock. \u201cHe was difficult. I mean, I would take a hold of him and he\u2019d head to the outside of the track sideways. He\u2019s just one tough horse, that\u2019s why I two-minute lick every day.\u201d Rock, 32, from Dublin, Ireland, is lithe, lean, fit \u2013 what you\u2019d expect from someone who treats triathlons and marathons like the rest if us do a stroll to the shops. He was an apprentice in Ireland where he rode in well over 100 races, winning six, before he headed first to Dubai and then to the States 11 years ago. Rock credits his extracurricular athletic activities as affording him the core strength to handle a race-fit Wise Dan: \u201cIt can\u2019t hurt, that\u2019s for sure. You need to be fit to ride this guy.\u201d Since Rock has been exercising Wise Dan in the mornings, LoPresti has seen a vast improvement in his stable star, due in no small part to Rock\u2019s quiet, relaxed approach in the saddle. Nevertheless, some days are more difficult than others \u2013 especially when the meddling gods decide to intervene. \u201cIt was the most stressful gallop I\u2019ve had in my life,\u201d said Rock, of one morning earlier this year. \u201cThe stirrup came off when I was galloping him. I balanced on one leg for a little while but then I had to throw out the other leg and just sat down on his back. That\u2019s when he took off. He must have gone for about half a mile flat out, but then he realized that something was wrong and he pulled himself up. He\u2019s actually a really smart horse\u2026I couldn\u2019t walk right for a week after that.\u201d Someone else who thinks that Wise Dan is one smart customer is McGaughey, nephew to LoPresti and son of this year\u2019s Kentucky Derby winning trainer, Shug. McGaughey, 24, has been with LoPresti for two and a half years\u2014his is an everyman role, where he does everything around the barn but ride\u2014and he joins Wise Dan on his travels when his usual groom is unable to. \u201cHe\u2019s pretty laid back, no problem at all really,\u201d said McGaughey, as taciturn as his boss, LoPresti, is loquacious. \u201cHe\u2019s easy to do anything with, around the barn at least. The only thing he might do is try to bite, but he doesn\u2019t mean it - not really.\u201d            By now, each member of team Wise Dan understands their role as seamlessly as any special operations force. Even Wise Dan\u2019s security guards seem serendipitously chosen for the task. Every horse competing in the Breeders\u2019 Cup championships is assigned a 24-hour watch until the race, and one of the guards assigned to Wise Dan has made a living watching over superstars. \u201cI\u2019ll soon be working the red carpet at the Oscars,\u201d said Giovanni Jimeno, from Glendora, a stone\u2019s throw from Santa Anita. \u201cSo the horse is in good hands. I\u2019m not just any kind of security guard - I\u2019m used to dealing with celebrities. Last year, I worked back stage at the Oscars. I saw everybody, saw everything. [The Breeders\u2019 Cup] is much more laid back, though.\u201d Racing folk are nothing if not a superstitious bunch, and this year, the Wise Dan team are doing everything they can to replicate last year\u2019s winning formula. He\u2019s stabled in the same hotel as last year: stall 24 of barn 36. He\u2019s keeping the same training regime. \u201cThe only thing we\u2019re doing differently is arrive a day early,\u201d said LoPresti. The reason he arrived a day later last year was because Hurricane Sandy scuppered travel plans. But ill winds blow with a little less frequency on this side of the continent, and the skies this year over Santa Anita are as pristine as ever - Rock stood with Wise Dan, scrubbed and ready after exercise, for a pick of grass as he dries off under a balmy sun. \u201cHe\u2019s just great,\u201d said Rock, his breath caught once again, smiling. Wise Dan appeared equally as content: as chilled as any holidaymaker, coat glimmering as though dusted with flaked gold. It\u2019s hard to believe that he\u2019s the same horse who was tearing up the turf less than an hour before. \u201cI\u2019m very relieved,\u201d said Rock, who added with ominous overtures for his competitors: \u201cI don\u2019t think he could be any better.\u201d", "title": "Wise Dan aiming to win Breeders' Cup Mile again", "sentences": ["He was an apprentice in Ireland where he rode in well over 100 races, winning six, before he headed first to Dubai and then to the States 11 years ago."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-01T17:51:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/01/somalia-first-florist-romance-mogadishu", "tags": ["Somalia", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa", "World news"], "article": "If there were any place in the world where it could be said romance is dead, Mogadishu might be it. But after more than 20 years of war, including hardline Islamist rule, flowers are blooming again amid the ruins of the hot and dusty Somali capital. Mohamed Mohamoud Sheik has just opened the country&apos;s first florist, allowing young couples to rekindle the courtship rituals of their parents. &quot;The new generation are starting to celebrate Valentine&apos;s Day,&quot; said the 25-year-old, standing among tulips, lilies and a box of pale blue and white roses arranged to represent the Somali national flag. &quot;I think next year Valentine&apos;s Day will be amazing. I can&apos;t wait to see that day.&quot; For centuries of nomadic existence, so Sheik has heard in folklore, Somali men would temporarily abandon their camels to woo with poetry, while women would step away from their sheep and goats to be wooed. But two decades of anarchy, warlord dominance and a Taliban-style ban on music, TV and artistic depictions of the human form did not invite romantic gestures. With the Islamist militia al-Shabaab now banished, however, Mogadishu is enjoying a revival, albeit as delicate as any blooms. The past year has brought a sprinkling of coffee shops, pizza parlours and beachside restaurants. Sheik, born to Somali parents in Italy and raised in Tanzania, is among numerous expat entrepreneurs flocking back for business opportunities that can also restore a sense of normality. &quot;Maybe 20 years of war has changed us a bit and made us aggressive,&quot; he said,&quot;but our mums and dads were romantic: they had poetry. If I bring back romance to Mogadishu, I will have something to remember. I will say, thank God, I did something good. This is the first time Somalis will ever have window plants. I had the first orchid in Mogadishu and gave it to a friend as a birthday gift.&quot; Facing challenges that Interflora could not imagine, Sheik cannot yet cater for impulsive lovers. &quot;I&apos;ve had a couple of people coming and saying, &apos;I want to take flowers to my girlfriend.&apos; I have to say, &apos;give me a week&apos;s notice because shipping from Nairobi takes five to six days.&apos;&quot; This is still preferable, he believes, to the abundance of plastic flowers that dominate hotels and government offices including that of the president. &quot;I don&apos;t like it. Why can&apos;t we have fresh flowers from Kenya or Ethiopia? It&apos;s something we&apos;re taking a risk on because I want people to have that environment at wedding and other events.&quot; Sheik&apos;s market research found that Somalis will only opt for fresh flowers if they last, so he flew to Nairobi to find chemicals that can preserve them for six months. He is monitoring the effects in a fledgling nursery that has natural humidity. This is just part of his ambitions for Amber Gardens and Florists, which opened in June. Sheik also wants to heal the deep physical scars of Mogadishu, a city of smashed buildings, rivers of rubbish and sprawling squatter camps. He plans to beautify it with trees, green spaces and children&apos;s playgrounds.     Mohamed Mohamoud Sheik is importing jacaranda trees after falling in love with them in Tanzania. Photograph: Graeme Robertson for the Guardian    &quot;Greenery and palm trees are missing in Mogadishu. Before the war it was a beautiful city. Our parents&apos; generation planted trees and there were green spaces. Now people cut down the trees and the city is dry and hot. &quot;I want to change the environment: we&apos;re close to the sea and with trees we could have the best weather.&quot; Sheik fell in love with jacaranda trees, with their fleeting lavender blossom, when in Tanzania, and has brought some to Mogadishu, with plans for more by the end of the year. He has also imported different types of grass from Tanzania and the UK. The florist and landscaping business comes a year after Sheik opened Somalia&apos;s first laundry and dry cleaner&apos;s since the state&apos;s implosion in 1991. The idea came to him after hearing a man ask his father to take six suits to Nairobi for cleaning. &quot;My dad said, most men in Mogadishu have suits but they only wear them once a year because there is no dry cleaner here.&quot; Sheik quit his job as an air operations assistant in Dubai to set up Somalia Premium Laundry and Dry Cleaning.He imported chemicals and detergents from Dubai, hired a dry cleaner from Nairobi to train his staff and bought a $35,000 (\u00a322,000) Chinese-made machine that broke during shipping. He had an Italian-made replacement flown in. The service, which typically charges a suit, attracts about 300 customers a month, including government officials, embassy staff and students. As Somalis return from the diaspora and fashions become more liberal, women are increasingly among the clientele. A percentage of the profits goes to charity, for example through a donation of T-shirts and slippers to a camp for internally displaced persons. &quot;My plan is to get the money from the rich people to the kids. I want to set up a place where we can change their lives after 20 years of war. A lad now wants to fight because he missed the childhood of playing that you and I had,&quot; said Sheik. Despite al-Shabaab&apos;s continued ability to strike in Somalia and beyond, Sheik is optimistic about the country&apos;s prospects. &quot;I think we&apos;re living in a very good time. It&apos;s all about us Somalis and what we want. If we want peace and good government, we have to bring it about ourselves. If the Somali people are not willing to step up, no one can do it for them. We have to wake up and say enough now.&quot;", "title": "War-torn Somalia's first florist lets romance blossom again", "sentences": ["&quot;My dad said, most men in Mogadishu have suits but they only wear them once a year because there is no dry cleaner here.&quot; Sheik quit his job as an air operations assistant in Dubai to set up Somalia Premium Laundry and Dry Cleaning.He imported chemicals and detergents from Dubai, hired a dry cleaner from Nairobi to train his staff and bought a $35,000 (\u00a322,000) Chinese-made machine that broke during shipping."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-01T19:02:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/nov/01/breeders-cup-friday-live-santa-anita", "tags": ["Breeders' Cup", "Horse racing", "Horse racing tips", "Sport", "US sports"], "article": "20.12ET There is an Arabian race on the card at Santa Anita now but that pretty much wraps things up for the first day of this year&apos;s meeting. British-trained runners won all three of the races in which Europe had entries, while both Goldencents and Beholder put up very impressive performances in the two main races on the dirt.  And while it has been an enthralling series of races, tomorrow&apos;s card promises to be even better. I hope you&apos;ll rejoin me for the nine-race main card at the 30th Breeders&apos; Cup, which kicks off at 19.05 GMT with the Juvenile Fillies, which is 14.05ET and 11.05 here in sunny California.  This is Greg Wood at Santa Anita, signing off.  19.56ET Paul Bittar, the chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority, has come down to say hello to the British media after a day when British-trained horses won three of the five Cup races. Did he back any of them? He certainly did.   &quot;You&apos;d be disappointed if I hadn&apos;t backed some winners today, wouldn&apos;t you? I&apos;d have some explaining to do.&quot;   19.54ET Two blowouts and one explosion among the principals in the Distaff. Royal Delta and Beholder were both close behind the pace set by Authenticity, but while Royal Delta started to fade a long way from home, Beholder got stronger the further they went and went clear in the straight. Princess Of Sylmar, meanwhile, never got involved.  Gary Stevens, who is now 50 and announced his comeback from seven years in retirement in January this year, became the oldest jockey to win a Triple Crown race when he took the Preakness earlier in the season and is now back in the winners&apos; enclosure at the Breeders&apos; Cup.  19.45.ET Breeders&apos; Cup Distaff result 1. Beholder 2. Close Hatches, 3. Authenticity. No show from Princess Of Sylmar, while Royal Delta faded rapidly approaching the end of the back stretch.  19.42ET Richard Hughes on Chriselliam:   &quot;She&apos;s one of the best fillies I&apos;ve ridden and she proved it today. She had no problem adaptaing to the firm turf and had a nice rhythm going down the backstretch. This is one of the biggest wins of my career.  19.39ET Some very wise old heads involved here too. Mike Smith and Gary Stevens will be looking to grab the lead and dictate the tempo on Royal Delta and Beholder respectively, but must be careful not to set things up for Princess Of Sylmar and Javier Castellano.  19.28ET Just six runners in the Distaff, the feature event on the first day at the Breeders&apos; Cup, but a fascinating race in prospect all the same. Princess Of Sylmar, the Kentucky Oaks winner, is locked in a battle for favouritism with Royal Delta, who won the race last year, and Beholder, who took the Zenyatta Stakes here over a mile and half a furlong last time.  That little bit of extra speed in Beholder&apos;s form may swing it for many of the American punters with the track apparently favouring pace, but Princess Of Sylmar has had an outstanding season and she gets my vote. It&apos;s 12 minutes to post time, by the way, with $2m in the purse.  19.07ET Indeed, Willie Carson is in a very good mood and unleashed his trademark cackle into Nick Luck&apos;s microphone up on the presentation stage. About 20,000 Americans just turned to each other and said: &quot;What in the name of all that&apos;s holy was that?&quot; 19.04ET An irresistible burst of finishing speed by Chriselliam under Richard Hughes, similar to the surge which won her the Fillies&apos; Mile last time out. Willie Carson, former champion jockey and one of Chriselliam&apos;s owners, will be overjoyed - and certainly in a much better mood than he was outside the quarantine barn a couple of days ago, when he did all he could to avoid talking about his filly and suggested that the attention on her was all &quot;hype&quot;.  The winner was about 13-2 on the pari-mutuel. Vorda never really threatened to be involved at the finish, and Al Thakhira faded rapidly from a decent position on the rail.  18.54ET Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf result: 1. Chriselliam, 2. Testa Rossi, 3. Colonel Joan. Charlie Hills joins Charlie Appleby as a winner at the Breeders&apos; Cup with his first runner at the meeting and Europe has taken all three of the races on the card in which we had a runner. 18.50ET Approaching the stalls for the Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile Fillies Turf. Come on Ryan Moore, do a favour for your fellow alumnus of Cardinal Newman School, Hove.  18.43ET A quote from Simon Crisford on Outstrip&apos;s win in the Juvenile Turf earlier on the card.   I think that we&apos;ve had a fantastic year really, because we&apos;re champion owner in England, we were champion owner in Dubai. We were successfulk in the QIPCO Champion Stakes with a very good horse called Farhh who is now retired to stud. We&apos;ve won a Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile race and we&apos;re about to win more races than we&apos;ve ever won before in a calendar year. So it&apos;s been a fantastic year.   And here is a definition of &quot;fantastic&quot; from the Free Online Dictionary. I&apos;m guessing he means number three but I still can&apos;t quite see it, personally.  18.38 ET About 12 minutes to post time for the Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile Fillies&apos; Turf, which could well put the Europeans 3-1 up on the night and thereby &quot;win&quot; the first day of the Cup for the visitors. Vorda and Chrisellium are the Group One winners in the field, but I fancy Al Thakhira, from the Marco Botti yard, might give them something to think about. The local betting suggests that My Conquestadory, who is drawn on the outside in 14, and Clenor (stall 10) may give the Europeans most to do, but even on the local pari-mutuel, Vorda is a solid favourite at 3-1.  18.29ET The Breeders&apos; Cup has an official cupcake collection. Its creator is currently being interviewed about it on the track TV, she says that if she had to bet all of her cupcakes on one horse, it would be Game On Dude in tomorrow&apos;s Classic. The only problem I can see is: how can they pay her out, if she&apos;s got all the cupcakes to start with? 18.22ET Our very own Nick Luck presented the winning trophy to the connections of Goldencents. It&apos;s fair to say that there was a whole lot of whoopin&apos; and hollerin&apos; going on up there on the stage, though not from the silky and unflappable Lucky, obviously.  18.17ET That was an exceptional performance by Goldencents to win the Dirt Mile. Drawn on the outside, he burst from the stalls under Rafael Bejarano to sit just off the lead at the turn, and then made all the running from there at a blistering pace. The first quarter was just over 22 seconds, the second quarter was just as fast and yet Goldencents was still able to last out to the line. Speed is what you need on the Santa Anita dirt today.  18.12 ET Breeders&apos; Cup Dirt Mile result: 1. Goldencents, 2. Golden Ticket, 3. Brujo De Olleros.  18.08ET Mike Smith on his success on Outstrip in the Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile Turf:   The trip was really good. I managed to get covered up, just make my way, and follow the right horses. I was following two of the greatest turf riders here in America, Gary Stevens and Corey Nakatani. They showed me a great way to go, and it really worked out for me.  18.02ET The field is parading for the Dirt Mile, which will get one back for the Americans as Europe does not have a runner. Verrazano, who will retire to Ashford Stud after this race, is the 5-2 favourite and would do his fee no harm at all with a valedictory victory. Goldencents and Pants On Fire are also well fancied. My head says Verrazano but my heart says Pants On Fire because I&apos;d like to hear the track commentator screaming it down the stretch.  17.54ET The first Guineas price update about Outstrip arrived via text from Paddy Power, that firm now 16-1 from 33-1. However, Simon Clare of Coral assures me that the 33-1 under the name of his firm on Oddschecker is not a mistake, and they are still laying Godolphin&apos;s colt at double carpet. Possibly not for long.  17.35ET That&apos;s two out of two for European stables, and two out of two for Mike Smith with late stretch runs. Bobby&apos;s Kitten set a strong pace from the off, but Ryan Moore on Giovanni Bodolini was always tracking him from a good pitch on the inside. He moved up around the final turn and took the leader&apos;s measure halfway down the stretch, but had nothing left to fend off the late charge of Outstrip. The winner paid 6-1 on the local tote.  17.32 ET Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile Turf result: 1. Outstrip, 2. Giovanni Boldini, 3. Bobby&apos;s Kitten. A first Breeders&apos; Cup winner with his first runner for Charlie Appleby, who replaced Mahmood al-Zarooni as the trainer at Godolphin&apos;s Moulton Paddocks in Newmarket after that unfortunate business with all the anabolic steroids back in the spring.  17.24ET Mike Smith on London Bridge: &quot;He had to work really hard. He was never really sure of the dirt. I had to keep riding him at times, taking a hold of him, trying to get him confident, but keep moving all at the same time. I felt if I kept chasing them, he&apos;d lose confidence. So I did a little bit of both and he outlasted them. If it was on grass, it would have been a much better victory.&quot; 17.22ET London Bridge has a new life awaiting him. &quot;This is absolutely fantastic,&quot; Mikael Magnusson, Hughes&apos;s assistant, said after his win in the Marathon. &quot;It&apos;s been our plan all along. We sold the horse prior to this race and he will now go and race in Australia.&quot; 17.16ET Next up here is the Juvenile Turf, where there are excellent prospects of the Europeans going 2-0 up. Bobby&apos;s Kitten is currently 6-5 on the local tote but a lot bigger with the British bookies. Giovanni Boldini and Outstrip are the obvious dangers from Europe, with Wilshire Boulevard and Shamshon also in with a shout.  17.09ET The connections of London Bridge have picked up a first prize of about \u00a3160,000 for their endeavour in sending their horse from Lambourn to Los Angeles. Paul Blockley, who has had a somewhat chequered disciplinary record over the years, is married to the trainer and will probably have had a say in the plans too. Nice work, it has to be said, as a three-way battle down the stretch was too much for Suns Out Guns Out and Blueskiesnrainbows and Mike Smith and London Bridge were able to pick up the pieces.  16.56ET Stirring stuff. London Bridge was being ridden as they went out onto the second circuit, but Jo Hughes&apos;s runner stayed on relentlessly to run down the leaders in the straight. Score one for the Euros. Does make you wonder about the Marathon though, wouldn&apos;t be surprised to see it go the way of the Juvenile Sprint between now and 2014.  16.50ET Breeders&apos; Cup Marathon result: London Bridge wins! From a Class 6 at Brighton to Breeders&apos; Cup success. 16.37ET Ok, the wi-fi is holding up and it&apos;s 8 minutes to post time for the Breeders&apos; Cup Marathon, the ugly duckling of the 14 races. The field is parading in front of the stands before an event of such extreme, unimaginable distance that it leaves almost everyone in the Santa Anita crowd cold. And when you tell them that we run a Classic over a little bit further, they look at you like you&apos;re mad.  16.00ET The 30th Breeders&apos; Cup starts here! When the first, one-day Breeders&apos; Cup meeting was staged in 1984, the organisers might well have been a little surprised to hear that the first race of the 30th edition would be a one-mile, six-furlong contest on dirt with a horse in the field whose first win earlier this year was off a mark of 64 in a Class 6 handicap at Brighton. But then, things rarely turn out quite as you expect them to, a lesson that racing fans above all should appreciate. The Cup celebrates its 30th birthday \u2013 or 29th, for pedants \u2013 in reasonable shape if not quite rude health, now spread over two days and extended to 14 races. It remains the most valuable two-day meeting in the sport, with $5m in the purse for tomorrow&apos;s Classic and at least $1m in the purse for all bar the Marathon, which will kick off proceedings at 16.45ET. From a European perspective, the meeting is much more balanced this year. The Filly &amp; Mare Turf has moved from Friday to Saturday and the three of the most high-profile European runners \u2013 The Fugue, Olympic Glory and Declaration Of War \u2013 are running in three of the last four events on the card. European interest today, meanwhile, centres on the two juvenile turf events, and the Juvenile Fillies&apos; Turf in particular, which includes Vorda and Chrisellium, the winners of the Cheveley Park Stakes and Fillies&apos; Mile respectively. Last year&apos;s renewal of the same event included the subsequent winners of both the 1,000 Guineas and the French equivalent, so it should be a race to study closely. In the Juvenile Turf, meanwhile, Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s two runners \u2013 Giovanni Boldini and Wilshire Boulevard \u2013 are joined by Godolphin&apos;s Outstrip as a three-pronged European challenge to Bobbys Kitten, the best turf juvenile in the US. And then there is the aforementioned Brighton winner, London Bridge, who represents Jo Hughes in the Marathon. There have probably been Breeders&apos; Cup winners with a more unlikely profile, but few that spring immediately to mind. Results, prices and reactions will be posted here as soon as possible after the horses pass the post, with the usual caveats about the Santa Anita wi-fi, possibly the only thing about this beautiful racecourse which leaves me a little cold.

London Bridge, whose first success this year came in a low-grade handicap at Brighton, started the run of British successes in the Marathon, before the high-profile yards of Charlie Appleby and Charlie Hills took the card&apos;s two Grade One turf races for juveniles with Outstrip and Chriselliam. Both are now leading ante-post contenders for the Classics next season. Outstrip&apos;s victory was Appleby&apos;s first at the highest level since taking over from the disgraced former trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni at Godolphin&apos;s Moulton Paddocks stable in Newmarket. Ridden by the veteran American jockey Mike Smith \u2013 who also partnered London Bridge \u2013 he came with a late charge to run down another European-trained runner, Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s Giovanni Boldini, and win by half a length, with the locally-trained favourite Bobby&apos;s Kitten only third. Giovanni Boldini spent much of the race considerably closer to a strong pace set by Bobby&apos;s Kitten than the winner, and Outstrip might be only a marginal favourite to reverse the form if the pair meet again in the 2,000 Guineas next year. Nonetheless, it was a moment for Godolphin to celebrate, and Simon Crisford, the operation&apos;s racing manager, insisted afterwards that it had turned a season which started in scandal into a &quot;fantastic&quot; campaign. &quot;I think that we&apos;ve had a fantastic year, really,&quot; Crisford said, &quot;because we&apos;re champion owner in England, we were a champion owner in Dubai. We were successful in the QIPCO Champion Stakes [with Farhh] who is now retired to stud. We&apos;ve won a Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile Turf race and we&apos;re about to win more races than we&apos;ve ever won before in a calendar year. So it&apos;s been a fantastic year.&quot; Outstrip was only third behind War Command in the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket, but is now top-priced at 20-1 for the 2,000 Guineas at the same track next spring. &quot;We felt he belonged in the race for certain,&quot; Crisford said. &quot;We probably had a favourite&apos;s chance and he proved that today. When he was disappointing in the Dewhurst, we were disappointed too, because we felt that he was better than what we saw that day, and he&apos;s proved it today. Hopefully he&apos;s a genuine contender for the 2,000 Guineas.&quot; Chriselliam came into her race, the Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile Fillies&apos; Turf, as a proven Group One winner, but another European filly with form at the top level, the French-trained Vorda, was sent off favourite on the back of her win in the Cheveley Park Stakes. Chriselliam&apos;s form in the Fillies&apos; Mile proved far more significant, however, and Richard Hughes powered down the straight to beat Testa Rossi and Colonel Joan with Vorda only seventh. The winner is part-owned by the former champion jockey Willie Carson, whose most significant previous involvement at the meeting had been Dayjur&apos;s last-gasp defeat at Belmont Park in 1990, when the brilliant sprinter threw away certain victory by jumping a shadow near the line. &quot;Bloody marvellous,&quot; Carson said afterwards. &quot;What else can you say? European horses are usually a little bit slow to get going in the first furlong and usually have to overcome that, and he did that marvellously.&quot; Hills said that his first success at the meeting, something his father Barry never achieved, &quot;means the world to me&quot;. Hills added: &quot;It&apos;s the icing on the cake this year. She&apos;s exceptional, she&apos;s got everything you want really. You can put here anywhere in the race. &quot;It&apos;s not often you can win a Breeders&apos; Cup race by taking a pull halfway down the straight. I&apos;m just looking forward to getting her home now, and then next year, we&apos;ll obviously aim for the Guineas.&quot; London Bridge will now continue his career in Australia at the end of a season which started with a defeat in a maiden event at Wolverhampton. &quot;We had targeted this horse on this race for a long time,&quot; Mikael Magnusson, assistant to trainer Jo Hughes, said. &quot;He needs very fast ground, and in England, the ground was gone. I think we&apos;ve learned a lot from this experience and how to prepare a horse for a race like this, so we&apos;ll come again with another one.&quot; The feature race on the card, the $2m Breeders&apos; Cup Distaff, was won by Beholder as her two main rivals, Royal Delta and Princess Of Sylmar, both disappointed. Beholder generally leads in her races, but her jockey Gary Stevens, who emerged from a seven-year retirement less than a year ago, sat just behind the pace-setting Authenticity in the early stages alongside Royal Delta. Royal Delta faded rapidly on the way to the far turn and Stevens had soon carved out a winning lead on Beholder, who is trained by Richard Mandella. &quot;We&apos;ve trained her [to run from off the pace] but we&apos;ve just never had to use it before,&quot; Mandella said. &quot;Today she had to come from off it and boy, do I love it. I&apos;ve been lucky enough to have many good mares in my years of training, but this mare might have to be the best of all.&quot;", "title": "British-trained horses get off to flying start at Breeders' Cup", "sentences": ["&quot;I think that we&apos;ve had a fantastic year, really,&quot; Crisford said, &quot;because we&apos;re champion owner in England, we were a champion owner in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-02T01:16:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2013/nov/02/gold-oil-land-scam-investments", "tags": ["Scams", "Investments", "Consumer affairs", "Money", "Investing", "Regulators", "Business", "Crime", "UK news"], "article": "I am not a sucker. I don&apos;t fall for dodgy deals \u2013 I write about them. But I&apos;m on a &quot;sucker list&quot;: a directory of contact details of potential losers that dodgy investment firms trade among themselves and use to target potential victims. I receive two to three calls a week from these scam companies. They all aim to part me from a minimum \u00a310,000. Over the past year I&apos;ve had wine (many times), carbon credits (starting to reappear), rare earth elements, and overseas land. Recently, they have become more inventive with offers of &quot;unmined gold&quot;, Bank of America shares, and stakes in an oil well prospect. But whatever the deal, they all use similar sales techniques, starting with a phone call. According to watchdog the Financial Conduct Authority (FCS), UK investors lose about \u00a3200m a year to high-pressure investment boiler rooms. It reckons some 10,000 victims are ripped off for an average \u00a320,000. Some are straight-forward frauds, while others are real shares but near worthless or highly risky. This is the tip of the iceberg. Many victims do not report losses, perhaps because they are too ashamed, or they know that the perpetrators, usually based overseas, get clean away or their chances of compensation are remote. The FCA has a wide variety of resources on its website, but they depend on potential victims knowing where to look. With the number of scam firms increasing and becoming more aggressive, it&apos;s not working. The simplest advice is just to slam down the phone on anyone who calls you to sell an investment. That&apos;s it. Simple and to the point. After all, no legitimate investment company ever cold calls for potential customers. The FCA website has the register of authorised firms, a list of unauthorised firms known to be operating in the UK, and a number of warnings. But these all have weaknesses. The register does not apply to wine, land, carbon credits, rare earth minerals and physical gold, so scammers can correctly claim they don&apos;t need authorisation. The unauthorised firm list is also historical \u2013 yet dodgy dealers rarely last long and change names frequently. The warnings are hedged with words such as &quot;usually&quot;, &quot;might be&quot; and &quot;probably&quot;. Typical calls I have received are: \u2022 Gold in the ground. A firm (Gold Assets Associates), operating from a London maildrop, offered me gold at $1,000 an ounce \u2013 $380 less than the current price. All I would get is a certificate entitling me to unmined gold from a Canadian mine in two years. \u2022 A Zurich maildrop firm (Capital Resources Development Group) called to try to get me to buy into Bank of America. But what it was selling was highly geared Contracts for Difference (betting on a stock) and not shares. It is easy to lose an entire stake in a very short period. The salesman claimed he also advised &quot;seven out of the nine biggest hedge funds&quot;. \u2022 A Dubai-based firm (Quantum Commercial, but which has no connection with Quantum Group in Bournemouth) offered me shares in an oil prospect in Illinois.

Every week for the next year members of Gulf Labor will show a piece of work that highlights the plight of South Asian workers on Saadiyat Island (the Island of Happiness), where three &quot;starchitect&quot; designed museums will rise among a complex of five-star beach resorts and luxury villas. The protest, which includes Swiss artist Thomas Hirschhorn and Lebanese artist Walid Raad, comes amid mounting concern about conditions on the island, which this summer saw riots by migrant workers. Labourers striking over poor terms and wages were also deported by a major contractor, Arabtec, earlier this year, while an annual report on the situation by the construction project&apos;s auditor PricewaterhouseCoopers, expected in September, has yet to be published. Lebanese artist Doris Bittar, who is collating a Facebook exhibition of art on migrant workers, said the &quot;52 Weeks&quot; campaign had been launched because the situation had reached breaking point. Bittar, an art lecturer at California State University San Marcos, accused the international museums involved in Saadiyat, including the British Museum \u2013 the consulting partner to the Sheikh Zayed National Museum \u2013 of being blind. She said they were more nervous about damage to their reputations than workers&apos; rights.  Recent attempts by the Louvre and the Guggenheim to buy or show work by Gulf Labor artists had raised fears the museums were trying to undermine their campaign, she added. &quot;These artists who make up the core of Gulf Labor have refused and are standing firm. Artists, curators and galleries should seriously consider boycotting these institutions to send a clear message. Some of the migrant labourers are going home in caskets. Do we, as artists, really want to be a party to that?&quot; Mumbai-based artists Shaina Anand and Ashok Sukumaran are asking the Indian government to intervene in cases of abuse involving migrant workers in Abu Dhabi. They have also made videos that show how isolated the workers&apos; village is on Saadiyat. Sukumaran said: &quot;Imagine a whole city made predominantly of workers camps \u2026 many surrounded with fences and mostly off-limits to outsiders. This is what Abu Dhabi, and other parts of the UAE and the Gulf are like, but also, much worse, are being designed as. What kind of cultural implications this has, what kind of society this imagines, is a question to be asked urgently.&quot; Saadiyat Island has suffered repeated delays to construction and financial concerns amid international criticism since Human Rights Watch first raised worries about workers&apos; conditions in a report in 2009. Gulf Labor launched an artists&apos; boycott of the Abu Dhabi Guggenheim in 2011 and last year project insiders and art experts said the emirate should scale back its plans, possibly even scrapping the Guggenheim museum. In response to international criticism, the emirate&apos;s Tourism Development and Investment Company, which runs Saadiyat, commissioned PwC to independently monitor workers&apos; conditions. The accountancy giant&apos;s first report, published in September 2012, highlighted a range of labour abuses, including that around three quarters of workers had paid recruitment fees to secure their jobs and poor sanitation and faulty air conditioning in the specially constructed workers village. Although the TDIC said the report showed that improvements had been made, this August saw violent clashes among migrant labourers, reportedly provoked by the deportation of strikers and the hiring of &quot;scab&quot; workers. Forty people were taken to hospital and 25 arrested after dozens of workers were attacked with sticks, beaten with metal bars and hit with hammers, according to news website 7 Days in Dubai. Although Arabtec said the brawl between Pakistani and Bangladeshi workers was an ethnic dispute, human rights activists said the deportations and hiring violated the right to strike. as defined by the International Labour Organisation. Nicholas McGeehan, Gulf researcher at Human Rights Watch, said: &quot;We have received reports from credible local sources that there are still serious problems at Saadiyat. There have been press reports of violent riots on the Saadiyat site and Arabtec, a major contractor, deported a significant number of workers from other projects in April, after workers went on strike due to complaints over wages. Moreover, there has been no independent auditors report since September 2012.&quot; The TDIC did not respond to requests for comment. A spokeswoman for PwC said work on their follow up monitoring report was under way. But she did not clarify when it would be published. The British Museum said it had discussed workers&apos; rights with the TDIC: &quot;We are aware of the incident between rival gangs of workers in August and understand this was dealt with by Abu Dhabi police. We are not aware of any violent disputes regarding pay or working conditions on Saadiyat Island.&quot;", "title": "Art world protest over 'mistreatment' of migrants at Abu Dhabi cultural hub", "sentences": ["Forty people were taken to hospital and 25 arrested after dozens of workers were attacked with sticks, beaten with metal bars and hit with hammers, according to news website 7 Days in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-02T15:25:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/04/melbourne-cup-betting-guide-runners-and-riders", "tags": ["Melbourne Cup", "Horse racing", "Horse racing tips", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "article": "Dunaden Powerful French stayer bidding to become a dual winner of the Melbourne Cup following his victory in 2011. Could manage only 14th last year but recent form includes a second behind Novellist, who subsequently won England\u2019s premier weight-for-age middle-distance event. Several factors against him \u2013 no eight-year-old has won the cup for 75 years and 1975 was the last time a horse carried 58.5kg to victory \u2013 but Dunaden grows a leg in Australia and is too good to leave out of calculations. Odds: $35.00 Green Moon The defending champion and one of six runners representing leviathan owner Lloyd Williams. His form since winning the 2012 renewal is not inspiring but the entire has been campaigned exclusively at weight-for-age with a view to having him right for one race. Winning back-to-back Cups isn\u2019t easy \u2013 just four horses have accomplished the feat \u2013 but Green Moon is well drawn, will like the ground and can give this a shake if in the same form as 12 months ago. Odds: $31.00 Red Cadeaux Lining up for his third tilt at the Melbourne Cup, following an agonisingly close second in 2011 and eighth last year. Has been campaigned all around the world and showed he retains most of his ability despite his advancing years with a slashing second in the Dubai World Cup in March. Battle-hardened and likely to be around the mark, but Red Cadeaux is poorly drawn and it\u2019s hard to see where the requisite improvement will come from to be a winning hope. Odds: $51.00 Sea Moon Another of Williams\u2019s imported gallopers, Sea Moon is a lightly raced six-year-old who arrived on these shores with a big reputation due largely to a big win at level weights over Dunaden and Red Cadeaux at Royal Ascot in 2012. Finished down the track in his first two starts in Australia, but there were valid excuses each time and subsequently his class has shone through with a Listed second at Flemington (lost on protest) and a tough win under a big weight in the Herbert Power at Caulfield. Saved for this, set for this and although untried at the trip gives every indication he\u2019ll get it. Winning chance. Odds: $15.00 Brown Panther Most headlines about Brown Panther haven\u2019t been about the horse: he\u2019s owned by former England footballer Michael Owen and last week his groom was sent home for breaching quarantine protocol at Werribee. The galloper himself is well worth writing about: placed twice at Group I level in Europe, Brown Panther showed his liking for the two-mile journey with a dominant win in the Group II Goodwood Cup two starts back. Reported to be working well in preparation for this. Expect him to be in the leading division from a good draw and a forward showing would not surprise.\u00a0Odds: $19.00 Fiorente Showcased his talent by running second in last year\u2019s Cup in just his first start for Gai Waterhouse after transferring from England. Hasn\u2019t run a bad race since and ticks plenty of boxes: trip, ground and journey pose no problems and stellar lead-up form includes a last-to-first win in the Dato Tan Chin Nam, a close-up fourth in the Turnbull and a brave third in the Cox Plate after doing plenty of work in the run. Has had a few jockey changes this preparation and multiple Cup winner Damien Oliver goes on this time. Worthy favourite and a fine chance of giving Waterhouse her first Cup win if the Cox Plate run hasn\u2019t flattened him.\u00a0Odds: $7.00 Foreteller Really honest and likeable Sydney galloper who carries oodles of weight-for-age form into this. Multiple Group I winner, including the Makybe Diva Stakes at Flemington four starts back, and turned in a slashing Cup trial with a fast-finishing fourth in the Cox Plate. Best form is at 2,000m so must be a question mark at the 3,200m, but drop-back racing style suggests he\u2019s a chance of seeing out the trip. Possibly wouldn\u2019t want the track too firm but if he handles the journey \u2013 and it\u2019s a big IF \u2013 his superior turn of foot will put him right in the picture.\u00a0Odds: $26.00 Dandino In years gone past, Dandino\u2019s barnstorming run to grab second place in the Caulfield Cup would have automatically promoted him to favourite for the Melbourne Cup. These days the formline waters are muddied with the influx of foreign raiders, of which he is one, but there is no denying Dandino turned in a trial at Caulfield that demanded you back him next time. Unlike several of the foreign legion, he\u2019s had that all-important sighter in this country, and, with natural improvement to come, is weighted to go two better than Jakkalberry\u2019s third place for trainer Marco Botti in the 2012 Cup.\u00a0Odds: $10.00 Ethiopia One of the locals trying to repel the foreign invasion. A great career looked in the offing when the gelding won the 2012 Australian Derby but he has failed to make much impact since and in fact hasn\u2019t won another race. Has had a classical Cup preparation but there\u2019s very little in his form to get excited about, even in his seemingly improved run to grab fourth in Saturday\u2019s Lexus Stakes. Flopped in this race last year and likely to do so again.\u00a0Odds: $71.00 Fawkner The staying find of the spring. Once known as a classy miler, Team Williams has transformed Fawkner into an equally classy stayer. Showed he had taken to the longer trips with a creditable third in the Turnbull when he hit the front too soon and showed that run was no fluke with a big win in the Caulfield Cup. Loves Flemington, well drawn and still well weighted after his penalty for winning the Caulfield Cup. Has an extra 800m to run on Tuesday and stamina must be a query, but his stable knows how to get their horses to stay.\u00a0Odds: $16.00 Mourayan Another spring carnival regular and looking to improve on his seventh place last year. Hasn\u2019t cut much ice in a quiet preparation, but like his stablemates has been campaigned with eyes only on the Melbourne Cup. Very capable on his day \u2013 has won a Sydney Cup over 3,200m and has weight-for-age placings in an Australian Cup and BMW \u2013 but not getting any younger and probably the weakest of the Williams sextet.\u00a0Odds: $126.00 Seville Finally cracked it for a first win in Australia when getting a rails run to win The Metropolitan at Randwick, a race with a mixed record as a Melbourne Cup trial. Then thrown in the deep end in the Cox Plate and performed better than stablemate Green Moon did in the race last year before going on to win the Melbourne Cup. The Metrop form hasn\u2019t worked out at all and on the face of it Seville has something to find, but doubt we\u2019ve seen the best of him and must rate as an each-way chance. Odds: $18.00 Super Cool One of last term\u2019s leading three-year-old stayers when he rubbed shoulders with, and beat, the likes of It\u2019s A Dundeel and Fiveandahalfstar. Really looked like he could be anything when running down the latter to win the Australian Cup in March but has been mostly disappointing this spring. However, there have been excuses most starts and his fifth in the Cox Plate suggested he might not be far off his best. Trainer/jockey combination responsible for 2009 winner Shocking and, if the extra journey brings out more improvement, Super Cool is probably over the odds. Just hard to know exactly how well he is going. Odds: $41.00 Masked Marvel Rounds out the Williams assault and possibly the hardest runner of his six to line up. Has form over long distances in Europe \u2013 including a wide-margin win over Brown Panther and Sea Moon in the 2011 English St Leger \u2013 but has not won a race since then, including in four Australian starts. Pick of those runs was a close second in the Group III Craven Plate at Randwick, but that is rungs below what is required to win a Melbourne Cup and he was firmly put in his place in the Cox Plate. Ticks on draw, weight, trip and jockey, but realistically needs to improve out of sight to be a factor.\u00a0Odds: $31.00 Mount Athos Ran a brave and unlucky fifth in last year\u2019s Melbourne Cup. Master UK trainer Luca Cumani has gone very close several times to winning this race and he has geared Mount Athos\u2019s past 12 months around a singular purpose: returning to Flemington to go four places better. Big-race rider Craig Williams takes the reins in a telling engagement and has been the subject of resoundingly good trackwork reports. Remains attractively weighted and looks set to run a big race, the only negative being his barrier draw of gate 22. Odds: $9.00 Royal Empire Global racing outfit Godolphin return to Melbourne single-handed for another crack at winning a first Melbourne Cup. They\u2019ve gone awfully close on a number of occasions and Royal Empire fits the mould of the horse they feel can win a Cup: lightly raced, unexposed (and hence well weighted) and boasting the acceleration to win good races in the UK at around 2,400m. Beat Red Cadeaux three starts back (though was receiving 2.5kg) and comes here with plenty of upside. No lead-up run locally so you have to take Royal Empire on trust, but if he\u2019s acclimatised to Australian conditions he can figure in the finish at good odds.\u00a0Odds: $21.00 Voleuse De Coeurs Irish St Leger winner in September when trained by Dermot Weld, Voleuse De Coeurs was then purchased by Australian interests and transferred to Michael Moroney for a tilt at the Cup. Is a two-time winner at 3,200m and lightly raced for a five-year-old mare, so suspect she has plenty more to give. It\u2019s worth noting Weld, who\u2019s twice won the Melbourne Cup, had nominated her for this year\u2019s race but aborted travel plans prior to her sale. Has form in the book and hard to deny her claims but she\u2019s drawn off the track and might prefer more juice in the ground than she\u2019ll get on Tuesday. Odds: $15.00 Hawkspur One of the few homebreds in the race and arguably the Australian breeding industry\u2019s best chance of winning the Cup. Certainly not bred to get anything like two miles but showed that 2,400m was no issue when winning the Queensland Derby this year. Announced himself as a major spring player with a blistering first-up win in the Chelmsford Stakes and was an unlucky, close-up fifth in the Turnbull before not enjoying the best of luck when unplaced as favourite in the Caulfield Cup. Another drawn wide with some concerns over stamina, but the balance of his form is good and he shouldn\u2019t be left out of calculations.\u00a0Odds: $15.00 Simenon Irish visitor with a varied resume which includes wins over hurdles and on the flat from distances between 1400m and 4369m. He also has a close second in the Group I Ascot Gold Cup (4,000m) to his name, so stamina and class can\u2019t be called into question. Simenon\u2019s had the benefit of a lead-up run in this country, a very respectable third in the Herbert Power three weeks ago behind Sea Moon. That race showed he has some tactical speed, the lack of which has cost many highly touted extreme-distance stayers from the UK in previous Melbourne Cups (think Drum Taps, Double Trigger, Yeats etc). Should have improved from his Caulfield run and is another with claims in an open race.\u00a0Odds: $18.00 Ibicenco Gained his ticket with a tough win in the Geelong Cup, a race which has a record in providing Melbourne Cup winners (Media Puzzle, Americain, Dunaden in recent years). It\u2019s almost certain this year\u2019s edition was not as strong, but winning form is good form and this horse showed he stays 3,200m when winning last year\u2019s Sandown Cup. Is building a good record in weaker races but needs to go up a few levels to rate a serious chance in this. Odds: $71.00 Verema A long overdue first runner in the Melbourne Cup for the Aga Khan, one of the world\u2019s leading owner/breeders. Has had a light campaign in Europe and crucially comes here in form, having won the Prix Kergolay over 3,000m, in a blanket finish, at her most recent start in August. That race was used as a springboard to Cup success by both Americain and Dunaden in past years. Her trainer, Alain De Royer-Dupre, is a masterful handler of stayers and put the polish on Americain in his 2010 triumph. Hard to line her up, though she clearly is very good, and it must be a query how she\u2019ll handle the hustle and bustle of a big field from an inside draw, having competed mostly in small fields. Still, the x-factor of the race and must be respected. Odds: $13.00 Dear Demi Iron mare who has seemingly gone up a notch this spring and bucked the trend of leading staying fillies who struggle when thrown into open company. She really has had a flawless preparation, competing well at every outing \u2013 and importantly in the races recognised as significant Cup trials. The only thing she hasn\u2019t done yet this spring is win, but placings in the Underwood Stakes, Caulfield Cup and Mackinnon Stakes position last year\u2019s Crown Oaks winner as a legitimate contender, particularly with the featherweight of 51kg on her back.\u00a0Odds: $19.00 Tres Blue Another virtual unknown, French galloper Tres Blue has had only 10 career starts and is still a three-year-old by European standards. What we do know about him is his form is very progressive, having won his two most recent starts (a Group II and a Group III) after running a close second in the German Derby. Now with Gai Waterhouse, who went close last year with another \u2018first-upper\u2019 in Fiorente, the bay horse has reportedly been working very well and must be given an each-way shout off a light weight.\u00a0Odds: $21.00 Ruscello Snuck into the field by winning Saturday\u2019s Lexus Stakes, a race which has proven to be a fair Melbourne Cup guide in recent years with Brew and Shocking two horses to win both in the same year. Showed guts to outstay Let\u2019s Make Adeal on that occasion, and has clearly settled well in Australia, but this is another step up and his English form is some way off what is needed to be competitive in a Melbourne Cup. His jockey, apprentice Chris Schofield, pulled a rabbit out of the hat to win the Cox Plate on a maiden but from the outside gate Ruscello can safely be discounted as a winning chance.

The South African launched an epic tirade against the set-up at Wentworth, his long-time home course, during the 2012 PGA Championship. &quot;Really, I am pissed off&quot; was among Els&apos;s more tame sentiments at that time. Later last year, Els claimed advances in equipment are responsible for relative parity in top-level golf. &quot;I look around now and see guys winning, guys who could never have done so 20 years ago,&quot; he said. On Sunday, Els was at it again. This time his target was those behind the European Tour&apos;s schedule and, specifically, this year&apos;s inaugural Final Series which encompasses two tournaments in China, with one each in Turkey and Dubai. Els has pulled out of the DP World Championship event in Dubai, the lucrative finale of the European Tour season, to emphasise his disquiet. Competitors must play in at least two of the three events preceding Dubai to be eligible for a spot in the Emirate state&apos;s 60-man field. &quot;I don&apos;t think they really care,&quot; Els said when asked how the Tour had reacted to the news that he would not feature in Dubai. &quot;Why would they make a decision like that and expect guys to play? It&apos;s farcical. In my view it&apos;s an absolute joke.&quot; Els, 44, is neither inexperienced nor loose with his tongue. He will be well aware of the impact of whatever he says and would presumably have the backing of Joost Luiten, who went through the farcical scenario of playing just a single shot at the BMW Masters in Shanghai before withdrawing because of a shoulder injury. By hitting that one drive, Luiten protected his chances of reaching Dubai. Luke Donald, on Twitter, promptly stated &quot;Can&apos;t blame Joost \u2013 new rule forced his hand&quot;. Ian Poulter, who is based in Florida, offered a similar if softer view to Els, also during the BMW Masters. Poulter said: &quot;For me it&apos;s too far to go home for a week and so I&apos;m away for a month now, missing the kids, finding it difficult and people are trying to make it more difficult. &quot;Don&apos;t get me wrong, I love playing here and around the world, and I have a global business. But you do need to pick and choose your events carefully so you can do yourself justice and it&apos;s not getting any easier when it gets to the end of a season and people are telling you where you&apos;ve got to play.&quot; Els and Poulter, like so many at the upper echelon, find themselves with the increasing difficulty of featuring on the more high-profile and wealthy PGA Tour in the United States while maintaining a presence in Europe. The European Tour has recently added an incentive for players to participate in tournaments in their home continent but 13 is the minimum figure for members to retain their card. Co-sanctioned events such as the four World Championships make that figure attainable but there is clearly increasing disquiet over what some players view as unreasonable demands on their time. By Monday lunchtime, the European Tour launched its response to Els. Keith Waters, chief operating officer and director of international policy, said: &quot;The Final Series is a concept which was initiated through discussions with the membership of the European Tour and their input will continue to be important as the Final Series evolves and moves forward, details of which the chief executive George O&apos;Grady will look to unveil on the final Sunday of this year&apos;s DP World Tour Championship. &quot;The current Race to Dubai is building to a thrilling conclusion and with two huge prize funds still to contest, there are over 60 players still with the opportunity of finishing No1 for the 2013 season. &quot;Top-five finishes from Ian Poulter, Graeme McDowell and Justin Rose last week in China saw them all close the gap on Henrik Stenson and we now look ahead to the penultimate tournament of the Final Series this week in Turkey and the season finale next week in Dubai.&quot; In basic terms, the European Tour has to be proactive to fight the continuing talent drain caused by players moving to the United States. Part-replication of the PGA Tour&apos;s FedEx series is at least a start in that regard. The $30m (\u00a319m) on offer in prize monies throughout China, Turkey and Dubai should be a pretty strong incentive to any player. The Tour has had to move away from traditional venues such as Spain because of economic circumstances; it has not only done that, but to impressive financial effect. The European Tour also needs at least some guarantee of player appearances before any tournament can be properly marketed. If scheduling was left completely loose, with the key attractions such as Poulter and Rory McIlroy able to turn up on a whim, sponsors would cite uncertainty as a reason not to be involved. Golfers are not exempt from the burn-out that impedes other sportspeople. Tiger Woods, who will play for a considerable appearance fee in Turkey this week, hinted at concerns over playing pressures at the culmination of the FedEx series.

A police officer who spoke to the Sunday tabloid&apos;s managing editor, Stuart Kuttner, was told the paper had information the Surrey schoolgirl had received a call from a recruitment agency in Telford, Shropshire informing her about job interviews at the Epson computer factory in the Midlands town, the jury in the phone-hacking trial was told on Tuesday. Kuttner had contacted Surrey police on Saturday 13 April 2002 to say the newspaper had &quot;information that may assist the inquiry into the disappearance of Milly Dowler&quot;, who was later found murdered. In a statement read to the court DS Kevin McEntee said Kuttner told him: &quot;The News of the World are in possession of a recording of that message.&quot; The statement added that Kuttner told him they had Dowler&apos;s mobile number and pin and the newspaper &quot;had confirmed with school friends this was her number&quot;. The jury was told the paper were told by the officer it might be a hoaxer. The paper made no secret of the fact it had hacked her voice messages. A journalist from the News of the World, Ricky Sutton, also played a recording of one of the voicemails to Surrey police, the jury heard. Mark Bryant-Heron, counsel for the prosecution said: &quot;Ricky Sutton played Sarah McGregor a recording of intercepted voicemail over the phone to her.&quot; The court heard that Rebekah Brooks, then editor of the News of the World, was on holiday in Dubai at the time, and the paper was being edited by the deputy editor, Andy Coulson. The first edition of the paper on Sunday 14 April carried a page 9 report headlined &quot;Milly hoax riddle&quot; that quoted verbatim from some of the voicemails left on her phone, the jury heard. By the second edition the story had changed to &quot;Missing Milly hoax outrage&quot; on page 30. Between the first and second editions, Brooks was in contact with Coulson by text twice, the jury was told. She had also been in contact with the News of the World on the Friday and Saturday, including one call to the newsdesk lasting 38 minutes and 23 seconds at 5.15pm on the Friday. Brooks made another call just after midnight on the Friday to the night desk, and spoke to the editors twice on the Saturday morning, the jury heard. On the Saturday afternoon she made a call at 3.24pm to the editors&apos; desk at the tabloid lasting 20 minutes and 31 seconds. Police obtained a court order to access voicemails left on Milly&apos;s phone while she was missing, which were read out. One said: &quot;Hi Milly, it&apos;s just that we want you home, bye.&quot; Bryant-Heron said there was TV noise in the background, someone could be heard saying &quot;I just called Milly to come home&quot;, and another voice asked why. &quot;Because I did,&quot; replied the first person. Another voicemail said: &quot;Hi Milly, please come home. I miss you so much. It&apos;s David.&quot; According to Kuttner&apos;s notebook, the Dowler story had cost the News of the World &quot;\u00a32,000 \u2013 estimate&quot;, the court heard. Brooks and Coulson, who are both former News of the World editors, are facing charges relating to an alleged conspiracy to listen to mobile phone voicemails of politicians, celebrities and others in a trial involving eight defendants. It is also alleged that Brooks and Coulson conspired to commit misconduct in public office, a charge also faced by the paper&apos;s former royal correspondent Clive Goodman. Brooks is also face a charge of conspiring to pervert the course of justice with her husband Charlie, an allegation also faced by her former personal assistant Cheryl Carter and News International&apos;s head of security Mark Hanna.

The disclosure came as the prosecution used notes kept by the specialist hacker Glenn Mulcaire as well as phone records, diaries, internal News of the World paperwork and live witnesses to reconstruct what apparently happened after the 13-year-old girl went missing on her way home from school in Surrey on Thursday 21 March 2002. On Wednesday 10 April, Mulcaire was tasked with listening to the messages that had been left for her, the court was told. Some were emotional messages from friends and family, according to transcripts shown to the jury: &quot;Please come home. I miss you so much \u2026 Hey, Milly, if you get this, call me \u2026 Hello, Milly. It&apos;s just that we want you home.&quot; But the one that attracted the News of the World&apos;s attention was from a recruitment agency in Telford, West Midlands, apparently using Milly&apos;s real name, Amanda. It had been left on Wednesday 27 March. As recorded by the News of the World, it said: &quot;Hello, Amanda. This is Jo from Mondays Recruitment Agency. We are ringing because we have some interviews starting today at Epson. Please ring.&quot; However, the court has heard that the message was, in fact, intended for a woman called Nana who had a similar phone number. Neverthless, believing they might find Milly alive, the paper dispatched a team of journalists to an Epson factory near Telford, without telling the police. When that failed to yield any sighting, the News of the World went to Surrey police, putting pressure on them to confirm their story with increasingly explicit references to the intercepted voicemail. On Friday 13 April, the managing editor, Stuart Kuttner, spoke to a detective who noted him saying: &quot;The News of the World are in possession of a recording of the message.&quot; The same detective then spoke to the paper&apos;s then news editor, Neville Thurlbeck, and noted at the time: &quot;Thurlbeck told me he had accessed Milly&apos;s voicemail with pin no 1210.&quot; Thurlbeck then repeated the claim to a press officer, saying the paper had obtained Milly&apos;s phone number and pin code from children. Surrey police believed that the message was probably the result of a hoaxer posing as Milly. But the News of the World duly published a story on Sunday 14 April headlined &quot;Milly hoax riddle&quot;, which quoted verbatim the voicemail from the recruitment agency. The story was amended after the first edition, the court heard, to remove the verbatim quote. The following week, Kuttner emailed police, challenging the accuracy of the hoaxer angle and adding that during the previous week: &quot;We passed on information about messages left on Amanda Dowler&apos;s phone \u2026 We offered a copy of a tape-recording of the messages.&quot; Shortly afterwards, a press officer called the paper&apos;s crime reporter, Ricky Sutton, insisting that the hoaxer story was true. According to the press officer&apos;s log, Sutton replied: &quot;This is not true. It&apos;s inconceivable \u2026 Milly has been up there in person. She has registered and applied for a job at the factory. We know this for 100%.&quot; During the conversation, Sutton played the message down the phone, the court heard.And yet, the jury was told, when senior Surrey officers held their weekly Gold Command meeting that week and discussed the activity of the hoaxer, the evidence that the News of the World had hacked the missing girl&apos;s voicemail was not even mentioned, and no investigation was started. The court was also told that in the week leading up to the News of the World printing the hoaxer story, the editor, Rebekah Brooks, had been on holiday in Dubai. The prosecution have produced phone records apparently showing that she stayed in contact with executives on the paper including her deputy, Andy Coulson. William Hennessy, a marketing executive who was on holiday in Dubai at the same time, told the court that he had met Brooks and her then partner, the TV actor Ross Kemp, and that he recalled Brooks going off to make a phone call explaining that it was about &quot;the missing Surrey schoolgirl&quot;. But the QC acting for Brooks, Jonathan Laidlaw, suggested that Hennessy had not spent the time that he claimed with her. Brooks, Coulson and Kuttner all deny conspiring to intercept voicemail. Mulcaire has pleaded guilty to hacking Milly Dowler&apos;s phone. The trial continues. Messages accessed by police Moving transcripts of some of the voicemail messages found on Milly Dowler&apos;s mobile phone were read to the court on Tuesday. They were obtained when Surrey police accessed the 13-year-old&apos;s messages during their investigation into her disappearance in March 2002. Her body was eventually found the following September. One mesage simply read: &quot;Hi Milly it&apos;s just that we want you home soon, bye.&quot; Prosecuting, Mark Bryant-Heron said there was noise from a television in the background immediately afterwards, and someone could be heard telling a third party after having left the voicemail message: &quot;I just called Milly to come home.&quot; Another voice then asked why they had done so. &quot;Because I did,&quot; replied the first person. A second voicemail message played to the Old Bailey jury said: &quot;Hi Milly, please come home. I miss you so much. It&apos;s David.&quot; A third read out to the court said: &quot;Hi Milly, if you get this call, call me back, OK.&quot; No identities of those who left the messages were given in court. There were seven saved messages on her phone, the court heard. On some of them no message was left. Evidence was given that Surrey police were told by News of the World journalists that another message left for the youngster had said: &quot;It&apos;s America, take it or leave it.&quot; Caroline Davies", "title": "Police did not investigate hacked Milly Dowler message, court hears", "sentences": ["The court was also told that in the week leading up to the News of the World printing the hoaxer story, the editor, Rebekah Brooks, had been on holiday in Dubai.", "William Hennessy, a marketing executive who was on holiday in Dubai at the same time, told the court that he had met Brooks and her then partner, the TV actor Ross Kemp, and that he recalled Brooks going off to make a phone call explaining that it was about &quot;the missing Surrey schoolgirl&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-05T20:42:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/05/rebekah-brooks-out-of-country-milly-dowler-story-trial", "tags": ["UK news", "Rebekah Brooks"], "article": "Former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks had other things on her mind in the days running up to the publication of a controversial story about Milly Dowler, including her boyfriend Ross Kemp and a story about one of his co-stars in EastEnders, the Old Bailey has heard. The private investigator Glenn Mulcaire had been asked to hack then-missing teenager Milly&apos;s mobile phone on 10 April 2002. But the front-page splash on the following Sunday, 14 April, was not about the missing schoolgirl but about the EastEnders actor Michael Greco and his character Beppe, Jonathan Laidlaw, QC, counsel for Brooks told the phone-hacking trial on Tuesday. Proceedings concentrated on the Milly Dowler story in relation to a charge faced by Brooks and Andy Coulson, the News of the World deputy editor at the time, that they were involved in a conspiracy to hack phones. They both deny the charge. The story about Dowler, which discussed her voicemails and one message that mentioned a potential job in a Midlands factory, appeared on page 9, the court was told. Laidlaw said that among the calls Brooks had made during the days before publication were a call to her mother and a call to Artists Rights Group, which represented Kemp. Laidlaw was cross-examining DS Greg Smith of the Metropolitan police&apos;s Operation Weeting investigation into phone hacking over a flurry of calls that Brooks had made while on holiday in Dubai to various staff members in the days before 14 April, including her then deputy editor Andy Coulson. Rebekah Brooks&apos;s phone calls The first edition of the News of the World on Sunday 14 April carried a page 9 report headlined &quot;Milly hoax riddle&quot; that quoted verbatim from some of the voicemails left on the 13-year-old&apos;s phone, the jury heard. By the second edition, the story had changed to &quot;Missing Milly hoax outrage&quot; on page 30. Between the first and second editions, Brooks was in contact with Coulson by text twice, the jury was told. She had also been in contact with the News of the World on the Friday and Saturday, including one call to the newsdesk lasting 38 minutes and 23 seconds at 5.15pm on the Friday. Brooks made another call just after midnight to the night desk and spoke to the editors twice on the Saturday morning, the jury heard. On the Saturday afternoon, she made a call at 3.24pm to the editors&apos; desk lasting 20 minutes and 31 seconds. Ross Kemp&apos;s agent Laidlaw put it to Smith that Brooks was, at the time, in a relationship with Kemp, who she went on to marry and subsequently divorce before marrying Charlie Brooks, who sat beside her in the dock. &quot;Ross Kemp was most famous for his role in EastEnders,&quot; said Laidlaw. &quot;I will have to take your word for it,&quot; replied Smith. Laidlaw stated that the BBC1 soap was watched by &quot;20 million or so people&quot; at the time and that Kemp played one of the Mitchell brothers. The call to Kemp&apos;s agent was made on 11 April, the day after Mulcaire was given the task of hacking Milly&apos;s phone. On the same day, Brooks called Dave Reed, who Laidlaw explained was Greco&apos;s publicist. &quot;The front-page story for the edition of 14 April fixed upon Michael Greco,&quot; he suggested. Laidlaw suggested that while the story of Milly&apos;s disappearance in March 2002 had made the paper in previous weeks, it was not prominent. On 24 March, the front page was about the actor Russell Crowe and the following Sunday it featured the Queen Mother&apos;s death and a story about Sara Payne, the mother of murder victim Sarah. On 7 April, the week before the story discussing Milly&apos;s voicemails appeared, the News of the World splash was about the murdered television presenter Jill Dando, Laidlaw said. When cross-examined by Laidlaw, Smith was asked whether he could be sure if the times recorded for these calls were referring to UK or Dubai time. He said he could not. He noted that Smith had made a comparative analysis of Brooks&apos;s phone calls to assess whether the level of activity was unusual. It was not unusual, he said. Mr Justice Saunders, the judge presiding over the case, added that it was perhaps not unusual for this editor. Vying with the Sun  The court heard there was fierce competition between the News of the World and the Sun over which paper could offer a reward in the Milly Dowler case. While Surrey&apos;s then chief constable was talking to the Sun, the assistant chief constable was talking to the News of the World. The police decided both papers could run a joint reward. The Sunday tabloid&apos;s then-managing editor Stuart Kuttner sent an email on 1 May to Sarah McGregor, who was head of communications at Surrey police at the time. McGregor said she was &quot;unhappy&quot; about the Sun being involved and that the Sunday paper had &quot;better circulation and more resources&quot;. She added that Kuttner told her that &quot;Rebekah Wade [as Brooks was then] has stated that she couldn&apos;t do this on a joint basis,&quot; she said. When a deal was struck, with both papers offering \u00a350,000 each in reward money, the court heard that McGregor received a call from News of the World crime reporter Ricky Sutton, who said: &quot;You have killed us stone dead in the water&quot; before putting the phone down. McGregor confirmed that at no time had she spoken to Coulson. The trial is in its second day of evidence and has been discussing the Dowler story in relation to a charge faced by Coulson and Kuttner that they were involved in a conspiracy to hack phones, which they deny.

He was one of the UK&apos;s greatest engineers, revolutionising transport and engineering. He was responsible for the building of the Great Western Railway \u2013 152 miles from London to Bridgewater that took six years to build. Many engineering problems had to be solved and spectacular bridges created, that are still used by trains today. Brunel also found time to design the suspension bridge over the Avon gorge at Bristol and create the first iron steam ship. We continue to benefit hugely from Brunel&apos;s work and vision, even if his projects tended to over-run in time and cost and occasionally didn&apos;t work out as intended. So, what might Brunel think of the debate about HS2? If things go to plan, it will reach Manchester by 2031 \u2013 just 200 miles in 18 years. Compare this with the high-speed railway between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore (250 miles in 90 minutes) recently approved by the Malaysian government for completion by 2020. Singapore&apos;s infrastructure investment is 30 times per head of population more than that of the UK. It is not as if Singapore does not already have a very good transport infrastructure compared with the UK&apos;s; rather, Singapore is investing to become a leading global business hub, which will be at the expense of the West. Even more impressive is Johannesburg, South Africa, where the road network is better than we have around any UK cities. Public transport is not being neglected, as evidenced by bus lanes from Soweto to the centre of Johannesburg, with bus stops between the carriageways designed like small futuristic railway stations. It is difficult to compare infrastructure investment between countries as costs vary hugely, but a 2012 document by the South African treasury argued that developing countries needed to invest 25% of their GDP in infrastructure to generate economic growth. That appears to be what South Africa is aiming to do. Dubai invests 17.5% of its GDP in infrastructure. By comparison, the UK government announced in June that \u00a370bn would be invested in transport infrastructure by 2020. That works out at less than 1% of the UK&apos;s GDP. The UK has not adjusted to the modern world. Expanding air capacity in south east England has been debated for decades and Heathrow is at 99% of capacity \u2013 a gift to the city of Frankfurt, which is seeking to attract business from London. Pointless arguments are taking place about the cost of HS2 and the economic benefits when none of us can forecast 18 years ahead. Successive UK governments have spent several decades debating whether to build a decent road between Sheffield and Manchester, two of our major cities, only 40 miles apart. If it was Dubai, we would have a highway with six lanes either side instead of long traffic queues polluting our villages. Brunel would not have been able to operate in today&apos;s UK. A dramatic change in government spending priorities and delivery of major infrastructure projects will be needed to prevent the UK talking itself imperceptibly into third world status.

Interior designer Dean Keyworth said he met Brooks and her then partner Ross Kemp twice during the holiday in April 2002, once in a nightclub for drinks at a hotel and once around the swimming pool. He said he did not recall the former News of the World editor talking about Dowler or a missing schoolgirl. Taking the witness box in the hacking trial, Keyworth told the court that he had known Andy Coulson, who was at the time Brooks&apos;s deputy on the Sunday tabloid, for 26 years. He said Coulson was a &quot;loyal&quot; friend and an &quot;honest person&quot; who would not have pursued a story at &quot;any cost&quot;. Both Brooks and Coulson have pleaded not guilty to charges that they conspired to intercept voicemails on mobile phones while at the News of the World. They sat in the dock with just one other of the eight defendants on trial, Brooks&apos;s husband Charlie. Asked by the prosecution to tell the court about the conversations he had had with Brooks in Dubai, Keyworth said: &quot;Rebekah was on the phone quite a lot back to the office so there wasn&apos;t actually that much of a conversation.&quot; He said he had found himself spending a few hours lounging around a pool with Brooks after Kemp had gone to play tennis with one of the two friends in the group. &quot;I did say [to her] &apos;You must get bored having to take work calls all the time&apos;; she said she would rather keep on top of things.&quot; Keyworth was on holiday with another friend, William Hennessey, who earlier testified that he remembered Brooks walking away from the group who were sitting around the pool saying she had to talk about a &quot;missing Surrey schoolgirl&quot;. The prosecution called both witnesses to support its argument that Brooks was on the phone to the office in London and being kept in the loop about a Dowler story that discussed the missing schoolgirl&apos;s voicemails the day after the meeting around the pool. Keyworth told the court that the only thing that &quot;sticks out&quot; in his mind about the conversation he had with the couple over the few days he was in Dubai was talking to Kemp about EastEnders, which the actor had just quit. He told how he had helped get Brooks and Kemp moved to a neighbouring hotel because he was friends with the marketing manager and that the former EastEnders star was &quot;very pleased&quot; because the hotel had Hermes toiletries. The jury heard that Keyworth is a longstanding friend of Coulson, having met him 26 years earlier when a mutual friend attended the same journalism school. Cross-examined by Coulson&apos;s counsel, Keyworth described the former News of the World editor and Downing Street spin doctor as a &quot;loyal&quot; friend who looked after those close to him even as he became &quot;extremely busy and important&quot;. He told the court: &quot;He was very ambitious, but I do not think he was ruthless; always seemed to have a very pragmatic approach to things; wanted to get good stories in the paper but I do not think at any cost.&quot; Keyworth said Coulson did a lot of work for children&apos;s charities and they had a close connection because they had become fathers within weeks of each other.

Tottenham Hotspur have been widely criticised for not substituting the player but Villas-Boas insisted the club did nothing wrong and accused &quot;incompetent people&quot; of turning on Spurs solely to attract attention to themselves. Villas-Boas also said it was &quot;remarkable&quot; Lukaku&apos;s role in the incident has not been questioned further and suggested the Everton striker could have avoided the clash. Tottenham originally intended to replace Lloris with Brad Friedel after the incident but the Frenchman demanded to play on and, after examination on the pitch by the club doctor, Shabaaz Mughal, and club physiotherapist, Geoff Scott, Villas-Boas let him do so. That decision has since been condemned by, among others, the Professional Footballers&apos; Association, the international players&apos; union, Fifpro, Fifa&apos;s chief medical officer, Professor Jiri Dvorak, and the head injury charity Headway, who described the club&apos;s actions as &quot;dangerous and irresponsible&quot;. However, Villas-Boas remains unrepentant. &quot;I stand absolutely by the decision that I took and the decision that the medical department has taken following the checks that they made on the player, all of which were according to the book,&quot; he said. &quot;I stand by the decisions that gave us the green light for the player to continue. I have nothing else to say regarding that matter. I registered the fact that a couple of people have taken this opportunity to find a chance to get themselves publicised, people who have had no experience on the pitch whatsoever in this type of situation.&quot; As far as the club are concerned, Lloris did not lose consciousness and was not concussed as a result of the blow to the head. Villas-Boas suggested it is wrong to question the responsibility of the same medical staff whose actions helped save the life of Fabrice Muamba when the former Bolton Wanderers player collapsed from cardiac arrest during an FA Cup tie at White Hart Lane two years ago. &quot;Two persons and the medical department that two years ago saved the life of a player on the pitch has been completely forgotten, poorly treated and badly respected by lots of opinion-makers. What is extremely disappointing is the fact that two persons \u2013 a great doctor and a great physio who saved the life of Fabrice Muamba \u2013 were put into question by lots of incompetent people and people who have no experience on the pitch, in the action, in the moment. That is extremely serious and disappointing.&quot; Lloris underwent a precautionary brain scan on Sunday night, during which nothing irregular was detected. Nevertheless, the incident ignited a debate regarding the effectiveness with which footballer clubs tend to deal with head injuries, with critics suggesting that other sports handle them with more appropriate prudence. Villas-Boas said any comparison between the Lloris incident and others was spurious. &quot;My medical department has followed the Premier League guidelines for this type of situation, that&apos;s the only thing I can tell you,&quot; he said. &quot;The situation is obviously not comparable to NFL situations, rugby situations or Petr Cech&apos;s situation. It astonishes me that you try to put this in the same mould as situations that happened in the past. We have all the indications that the player is OK and we don&apos;t see incidents like this happening again.&quot; However, the possible delayed effects of concussion were demonstrated when South Africa&apos;s Graeme Smith withdrew from the one-day international series against Pakistan on Wednesday and was advised to rest for at least two weeks. Smith was hit on the right temple on the second day of the second Test and the team manager Dr Mohammed Moosajee said: &quot;Graeme was symptom-free after the blow except for a mild headache and tests at the time allowed him to continue playing. However, seven days post-injury, during the second ODI in Dubai he started complaining of blurred vision, which progressed to dizziness, unsteadiness on his feet and difficulty focusing. &quot;The MRI scan was clear, however it is in keeping with the assessment of post-concussion syndrome, which is usually a clinical diagnosis. Post-concussion syndrome can be described as a collection of symptoms that some people develop after they have experienced a minor traumatic brain injury otherwise known as concussion. &quot;Graeme will leave the tour on Thursday and has been advised a rest period of at least two weeks by the medical team. He will continuously be monitored in the interim.&quot; Villas-Boas added it was &quot;remarkable&quot; that Lukaku, who injured his knee during the clash, has not come under more scrutiny for his role in the incident. The Portuguese, who was Chelsea manager when Lukaku joined that club from Anderlecht, claimed the striker could have moved his knee to prevent it hitting Lloris and said he was saddened the Belgian has not made contact with the goalkeeper since Sunday to check on his wellbeing. &quot;I want to believe that Lukaku&apos;s leg was not left late to clash into Hugo&apos;s head. I find it remarkable that through all of this amount of publicity that this incident has got nobody has actually dedicated themselves to finding out if he could have avoided the goalkeeper and I am disappointed that Lukaku hasn&apos;t contacted Hugo. &quot;Lukaku is a fantastic footballer and I don&apos;t question his integrity or his human side. We had a warm hug on the pitch before the game, so I have maximum respect for him and I think he has for me but amid all this negative excitement I find it surprising that no time was lost to actually study the incident. I don&apos;t want to question Lukaku. He&apos;s a young player and wonderfully gifted but I think he could have jumped over perfectly.&quot; On Wednesday night, Headway reiterated their stance that Lloris should have been substituted. &quot;The views of a number of leading experts from both within the game and outside of it \u2026 are all aligned on this issue and agree that if there is any sign of concussion, a player should be removed from the game,&quot; a statement from the charity read.", "title": "Andr\u00e9 Villas-Boas blasts 'incompetent critics' in Hugo Lloris concussion row", "sentences": ["However, seven days post-injury, during the second ODI in Dubai he started complaining of blurred vision, which progressed to dizziness, unsteadiness on his feet and difficulty focusing."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-06T14:08:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2013/nov/06/milly-dowler-case", "tags": ["UK news"], "article": "Recruitment firm&apos;s experience  Staff at a recruitment agency which the News of the World mistakenly believed Milly Dowler was working for received calls from a woman claiming to be the missing schoolgirl&apos;s mother, the Old Bailey jury in the phone-hacking trial heard on Wednesday. Employees at the Mondays Recruitment Agency in Telford, Shropshire, received a call demanding to know where she was. The trial has been told that a message for a &quot;Nana&quot; was mistakenly left by the agency on the mobile belonging to the 13-year-old, whose real name was Amanda. The tabloid had dispatched reporters to Telford after that message had been hacked and ran an article about it on 14 April 2002. On Friday 12 April, Stephanie Hardy, an employee at the agency, took a call from a woman. In a statement read to the court, Hardy said the woman, whom she did not know, &quot;asked me if I could tell her if her daughter was working for Monday&apos;s Recruitment Agency. She told me her daughter&apos;s name was Amanda Dowler and asked if I had heard of her&quot;. Staff at the agency checked their records and could not find details of an Amanda Dowler, the court heard. Valerie Hancox, who ran the agency with her son, Mark, said a further call was received, inquiring about Milly in which a woman said: &quot;I&apos;m her mother and I want to know where she is living and working.&quot; Hancox&apos;s statement said that a male reporter from the News of the World turned up at her house on Saturday 13 April. She described him as slim, in his 30s, &quot;not aggressive and well mannered&quot;. He asked if she wanted to help in the Milly Dowler case and asked if they could go to her offices to check if the schoolgirl was on their records. Hancox&apos;s statement, read aloud to the court, said she was &quot;quite wound up and agitated at this time&quot;. She phoned Hardy who was &quot;adamant&quot; that Milly was not on their books. Hancox said she asked the reporter to leave but, &quot;he refused to leave the outside of my house and just sat in his car outside&quot;. Hancox&apos;s son Mark said a &quot;heavy set man&quot; knocked on his door on that Saturday and said &quot;it was important&quot;. He said he refused to speak to the man, who &quot;sat in his silver Range Rover outside&quot; and that he then received a call on his home phone &quot;asking if he was Mark Hancox&quot;. His statement read: &quot;He told me he had reason to believe Milly Dowler was working for my employment agency and he wanted any information we had on her \u2026He said he was an editor, or editor in chief or high-ranking employee of the News of the World&quot;. Mark Hancox&apos;s statement added that he subsequently believed the voice of the caller to be Stuart Kuttner, managing editor of the Sunday paper. The Dubai holiday  Rebekah Brooks was on the telephone to the News of the World &quot;quite a lot&quot; during a holiday in Dubai taken at the height of the hunt for Milly Dowler and told a fellow holidaymaker that she liked to keep on top of things even on her days off, the jury also heard on Wednesday. Dean Keyworth, an interior designer, said he met Brooks and her then partner, Ross Kemp, twice during the holiday in April 2002, once in a nightclub and once around the swimming pool. He said he did not recall the former News of the World editor talking about Milly or a missing schoolgirl. Keyworth told the court he had known Andy Coulson, who was Brooks&apos;s deputy on the at the time, for 26 years. He said Coulson was a loyal friend and an honest person who would not have pursued a story at &quot;any cost&quot;. The jury heard that Keyworth had met Coulson when a mutual friend attended the same journalism school. Brooks and Coulson have pleaded not guilty to charges that they conspired to intercept voicemails on mobile phones while at the News of the World. They sat in the dock with just one other of the eight defendants on trial, Brooks&apos;s husband Charlie. Asked by the prosecution to tell the court about the conversations with Brooks in Dubai, Keyworth said: &quot;Rebekah was on the phone quite a lot back to the office so there wasn&apos;t actually that much of a conversation.&quot; He said he had found himself spending a few hours lounging around a pool with Brooks after Kemp had gone to play tennis with one of the two friends in the group. &quot;I did say [to her] &apos;You must get bored having to take work calls all the time&apos;; she said she would rather keep on top of things.&quot; Keyworth told the court that the only thing that &quot;sticks out&quot; in his mind about conversations with the couple in Dubai was talking to Kemp about EastEnders, which the actor had just quit. He told how he had helped get Brooks and Kemp moved to a neighbouring hotel because he was friends with the marketing manager and that the former EastEnders star was &quot;very pleased&quot; because the hotel had Hermes toiletries. Reporter&apos;s story denial  A former News of the World reporter whose byline appeared on a 2002 Milly Dowler story that referred to her hacked voicemails has told a jury he did not write the article. Robert Kellaway said: &quot;My recollection is, I was never assigned to the Milly Dowler story, it wasn&apos;t a running story that I was part of.&quot; He added: &quot;As far as I am aware, the first time I saw this article was in the summer of 2011.&quot; Asked to explain how his name could have got on it, he said it could have been &quot;a simple production error&quot;. Another explanation was, he said, that journalists on the new defunct Sunday tabloid were judged by a &quot;key performance indicator&quot; based on the number of times their names were published in the paper. Sometimes when, through no fault of their own, a reporter&apos;s name had not appeared for some time, the &quot;news desk append your name to a story in order to keep your byline count up&quot;, he said. &quot;If that&apos;s what happened, it&apos;s slightly ironic that this might have been a professional favour that somebody has attempted to do,&quot; he said.", "title": "Milly Dowler case: job agency staff bombarded by NoW inquiries", "sentences": ["The Dubai holiday  Rebekah Brooks was on the telephone to the News of the World &quot;quite a lot&quot; during a holiday in Dubai taken at the height of the hunt for Milly Dowler and told a fellow holidaymaker that she liked to keep on top of things even on her days off, the jury also heard on Wednesday.", "Asked by the prosecution to tell the court about the conversations with Brooks in Dubai, Keyworth said: &quot;Rebekah was on the phone quite a lot back to the office so there wasn&apos;t actually that much of a conversation.&quot; He said he had found himself spending a few hours lounging around a pool with Brooks after Kemp had gone to play tennis with one of the two friends in the group.", "&quot;I did say [to her] &apos;You must get bored having to take work calls all the time&apos;; she said she would rather keep on top of things.&quot; Keyworth told the court that the only thing that &quot;sticks out&quot; in his mind about conversations with the couple in Dubai was talking to Kemp about EastEnders, which the actor had just quit."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-06T22:09:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/07/us-spooks-russia-china-internet-authoritarian", "tags": ["Internet", "Espionage", "US news", "Russia", "China", "Technology", "NSA", "World news"], "article": "No wonder Vladimir Putin and Xi Jinping are smiling: they are closer than they have ever been to mastering who is saying and doing what online. They and other authoritarian leaders are watching with glee as US intelligence agencies destroy what is left of the original utopian vision of a cyberspace free of government control. The process was under way long before Edward Snowden revealed the extent of surveillance by the US National Security Agency. But the allegations of mass monitoring of hitherto friendly political leaders, businesses and ordinary internet users around the world have stoked a backlash with worrying consequences. Slowly but surely governance of the internet is moving from the existing mishmash of institutions and into the hands of national governments. The Chinese call this &quot;cyber autonomy&quot;. Authoritarian regimes are showing ever-greater confidence in restricting information, filtering, blocking, monitoring and punishing anyone who steps over the mark. During a recent visit to Beijing \u2013 attending a seminar on new media at the Central Party School \u2013 I was given a remarkable insight into official thinking. The issue is one of the most sensitive in China, going to the heart of the party&apos;s hold on power. With up to 600 million netizens \u2013 spending hours every day on the micro-blogging site Weibo and the messaging service WeChat \u2013 is it still possible to control the message? The party believes it can. The exhortations were colourful: I was told that China needed to help people &quot;show responsibility and reasonableness&quot; and to &quot;harmonise the public and private persona, to minimise public confusion&quot;. After President Xi&apos;s call to &quot;seize the ground of new media&quot;, a law was introduced in September to punish &quot;wrongful rumours&quot; online. Content that is re-posted more than 500 times or viewed more than 5,000 times could land the author in jail for up to three years. A number of well-known bloggers have since been arrested. Reports say that China has an estimated 2 million &quot;internet opinion analysts&quot; tracking content. The boundaries for acceptable and unacceptable information are subjective. It may be patriotic to report on the corruption of certain officials; to cast aspersions on others could be a crime. Chillingly, I was told that the party is looking at an &quot;explicit protocol to provide for future discipline requirements&quot;. Given the penalties, harassment and deliberate vagueness of the boundary lines, it is remarkable that so many ordinary Chinese are as outspoken as they are. They have more to fear now than ever before. In Russia, alongside the violence meted out to journalists \u2013 making it one of the most dangerous places for investigative reporters to operate \u2013 new laws instigated under the guise of child protection allow the authorities to close down sites immediately and force the big service providers to block access. Other countries have imposed their own rules to promote &quot;responsibility&quot; and &quot;stability&quot;. In Singapore new licensing regulations require news websites with more than 50,000 unique visitors a month to pay a deposit then comply with takedown orders within 24 hours. The credibility of the US to proselytise about individual rights online is pretty much shot. Its attempts to preserve the existing system of internet governance have been similarly undermined. Until now, a number of organisations have shared responsibility: groups with an alphabet soup of acronyms, from Icann (Internet Corporation of Assigned Names and Numbers, a US-based not-for-profit organisation that assigns domains) to IGF (Internet Governance Forum, which brings together companies, civil society groups, governments and techies for an annual week of discussions on the future of the net). At the recent IGF in Indonesia the Chinese were, for the first time, out in force. One &quot;expert&quot; offered to explain to a US state department official why US human rights standards are not up to scratch and how China could help. Gatherings such as these are often cumbersome, but they have the benefit of being open to all voices \u2013 multi-stakeholder in geek jargon. All this could change. Moves are afoot to give a long- established but previously low-profile UN organisation \u2013 the International Telecommunications Union \u2013 jurisdiction over the web. The ITU is the preserve of governments alone. It is not just the Chinese and Russians who are keen on this change. India, Brazil and South Africa are among a number of emerging powers that want to prise control away from groups considered friendly to the US and towards the ITU. The most recent move, in Dubai last December, narrowly failed. Thanks to the NSA furore, it will be easier next time. Matters are likely to come to a head next April when Brazil holds a special conference focusing on securing user privacy from the prying eyes of US and other intelligence services. One idea being mooted is to require internet service providers to host data country by country, and thereby be answerable to local laws. On the one hand, this could be seen as an understandable and laudable fightback. But the Balkanisation of the net could also reinforce the control of nation states over global digital citizens. American dominance of the internet is being challenged on several fronts. The Obama administration and its spooks only have themselves to blame. It is just possible that recent events could usher in a new era of transparency and data protection. But don&apos;t bet on it. The direction of travel is more likely moving towards the authoritarians. As one Chinese interlocutor put it to me: &quot;We should cleanse negative information, which jeopardises good order.&quot;", "title": "US spooks play into the hands of Russia, China and others who want control over global digital citizens | John Kampfner", "sentences": ["The most recent move, in Dubai last December, narrowly failed."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-07T06:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/nov/07/media-briefing-thursday-7-november", "tags": ["Media"], "article": "Top eight stories on MediaGuardian     Twitter has said that it is pricing its Initial Public Offering of 70 million shares of its common stock at $26 per share.

Musharraf, who ruled the country for nine years before being forced out in 2008, had been held in his luxury mansion in the outskirts of Islamabad since April while his lawyers battled on several fronts. On Monday he was granted bail in a case where he is accused of being involved in the death of a radical cleric during an assault on an extremist mosque in the heart of Islamabad in 2007. The formalities required for his release from the &quot;sub jail&quot;, which included the payment of a bond worth $2,000, were finally completed on Thursday. It was a rare bit of good news for a man who once wielded immense power but who has suffered multiple humiliations since returning from self-exile to Pakistan in March. Not only did few people turn out to welcome him home on his return to a country he had vowed to &quot;save&quot; but he was also banned from standing in the country&apos;s general election. Musharraf&apos;s problems are far from over, however. A ban on the former army chief travelling outside the country remains in place. There has been persistent speculation that the government or the judiciary, which are both said to be under pressure from Pakistan&apos;s powerful military, will find a way to allow the 70-year-old to slip back into comfortable exile in his homes in London and Dubai. In recent weeks Musharraf has won bail in three other cases, including one where he is accused of being complicit in the killing of the former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007 and another where he is blamed for the death during a military operation of an important tribal leader from the restive province of Baluchistan in 2006. It is believed Musharraf can expect to successfully defend himself against charges many lawyers regard as weak or hard to prove. A far more significant problem is the government&apos;s promise to set up a special court to charge him for treason over his decision to suspend the constitution in 2007. Treason is a capital offence and lawyers say Musharraf will struggle to defend himself against the charge. The prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, whose second term in office was cut short by Musharraf&apos;s military coup in 1999, told parliament in June that Musharraf had to &quot;answer for all his deeds in court&quot;. Despite the bad blood between the two men \u2013 and the annoyance of many generals over the way Musharraf ignored warnings not to return to Pakistan \u2013 it is expected a way will be found to avoid a treason trial. Analysts say the army will not want to see precedents set for trials of retired generals. The retirement in December of Pakistan&apos;s activist chief justice, Iftikhar Chaudhry, may also help as Chaudhry led calls for the government to take action against Musharraf. The bail decision on Thursday prompted his jailers to leave Musharraf&apos;s &quot;farmhouse&quot; in the upmarket area of Chak Shahzad, where he had been confined in just a couple of rooms. Although the decision will free him to use all the house&apos;s amenities, including a swimming pool and jogging track, he is unlikely to rove far outside given the security threats against him.

The problem is, One World Trade Center may not be the tallest building in the Western Hemisphere. It might not even be the tallest building in America. The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat is meeting on Friday to rule over a squabble that has been building for some time. Ever since One World Trade Center reached its full height \u2013 when its 408ft steel spire was installed on 10 May\u00a0\u2013 there has been a growing lobby who have argued that Chicago&apos;s Willis Tower, formerly the Sears Tower, is actually the tallest. No one disputes that One World Trade Center, with its steel attachment, measures 1,776ft \u2013 a symbolic reference to the year of the US Declaration of Independence. The contention is over whether that steel attachment is an antenna or a spire. If the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat decides it is an antenna, then One World Trade Center will be reduced to a mere 1,368ft building \u2013 smaller than the 1,451ft Willis Tower. &quot;Most of the time these decisions are not so controversial,&quot; Daniel Safarik, an architect and spokesman for the council told the Associated Press. The 30 members of its \u201cheight committee\u201d are meeting in Chicago to decide One World Trade Center\u2019s fate and will announce their decision next week.     The view from the Willis Tower in Chicago. Photograph: Kiichiro Sato/AP    Under the council&apos;s current criteria, spires that are an integral part of a building&apos;s aesthetic design count; broadcast antennas that can be added and removed do not. One World Trade Center\u2019s steel attachment was to have been sheathed in decorative cladding, which would have made the structure an integral part of the building\u2019s design \u2013 ergo a spire. But the developer removed that exterior shell from the design due to issues over its upkeep. The Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat must now decide whether that renders it a mere antenna, reducing the height. Safarik told the Associated Press that the council could change its height criteria during the Friday meeting, which could mean a change of position for other tall buildings around the world. For its part, the Willis Tower defiantly refers to itself as the &quot;tallest building in America&quot; in its own publicity material,\u00a0thus far ignoring One World Trade Center&apos;s claims to the title. Whatever happens, its top floor, at 1,354ft, will always be higher than the One World Trade Center\u2019s 1,268 ft. &quot;The folks that run the Willis Tower have tremendous respect for what is being done in New York,&quot; said Bill Utter, a spokesman for the owners and managers of the building. &quot;But if you technically look at the standards that are in place today, Willis Tower remains the tallest building.&quot; The Willis overtook the old One World Trade Center in 1973 and was the tallest building in the world until Malaysia&apos;s\u00a0Petronas Twin Towers overtook it in 1998. Burj Khalifa in Dubai has been the tallest building in the world since 2010 and stands at 2,722ft to the tip of its spire. Utter said the Willis Tower would honour the Council\u2019s decision, even if it ruled that One World Trade Center was the tallest. \u201cMy guess is that Willis Tower will not fall from the sky. My guess is it will still remain standing. It is an amazing icon, a true landmark not only in Chicago and worldwide,\u201d he said. \u201cYou&apos;ll still be standing on the tallest occupied floor in a building in North America.\u201d", "title": "Willis Tower and One World Trade Center battle for skyscraper supremacy", "sentences": ["Burj Khalifa in Dubai has been the tallest building in the world since 2010 and stands at 2,722ft to the tip of its spire."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-08T17:56:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/09/said-and-done-awards-season", "tags": ["Wonga", "World Cup 2022", "Newcastle United", "Qatar", "Sepp Blatter", "Football", "Sport", "Football politics", "Finances", "Fifa"], "article": "Awards season: best newcomers Newcastle sponsors Wonga \u2013 accused on Tuesday of &quot;grooming children&quot; with cynical PR, but embraced on Thursday at the Football Business Awards.

It was a performance which answered few questions before more challenging targets this season, however, as Flemenstar gave the fences too much air and was then pushed out to beat Days Hotel by a length-and-a-quarter at odds of 1-4. Flemenstar finished second in a Beginners&apos; Chase on the same card two years ago, at the start of a novice season which concluded with victory in the Grade One Powers Gold Cup at Fairyhouse. He was also successful in the Fortria Chase 12 months ago and went on to win the Grade One John Durkan Memorial Chase on his next start, but failed to win again in three subsequent starts and was well beaten behind Sprinter Sacre at Aintree on his last outing of the campaign in April. In addition to leaving Casey&apos;s stable to join Martin, Flemenstar had also had a wind operation over the summer, but on Sunday&apos;s evidence, it is his jumping which will need to improve if he is to be a contender at this highest level again this season. &quot;We&apos;ll take our time with him [and] I&apos;ll have a chat with Andy [Lynch, Flemenstar&apos;s jockey], and Steve [Curran, his owner],&quot; Martin said. &quot;He&apos;s entered in everything but I&apos;ll give it two or three weeks to decide where next. &quot;I&apos;m still finding my feet with him really. I&apos;m happy that&apos;s out of the way. With good horses like that you are always nervous and he&apos;ll improve a bit fitness-wise. He was a bit extravagant, his jumping was a bit big. He let fly at a few down the back but I&apos;m hoping that was freshness.&quot; Martin completed a treble on the card as Dedigout took the Grade Two Lismullen Hurdle and Spacious Sky landed a handicap hurdle. Tony McCoy, who rode the 4,000th National Hunt winner of his career at Towcester last week, was cheered into the paddock before his ride on Minella Foru in the Grade Three For Auction Novice Hurdle and rewarded his supporters with a length-and-a-half success over Very Wood. &quot;It&apos;s all a bit embarrassing, to be honest,&quot; McCoy said afterwards. &quot;I&apos;m just trying to get on with my job now and I&apos;m trying to ride another 998 winners and then I can have another day. &quot;He&apos;s a smart horse but it was a messy race and turned into a bit of a sprint, the second is a smart horse too and it won&apos;t have suited him either.&quot; Minella Foru can be backed at 25-1 for the Supreme Novice Hurdle next March with Paddy Power and William Hill, while Dedigout, who holds an entry for the Hennessy Gold Cup, is 20-1 with Ladbrokes to win at Newbury on 30 November. Toronado and Olympic Glory, two of the big names in Richard Hannon&apos;s team for the 2014 Flat season, are possible runners on Dubai World Cup night at Meydan next March, Richard Hannon jun, the trainer&apos;s son and assistant, said on Sunday. &quot;It was a shame that things did not work out for Olympic Glory [in the Breeders&apos; Cup Mile] in California,&quot; Hannon said, &quot; but the ground was quicker than it was in Deauville, and with the leaders going off at such fast fractions he was not able to hang on to their coat-tails. &quot;However, Olympic Glory ran much better than his finishing position of ninth might suggest and either he or Toronado could go to Dubai on World Cup night.

It was not a difficult finale to ignore. The last afternoon at Doncaster was a gruelling slog on desperate ground and both the trainers&apos; and jockeys&apos; championships had long since been sewn up, by Richard Hannon \u2013 who may well pass on the licence to his son Richard Jr before the start of the new turf campaign in March 2014 \u2013 and Richard Hughes respectively. Overall, however, fears that the first post-Frankel season might turn out to be a little, well, flat were not realised. The Queen won the Gold Cup at Royal Ascot, the head-to-head between Dawn Approach and Toronado ran from the Guineas meeting via Ascot to Glorious Goodwood, while, having drawn a blank on Arc day, British stables won four races at the Breeders&apos; Cup in California and picked up second- and third-place money in the Melbourne Cup. Away from the track, the death of Sir Henry Cecil in June was a huge loss to the sport and one which was felt from top to bottom as racing put aside its disputes and divisions not just to mourn but also to recognise and celebrate Cecil&apos;s genius. Lady Cecil, his widow, saddled an emotional winner at the royal meeting less than a fortnight later and will continue to oversee Warren Place next season. And 2013 was also, of course, the year of the steroids, which was not a drama that anyone wanted to see but was an essential part of the narrative all the same. It seems difficult to believe now but it is less than eight months since I was sitting in a press conference at Meydan racecourse in Dubai, listening to Mahmood al-Zarooni talk through his hopes for World Cup night and the season ahead in his typically relaxed and engaging style. Who could have guessed that, several thousand miles away, he had already launched the huge \u2013 and supposedly almost single-handed \u2013 steroid-doping programme which would bring about his downfall a few weeks later? The many and various gaping holes in the official &quot;lone assassin&quot; theory of the Godolphin doping scandal have been a staple of this column ever since but there is no sign that any of these will be filled in any time soon, if ever. In PR terms, the British Horseracing Authority&apos;s eagerness to dispense lightning justice to Zarooni and then move on as quickly as possible seems to have worked, though I suspect that a story as complex as this one may still have a surprise or two to offer. Sungate was a different kind of scandal, which will finally conclude when Gerard Butler, who admitted in April that he had used the joint treatment which has the anabolic steroid stanozolol as its active ingredient, faces the BHA&apos;s disciplinary panel. Nine other trainers in the town, who were found to have used Sungate too, escaped without charge and with their anonymity intact, because there were no positive tests to offer as evidence. The BHA will act to close this gaping hole in its &quot;strict liability&quot; rule once the Butler hearing has finished but it is hard to escape the conclusion that some of the sport&apos;s biggest names were either too lax to ask what was being injected into their horses, or had their suspicions but adopted a &quot;don&apos;t-ask-don&apos;t-tell&quot; approach because Sungate got results and did not produce positive dope tests. There was better news towards the end of the campaign. A Levy deal has been struck for the next four years, while a \u00a32m investment in the all-weather programme will keep Flat fans interested through the winter months before a \u00a31m card at Lingfield on Good Friday 2014. Both Ruler Of The World, the Derby winner, and Magician, who took the Breeders&apos; Cup Turf, will remain in training as four-year-olds while Treve, the brilliant Arc winner, will be the middle-distance horse to beat in 2014, when Frankie Dettori will be back in her saddle for his new retaining owner, Sheikh Joaan al-Thani.

Before cantering to victory at the Tour Championship in Atlanta, claiming a US$11.44 (\u00a37.15m) bounty therein, Stenson complained about pain in this crucial area. Now, as he seeks to close out victory in the European Tour&apos;s Race to Dubai, in this week&apos;s DP World Tour Championship, and with Justin Rose leading those in hot pursuit, Stenson has again cited injury. The Swede has withdrawn from Tuesday&apos;s pro-am in a bid to ease pressure on the wrist. Rose aside, another eight players can mathematically topple Stenson by close of play on Sunday evening. &quot;I just need to give my wrist some rest,&quot; said Stenson. &quot;My preparation is going to be less than I would have liked but I&apos;ve played Jumeirah so many times, so hopefully I shouldn&apos;t have to be further behind due to that. &quot;Maybe I can do a light practice session on Wednesday and go. It&apos;s obviously going to affect my preparations but it&apos;s been like that for the last three weeks, so just do the best I can. Long term, I just hope I&apos;m not damaging anything that&apos;s going to take longer to get fixed later on. I don&apos;t see that should be a problem playing but my preparation is going to be affected.&quot; Should he ignore events in Atlanta, these words offer clear hope to an in-form Rose. The reality is that the US Open champion, Graeme McDowell and Ian Poulter have by far the most viable opportunities of wrestling the European Tour&apos;s end of season money list prize from Stenson&apos;s grasp, with $8m in total on offer in the prize pot. Stenson has enjoyed a wonderful year, in announcing his return to the upper echelons of world golf. Few would begrudge him a European money list title but none of his fellow players will hand him that honour. Rose&apos;s late-season form is worthy of particular credit. Having won the season&apos;s second major in such stirring form at Merion, it would have been perfectly natural for the Englishman to \u2013 even subconsciously \u2013 down tools. He suffered an immediate post-US Open lull on account of fatigue but his tie for third in last week&apos;s Turkish Open illustrated continued determination. When on a hot streak, Rose is a danger to any field in world golf. A year ago, Rose was pipped to the DP World Tour Championship by a remarkable closing stretch from Rory McIlroy. Rose himself had supplied brilliant drama, with a 72nd hole putt which was arguably the finest ever witnessed on the European Tour. &quot;It&apos;s nice to be able to control your own fate,&quot; said Rose. &quot;So if I go in and have a good week, win a golf tournament, which is obviously the aim any time you tee it up; but if I go ahead and do that, that&apos;s going to obviously be the exact scenario I&apos;m looking for. Fifth last week, tied for third this week, I like the way that&apos;s trending towards No1. All I wanted really was to go into Dubai with a chance and knowing it&apos;s in my own hands.&quot; Poulter offered contrasting emotions, amid upset that he did not win in Turkey. &quot;Disappointing&quot; and &quot;frustrating&quot; were just two of the words Poulter offered after finishing five shots adrift of Victor Dubuisson. &quot;I&apos;m in a good position. I guess when you can keep finishing top-five, it is good,&quot; Poulter added upon reflection. McDowell has enjoyed a mixture of success and failure during 2013.

A turbulent 2013 in tournament golf for McIlroy has been mirrored by events surrounding his split from the Horizon management company. The detail of that contract exit is the subject of a multimillion-pound legal case, which was first formally aired in a Dublin courtroom last month. A legal dispute between McIlroy and one of his former sponsors, Oakley, also remains unresolved. The Northern Irishman, who has slipped from No1 to No6 in the world over the last 12 months, once firmly asserted there had &quot;never been any distractions&quot; to his professional life. Speaking in Dubai, McIlroy finally confirmed that had not recently been the case. &quot;Definitely, there have been a few things that have impacted,&quot; he said. &quot;Obviously there have been a few different things to think about and different things occupy your head that really shouldn&apos;t. But, you know, it&apos;s just the way it is and the position that I am in. It&apos;s something that will be sorted out hopefully sooner rather than later.&quot; As and when that happens, McIlroy admitted there will be a huge sense of relief. &quot;Yes, for sure,&quot; he said. &quot;I have obviously got people to handle that sort of stuff for me and I only see a fraction of it, the stuff that I really want to see. &quot;So I have got people dealing with that. But it&apos;s something, as I said, that shouldn&apos;t be in my mind. It&apos;s something that I don&apos;t really think any athlete or anyone should ever go through. &quot;I have seen more lawyers offices and more lawyers this year than I care to see in my entire life. It&apos;s not something I ever want to go through again and I&apos;m making sure that I won&apos;t ever go through it again.&quot; McIlroy, thankfully, has not lost his refreshing honesty. The same was true at this year&apos;s Open Championship, where he alarmingly claimed to be feeling &quot;brain dead&quot; when on the golf course. &quot;There was no specific time when I hit a bad shot because I was thinking of this,&quot; McIlroy added. &quot;But as a golfer, you want your mind as clear as possible and it&apos;s obviously hard for that to happen when you have other things going on that, firstly, you don&apos;t want to happen and secondly you don&apos;t think should be happening. &quot;It has been a distraction. But as I said, I have only seen a fraction of it and I haven&apos;t had to deal with it as much as some of the guys around me. It&apos;s something that obviously I have not wanted to have in my life.&quot; McIlroy was similarly forthright when asked to compare this year to 2012, when a win here at the Earth Course endorsed his status as the world&apos;s leading player. &quot;It&apos;s funny, it&apos;s like polar opposites,&quot; explained the 24-year-old. &quot;I guess I learnt last year how to deal with the hype and deal with people building you up. This year I have had to deal with criticism. So it has been two opposite ends of the spectrum. &quot;I try to learn from everything that I do. Every year is a learning year. Every year for me is still a new experience. Last year was getting to world No1 and being the dominant player in the world for a while. This year, it has been having to handle criticism and scrutiny.&quot; Should McIlroy need advice, it seems likely he would turn again to Tiger Woods. Some may question whether Woods&apos;s influence on McIlroy could be entirely positive, given the much-publicised scandals of the 14-times major winner. McIlroy himself, though, clearly sees no issue. &quot;I think I learned a bit more about time management last year,&quot; said McIlroy. &quot;Last year was the first time where the demands on my time, I guess it actually got to me a little bit. I said that I had to remember what got me here in the first place; dedicating myself to my practice and working on my game. &quot;It&apos;s something that Tiger actually told me last year. He said you have , to remember what got you here in the first place and I think you guys [in the media] know, with Tiger it is &apos;no&apos; 99% of the time, which is a good thing. &quot; It&apos;s what he needs to do to be the player that he is and to have the career that he has had. If that works for him then that&apos;s great. I&apos;d say I&apos;m a little more forgiving with my time than that but there still needs to be a point where you say no, and look after yourself.&quot;", "title": "Rory McIlroy admits off-course 'distractions' have affected his game", "sentences": ["Speaking in Dubai, McIlroy finally confirmed that had not recently been the case."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-12T13:48:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/12/justin-rose-honorary-membership-european-tour", "tags": ["Justin Rose", "European Tour", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Justin Rose has been afforded honorary membership of the European Tour, after becoming the first Englishman in 43 years to win a US Open. George O&apos;Grady, the tour&apos;s chief executive, presented Rose with the award in Dubai on Tuesday. A similar honour was bestowed on Rory McIlroy a year ago. &quot;Justin joins a very illustrious band of major championship winners and others that have contributed hugely to the growth of the European Tour,&quot; said O&apos;Grady. In practical terms, Rose will save \u00a3150 per year as a membership fee. Rose could yet top off 2013 by being crowned as the winner of the European Tour&apos;s order of merit, the Race to Dubai. &quot;This really is an incredible honour,&quot; said Rose. &quot;And for a kid who started his [professional] career with 21 missed cuts, this means an awful lot really. &quot;The whole journey couldn&apos;t have been done without all the hard work of the European Tour. This is very, very surreal and unexpected.&quot; Rose&apos;s Race to Dubai prominence is less of a surprise. He has emerged as the strongest threat to Henrik Stenson, who is currently in first place, after cementing his major win at Merion with some consistently fine late season form. &quot;It&apos;s a big motivation,&quot; said Rose, who won the tour&apos;s order of merit in 2007. &quot;I feel like this is the modern era, now knowing it as the Race to Dubai. I won it as the order of merit so I would love to do it. &quot;I have never held this trophy, even though my name is on it. I would like to see if I am strong enough to pick up this new trophy. It is a big goal and a goal that presents itself as the season progresses. &quot;At the beginning of the year, you can dream of winning it but it really only becomes an option once you have played some good golf. Obviously at this time of year, everybody turns their attentions towards it and this is the last chance.&quot; Like Rose, Ian Poulter has a chance of toppling Stenson by the time the season closes on Sunday evening. Poulter conceded he has endured a &quot;disappointing year&quot; but added: &quot;I think if I can win this week and win the Race to Dubai, that would be a huge achievement for myself as a personal goal. &quot;That&apos;s something that every player wants to do. You want to win the order of merit. It would be another box ticked.&quot; Poulter is amongst those who have expressed concern about the severity of the European Tour&apos;s newly-introduced end of year schedule. As part of that, players must compete in at least two out of three playoff events preceding Dubai to be permitted a place in the 60-man field at the Earth Course. Ernie Els, Sergio Garc\u00eda and Charl Schwartzel will be notable absentees here with that prerequisite in mind. Poulter believes the demands placed on professionals will and should be altered for 2014. &quot;Obviously it has been awkward for a few guys,&quot; Poulter said. &quot;Scheduling is never easy. It&apos;s difficult sometimes to be able to play enough events everywhere to keep everybody happy. &quot;The rule was put in place. They may have got it slightly wrong.

He is casually dressed in a black T-shirt and jeans. As he walks to his black SUV, the crowd begins to chant his name. This is Prince Ali bin Al-Hussein, half-brother to the king of Jordan, the president of the Jordanian Football Association and a Fifa vice-president. So high are emotions running that many of the fans are crying. On the other side of the stadium, hundreds of fans have gathered, seemingly just to be near the national team as it undergoes its final training session before Wednesday&apos;s World Cup play-off first leg against Uruguay. Music thumps from speakers as vendors turn heads of corn on their griddles. There is excited chatter about Luis Su\u00e1rez and Edinson Cavani: there is a desire for Jordan to win, of course, but there is also simply a thrill that players of that stature are in Amman. Again and again children ask if it might be possible to arrange a photograph with them. Su\u00e1rez and Cavani had a central part in Jordanian football&apos;s previous biggest moment, playing against them at the Under-20 World Cup in Canada, Cavani scoring the only goal. &quot;In Jordan&apos;s football history this is the biggest match we have had,&quot; said Prince Ali. &quot;That is a reality. We are on the verge of qualifying for the World Cup. There&apos;s been a lot of hard work from players and officials and coaches to get here. Remember, Jordan is a country that has very limited resources but at the same time with the spirit and hard work we managed to get here.&quot; The spirit, perhaps, is the most remarkable aspect. Jordanian football has traditionally been divided between Wihdat and Faisaly, who, broadly speaking, represent the ethnic Palestinian and Jordanian communities in Amman. Their rivalry is fierce and derbies have often ended in violence \u2013 so bad on one occasion that, Wikileaks revealed, the US ambassador had cabled the state department to warn of the tension \u2013 but for now all that has been put to one side: a number of fans outside the ground refused even to say which of the two they supported. For Prince Ali, the issue is particularly significant; his mother, Alia, King Hussein&apos;s third wife, was Palestinian. &quot;I think they are rivals on the pitch but to be honest that rivalry has helped us because there&apos;s so much emotion behind it,&quot; he said. &quot;Because we don&apos;t have the financial means it is the emotion that has got us to that level. When our players are on national team duty, they are all united, they are all one. I&apos;d like to emphasise one point: our players all come from very different backgrounds across the country. The reason they are playing is that they love the sport.&quot; Prince Ali is reluctant to hail the national side as an emblem of a spirit of unity but acknowledges that its success has eased tensions. &quot;I don&apos;t think there&apos;s anything political,&quot; he said. &quot;Our clubs right now all realise and support each other we are one family and that&apos;s a reality so I am not concerned at all.&quot; It&apos;s a view echoed by Jordan&apos;s coach, the great former Egypt striker Hossam Hassan. &quot;About Faisaly and Wihdat, there is no problem there,&quot; he said. &quot;It&apos;s like in Spain with Barcelona and Real Madrid, there&apos;s a rivalry, but now we are all in the national team. We are all Arabs together under Allah.&quot; There is a sense that this is not just about Jordan but about the region as a whole, with Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid of Dubai providing a private plane to take the Jordan side to Montevideo for the second leg. &quot;It is big especially for Jordanian and Arab football,&quot; Hassan said. &quot;We are very ambitious and we know that Uruguay are a real team and very difficult to overcome. But we will make the Jordanian dreams come true and take our chance and give our all by fighting on the pitch.&quot; There is a wider question than getting to Brazil, which is whether this qualifying campaign signals a broader upturn in Jordanian football. Prince Ali acknowledges that in part this is a lucky generation, but also points out the work that has been done in improving coaching at youth level. &quot;Many of the players on this team played in the 2007 World Cup in Canada,&quot; he said. &quot;They were products of youth centres across the world. This includes the boys and girls. The focus is on the boys today, but the girls have become the first team anywhere from West Asia to qualify for the Asia finals. Five teams will qualify for the World Cup so I hope the girls can follow the boys.&quot; After Jordan&apos;s training session, the prince addressed his players, who gathered round him squatting on the running track, overlooked by three huge portraits: one of the late King Hussein, one of the present king, Abdullah, and one of his son, the crown prince, the latter two both wearing football shirts, bearing the number 99 that was special to Hussein. There is something hugely symbolic about the scene, three generations of the royal family staring down as another royal encouraged the team that carries the hopes of the nation. The JFA headquarters was besieged by fans begging for tickets, many left in tears when it was announced the 25,000-capacity stadium had sold out. On the black market tickets were selling for 50 Jordanian dinars, which equates to \u00a350, although for the majority of Jordanians that would represent almost a week&apos;s wages. There will be 500 there supporting Uruguay, almost all of whom have travelled from Europe. Uruguay manager \u00d3scar Washington Tab\u00e1rez has spent most of the time since his side beat Argentina last month warning fans that Jordan are not to be taken lightly. &quot;If Jordan gives everything they have as the home team, they will make it hard for us, and I&apos;m not being pessimistic or cautious,&quot; he said. &quot;They don&apos;t have any elite football players, but to make a match tough, that&apos;s not necessary. They&apos;re very strong physically, they&apos;re back and forth, they have a very direct style of play, but when they throw the ball forward, don&apos;t look at how they play, but how all the team goes forward and get within 10 metres of the play. They have the speed to recover and get as many as eight players into the box.&quot; Tab\u00e1rez seems to expect Jordan, rather than surging forwards on a wave of enthusiasm and trying to overwhelm Uruguay in what is certain to be a raucous atmosphere, to sit deep and look to frustrate their opponents. Tab\u00e1rez has spoken of the need to play fluently and to move the ball quickly; for all he spoke about &quot;putting up the umbrella&quot; he appears to expect the game to be played largely in his opponents half. To that end, Nicol\u00e1s Lodeiro rather than Walter Gargano has been used in training alongside Egidio Ar\u00e9valo R\u00edos at the back of midfield, with Christian Stuani and Cristian Rodr\u00edguez wide and Su\u00e1rez and Cavani up front, creating more of a 4-1-3-2 shape than the 4-4-2 used in the 3-2 victory over Argentina last month. There is one obvious absentee, Diego Forl\u00e1n, at 34, now seemingly confined to the role of impact substitute. Southampton&apos;s Gast\u00f3n Ram\u00edrez was also used repeatedly in a central role, indicating perhaps that he is an option from the bench should Uruguay need additional creativity. Su\u00e1rez pulled up during training on Monday and finished the session with a strapping on his thigh but, while there seems to be no major issue, the incident can only have heightened Tab\u00e1rez&apos;s frustration that he played for Liverpool and Cavani for Paris Saint-Germain in league games on Saturday. &quot;The players had to report five days before the game, so we cannot say much, but we thought things might be different,&quot; he said. &quot;The players are part of this situation and are influenced by the team that pays their salary. In this, it&apos;s not a perfect situation but you cannot say they have violated the rules. There was no negotiation: nine turned up and we had to put up with it.&quot; Jordan have personnel issues of their own. They will be without the goalkeeper Amer Shafi, the hero against Uzbekistan, who is suspended after being booked for time-wasting in that play-off victory, while the experienced midfielder Amer Deeb was omitted from the squad having collected a booking that will rule him out of the first leg. There are also injury concerns over the defenders Mohammad Al-Dmeiri and Anas Bani Yaseen. &quot;I have no doubt the match against Jordan will be difficult,&quot; said Tab\u00e1rez. &quot;We&apos;ve studied our opponents and whoever thinks Jordan is Tahiti, that&apos;s their problem.&quot; Uruguay beat Tahiti 8-0 at the Confederations Cup in June and, while Jordan are clearly rather better than the Oceanian champions, they did lose 6-0 to Japan and 4-0 to Australia in qualifying. Uruguay have the stars and they have the pedigree, but Jordan have hope and spirit and a sense of destiny. &quot;The crowd has been a huge part of Jordan&apos;s success,&quot; said Hassan. &quot;We are going to win the match tomorrow [Wednesday] in front of the Jordanian crowd.&quot;", "title": "Jordan await the visit of Luis Su\u00e1rez and Uruguay in World Cup play-off | Jonathan Wilson", "sentences": ["We are all Arabs together under Allah.&quot; There is a sense that this is not just about Jordan but about the region as a whole, with Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid of Dubai providing a private plane to take the Jordan side to Montevideo for the second leg."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-13T09:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/13/rory-mcilroy-dubai-graeme-mcdowell", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Graeme McDowell", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "By his own admission, Rory McIlroy has had far more to occupy his mind this year than his closeness to Graeme McDowell. Still, an apparent cooling of the relationship between these close friends, highlighted by McIlroy&apos;s non-appearance at McDowell&apos;s wedding, was not a happy scenario. McIlroy had taken exception to the public comments of McDowell about his messy split from the Horizon management group. When McIlroy and McDowell partnered each other at the BMW Masters in China last month, all indications were that the pair were on strong terms again. McIlroy even explained afterwards that McDowell&apos;s wife had done some interior design work on the 24-year-old&apos;s Florida home. Speaking before the DP Tour World Championship in Dubai, McDowell offered both support and praise towards McIlroy as he looks to emerge from the on-course slump during 2013 which has been so determined by off-course matters. &quot;If Rory won this week, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised,&quot; McDowell said. &quot;I obviously played with him in the first round in China and his game looks back to its best. This is a golf course he knows how to get around so I certainly wouldn&apos;t be surprised to see him on the leaderboard. &quot;What does this course demand? If you can drive the ball exceedingly well, which has always been a staple of Rory&apos;s game, you can really set yourself up to attack these greens which are hidden away from you. &quot;And just feeling comfortable at a venue always helps. I have talked about my general discomfort on this golf course over the last four or five years. I can only assume that Rory McIlroy is pretty comfortable, having won around here in style last year. &quot;He&apos;s the kind of player that, when he is on, he can win anywhere but this is a course he is comfortable around. I think he has the tools to get the job done. &quot;It is difficult to comment on anything else, really, because I haven&apos;t seen enough of him lately to know what he needs to change, really, or where his head is at. He has had a lot of distractions off the golf course this year as we all know but his game certainly looks to be back to its best.&quot;           McDowell remains a Horizon client, which of course makes it tricky for the 2010 US Open winner to speak expansively on McIlroy&apos;s situation. Even when he did previously, to be fair to McDowell, he was only responding to questions rather than volunteering opinion. The case between McIlroy and his former management group is subject to a high-profile, and highly valuable, legal case. Yet McDowell knows McIlroy better than anybody else on tour, and understands the value of a calm golfing head. &quot;I think when you have a balance in your life, certainly off the course, that really frees up the mind and body to perform on the golf course,&quot; McDowell added. &quot;I know that when I have my ducks in a row off the golf course, I&apos;m a much happier man on it. &quot;Rory is a young man, he&apos;s a very talented young man. We all go through learning curves and we all experience things that throw us outside of our comfort zone. &quot;I can&apos;t really relate to what he has experienced this year. He&apos;s certainly in a different echelon to where I have ever been in my career; the way he burst on to No1 in the world, two-time major champion and all of the things he has accomplished these last couple of years. &quot;So it&apos;s difficult to relate to all that he has experienced but I can only assume that he is getting comfortable in his new skin as a global superstar and we shouldn&apos;t take that lightly. It&apos;s a big ask. &quot;He has certainly still got the talent and, like I said, I wouldn&apos;t be surprised to see him winning this week.&quot;", "title": "Rory McIlroy has the tools to defend Dubai title, says Graeme McDowell", "sentences": ["Speaking before the DP Tour World Championship in Dubai, McDowell offered both support and praise towards McIlroy as he looks to emerge from the on-course slump during 2013 which has been so determined by off-course matters."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-13T12:56:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/13/henrik-stenson-ian-poulter-race-dubai", "tags": ["Ian Poulter", "Sport", "Golf", "Henrik Stenson"], "article": "Henrik Stenson&apos;s FedEx Cup victory ensured money will not be a problem for him any time soon, but there remains the potential for embarrassment in front of a fellow player. Stenson struck up a friendly bet with Ian Poulter which will come back to haunt him if the Englishman prevails at this week&apos;s DP Tour World Championship and, therefore, overhauls the Swede to win the Race to Dubai. With Poulter seemingly out of the order of merit race, Stenson had agreed he would act as a drinks waiter for the pair on a night out, if, and only if, Poulter beats him to the Race to Dubai title. &quot;That&apos;s probably my biggest motivation, not to become his servant for a day,&quot; said Stenson with a smile. &quot;He is certainly not going off that bet and I know he is up my tail. &quot;The No1 focus is to win the Race to Dubai. I guess the second would be to win this tournament and the third would be to make sure Ian Poulter is behind me. We&apos;ll have to see if that priority changes at some point but, as of now, that&apos;s the way I look at it. I know if I tick the other ones, that will take care of itself.&quot; The bet is unsurprising given the charismatic nature of the two men involved, and it also offers an insight into the kind of left-field motivation which can occasionally inspire Poulter. He was approximately 960,000 points behind Stenson in the Race to Dubai chase when the bet was struck; with one tournament to go, he is within 345,000 and keen to end his wait for a 2013 victory at what would be an opportune moment. &quot;I fancy my chances,&quot; said the Englishman. Stenson&apos;s preparations for the Dubai event have been curtailed by a wrist problem which, while not thought to be any case for undue worry, will inevitably lead to a dedicated rest spell in the not-too-distant future. &quot;It needs treatment and it needs some work, some strengthening and so on,&quot; Stenson said. &quot;I guess it is always going to be a weak point for golfers. I&apos;m a pretty big and a pretty strong guy; the wrists are going to take a beating. &quot;I think I just ended up in a bad cycle after a long season, I started getting a problem and there is not any time to take off so I just kept going. It&apos;s not a major worry at this point, in terms of what is showing up on the MRI scans.&quot; Regardless of events in Dubai, the consensus among European Tour players is clear: Stenson should be its player of the year. &quot;Henrik has basically done what Rory McIlroy was doing last year,&quot; Poulter said.           Stenson&apos;s FedEx success, and the $10m that came with it, rounded off a superb run which had actually started after the frustration of a second-placed finish in July&apos;s Scottish Open. &quot;When I look back at the summer, at that great period, the Scottish Open was the only one that really I felt I should have won,&quot; Stenson said. &quot;I had a two-shot lead going into the last day, had my chances and didn&apos;t take them. That was one I let slip.&quot; The FedEx finale at East Lake in Atlanta was a different story and Stenson surged to victory despite his pre-tournament injury concerns. &quot;I will always bring that with me, that achievement I had there, in terms of how I played against such a strong field and the way I did it,&quot; he said. &quot;The important thing was I had such a big lead. I came back a little bit and some of the other guys made a charge, but I handled it on Sunday; with the pressure, with everybody coming after me I just hung in there. &quot;So those are the ones that you would always keep in the back of your mind. You know you can do it, even when things don&apos;t feel the best.

Within hours, the Home Office was announcing that a joint taskforce of police, Border Agency officials and MI5 officers had been ordered to track him down. According to some reports, undercover soldiers were also drafted in. One newspaper declared that Mohamed had &quot;made a mockery&quot; of the government&apos;s claim to protect the public, while another offered a reward for information leading to his capture: &quot;\u00a325k to Find the Burka Bunker&quot;. Behind the headlines about the manhunt, however, lies another story. It is one that is a little less dramatic. But in the eyes of some, it is a story that is far more disturbing. Mohamed was in Britain against his\u00a0will: he had been forced aboard an aircraft in Somaliland, the breakaway territory in northern Somalia, and flown to the UK in March 2011 in an operation that his lawyers say amounted to little more than an act of rendition. He and a\u00a0second man had been detained in Somaliland two months earlier and allegedly suffered severe mistreatment while they were being interrogated. Since then, evidence has emerged that the British government had a hand in their detention, and may have supplied many of the questions. As a consequence, the coalition government is now facing, for the first time, serious allegations of complicity in rendition and torture. The men&apos;s accusations, if true, would appear to flatly contradict the assurances given by the heads of the three main intelligence agencies when they stepped out of the shadows for the first time last week, telling the intelligence and security committee they have learned a great deal since 9/11, and that &quot;at this stage&quot; their officers could not possibly become complicit in torture. However, the public may never learn whether the allegations are true or not: when Mohamed and the second man decided to sue the British government for damages, lawyers representing the intelligence agencies called upon the secret justice provisions of the highly controversial Justice and Security Act. It is the first time that the government has resorted to these provisions since the act became law earlier this year. As\u00a0a consequence of this move, any evidence that the government itself possesses that supports the allegations is unlikely ever to see the light of day. Instead, any such evidence will be heard by the court in secret, and part of\u00a0the court&apos;s final judgment will also remain concealed. Mohamed, 27, and the second man, a 25-year-old, are both British citizens of Somali descent. MI5 is satisfied that both are terrorists who are deeply involved with al-Shabaab, the group that carried out the attack on Nairobi&apos;s Westgate shopping mall in September. While the two men deny this allegation, Mohamed is assessed to be linked\u00a0to a group said to have received terrorism training from Saleh Nabhan, a leading al-Qaida figure suspected of involvement in the 1998 US embassy bombings in east Africa. He is also said to have received terrorism training and to have fought for al-Shabaab, and is accused of helping other British men slip into and out of Somalia, where his wife and two children live. The second man can be identified only as CF since becoming subject to a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure (TPIM) notice, introduced to replace control orders. He travelled to Somalia in 2009, where he too is said to have received training and fought alongside al-Shabaab. When Mohamed went on the run, Theresa May, the home secretary, said he did not pose &quot;a direct threat&quot; to the public. Nevertheless, MI5&apos;s anxieties about young British Muslims travelling to Somalia were made public in a speech given by the agency&apos;s then director general, Jonathan Evans, in September 2010. &quot;I am concerned,&quot; he said, &quot;that it is only a matter of time before we see terrorism on our streets inspired by those who are today fighting alongside al-Shabaab.&quot; It appears that, in January 2011, CF wished to return to the UK via Addis Ababa, and asked Mohamed to help him\u00a0travel across Somaliland and on to the Ethiopian border. On the night of 14 January, while staying in a house in\u00a0the town of Burao, the pair heard a helicopter hovering overhead. Moments later, a group of armed and uniformed men burst through the front door, forced hoods over their heads and tied their hands tight behind their backs. CF claims he could hear the leader giving orders in English, with a British accent. At one point, the hoods were said to have been lifted briefly so that their faces could be checked against what appeared to be mugshots. Both men say they were fingerprinted and that DNA swabs were taken from inside their cheeks; CF says &quot;Bravo 1&quot; was written across his forehead. Over the next few days, the two men allege, they faced mock executions and severe beatings, and were then held in brightly lit cells at a prison in Somaliland. CF claims he was kept naked for a period, and was once half-strangled with a piece of cloth. When a UK Foreign Office consular official visited CF a month after his detention, he recorded that marks, apparently from handcuffs, were visible on CF&apos;s wrists. Both men also say they were interrogated repeatedly, and that they believe the questions were based on information that can only have been supplied by the British authorities. Meanwhile, the local media reported that their capture was the result of a joint operation by British and Somaliland intelligence officers. On 13 March, the two men were taken from the prison to an airport, where they were forced aboard a flight to Dubai. Mohamed says he begged to be returned instead to Somalia, to be reunited with his family. In Dubai, they were put aboard another flight, to London, and guarded en route. Neither man was aware of any formal deportation process. The British government says the deportation was lawful under Somaliland law; the men&apos;s lawyers complain that they had, in effect, been rendered.

Photograph: AFP    Since their forced return to the UK, evidence that the government was closely involved in the detention operation in Somaliland has seeped steadily into the public domain. First it became\u00a0apparent that May had signed Mohamed&apos;s control order on 13 January 2011, the day before the pair were arrested. Then it became clear that in March that year, two days before the pair were taken from prison and forced aboard an aircraft, MI5 had sent an email to police at Heathrow giving precise details of the flight upon which the men would be arriving at the airport. The agency said it wanted Mohamed to be held and questioned under Schedule 7 of the Terrorism Act 2000 \u2013 the same measure that was used to detain David Miranda, the partner of former Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald. MI5 had 118 questions it wanted to be put to\u00a0Mohamed. The email asked police to make a full\u00a0record of any complaints he made about his treatment in Somaliland, but warned officers: &quot;We would be grateful if you would NOT be drawn into any discussion with MOHAMED regarding HMG [Her Majesty&apos;s Government] involvement in his arrest.&quot; The email also showed that the agency was anticipating the possibility of being sued for damages over the affair: &quot;You should be aware that any such write up is likely to be disclosable in any future civil proceedings.&quot; After five hours of questioning at Heathrow, Mohamed was told he had been made the subject of a control order, and was compelled to go and live\u00a0in the east of England \u2013 in a town where he knew nobody and where MI5 believed he would be far removed from his jihadist associates. Later that year, the high court ruled that the police at Heathrow had abused their powers when they detained Mohamed. Schedule 7 permitted them to detain and question him only in order to help establish whether or not he was a terrorist: but the home secretary had determined that he was a terrorist two months earlier, when she signed his control order. The purpose of holding Mohamed at the airport, despite the police not having the lawful power to do so, appears to have been in order to ask MI5&apos;s 118 questions. Mohamed says these were essentially the same questions that had already been put to him while he was being beaten and threatened with death in a jail in Somaliland. His solicitor, Gareth Peirce, is highly critical of what she says was an attempt to clean up information that had previously been extracted under torture: &quot;Schedule 7 was unlawfully deployed, and extended far beyond any legitimate legislative purpose to launder &apos;intelligence&apos; obtained, equally unlawfully, from torture in Somaliland.&quot; While ruling that there had been improper use of Schedule 7 powers, the judge commented: &quot;It was clear that the Security Service, for entirely understandable reasons, was anxious if possible to get information which could not be regarded as tainted by torture allegations or which might confirm the propriety of a control order.&quot; In July last year, at the high court, while Mohamed was challenging his control order, the court heard that, a few weeks before the two men had been detained and forcibly removed to the UK, the Crown Prosecution Service had advised Scotland Yard there was insufficient admissible evidence to charge Mohamed with any terrorist offence. An MI5 officer gave evidence at that hearing, and Mohamed&apos;s counsel, Tim Otty QC, asked him a series of questions. Had the agency been involved in Mohamed&apos;s detention in Somaliland? Did it accept that such an operation had no basis in law? Would MI5 acknowledge that it had &quot;participated actively&quot; in Mohamed&apos;s interrogation despite knowing he had suffered serious physical mistreatment? Had the agency been involved in his removal from Somaliland to the UK? Was it aware that CF had been beaten and subjected to a mock execution after his arrest? To each of these questions, the MI5 witness gave the same reply: &quot;I can neither confirm nor deny that.&quot;     An Noor Masjid and Community Centre in Acton, London, from where Mohamed slipped away in a burqa. Photograph: Amer Ghazzal/Demotix/Corbis    Before the 2010 general election, a\u00a0number of politicians who are now cabinet ministers quietly let it be known that they were horrified at the way in\u00a0which the country&apos;s intelligence agencies had become involved in rendition and the mistreatment of terrorism suspects after 9/11, and that they were greatly concerned there appeared to have been ministerial approval. Within two months of the formation of the coalition, David Cameron signalled a change of direction when he announced that there would be an inquiry, and that the hitherto-secret policy that governed MI5 and MI6 &quot;detainee operations&quot; would be rewritten and made public. Some sounded a note of caution. Sir\u00a0John Sawer, the head of MI6, for example, pointed out in an unprecedented public speech that the agencies could not afford the luxury of working only with friendly democracies. &quot;Dangerous threats usually come from dangerous people in dangerous places,&quot; he said. &quot;We have to deal with the world as it is.&quot; But across much of Whitehall the sense of relief was almost palpable. Three years on and the inquiry has been shelved amid a behind-the-scenes dispute about control of the evidence that was to be made public. An interim report from the inquiry has been sitting on the prime minister&apos;s desk for\u00a0almost 18 months, despite a government pledge that as much as possible would be published. Four separate police investigations grind slowly on. The intelligence agencies \u2013 and government ministers \u2013 are once again facing what Otty described in the high court last week as &quot;core allegations of very grave misconduct&quot;. The Foreign Office and Home Office both told the Guardian that they were unable to comment on the allegations that the government now faces, precisely because of the ongoing proceedings in the civil courts. Government lawyers are indicating that they may attempt to\u00a0have Mohamed&apos;s case struck out, on the grounds that it would be wrong for the courts to entertain such a claim while he is in breach of an order of the\u00a0court by being on the run. Almost two weeks after Mohamed disappeared, there remains no sign of\u00a0him. That still leaves CF&apos;s damages claim against the government. However, CF&apos;s solicitor, Ravi Naik, fears that the use of the secret justice measures of the Justice and Security Act will result in an odour of suspicion for ever lingering around the affair. &quot;Our client could fail or succeed in his case without ever knowing why,&quot; Naik says. &quot;This much is clear from the fact that the government has sought to put its entire defence into secret sessions. &quot;In those circumstances, our client \u2013 and the public \u2013 will for ever be kept in\u00a0the dark about whether the British government was involved in serious\u00a0wrongdoing.&quot;", "title": "The real question about the terror suspect who fled in a burqa: did MI5 bring him here illegally?", "sentences": ["On 13 March, the two men were taken from the prison to an airport, where they were forced aboard a flight to Dubai.", "In Dubai, they were put aboard another flight, to London, and guarded en route."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-13T18:40:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2013/nov/14/tv-highlights-day-kennedy-died", "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "article": "European Tour Golf: The World Tour Championship8am, Sky Sports 4 Day one of the final tournament of the European tour season, which takes place at Jumeirah Golf Estates in Dubai.

Today we&apos;re discussing the economics of climate change. We all want to save the environment, but how are we going to pay for it? A packed audience is gathered here at the ODI&apos;s headquarters in London to challenge our esteemed panel. We have John Vidal, he&apos;s the environment editor at the Guardian. Tom Mitchell is the head of climate change at the ODI. Amal-Lee Amin is an associate director of E3G, a not-for-profit organisation promoting sustainable development. And completing our line-up is climate-change specialist Monica Araya from Costa Rica; she&apos;s an independent adviser with much to say on low-emissions development and the politics of climate change. Can I ask you to welcome our panel? Well, you may well be asking why is this debate happening now. In a week the UN hosts the next round of climate change talks, this time in Warsaw. It&apos;s called COP19; yes we&apos;ve had 18 rounds already. And very much on the agenda is how to pay for our greener future. So, what can be expected from these talks? And how is the world responding, or not responding, to climate change? Who has actually put their money where their mouth is to fund efforts to mitigate our carbon footprint? Where is that money going? And what, in particular, are the challenges facing developing countries? Lots of questions there, big questions too, and a finite amount of time. But before we start I&apos;d like to get a quick show of hands here in this room. Can I ask you how many of you agree that COP19 can make a lasting impact on the problems of climate change? Can I have a show of hands, don&apos;t be shy. The rooms aren&apos;t good. I can tell you for those who aren&apos;t in the room, that that was not a very impressive show of hands; a smattering, if that. And we may come back to you once we&apos;ve heard from our panel and see if you are of the same view. Let&apos;s move quickly to our first question, and it&apos;s from Tom Levitt, who is the managing editor of China Dialogue. Tom&apos;s question was: do China and India now firmly belong in the climate-debt camp, along with the US and Europe? And what does this mean for the negotiations? Let me start with you, Tom Mitchell. TM Well, about a month ago we heard from the IPCC, the Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change, that told us that we have a finite carbon budget; that the atmosphere has a limit and if we want to stay within 2C, a limit that often people talk about as dangerous climate change, then we&apos;ve got to stay within that budget. So that budget is about 1,000bn tonnes of carbon dioxide \u2013 of which we&apos;ve probably used up already about 520bn tonnes. Now the point is that then there&apos;s this budget left, and what are we going to do with it. Really, Warsaw is in some ways about the discussion; about that budget. People for a long time have said that we&apos;ve got to recognise that in the past some countries have emitted a lot more than others; certainly, the US and the European Union countries have emitted a lot more than others \u2013 but China and India are fast catching up in terms of total emissions. But the way I&apos;d like to look at it is actually per capita, per head how much are we emitting. And certainly in the US, Australia, Canada and Europe it&apos;s well above eight, nine tonnes per capita. Whereas in China it&apos;s much less; and in India it&apos;s an even smaller number. And with China, I&apos;d say how much of that emissions is actually ours in terms of how much we import from them. I think what we know, though, is if we&apos;re going to stay within this carbon budget we&apos;ve actually got to reduce it down to something like less than one tonne per capita \u2013 which means we all need to become a country like the Philippines or Nicaragua, and we need to do that almost tomorrow. And I think that&apos;s where the challenge is; which means that almost every country has a carbon debt. And that&apos;s the way we need to approach the discussions. HM Thank you. Amal-Lee, what&apos;s your take on this? Do China and India now firmly belong in the climate-debt camp? China is very resistant to that idea, isn&apos;t it? ALA Yes. I tend not to think of it as climate debt, but to try to think of it more in a positive framing and the role of leadership; which China is clearly taking in many respects on the domestic front. It&apos;s not only developing a lot of the renewable energy technologies that are now coming down in cost, but also we&apos;ve just heard about the new regulation on coal-fired generation. So that is a very significant step we&apos;re seeing from China from a domestic point of view, which I think is primarily driven for a range of reasons \u2013 not only climate but also linked to their social and economic development within China. I also like to think of China and India as quite separate. India has much, much greater development needs; huge poverty with, I think, around 800 million people living on less than $2 a day. And so, I do think India&apos;s needs and the way it responds to climate is necessarily very different and needs to focus very much on strengthening resilience to the impacts of climate change. HM Let me remind those who are watching online that we are taking your questions as well. Just hit the chat button at the bottom of the player and we&apos;ll try to read out as many of your questions as we can. We have this one from Catherine Russner: creating world-performing effective country systems within developing countries can be a long process. At the same time, the effects of environmental degradation and climate change already threaten the population in some countries. So, we might cause irreparable damage if we stick to the business as usual. How can we balance these two elements? Monica? MA From where I sit \u2013 and that means a middle-income economy that is growing and that is coming to terms with the fact that we have to solve our own problems \u2013 what I see is that the whole narrative around emissions is not getting to the public. What I mean is that there seems to be a lot of indifference about the whole conversation of emissions in this global problem that the average voter cannot really grasp. At the same time, there is a lot of nervousness and frustration when you confront people with the fact that we are becoming very vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. So what I am seeing in Costa Rica is an opportunity to reverse the order of the message to the public, because at the end of the day politicians will react to the public if there is a strong demand. And I see an opportunity in the context of transport, and I see an opportunity in the context of agriculture. A lot of the discussions in Europe and the US start with energy systems or carbon markets, ETS [emissions trading scheme]. I don&apos;t think that is where the conversation really gets the attraction politically with voters in middle-income economies because there is this enthusiasm that we are growing and that people want to consume. I&apos;m not saying that&apos;s good or bad; I&apos;m just saying that&apos;s happening. But if you turn this into not so much a technical conversation but a political one, you will see a different reaction when the political process says we will build transport systems that deliver quality of development, quality of life, quality of growth; and they will see the benefits in their daily life in a way that you don&apos;t get from green energy. And the same applies to agriculture. Right now, the most active sector I would argue in many ways in Costa Rica is agriculture because they are becoming aware of their vulnerability. So my point is that if you start from impacts, it&apos;s easier to then get into emissions. And thus far we&apos;ve done it the other way around, and I don&apos;t think that&apos;s working. So I do see an opening. HM John Vidal, there&apos;s a big job of persuasion to be done, isn&apos;t there, because the transition can be very difficult. Let&apos;s talk about the issue of energy subsidies, because we know there were riots in Nigeria when the government tried to take those subsidies away and oil prices rocketed. How can they win that argument? How can you take people with you as you make that transition? JV I have to say the issue of subsidies is absolutely fascinating. The ODI, our hosts here, have just come up with a fantastic report and it really lays bare the scale of what&apos;s going on not just in rich countries \u2013 Britain were subsidising fossil fuels by \u00a34.2bn a year in 2011, maybe it&apos;s more now, but in developing countries as well. Every country has long subsidised its fossil fuels because of very powerful interests, commercial interests and others, and they are stopping a debate happening about this. The speed at which this has to happen, the speed of the transition which has to take place if we are to keep below 2C \u2013 which is kind of a notional thing, but it&apos;s still a lot \u2013 is absolutely enormous. And we&apos;re not really getting anywhere near it at the moment. I have to say something. People think 2C is not very much. What 2C actually is, is overall, that&apos;s for the whole, whole lot, and that includes the oceans as well. Because the oceans heat up much more slowly, a 2C rise \u2013 which is what we&apos;re well in line for \u2013 would mean a 4C or 5C rise on most of the land masses in the world. And this would be absolutely terrifying in terms of food production and everything else. So, let&apos;s get it right: 2C is the absolute limit which we really can possibly ever go to. And we are not getting anywhere near that at the speed required. And there is no political will; it is as simple as that. So somehow civil society perhaps is not giving the legitimacy to governments to change things, to do things. And we are just failing: our businesses are failing, our institutions are failing. We saw an enormous rise before the 2009 COP, before the climate talks then, and we will see it again in a couple of years&apos; time. But in the meantime, the whole thing has been put on ice and there is no political will there, I fear, at the moment. HM OK, so we&apos;ve had a look at some of the problems. Let&apos;s talk about some of the solutions and how well we&apos;re meeting that challenge. Many papers come out of the ODI and, Tom, I think you&apos;ve been involved in a new paper released this week. Tell us a bit about that. TM Well, we&apos;ve been working hard over the last few months at the ODI to release three flagship papers, all of which are around this issue. The first, a couple of weeks ago, was on the impacts of climate change on the poorest, saying that we can expect by 2030 for there still to be many millions, tens of millions, hundreds of millions of poor people living in the areas most exposed to climate change-related disasters. And so this climate change poses a fundamental challenge to our task of eradicating extreme poverty. That&apos;s one. The second one released today is our report on fossil fuel subsidies, that I&apos;ll come back to. And then next week we release a set of reports looking at climate finance: what&apos;s been happening, where it&apos;s been spent, and where it can go in the future. HM You&apos;ve been very busy, and it&apos;s all well-timed. TM Yes. And on subsidies, some of the key messages: first, we&apos;re subsidising fossil fuel productions globally to the tune of about $500bn. Even if we just look at the biggest rich-country emitters, for every tonne of carbon released we&apos;re subsidising that tonne of carbon by $7. And if we look currently at the price of carbon under the EU emissions trading scheme it&apos;s about $7. So, the point is, we&apos;re letting the carbon price collapse; we&apos;re subsidising high-carbon fuels, so we&apos;re effectively shooting ourselves in both feet if we want to tackle climate change. And so, what we&apos;re saying is and what we&apos;re actually calling for is for the G20, that has already committed to phase out damaging fossil fuels, to get on with it. They&apos;ve not set a clear deadline for that and they&apos;ve not set a clear plan. The G20 should get on and do this, and other countries should follow \u2013 all by 2025, if we&apos;ve got a cat in hell&apos;s chance of meeting that carbon budget target. HM Right, so just get on with it. I&apos;m sure you phrased it a lot more elegantly than that; but the message is very clear. Let&apos;s involve our audience now because I understand there is question from an audience member called Desir\u00e9e. MF The first question I have is about the fifth low carbon economy index that PwC released. At the moment, we have a rate of decarbonisation for the G20 of 0.7%, according to the analysis. And they say that globally we would have to invest 6% of GDP to really be within the carbon budget. So, they are recommending investing in nuclear, energy efficiency and renewables \u2013 but where do forestry and agriculture fit into this picture? HM Thank you very much. John Vidal, I think that has your name on it. JV Forestry was brought into these talks much later than some of the other issues, because people realised only quite recently that land use is a huge percentage of emissions, up to 15%-17% of emissions do come from it. The forests of the world are in a complete mess, how they&apos;re organised and whatever. So there is a very good reason to link carbon markets with forestry. The awful reality, as far as I can see, is that carbon markets are just probably not going to work. They are a lovely idea, but frankly there is not much evidence that they will. And also the social and human implications of imposing carbon markets on the world forests really haven&apos;t been looked at in great detail yet. But all the evidence from the NGOs certainly and people I&apos;ve been talking to in Indonesia and Latin America is that they are unlikely to work, and it&apos;s actually going to make things messier. So, I think forestry is a really fascinating issue but I fear we are going to be landed with something which we may regret if we go too far down that carbon-pricing market in forestry certainly. HM Thank you. And we will be taking more questions from the audience and also online. Amal-Lee, you&apos;ve worked in government and are obviously very experienced in the field. What is it you see? Where is best practice, where do you look and say that&apos;s the sort of thing we need to see more of? ALA I think other good practice in the region in Latin America we&apos;ve seen is the case of Mexico recent. A couple of years ago, some legislation that was passed that I think represents very good practice in terms of setting the governance arrangements that have withstood a change of election. I think in many countries, including in this country, we see that once the political parties change, the momentum may shift and either move in a different direction or stall altogether. So countries like Mexico, I think, are leading the way in terms of demonstrating the importance of a certain and long timeframe for an investment framework, which Tom referred to earlier on. So I think certainly in Latin America there is a lot of good practice. I&apos;d like to just quickly pick up on the last point and also very quickly the point on fossil subsidies. I think in terms of forests it is about ensuring sustainable development, sustainable livelihoods, and also ensuring that governments that do have those forests where there is logging that is managed in a way that benefits that economy. A lot of the deforestation we see is either illegal logging; is a slash and burn to produce products to grow agricultural products on that land that actually may not have a very high value. And I think issues around WTO rules actually could be a big part of the solution there in terms of encouraging those governments to export a table as opposed to logs. So I think it is a very complex picture. In terms of fossil fuel subsidies, I also think it&apos;s an excellent piece of work that ODI have produced; a very important and timely contribution to the debate. For me, I think it&apos;s all about creating viable alternatives, particularly for the poorest communities. So, even though fossil fuel subsidies are often held up as a way of providing benefits to the poor, in reality the poorest communities are paying very high wages, bills, amounts of their wages towards use of fossil fuels \u2013 whether it&apos;s kerosene lamps, diesel, etc. And it&apos;s providing alternatives, more efficient solutions to their energy consumption, which needs to be promoted alongside reform of fossil fuel subsidies. So I think taking that kind of approach can help reduce some of the political objections to removal of fossil fuel subsidies. HM Thanks very much. Monica, you have a broad view; where do you see best practice? MA I&apos;ve seen an opening in the last three years because up until 2008-09 there was a very concentrated focus on the role of carbon pricing and market mechanisms. And in Latin America that idea took over. What I see now, especially after the financial crisis, is that it is politically acceptable to talk a lot about planning. And I do think that in terms of risk management there is no way we can deal with that unless we have a longer planning horizon. And the opportunity I see is that by talking about risks and long-term planning you get the discussion outside the limited bubble that sometimes we create when we only look at environment or ministries of environment or environmental policy experts. And then you start getting into conversations with engineers, with economists. Some of them are longer-term thinkers, they care about development; you get into conversations about fiscal policy and new ways of taxing bands. Where I want to land the idea is that I see openings whenever the discussion lands in ministries that deal with very specific sectors. Again, agriculture is one where I see a lot of synergies because you have the discussion of protecting a sector, the linkages to food, the linkages to water. And because these ministries deal with the business communities directly, then the conversation is different from the one you get when you only involve the ministry of environment that only deals with climate policy in numbers and foreign aid. HM Let me take a question that has come to us online, because I&apos;m told that there are people watching us in Costa Rica and in Mali \u2013 so we have to be on our best behaviour. We have a question from Penny Ramsden. She asks: what does the panel think about maximising economic development through renewables? John Vidal? JV Well, yes is the answer. I think we&apos;re just sort of crazy what we&apos;re doing: we&apos;re just going down a fossil fuel route and we know exactly where it&apos;s going to end up, which is maximum disaster for everyone. So renewables, there are lots of things wrong \u2013 they&apos;re not necessarily efficient and the wind doesn&apos;t blow exactly when corporations want them to or whatever, but the point is that they are the future. And most of the investment in energy last year and the year before and the year before, most of the energy in the world was low-carbon investment. Solar is taking off absolutely everywhere. I was in Dubai last week, Dubai is probably the least sustainable economy in the world, it&apos;s unimaginably awful. But \u2026 HM But someone&apos;s got to go, I know. JV And I won&apos;t tell you about the hotel I stayed in! No it was seriously impressive that some part of that government has got the idea that they cannot go on like this. Okay, there&apos;s a screeching handbrake U-turn, perhaps maybe nothing happens; but they are going to invest tens of billions, really hundreds of billions over the next 10 years in solar. That is the only way they can go. They know that. I think most of the Arab states, certainly the Emirates, are going in the same direction. So renewables are taking off. We in Britain are ideally set up for some sorts but not for others. But most of the world will benefit enormously from renewables over the next 20, 30 years inevitably. That is fantastic news. And new technologies are screaming in and it&apos;s really, really exciting the renewable thing. But it doesn&apos;t get much play from governments because they are locked into very old fossil fuel thinking dominated by very small elites of corporates and others. HM Amal-Lee, maximising economic developments through renewables; is that the way forward? ALA Absolutely, I believe it is. I think that when you look at countries that have really developed their renewable sector, Germany in particular, there has been a very clear legal renewable energy framework that has incentivised investments, that has led to and attracted manufacturers of the technologies, which has created jobs and income within Germany. I think when you look at a country like the UK, I think as Tom said earlier, the policy framework here has been really fits and starts over the last 20 years or so. We&apos;ve really not been able to benefit as a result from the economic benefits that could come with the technologies. I think offshore wind in particular; the UK had an opportunity to become the world leader in that technology, which would inevitably involve the creation of an economic base for producing the technology here exporting that. It remains to be seen, and in fact with recent developments in the constant sort of almost ongoing review of the electricity market incentives, it looks unlikely that the UK will benefit from those jobs and economic benefits that it could have done had it taken perhaps a more strategic approach towards attracting that and ensuring that the policy framework supported that. HM OK, Amal-Lee, thank you very much. The clock is against us as ever. Let&apos;s throw forward to next week and what will happen in Warsaw. I&apos;m sure a lot of things will happen in Warsaw, some of which we should probably not speak about. But the conference, COP19, Tom are you thinking about it and thinking this could be in future years what we&apos;ll look back at and think: that was when it all changed that was a defining time? TM I hope so. HM You don&apos;t seem sure. TM Warsaw is a really important point in keeping us on track towards getting a global agreement in 2015. So what we&apos;ve got to look to Warsaw to do is to signal the right level of ambition. And I pick out three particular areas in this regard: The first is I think on climate finance. We need to get very clear signals from the rich country emitters that they are prepared to step up and put the right kind of resources in to dealing with the problem; one that gives confidence to the other parties that a deal can actually be struck. And that is an important part of the glue here. HM They will say that though because they always say that. TM They always say that; but at some point before 2015 that money has got to come on to the table. I think the second aspect is there needs to be much more discussion about how countries are going to bring forward their national commitments for greenhouse gas emissions reductions. Whether that&apos;s going to be voluntarily brought to the table or somebody is going to be brought kicking and screaming to the table, it remains to be seen but Warsaw will be a key test of that. And then the third area is something called loss and damage. And it refers back to what John Vidal said around this 2C thing. Actually, the reality is now that poor people around the world are already facing the impacts of climate change, and they are seeing these kinds of losses and damages as a result and they want to know who is going to help them. And so the loss and damage dimension of the discussion in Warsaw is really important to signal to those poor people about what kinds of help they&apos;re likely to receive. And for now, we haven&apos;t got a clear proposal on that we hope that emerges from Warsaw. HM We hope for many things from Warsaw, and I&apos;m sure that will unfold. Let&apos;s go back to the audience because we have a question here from P Severatnan, and a very good question it is too, very important. Do participants at international summits, on their return home, discuss the issues with their governments and civil society groups and try to take practical steps? Is that ever evaluated? Monica? MA No. The simple answer is no, and that is a reason for concern. I do believe that this is the time where delegations from all countries have to be held accountable when they go back home; either because of the things sometimes they killed in the negotiations or because of the things they don&apos;t support or the things they do support. And I do think that there is a generational shift in a lot of our countries whereby people demand questions, and if you don&apos;t answer you get in trouble; whereas before, especially in Latin America, you ask the question and then you get in trouble for asking. And that shift is very important, not only because of climate delegations \u2013 at the end of the day, people in ministries of environment or ministries of foreign affairs are not the real bad guys \u2013 let&apos;s just put it that way. But I do believe that to the extent that the positions that ministries defend in the negotiations become more transparent, I do think that some of the inflexibility that you see sometimes would be harder to sustain. But in the bigger scheme of things, I do think that the important exercise has to happen before the delegations go to the COP; because you could come back and say this is what you did. You inform, but you already did it. Whereas in the ideal world I would like to see something like this at home, where the minister is sitting. And if there are people listening in Costa Rica, write down these ideas. Because, basically, you would have the minister and the lead negotiators, and then you would have the NGOs and even people from the business sector listening to the position that the country will take to the negotiations. That is what I believe we should do. HM I can see my colleague John Vidal champing at the bit to get in here, presumably to explain how all of the fine words that we hear at these conferences come to nothing thereafter. JV The problem, actually, is you don&apos;t know what the fine words are because most of the meetings in these COPs \u2013 these huge, huge conferences \u2013 are secret. You never hear. You don&apos;t have access to them, there&apos;s no reportage. It is almost impossible to find out exactly what is going on. If anyone ever tells you at a COP that is or that is happening they&apos;re wrong. Nobody knows, it is done in a complete miasma of secrecy and corridor stuff, and bits get let out here and there and wherever. It&apos;s a shambles frankly. The UN, the way it organises these things is something out of the 18th century almost. The diplomats are not accountable, the delegations keep themselves to themselves, nobody talks to each other, journalists basically are spoon-fed stuff by their governments. And so there is very, very little real understanding of the scale of what&apos;s happening or the importance of what is happening. So I think a big part of the problem, actually, is the meetings themselves. HM There&apos;s a frustrated man. He takes the Guardian ear trumpet and he still can&apos;t hear what they&apos;re saying in the meetings. JV But we do like getting leaks. So if there are any governments out there who want to have something specific to say, just make sure that it&apos;s got our name on it. Thank you very much. HM Amal-Lee, very quickly, you&apos;ve worked in government, how do these things fall off the edge as it were? ALA I think we shouldn&apos;t forget that the UNFCCC [UN framework convention on climate change], the convention is about creating international law and an international legal framework. That doesn&apos;t happen quickly, for very good reasons. Climate change is at the heart of economic and social development, and so it is quite natural that it is a very challenging, very complex, very difficult negotiating process. I personally feel that the UN convention has a very important role to play. I think what we&apos;re seeing, fortunately, is that its role will be to codify and to create, build rules and norms around existing actions that are already happening at the country level. And I think, fortunately, that is the case because it isn&apos;t going to lead action at the moment. But it is incredibly important to create greater transparency around those actions and comparability of actions so that there is a sense of fairness in the process, and that countries feel that they are prepared to increase their level of ambition because they see that their neighbours or competitors are also doing so. But I certainly acknowledge it&apos;s quite an opaque process as a negotiation. But I think, for very good reasons, it requires a very considerable diplomatic effort that we are hopefully going to see building up to the Paris climate conference in 2015. HM Thank you very much for that. Let&apos;s have another question from the floor, and this time it is from Catriona Moss. MF With the legally binding climate agreement unlikely until 2020, where does that lead countries pushing ahead with reduced emissions from deforestation and degradation programmes? HM Tom? TM I think it leaves them in a good position \u2013 they&apos;ve done a good thing. The key here is that countries should not be waiting for the international process to catch up with their national actions. Now I think there were certainly a lot of promises made about the climate finance that would flow to support countries and their actions, and that needs to be delivered. But we should really be signalling that these kinds of actions need to happen irrespective; whether it&apos;s on gas flaring, whether it&apos;s on black carbon and charcoal emissions, whether it&apos;s on getting on and installing solar capacity. I was listening last week to the governor of the Bank of Bangladesh, and they have installed solar panels in a million homes already. They are installing at a rate of 1,000 a day. And they are dealing with the impacts of climate change. Countries need to get on with it \u2013 and that&apos;s what we&apos;re seeing, and I think that&apos;s what gives us a degree of optimism here. HM Optimism is good; let&apos;s end with some optimism. I did say that we might see if you&apos;d changed your view about the upcoming Warsaw meeting, whether or not you were more optimistic \u2013 so let&apos;s just quickly do that. Who now thinks that Warsaw can have a lasting impact on the problem of climate change? Maybe one more. No I don&apos;t think there has been a great shift there, but we&apos;ll have to wait and see. We&apos;ll all be optimistic, as they say. That&apos;s all we have time for on this edition of the Global development podcast.

This compelling end to the European Tour season sees Stenson in pole position to become the first player in history to claim both the Race to Dubai title and the FedEx Cup in the same year. Yet with Ian Poulter and Justin Rose already breathing down the Swede&apos;s neck another new challenger, Jamie Donaldson, has emerged from the shadows. This race now has a fourth horse. Donaldson started 2013 with a win in Abu Dhabi; it would be folly to rule out another Emirate success for a player who has recovered startlingly well from career-threatening back problems. Albeit he is unwilling to admit it, there is the added benefit for Donaldson of no wider expectation. Before a ball was struck in anger in Dubai, discussion surrounded whether Rose, Poulter or Graeme McDowell was best placed to topple Stenson. That might just have proved an oversight. Were Donaldson to win here \u2013 and he lies just two shots off the lead after round one \u2013 then Stenson would need to finish second to secure the European order of merit. Stenson is tied with Donaldson at four under, two shots adrift of the leader, the Spaniard Alejandro Ca\u00f1izares. &quot;That is still three rounds away,&quot; said Donaldson of the prospect of winning the Race to Dubai. &quot;I can only take it one day at a time; I cannot change what anybody else does.&quot; When prompted on the subject of a charge towards the European Ryder Cup team for Gleneagles next summer, Donaldson was similarly non-committal. Thankfully, his golf is considerably more aggressive. Stenson played excellent golf until the 18th hole, where he missed a tiny putt for par. Earlier, glimpses of the nerveless touch which saw him march towards that FedEx Cup success in Atlanta in September had been apparent. &quot;You can&apos;t win tournaments on a Thursday but you can certainly play your way out of them,&quot; Stenson said. &quot;I&apos;m happy with the way I&apos;m playing and I would have taken four under.&quot; Rose reached three under par after 14 holes but dropped back to minus two with a bogey on 17. A glorious second shot to the par-five 14th almost found the hole for an albatross, which would have represented quite a statement of intent. If Poulter is to be believed, a seriously low score is in the pipeline. Albeit that will be tricky for anybody here, given the extremely fast, grainy greens which can make a mockery of even the finest putters. &quot;I&apos;m annoyed,&quot; Poulter said after his 69. &quot;I holed two putts outside what I would class as birdie chances and the rest was about missed putts. Every putt I had was on a slope, downhill, right to left or left to right. They were tricky to read and very quick; misses would go five foot past. &quot;I am frustrated but happy to be only three behind. I am playing as good as I have ever played, I am as confident as I have ever been and I am swinging it as well as ever.&quot; McDowell endured a disastrous opening to Thursday, which saw him slip to three over after 13. The 2010 US Open winner displayed his typically strong spirit thereafter, three birdies in a row ensuring a 72 and a considerably better night&apos;s sleep than would otherwise have been the case. More attention surrounded the female tennis star who walked 18 holes with Rory McIlroy than the form of the Northern Irishman himself. McIlroy was under par within seven holes but stumbled thereafter, carding a 71 which he branded &quot;disappointing.&quot; McIlroy added: &quot;I guess it is one of those cases of how to turn a 67 into a 71.&quot; Not even the appearance of Caroline Wozniacki could boost McIlroy&apos;s score. The latest set of rumours surrounding the supposed break-up of the pair arose last month, since when McIlroy has publicly hailed Wozniacki&apos;s win at the Luxembourg Open and, now, the Dane has taken on a watching brief in Dubai. Far from their relationship being back on, perhaps it was never really off. &quot;She started her pre-season a couple of days ago and was on court this morning at seven o&apos;clock,&quot; McIlroy explained. &quot;So she got some practice in before coming to see me. It&apos;s good to have her here.&quot; Lee Westwood is within touching distance of the lead at two under.

The UAE, which is hosting the show, is deciding whether to buy the Eurofighter and Dassault Systems Rafale aircraft. The Rafale deal was said to be the most likely last year, but visits to the Gulf state by UK prime minister David Cameron and concerns about the terms put things back up in the air. BAE shares are currently 5.2p lower at 449p, and JP Morgan Cazenove has repeated its underweight recommendation. The bank said:  In July this year BAE told investors that at the Dubai air show it hopes to be able to announce progress in securing a contract from the UAE for 60 Eurofighters and also unmanned aerial vehicles. We [have] argued that a UAE contract for Eurofighters and associated equipment would be worth around 45p per share for BAE, and that this was already discounted in the current price.   The bank laid out five possibilities for next week:  Scenario 1 (worst case) \u2013 contract awarded to a rival: Some French defence industry executives believe they still have a chance to secure the UAE fighter jet contract. We believe BAE is still the front runner but we cannot rule out the French or US being successful, though probably not at Dubai next week.  Scenario 2 \u2013 no announcements at all from the UAE regarding the procurement of fighter jets.  Scenario 3 \u2013 holding pattern: In November 2012 the UAE and UK governments released a statement saying they will &quot;establish a defence industrial partnership that involves close collaboration around Typhoon.&quot; This was rightly seen as a positive development for the Eurofighter consortium, although there is no guarantee of a contract being secured. If the only outcome from Dubai next week is another statement along these lines, it would not be negative but probably a little disappointing.  Scenario 4 \u2013 a formal government to government deal between the UK and the UAE: This would a good outcome for BAE, we believe, as it would be a definite stepping stone to a final contract. In December 2005 the UK finalised such a deal with Saudi Arabia. BAE issued an RNS which said that &quot;the Governments of Saudi Arabia and the UK have signed an Understanding Document, which is intended to establish a greater partnership in modernising the Saudi Arabian Armed Forces and developing close service-to-service contacts especially through joint training and exercises.&quot; We see a similar UAE-UK announcement as quite possible at Dubai.  Scenario 5 (best case) \u2013 an actual contract for 60 Eurofighters: This is less likely than scenario 4, in our view, but not impossible. We would not expect the deliveries to be before 2018 but BAE could benefit from a near- term prepayment on the contract.

Initial announcements about China&apos;s much anticipated ten year economic plan proved a disappointment, lacking much detail on how the country&apos;s targets were to be achieved. Given China is a key consumer of commodities, this was unhelpful for mining shares. But more information emerged on Friday, along with a whole raft of reforms, and revived interest in the sector. David Madden, market analyst at IG said:  Beijing showed some signs that the old regime is changing slowly but surely, by announcing yesterday that foreign banks will be allowed to open in the country, putting a dent in the state-run banking monopoly. Mineral extractors are now the best performing stocks in London as traders feel the reforms will boost China&apos;s manufacturing.  So Fresnillo rose 26.5p to 941.5p, Anglo American added 19.5p to \u00a314.30 and Rio Tinto rose 24.5p to 3253.5p. There were a couple of notable exceptions. Vedanta Resources dropped 68.5p to 955.5p after it reported a 14% fall in half year earnings to $2.21bn, hit by weak metal and oil prices. Finnish nickel miner Talvivaara slumped 43% to 3.51p after it failed to raise additional funds from its investors, which include the state investment fund. The miner has suffered from falling prices and a number of production problems, and said it would seek a court-supervised restructuring of its debts. Without this, it risked going bankrupt. Analyst Yuen Low at Shore Capital said:  The end is nigh! Talvivaara is to apply for corporate reorganisation as it has become evident that &quot;additional liquidity would not be available&quot; for a voluntary restructuring &quot;due to timing and other constraints&quot; of a stake holder group (i.e. they didn&apos;t want to pour yet more good money after bad). The corporate reorganisation is nonetheless subject to availability of sufficient funding\u2026 and failure of this would result in the company filing for bankruptcy.  In our opinion, this is one haemorrhaging dog that should be put out of its misery sooner rather than later.  In a week dominated once more by the outlook for interest rates and quantitative easing, the FTSE 100 finished at 6693.44, up 27.31 points on the day but down 15 points since the start of trading on Monday. There was a host of economic data and policy statements during the week for the market to digest. In the UK, better than expected inflation and jobs data, along with comments from Bank of England governor Mark Carney, suggested that interest rates might rise by early 2015, earlier than the market had been expected. As a result, leading shares suffered their biggest one day fall since mid-August on Wednesday, before regaining some ground. There was talk the US could start winding down its $85bn a month bond buying programme before the end of the year - again, ahead of expectations - after remarks from various Federal Reserve members. But those fears were eased by Thursday&apos;s testimony before the senate by Janet Yellen, President Obama&apos;s choice to replace Ben Bernanke as chair of the Fed. So US markets continued their seemingly unstoppable charge to yet new peaks. Conversely, over in Europe, the European Central Bank was busy hinting it might sanction buying bank bonds or even negative interest rates to try and revive the flagging eurozone economy, as inflation and GDP growth both came in lower than forecast. Elsewhere it was a bad week for UK jobs. Blockbuster and Barratt went into administration, giving 3,000 employees an uncertain future, while Barclays, down 0.55p to 249.45p, announced 1,700 redundancies at its branches. Outsourcing group Serco, currently being investigated over alleged fraud on UK government contracts, issued a profits warning on Thursday and said 400 jobs would go. The news sent its shares plunging by 17% and they slipped another 0.5p to 418.6p on Friday as analysts issued negative notes. Deutsche Bank cut its price target from 630p to 440p, saying:  On the back of the profit warning, we are reducing our 2013 and 2014 earnings per share forecasts by 11% and 14% to 38.9p and 35.6p, respectively. Our 2014 operating profit of \u00a3267.8m compares to management&apos;s guidance that 2014 operating profit would be modestly below 2013 levels, which we estimate will be around \u00a3300m. We think there is much uncertainty due to re-bid risk, volume risk on a number of contracts including [Australia&apos;s] Department of Immigration and Citizenship and an ongoing UK government audit and review. Given the lack of full visibility, we remain at hold.   Cantor Fitzgerald analysts Caroline de La Soujeole and Sam Thomas said:  Despite [Thursday&apos;s] sharp share price fall we see scope for further downside and do not subscribe to the view that the worst is over. We therefore retain our sell recommendation but reduce our target price to 380p from 450p.  Whilst we do not believe that Serco will be frozen out of UK government outsourcing there is a significant risk that the company will be left in the cold for some time beyond the conclusion of the various government reviews into its public sector contracts, some of which are due this month (Cabinet Office, Ministry of Justice). There is also a Serious Fraud Office investigation to contend with which is unlikely to be concluded this year in our view. Therefore, 2014 is likely to be a lean year in terms of UK government contract awards. 2015 is unlikely to see much improvement given it is an election year when public sector contract awards typically slow. Therefore around half of Serco&apos;s revenue base will, at best, be flat for the next two years, in our view.  Supermarkets were under pressure, with Tesco suffering downgrades from HSBC and Goldman Sachs on worries about future UK growth. Asda&apos;s \u00a31bn price cutting initiative also hit its rivals. Tesco fell 1.65p to 354.5p, J Sainsbury slipped 5.6p to 409p but Morrisons edged up 1.1p to 267.3p. BSkyB was hit by news that rival BT had snapped up the next round of Champions League rights. The satellite broadcaster closed up 1p at 819.5p on Friday, but down 110.5p on the week. BAE Systems slipped 5.2p to 449p ahead of next week&apos;s Dubai air show, when it hopes to hear news on a proposed \u00a36bn Eurofighter deal with the United Arab Emirates. The UAE, which is hosting the show, is deciding whether to buy the Eurofighter and Dassault Systems Rafale aircraft. The Rafale deal was said to be the most likely last year, but visits to the Gulf state by UK prime minister David Cameron and concerns about the terms put things back up in the air. An upbeat trading statement from International Airlines Group provided investors with an excuse to take profits after recent gains. A week after reporting more than doubled third quarter profits, the owner of British Airways and Iberia raised its 2015 operating profit target by 12.5% to \u20ac1.8bn. Analysts had been expecting around \u20ac1.6bn. It attributed the better than expected forecast - issued ahead of an investor day - to good growth from BA and the group&apos;s Spanish budget airline Vueling, which it took over earlier this year, as well as a recovery at Iberia. But the group&apos;s shares fell 10.8p to 362.2p as investors cashed in recent gains. British Gas owner Centrica was down another 2p to 343.3p after Thursday&apos;s profit warning, as a number of analysts cut their price targets. Credit Suisse said:  Centrica trades on 12.7 times 2014 PE, which we think is expensive versus gas and oil stocks on around 10.3 times, and also versus the two UK regulated energy utilities (SSE and National Grid) on around 12.4 times and 13.5 times respectively.  Citigroup said:  There are many reasons to be positive on Centrica, including its under levered balance sheet, strong cash flow generation and sensible corporate strategy. However, the current political risks and earnings profile overshadow these positives in the near-term. We remain Neutral while we await the outcome of the Autumn Statement and lower our target price to 360p from 390p to reflect estimate downgrades.  Among the mid-caps, Ultra Electronics lost 80p to \u00a318.16 after warning on sales. The company, whose products include safety devices in aircraft, nuclear controls and submarine sonars, said it was facing &quot;a number of headwinds.&quot; In particular, the recent US government shutdown has led to delays in orders, approvals and payments. In Oman, its contract has seen further setbacks, with the installation phase pushed back from the fourth quarter of this year until next year. As a result, Ultra said 2013 revenues would be slightly below last year&apos;s figure. Heading in the other direction was animal genetics company Genus, up 49p at \u00a312.97 after an upbeat trading statement. Charles Hall at Peel Hunt said:  We expect Genus to see stronger growth in the second half. The company is forecasting full year profit growth of mid-high single digits in constant currency having been flat year to date. Furthermore, the acquisition of Genetiporc will start to contribute next year as the synergies are delivered. The rating now looks attractive given the prospect of stronger growth.

Irish golf has earned global recognition thanks to the major championship success of McIlroy, Graeme McDowell and, earlier, Padraig Harrington. McIlroy is by far Ireland&apos;s most illustrious golfing son. &quot;I have spoken to Ted Bishop [the PGA of America&apos;s president] and spoken to Pete Bevacqua [the chief executive] about this,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;They approached me about it a few months ago. I would be all for it. They said it is obviously quite a long way down the road, maybe 10 years or so. But I would love to be able to play a major championship at home. That would be nice.&quot; Portrush last hosted a major, the Open, in 1951. The Royal &amp; Ancient has touted the possibility of that tournament&apos;s return to the Northern Irish links without ever appearing to be fully convinced by the option. The 2012 Irish Open was held at the course in the north of Antrim and deemed a roaring success, but this summer saw further social unrest in Northern Ireland, a matter that cannot and will not be ignored. McIlroy clarified that Irish venues in general had been the topic of his discussion with the PGA officials, rather than specifically Portrush. &quot;They are very forward-thinking,&quot; he said. &quot;They want to think outside of the box and that is what they are doing. &quot;The US Open, the Open Championship and the Masters can&apos;t really go elsewhere but they are thinking of moving the PGA Championship around a little bit. I think it is a great thing for the growth of the game globally. &quot;I think Ted has always liked Ireland as a venue. Having the Irish Open at Portrush had a huge impact. Everyone saw how well it was supported. So if they had five years or 10 years to prepare for it, it could be massive.&quot; Earlier Bishop, speaking in the United States, said: &quot;Royal Portrush would be a great first international major. I think given the powerful effect that Irish golfers have on the professional game today, that might be a good place to start.&quot; There was further, unsurprising support for the plan from McDowell. The 2010 US Open winner counts the neighbouring Rathmore course as his home club. &quot;I heard that the US PGA Championship was looking to go global, which I think is a very positive step forward,&quot; he said. &quot;I think to have three major championships in America, with the global nature of the game nowadays, is a little too heavy-weighted. I think the US PGA Championship going global is great for the game of golf. &quot;Royal Portrush \u2013 it has always been a dream of mine to play the Open Championship there. The PGA would do nicely. &quot;It&apos;s a very bizarre, a very amazing statement [from Bishop]. I was expecting it to be Asia. I wasn&apos;t expecting it to be the north coast of Ireland. But exciting, exciting times. If it never comes to fruition, it is still a great boost for everyone in that area just to be mentioned in that breath.&quot; More immediate matters concern McIlroy playing himself into contention at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai thanks to a Friday 67. Michael Carrick, Manchester United&apos;sinjured midfielder, joined Caroline Wozniacki in the gallery following McIlroy. Yet the world No6 and the rest will have to go some to prevent the European Tour&apos;s season finale from turning into a procession by Henrik Stenson. The Swede did not drop a single shot on day two, moving to 12-under par with a superb 64. He leads Alejandro Ca\u00f1izares by one and is now within touching distance of the European Tour&apos;s order of merit. &quot;I have had two good days,&quot; said Stenson. &quot;I hope I can deliver another two.&quot; With that Race to Dubai prize in mind, Justin Rose is the best placed to usurp the Swede. He signed for a second-round 67, which leaves him seven-under. Ian Poulter has tied Rose&apos;s aggregate score, while there was a more promising day for Luke Donald, who had 66 for a five-under halfway total.", "title": "US PGA could be at Northern Ireland's Royal Portrush, McIlroy reveals", "sentences": ["If it never comes to fruition, it is still a great boost for everyone in that area just to be mentioned in that breath.&quot; More immediate matters concern McIlroy playing himself into contention at the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai thanks to a Friday 67.", "&quot;I hope I can deliver another two.&quot; With that Race to Dubai prize in mind, Justin Rose is the best placed to usurp the Swede."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-15T18:36:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/16/european-tour-ian-poulter", "tags": ["European Tour", "Ian Poulter", "Sport", "Golf", "Henrik Stenson"], "article": "In situations such as these, Ian Poulter is perfectly capable of talking the talk. The only danger for Henrik Stenson as he looks to secure a DP World Tour Championship and Race to Dubai double is that the Englishman also has form for walking the walk. And, make no mistake, that does indeed represent the sole element of trepidation that could enter Stenson&apos;s mind. &quot;I&apos;m up for it,&quot; Poulter warned after his 66. &quot;I&apos;m right there. I&apos;m hunting. It&apos;s going to be fun tomorrow. I&apos;m playing great golf and I&apos;m in with a shout.&quot; Poulter&apos;s message to Stenson? &quot;Don&apos;t look back.&quot; This is precisely the sort of box-office finale that the European Tour sought when introducing the Race to Dubai format five years ago. Poulter&apos;s key role in it merely adds to the 2013 version&apos;s appeal. With 18 holes to play at the Earth Course, Poulter is the most legitimate challenger to Stenson&apos;s bid to win the European Order of Merit for the first time. Coming in the same year as Stenson lifted the FedEx Cup, further glory would be some achievement. It would, moreover, confirm the Swede&apos;s comeback from the slump that was so catastrophic as to move him outside the world&apos;s top 200 players. &quot;Even when you have a bad time for a couple of years, you don&apos;t forget how to play golf,&quot; Stenson explained. &quot;And I have that little bit more experience now. I am hitting the ball better than ever, I am putting better. And a lot of things have come together off the course, as well.&quot; Four shots separate Stenson and Poulter. Victor Dubuisson, who seems on a mission to secure a European Ryder Cup place with the best part of a year to spare, lies one adrift of Stenson at 16 under par. Dubuisson&apos;s third-round 64 in Dubai illustrated his credentials as a big hitter who putts wonderfully well. Paul McGinley will already have taken note. Should Poulter win the DP World Tour Championship, Stenson must finish second to cross the Race to Dubai line first. The odds, though, are firmly stacked in Stenson&apos;s favour. &quot;It&apos;s when Henrik is not in contention that he seems to get frustrated and not know what to do,&quot; said Justin Rose. &quot;So it&apos;s the opposite here; he is very comfortable, he is in a groove.&quot; Stenson has played consistently excellent golf since mid-summer. Unlike during his troubled times, aggression has been appropriately channelled. Yet Poulter revels in shootout situations such as these, as indicated every time he takes to the course for the one-on-one battle of the Ryder Cup. That he and Stenson share a management company and are good friends only seems to have intensified Poulter&apos;s will to topple the\u00a0Swede. He will not play Sunday&apos;s round in Stenson&apos;s company, but Poulter cares little about that. &quot;I&apos;m as happy as a pig in you know what,&quot; he said of the scenario where he must apply pressure from one group in front of the 54-hole leader. It is inevitable that Stenson would take notice of any early Poulter charge. &quot;I watch leaderboards,&quot; Stenson said. &quot;You need to do something for a bit of excitement when you are out there playing golf.&quot; Lee Westwood hit a 65 but had cause to rue an ordinary, level-par finish from the 12th hole in. Through 11, Westwood had been minus seven for the\u00a0day. At 10 under, Rory McIlroy lurks with intent but may well find too many in-form players between him and the Dubai tournament prize. McIlroy also continues to exhibit the air of someone who feels he should be scoring better than is the case. A 68 from McIlroy was tempered by three bogeys, the one at the par-five 14th causing the Northern Irishman particular angst. McIlroy had only a six-iron in his hand when playing his second shot. &quot;It was a solid third round,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;I felt like I could have been a couple of shots lower but it is still a decent round and I have a decent chance going into tomorrow. At least I feel like I am going out on the golf course with a chance to win the tournament.&quot; A clutch of players share that emotion. Stenson, though, is in full control both of his own destiny and a game that is once again among the best in the world.", "title": "Ian Poulter still believes he can chase down Henrik Stenson in Dubai", "sentences": ["The only danger for Henrik Stenson as he looks to secure a DP World Tour Championship and Race to Dubai double is that the Englishman also has form for walking the walk.", "&quot;Don&apos;t look back.&quot; This is precisely the sort of box-office finale that the European Tour sought when introducing the Race to Dubai format five years ago.", "Dubuisson&apos;s third-round 64 in Dubai illustrated his credentials as a big hitter who putts wonderfully well.", "Should Poulter win the DP World Tour Championship, Stenson must finish second to cross the Race to Dubai line first.", "At 10 under, Rory McIlroy lurks with intent but may well find too many in-form players between him and the Dubai tournament prize."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-16T14:34:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/16/sri-lanka-david-cameron-war-crime-allegations", "tags": ["Sri Lanka", "War crimes", "World news", "David Cameron", "Politics", "UK news", "Law", "Foreign policy", "Arms trade", "Dubai", "United Arab Emirates", "Commonwealth summit"], "article": "David Cameron has set a four-month deadline for Sri Lanka to investigate allegations of war crimes, in a parting shot at the host country as he left the Commonwealth summit early. The British prime minister left Colombo having failed to secure any concessions from President Mahinda Rajapaksa or persuade fellow leaders to criticise Sri Lanka&apos;s record in a communique. Before he left Cameron gave Sri Lanka until March to order an independent inquiry into alleged brutality against civilians or face an international UN-backed investigation. However, Rajapaksa reacted defiantly to the UK&apos;s call, saying &quot;people in glass houses shouldn&apos;t throw stones&quot;, adding that Sri Lanka would &quot;take its own time&quot; in probing alleged abuses.           Sri Lankan cricketer Muttiah Muralitharan also claimed the prime minister must have been misled about human rights abuses in the north of his country following its bloody 25-year civil war. The world record-holding bowler, a Tamil, challenged his understanding of the situation in the north. Before playing cricket with Cameron, the sportsman, known as Murali, said: &quot;I can&apos;t say the prime minister was wrong or not because he&apos;s from England, he hasn&apos;t seen the site, he hasn&apos;t gone and visited these places, yesterday only he has gone.&quot; Cameron said he had given a balanced account of what he saw in Jaffna after visiting newspaper journalists whose six colleagues were killed and a refugee camp where hundreds of people have been living since 1990. After attacking the country&apos;s human rights failings, the prime minister headed to the Gulf Air Show in an attempt to help British businesses sell Eurofighter Typhoon fighter jets and arms to the United Arab Emirates, which also has a controversial record on allowing dissent. He was due to have a one-on-one dinner at the palace of Abu Dhabi&apos;s crown prince, Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan, to press the case for the Emirates to choose Typhoons, built by a consortium including BAE Systems, over France&apos;s rival Rafale fighter. Saudi Arabia and Oman have ordered Typhoons but last year India chose the Rafale as its preferred option, in a blow for Cameron&apos;s foreign trade drive. Speaking in Dubai, the prime minister said: &quot;I continue to support Typhoon around the world, which is doing extremely well and is clearly in the running here as well, so there&apos;s a lot of jobs, a lot of investment to be garnered from visits like this.&quot; It is the last leg of Cameron&apos;s controversial tour of India, Sri Lanka and the Gulf, which led Labour to criticise his decision to attend the biennial Commonwealth gathering.           India, Canada and Mauritius have all boycotted the summit in protest at the Sri Lankan regime&apos;s alleged brutality against some Tamils but Cameron decided to go in order to visit the troubled north of the country. Among other attendees, he appears to have found muted support for his critical public stance towards Sri Lanka. Asked about claims that opponents of the government are routinely tortured, Tony Abbott, the new Australian prime minister, backed the Sri Lankan government, saying he deplores the use of torture but &quot;sometimes in difficult circumstances, difficult things happen&quot;. The official Commonwealth communique will not mention allegations against the Sri Lankan government and military, although it is understood it will contain pointed references to the need for members to uphold human rights. According to well-placed sources, a draft of the communique refers to the key role of a free media in maintaining peace and democracy. In public, Sri Lanka has firmly rebuffed calls for fresh inquiries. Nima Siripala de Silva, a cabinet minister, told reporters Sri Lanka does not need to do any more to investigate what happened in its civil war and he was fully confident the country could convince any UN panel of this. On Friday, Cameron challenged Rajapaksa in an animated one-on-one meeting at the summit in which the president warned him to not to turn the Commonwealth into a punitive body and suggested his trip was a ploy to win votes among the Tamil diaspora in the UK. However, Downing Street sources said Rajapaksa summoned Cameron for a second meeting on Saturday morning at which he sounded more conciliatory. \u2022This article was amended on 19 November 2013 to correct Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan&apos;s name.", "title": "Sri Lanka defiant after Cameron calls for war crimes investigation", "sentences": ["Speaking in Dubai, the prime minister said: &quot;I continue to support Typhoon around the world, which is doing extremely well and is clearly in the running here as well, so there&apos;s a lot of jobs, a lot of investment to be garnered from visits like this.&quot; It is the last leg of Cameron&apos;s controversial tour of India, Sri Lanka and the Gulf, which led Labour to criticise his decision to attend the biennial Commonwealth gathering."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-17T00:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/17/ashes-david-saker-england-australia", "tags": ["Ashes 2013-14", "Cricket", "The Ashes", "England cricket team", "Australia cricket team", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "article": "England&apos;s bowling coach, David Saker, a long-time colleague of Shane Warne in Victoria sides of the 90s, may share the same passion for bowling as the great leg-spinner but my guess is that he is not quite such a good poker player. Saker was placed in front of the microphones soon after England arrived at a muggy Brisbane, which has been living up to its reputation for late thunderstorms, and was repeatedly asked &quot;Who is going to be the third man?&quot; \u2013 namely the identity of the England paceman to accompany Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad when the Test match gets under way on Thursday. Obviously he was under instructions not to tell us. However, Saker likes straight-talking \u2013 this is one reason why he has such a fine relationship with England&apos;s pacemen. Obfuscation is not his forte. He did his best, but it was hard not to come away with the conclusion that Chris Tremlett will be the mysterious third man. Saker suggested that the men that matter \u2013 and this was not a reference to Michael Clarke, who predicted Tremlett&apos;s inclusion almost a week ago \u2013 knew the answer to the conundrum. &quot;There&apos;s a few more days to go,&quot; Saker said. &quot;And I&apos;m not going to announce who&apos;s going to play but we&apos;re pretty clear in our own minds who we&apos;re going to pick.&quot; Steven Finn did have some success in England&apos;s last match, a fact applauded by his bowling coach but then Saker added: &quot;He [Finn] is still a work in progress; he&apos;s come back from some changes in his action which he&apos;s still trying to work through. Getting eight wickets in the game was a good achievement for him. But he still needs more work, no doubt about that.&quot; At the other end Boyd Rankin delivered a mixed bag in Sydney. Meanwhile Tremlett&apos;s work was restricted to the nets, normally a very dodgy place to draw any conclusions. &quot;We did have two or three really good sessions in Sydney,&quot; said Saker. &quot;We had a good chat about certain things. The nets were fantastic batting surfaces and he came out of that really well and I think he gained a lot of confidence. In the last week I&apos;ve seen a big change in Chris Tremlett, so that was a really pleasing thing for us.&quot; Saker acknowledged this trio were not bowling as well as he \u2013 or they \u2013 would like, all of which continues to enhance the reputation of Tim Bresnan, who is not in contention for Brisbane but is expected to play in the two-day game in Alice Springs and to be available for selection for the second Test in Adelaide. If it is to be Tremlett on Thursday (midnight on Wednesday GMT) this is an odd state of affairs. On the batting side, the figures have demanded the unexpected inclusion of Michael Carberry, England&apos;s leading run-scorer on the tour with 285. Figures do not mean so much for the bowlers. So far Finn has 11 wickets on tour from 82 overs, Rankin seven from 73 and Tremlett one from 37. Yet Tremlett appears to be the favoured one, presumably on the basis that he should offer more control. His is becoming an extraordinary career. In the six years since his debut Tremlett has played only 11 Tests. His reputation was at its peak after the Sydney match of January 2011, by which time he had taken 17 Ashes wickets in three games. After that there were four more outings in the summer of 2011 plus one game in Dubai in 2012. Then nothing. Admittedly Tremlett, despite his awesome physique, has always been a little injury-prone. Nonetheless he can be likened to England&apos;s nuclear deterrent, so potent, it seems, that they dare not use him. So there are questions about Tremlett. If his qualities are so obvious how is it that he has not played more often? Or can he only function on the steeper bouncing pitches of Australia? It looks as if we may have some answers from Thursday onwards. Saker was anticipating &quot;two very good attacks at the Gabba. As a person who loves bowling it&apos;s quite mouthwatering.&quot; It may be that the Australians will target England&apos;s third paceman and perhaps their spinner as well. There is a certain bold logic there. But Saker was sanguine about that. &quot;I know as a bowling group we&apos;ll put pressure on them and if they want to come after our bowlers good luck to them. If they do that there&apos;s a good chance we&apos;ll get some opportunities.&quot; For certain the Australians will respect Anderson; they may be content to try to block him out. They may find it harder to do the same with Stuart Broad \u2026 because he is Stuart Broad and in the phoney war there has been a fair amount of Broad baiting. But this does not worry Saker either. &quot;In our group if you wanted one guy to be picked on, it would be Stuart. He will take it and know how to deal with it. He will probably use his performances to win respect from the Australian audiences. I think he likes that sort of pressure.&quot;", "title": "Ashes 2013-14: David Saker refuses to name England's third paceman", "sentences": ["After that there were four more outings in the summer of 2011 plus one game in Dubai in 2012."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-17T11:50:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/17/henrik-stenson-race-to-dubai-tour-championship", "tags": ["European Tour", "Golf", "Sport", "Henrik Stenson"], "article": "A year ago Rory McIlroy marched to a DP\u00a0World Tour Championship triumph which added gloss to his position as the best golfer in the world. The rankings do not place Henrik Stenson in that position, yet, but a debate is now alive as to just where the Swede&apos;s outstanding run should be placed in the context of the sport&apos;s recent history. Reality has not quite hit Stenson after he became the first player in history to win both the FedEx Cup series on the PGA Tour and the European Tour&apos;s money list in the same year. &quot;It has been a dream summer for me,&quot; he said. &quot;It has been the season of my life. I would be lying if I said I saw this coming.&quot; Nor did many others. &quot;Henrik&apos;s ball striking is as good as I have seen,&quot; acknowledged Luke Donald. &quot;And I include Tiger Woods in his prime.&quot; Tiger-esque. That lofty praise was also thrown McIlroy&apos;s way last November. In neither case has the term been an exaggeration. &quot;He is the best player on the planet right now,&quot; said Ian Poulter of Stenson. In reference to a bet between the pair, which could have resulted in Stenson acting as butler to Poulter for a night, the Englishman hailed his close friend by waving a tea towel \u2013 and wiping his face - by the 18th green. Stenson played imperiously to win the DP World Tour Championship, his 25-under-par total leaving the field trailing by six shots. &quot;What is he running on?&quot; asked Poulter. It was a fair question. Stenson could have claimed the Race to Dubai without victory in its final event,\u00a0and therefore without a European Tour success all season, but was not of a mind to have that used as a criticism against him. A final round of 64 on the Earth Course did not include a single bogey despite the blustery conditions which hindered the remainder of the field. A wonderful eagle on Stenson&apos;s 72nd hole was a fitting end, as was the appearance of 15 family members to join in the party. Stenson remains No3 in the world but has closed the gap on Adam Scott. Next on the list, surely, is a tilt at No1. &quot;I am going to keep on trying,&quot; said Stenson of that goal. &quot;I have got to play a lot of good golf to get to No1 but someone already said to me that everyone who has won the Race to Dubai has been world No1 at some stage. So I have got to try.&quot; As Stenson celebrated, he would have been entitled to let his thoughts turn briefly to Allen Stanford, who is serving a 110-year sentence in a Florida jail. Stenson was merely a high-profile victim \u2013 to the tune of several million dollars \u2013 of the banking fraudster immediately before one of two career slumps for the golfer. Perhaps karma is a reality. For all Poulter&apos;s claims about chasing down Stenson, the Englishman was left amongst those swatted aside and had the good grace to admit as much. Still, Poulter is due credit for refusing to tone down his pursuit of Stenson at any point on Sunday. He left the Emirates with the consolation of second prize in the Race to Dubai, from a year which Poulter earlier admitted has not generally lived up to his own high standards. &quot;I have to take my hat off to Henrik,&quot; Poulter said. &quot;He has been unbelievable, he has shown incredible form over the last six months. I just couldn&apos;t get close enough.&quot; Likewise McIlroy, who signed off with a 67 for 15 under par. Better things will arrive once again for the Northern Irishman in 2014. Luke Donald and Lee Westwood tied McIlroy&apos;s aggregate score. The European Tour has confirmed their Race to Dubai format will continue until 2017.

For all the moral vacuity and corruption endemic in football&apos;s world governing body when it made the decision \u2013 and president Sepp Blatter&apos;s oily evasions \u2013 this shame is on a greater scale than football. The report, which supports similar findings by Human Rights Watch and the International Trades Union Congress, holds up a mirror not only to the world&apos;s principal sport but to the world itself, showing how the richest are happy to treat the poorest. Like Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar \u2013 a tiny country grown rich on natural gas \u2013 is engaged in a vast nation-building programme, constructed using people who most needed labouring work. They were never going to allow hundreds of thousands of poor men from south Asian countries the rights of equals. As Amnesty&apos;s report makes clear, the abuse of migrant workers is systematic, too often amounting to forced labour. Foreign workers on residence permits must be &quot;sponsored&quot; \u2013 a benign-sounding word which in practice means they are tied to one employer. This means they cannot move jobs or even leave the country without that employer&apos;s permission. They are forbidden by Qatari law to join or form trade unions, in breach of the fundamental human right to freedom of association, and so are condemned to vulnerability. Contractors commissioned by Qatar&apos;s largest state-owned corporations hold their imported workforce to ransom; too often fail to abide by basic health and safety requirements on potentially lethal construction sites, withhold money in penalties if men fall sick and fail to pay them for months. Photographs in the Amnesty report reveal the filthy insides of Qatar&apos;s accommodation for the workers who build their air-conditioned palaces, malls and five-star hotels: dank, windowless hovels, dangerously hot without air-conditioning; primitive dormitories cramming together crowds of men far from their homes and families. Human rights organisations have peered into the detail, but these conditions are not hidden. In the gulf&apos;s broad desert daylight, the only people seen outside are often teams of migrant workers. They live in labour camps, a term completely accepted. This report highlights an actual law passed in Qatar in 2011, which makes it illegal for migrant workers to be housed in &quot;family areas&quot; \u2013 meaning they must be kept separate from &quot;districts where Qatari families live&quot;. Some Qataris object that these reports focus relentlessly on dreadful practices while many of the men working in construction, and women in domestic service, are humanely treated, paid on time, and send a critical stream of money home. Amnesty acknowledges this. Researchers spoke to people &quot;broadly satisfied with their working conditions.&quot; Overall, however, Amnesty concludes: &quot;The abuses against migrant workers in the construction sector in Qatar are grim.&quot; When Fifa&apos;s barons sat in Zurich and greenlit the building of twelve huge football stadiums, hotels and vast attendant infrastructure in Qatar, they did not consider the workers who would do all this building. Since making this decision, six of the most senior Fifa executive committee have left or been banned following damning reports that they were corrupt. In 2011, Fifa promised co-operation with the ITUC, accepting it bore a &quot;responsibility that goes beyond the development of football&quot;. The Amnesty documents reveal that Blatter has slid back tothe position that Fifa can only organise a football tournament. The report pointedly chronicles abuses of workers engaged in building Fifa&apos;s Doha HQ and VIP centre, where one man complained: &quot;Nepalis are treated like cattle.&quot; The Qatar 2022 committee, led by Hassan Al Thawadi, who studied law at Sheffield University, are mostly younger, more enlightened Qataris who appear genuine in their desire to improve their country.But their constant repetition of the hope that the World Cup will be a &quot;catalyst&quot; for progress can seem glib. They bid for the World Cup knowing how workers are treated in their country \u2013 workers are dying, suffering injury, mental tortureand penury while waiting for the &quot;catalyst&quot; to change their miserable reality. The Qatari government&apos;s response cited in the report gives little grounds for hope: restating current Qatari law, accepting none of the criticismand making no promises of improvement. Yet it is not just Fifa that overlooks the woeful human rights abuse while doing grateful business with Qatar. Governments do, too. David Cameron is supporting British efforts to sell typhoon fighter jets to Qatar and the UAE, even Bahrain. The interests of British business will no doubt temper official moral outrage at this report, painting a disheartening picture of how the world works.", "title": "Amnesty report on Qatar exposes 'grim' abuse of migrant workers", "sentences": ["Like Abu Dhabi and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, Qatar \u2013 a tiny country grown rich on natural gas \u2013 is engaged in a vast nation-building programme, constructed using people who most needed labouring work."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-17T21:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/nov/18/henrik-stenson-race-to-dubai", "tags": ["Golf", "The Masters", "Ryder Cup", "Sport", "US sports", "Henrik Stenson"], "article": "Any golfer who has been afflicted by a slump in form can take a degree of solace from being in good company. Sunday&apos;s confirmation of Henrik Stenson as the 2013 European order of merit winner marked a wonderful turnaround from a player who had lost his way to such an extent there were concerns his game might not recover. Stenson had slipped into the wilderness before, after winning a maiden tour title in 2001, but his fall to No230 in the world at the start of 2012 suggested he was in danger of becoming one of the forgotten men. After all, this decline had been preceded by a period in which Stenson had won the Players Championship in 2009, competed fiercely in all four major championships and sat No5 in the world rankings. Even when there seemed a glimmer of hope, at last year&apos;s Masters, Stenson returned a record-equalling eight on Augusta&apos;s 18th hole when leading the first-round field at six-under par. Stenson will not spend much time reflecting on such troubled times now. This year has seen him earn close to $20m in prize money and become the first player to win the FedEx Cup and Race to Dubai in the same season. Since July, Stenson has been the most consistently excellent golfer in the world. When Stenson returned to the $22,000-a-night, top floor suite of the Atlantis Hotel in Dubai on Sunday evening, no one could claim he was not worthy of such decadence. Stenson credits a long-term approach to his game, rather than finding immediate solutions to ongoing flaws, as the key reason for his renaissance. The Swede also cites contentment away from the course, a matter which must be linked to previous worries over the millions he lost in the Stanford banking scandal. &quot;I know how much playing this kind of golf will mean to Henrik and how much he is enjoying it,&quot; says Paul Casey, who is in the midst of his own return from oblivion. &quot;Once you have been on the other side, any time you tee it up and play great golf it is really, really enjoyable. When you start off in your career everything is just great. You are playing good golf, you have no clue what the other side looks or feels like. Once you have been there, you become very appreciative of everything.&quot; Stenson had in the past been guilty of letting on-course frustrations resonate too deeply at the cost of several golf clubs. He is an emotional character who found that so much of golf is at least 50% in the head at the very top level. When Stenson struggled, his brain never let him forget about it or, indeed, allowed him to remember why things had earlier been so good. &quot;You can tell the difference with Henrik in the way he carries himself, more than anything,&quot; Casey adds. &quot;I have been evidence of that for a couple of years; when golf is beating you up, it is so difficult to walk down the fairway with your chest out and head held high. You look like the world is upon you. Henrik looks night and day to before. The cheeky Henrik is back, the mischievous prankster who tells jokes and causes mayhem in the locker room or players&apos; lounge. &quot;When he is playing good golf he always has been one of the most spectacular golfers in the world. His good stuff is right there with everybody else. You can name the names in the United States: Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson, they would struggle to beat Henrik on a great day.&quot; Woods himself bounced back from a total loss of form and confidence which was part linked to injury and otherwise created by the disgrace which engulfed his personal life. The American now takes great pleasure in pointing out how some pundits predicted he would never win another tournament after 2009. In his book which details coaching the 14-times major winner, Hank Haney explains that when individuals who have never encountered trouble in their life suddenly discover they are fallible \u2013 with Woods a case in point \u2013 they find it extremely difficult to handle the concept of susceptibility. &quot;It&apos;s not great when you find yourself not knowing where the next shot is going,&quot; says Lee Westwood, who was the world No266 in late 2003 before a run which took him to No1. &quot;But what can you do? Either walk away or carry on working on it, trying to grind it out, trying to build. &quot;The thing about Henrik is that you could always see how mentally strong he is down the stretch. Whenever he had a lead he would invariably win. You need that mental toughness when things are going wrong and when you can&apos;t figure out why things are going wrong. &quot;How much is based on self-belief? Well, put it this way, when I look at how Henrik swings it now, it seems absolutely no different to my naked eye than when he was hitting it sideways.&quot; Stenson could play in his pipe and slippers for the next 10 months and still make Europe&apos;s Ryder Cup team for the meeting with Woods and co at Gleneagles. He won&apos;t, of course, now there is a live opportunity of winning a debut major title. That, and a serious challenge to Adam Scott and Tiger Woods at the summit of the world rankings, are next in his sights. The Masters next April, at a course which suits him, is a legitimate target for Stenson.

Successive architects have each brought their add-ons, but few have spared much consideration for the whole \u2013 until now. &quot;For our generation, the distinction between new and old is less interesting,&quot; says Adam Caruso, who, with partner Peter St John, both in their early 50s, has worked to bring a sense of coherence to the jumble \u2013 but not without adding exuberant flourishes. Their most visible intervention is a spectacular new staircase that plunges through the floor of the Millbank entrance rotunda in a swirling op\u00a0art whirlpool of black and white terrazzo, a concentric fan motif that writhes up to form a lacy balustrade. Lined with a mirror-polished handrail and pearly glass, it brings a dose of glitz and glamour (with a hint of the Dubai shopping mall), flirting close to the boundaries of good taste. &quot;The original building was designed with inflated pomp and ceremony for Queen Victoria&apos;s diamond jubilee in 1897,&quot; says project architect Rod Heyes. &quot;We&apos;re trying to be part of that world, without losing a sense of irony.&quot; At the lower levels, the architects have burrowed out new spaces with a series of masterly excavations, creating educational rooms and a new cafe in the formerly dingy depths below stairs. What was a miserable low-ceilinged domain of lino and school dinners has been transformed into an inviting place of arched openings and vaulted ceilings, with the majesty of a Roman catacomb.     The newly designed cafe at Tate Britain. Photograph: Peter Macdiarmid/Getty Images    &quot;Our approach has been a bit like working in a quarry,&quot; says Heyes. &quot;You have all of this stuff, the layers of history and influences, and you decide where and how to redeploy it.&quot; This magpie sampling is most evident at the upper level of the rotunda, an area previously off-limits, now an airy members lounge, populated with an intriguing mixture of clubby furniture. Lopsided Lutyens armchairs mingle with arts and craftsy oak tables and matching tub seats. A 14-metre long counter, decorated with fluted carving, is lined with stumpy stools that look endearingly like chubby-legged creatures queuing up to suckle at the bar. Tying the whole scheme together, the star of the show is the lighting. Glowing alien eggs plugged into drooping umbilical cords, the 330 milky blown glass baubles hang throughout the spaces, variously held in chandeliers, gathered in pendulous clusters or stretched out spread-eagle on the ceiling. As in the rest of the Caruso St John interventions, these fixtures draw on the stripped classicism of early 20th-century architects such as Gunnar Asplund and Adolf Loos, inflected with a modern twist. &quot;We&apos;re aiming for an overall sense of ambiguity,&quot; says St\u00a0John. &quot;The best thing would be if you didn&apos;t quite know what we had done, and what period it came from. It should all just become part of your memory of the Tate.&quot;", "title": "Tate Britain revamp brings pizazz and mischief to a Victorian classic \u2013 review", "sentences": ["Lined with a mirror-polished handrail and pearly glass, it brings a dose of glitz and glamour (with a hint of the Dubai shopping mall), flirting close to the boundaries of good taste."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-18T19:10:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/germany-vote-more-women-in-boardroom", "tags": ["Germany", "Europe", "World news", "Gender", "Corporate governance", "Business", "Women in the boardroom"], "article": "Norway led the way back in 2003. Italy, France, Spain, Belgium, Iceland and even Dubai have since followed suit. Now it looks like Europe&apos;s largest economy is also going where British business fears to tread \u2013 imposing quotas on companies forcing them to increase the number of women in their boardrooms. On Monday, the two parties most likely to form the next German government reached a compromise over the so-called Frauenquote, or women&apos;s quota. As of 2016, companies registered on the German stock exchange will be required to have at least 30% women on their supervisory boards. In addition, large firms will have to define and make public their plans for elevating more women into top executive roles. Until recently, Angela Merkel&apos;s CDU party had successfully managed to swat away attempts to introduce a boardroom gender quota. In April this year and back in 2011, the Bundestag rejected proposals put forward by the Social Democrats and Greens. Even as recently as July, Germany joined Britain and seven other countries in voting against the European commission&apos;s proposal for a compulsory boardroom quota. But with the Free Liberal party failing to get into parliament at the general elections in September, the political resistance against a mandatory quota system has largely collapsed and on Monday Manuela Schwesig, who has been leading the coalition talks on the issue, described the agreement as &quot;an important signal to improve the chances of women in the workplace&quot;. In its manifesto, Merkel&apos;s party had only called for a quota after 2020 but Annette Widmann-Mauz, the CDU negotiator, said the main reason for the change of heart had been a &quot;culture shift within companies&quot;. For German companies, meeting a 30% quota will involve nothing less than major management upheaval. Unlike Britain and the US, Germany has a two-tier board system, which distinguishes between non-executive supervisory boards \u2013 part-time outside advisers \u2013 and full-time executive boards, which manage the company day-to-day. On the supervisory boards of German companies, 22% of supervisors at the 30 companies that make up the Dax 30 of German&apos;s biggest companies are female \u2013 compared with 24% of non-executive directors in Britain&apos;s FTSE 100. But in terms of executive directors, Germany is well ahead of Britain. Nearly 12% of executive board positions are held by women, compared with just 6% in the UK. Marion Weckes, of the Hans B\u00f6ckler Foundation, hailed the outcome of the coalition&apos;s negotiations as a major step for equal opportunities. &quot;If we want to get more women into top roles, we have to start somewhere. Introducing a quota for supervisory boards is as easy as it gets: for management, you&apos;ll need specialists, but for supervisory boards, you can recruit women from anywhere in society. It&apos;s a no-brainer&quot;. Nonetheless, the business world has greeted the proposals with scepticism. Germany&apos;s car industry is leading the opposition. The bosses of the country&apos;s four biggest car manufacturers \u2013 Volkswagen, BMW, Daimler and Opel \u2013 have threatened to move production out of Germany if they are forced to introduce the quota. In an interview with Bild am Sonntag, Daimler&apos;s chairman, Dieter Zetsche, suggested that being forced to bring in more women would be a dangerous step for the company: &quot;If conditions in Germany deteriorate, we&apos;ll have to think about moving production elsewhere.&quot; Daimler, which owns the Mercedes-Benz marque, has been one of the slowest firms to appoint women to its eight-person board, appointing its first ever woman, a legal affairs specialist, in 2011. The company, founded by Gottlieb Daimler in a small town near Stuttgart in 1890, has previously admitted it might be &quot;too German&quot; to succeed on the world stage and needed to hire more women and more foreigners. The situation at Volkswagen illustrates the challenge a quota could pose for the car industry: with only three women currently on its supervisory board, it would have to at least double its number of female supervisors. Wolfgang Schmitz of the employers&apos; association said that &quot;a quota merely treats the symptoms, not the causes of the low representation of women in leading roles&quot;. &quot;It should be up to the state, not businesses, to create the right conditions. Instead of wading in with statutory requirements, the government should concentrate on improving infrastructures: more nursery places and all-day schools. We need chances, not quotas.&quot; But some German firms welcomed the quota proposal. Communications company Deutsche Telekom had already announced in 2010 that it would aim to achieve a 30% quota across senior and middle management by 2015. &quot;The latest political developments show that no modern company can avoid addressing the quota issue,&quot; Telekom spokesman Christian Schwolow told the Guardian. &quot;But the risk of concentrating a quota solely on the boardroom risks making it a purely symbolical act. What is needed is systematic support for female workers even at junior recruitment level.&quot; Telekom&apos;s current percentage of female managers is 24%, up from 19% in 2010.", "title": "Germany to vote in favour of more women in the boardroom", "sentences": ["Italy, France, Spain, Belgium, Iceland and even Dubai have since followed suit."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-18T20:07:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/18/private-firms-mass-surveillance-technologies", "tags": ["Surveillance", "World news", "GCHQ", "UK security and counter-terrorism", "UK news", "Privacy"], "article": "Private firms are selling spying tools and mass surveillance technologies to developing countries with promises that &quot;off the shelf&quot; equipment will allow them to snoop on millions of emails, text messages and phone calls, according to a cache of documents published on Monday. The papers show how firms, including dozens from Britain, tout the capabilities at private trade fairs aimed at offering nations in Africa, Asia and the Middle East the kind of powerful capabilities that are usually associated with government agencies such as GCHQ and its US counterpart, the National Security Agency. The market has raised concerns among human rights groups and ministers, who are poised to announce new rules about the sale of such equipment from Britain. &quot;The government agrees that further regulation is necessary,&quot; a spokesman for the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills said. &quot;These products have legitimate uses\u00a0\u2026 but we recognise that they may also be used to conduct espionage.&quot; The documents are included in an online database compiled by the research watchdog Privacy International, which has spent four years gathering 1,203 brochures and sales pitches used at conventions in Dubai, Prague, Brasilia, Washington, Kuala Lumpur, Paris and London. Analysts posed as potential buyers to gain access to the private fairs. The database, called the Surveillance Industry Index, shows how firms from the UK, Israel, Germany, France and the US offer governments a range of systems that allow them to secretly hack into internet cables carrying email and phone traffic. The index has details from 338 companies, including 77 from the UK, offering a total of 97 different technologies. One firm says its &quot;massive passive monitoring&quot; equipment can &quot;capture up to 1bn intercepts a day&quot;. Some offer cameras hidden in cola cans, bricks or children&apos;s carseats, while one manufacturer turns cars or vans into surveillance control centres. There is nothing illegal about selling such equipment, and the companies say the new technologies are there to help governments defeat terrorism and crime. But human rights and privacy campaigners are alarmed at the sophistication of the systems, and worry that unscrupulous regimes could use them as tools to spy on dissidents and critics. Libya&apos;s former leader Muammar Gaddafi is known to have used off-the-shelf surveillance equipment to clamp down on opposition leaders. Privacy International believes UK firms should now be subject to the same strict export licence rules faced by arms manufacturers. &quot;There is a culture of impunity permeating across the private surveillance market, given that there are no strict export controls on the sale of this technology, as there are on the sale of conventional weapons,&quot; said Matthew Rice, research consultant with Privacy International. &quot;This market profits off the suffering of people around the world, yet it lacks any sort of effective oversight or accountability. &quot;This lack of regulation has allowed companies to export surveillance technology to countries that use their newly acquired surveillance capability to spy on human rights activists, journalists and political movements.&quot; Privacy International hopes the Surveillance Industry Index will give academics, politicians and campaigners a chance to look at the type of surveillance technologies now available in the hope of sparking a debate about improved regulation. The documents include a brochure from a company called Advanced Middle East Systems (AMES), based in Dubai. It has been offering a device called Cerebro \u2013 a DIY system similar to the Tempora programme run by GCHQ \u2013 that taps information from fibre-optic cables carrying internet traffic. AMES describes Cerebro as a &quot;core technology designed to monitor and analyse in real time communications\u00a0\u2026 including SMS (texting), GSM (mobile calls), billing data, emails, conversations, webmail, chat sessions and social networks.&quot; The company brochure makes clear this is done by attaching probes to internet cables. &quot;No co-operation with the providers is required,&quot; it adds. &quot;Cerebro is designed to store several billions of records \u2013 metadata and/or communication contents. At any time the investigators can follow the live activity of their target with advanced targeting criteria (email addresses, phone numbers, key words),&quot; says the brochure. AMES refused to comment after being contacted by the Guardian, but said it followed similar protocols to other surveillance companies. &quot;We don&apos;t want to interact with the press,&quot; said a spokesman. Another firm selling similar equipment is VASTech, based in South Africa, which has a system called Zebra. Potential buyers are told it has been designed to help &quot;government security agencies face huge challenges in their combat against crime and terrorism&quot;. VASTech says Zebra offers &quot;access to high volumes of information generated via telecommunication services for the purposes of analysis and investigation&quot;. It has been designed to &quot;intercept all content and metadata of voice, SMS, email and fax communications on the connected network, creating a rich repository of information&quot;. A spokesman for the company said: &quot;VASTech produces products for governmental law enforcement agencies. These products have the primary goal of reducing specifically cross-border crimes such as child pornography, human trafficking, drug smuggling, weapon smuggling, money laundering, corruption and terrorist activities. We compete internationally and openly against several suppliers of similar systems. &quot;We only supply legal governments, which are not subjected to international sanctions. Should their status change in this regard, we hold the right to withdraw our supplies and support unilaterally.&quot; Ann McKechin, a Labour member of the arms export control committee, said: &quot;Obviously we are concerned about how our government provides licences, given these new types of technology. &quot;Software technology is now becoming a very large component of our total exports and how we police it before it gets out of country will become an increasingly difficult question and I think the government has to review its processes to consider whether they are fit for the task.&quot; She said the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills, which has responsibility for granting export licences, had to ensure it has the skills and knowledge to assess new technologies, particularly if they were being sold to &quot;countries of concern&quot;. &quot;The knowledge of staff which maybe more geared to more traditional types of weaponry,&quot; she added. A business department spokesperson said: &quot;The government agrees that further regulation is necessary. These products have legitimate uses in defending networks and tracking and disrupting criminals, but we recognise that they may also be used to conduct espionage. &quot;Given the international nature of this problem we believe that an internationally agreed solution will be the most effective response. That is why the UK is leading international efforts to agree export controls on specific technologies of concern. &quot;We expect to be able to announce real progress in this area in early December.&quot; What&apos;s on offer Some companies offer a range of spy equipment that would not look out of place in a James Bond film Spy vans Ordinary vans, cars and motorbikes can be customised to offer everything a spy could need. Tiny cameras and microphones are hidden in wing mirrors, headlights and even the makers&apos; logo. Vehicles can also be fitted with the latest mass surveillance technology, allowing them to intercept, assess and store a range of digital communications from the surrounding area. Hidden cameras The range of objects that can hide high-quality cameras and recording equipment appears almost limitless; from a box of tissues giving a 360-degree view of the room, to a child&apos;s car seat, a brick and a key fob. Remote controls allow cameras to follow targets as they move around a room and have a powerful zoom to give high definition close-ups. Recorders As with cameras recording equipment is getting more sophisticated and more ubiquitous. From cigarette lighters to pens their are limitless ways to listen in on other people&apos;s conversations. One firm offers a special strap microphone that straps to the wearer&apos;s would be spies&apos; back and records conversations going on directly behind them. According to the brochure: &quot;[This] is ideal because people in a crowd think that someone with their back turned can&apos;t hear their conversation.. Operatives can work much closer to their target.&quot; Handheld &apos;biometric cameras&apos; This system, made by a UK firm, is currently being used by British forces in Afghanistan to help troops identify potential terrorists. The brochure for the Mobile Biometric Platform says: &quot;Innocent civilian or Insurgent? Not Certain? Our systems are.&quot; It adds: &quot;The MBP is tailored for military use and enables biometric enrolment and identification of finger, face and iris against on board watchlists in real time from live or forensic data.&quot; Mobile phone locators It is now possible, from a single laptop computer, to locate where a mobile phone is calling from anywhere in the world, with an accuracy of between 200 metres and a mile.

She visited the UK in October as part of a future international leaders programme organised by the Foreign Office. She worked for the UAE government in Dubai from 2007, as a legal advisor helping the country to reform its economic laws, in particular those affecting companies, foreign investment, small and medium enterprises and anti-fraud. She also worked for one year as a public sector consultant at the World Bank from late 2009. Among her successes Qassim oversaw a bankruptcy law designed to support struggling companies and a law which eased ownership rules for international companies in certain industries. Qassim trained as a lawyer at Brunel University in the UK, and worked for several years for Clifford Chance, in London and Dubai. She immensely enjoyed her role, despite the intense pressure and long hours. She was headhunted by the UAE government in 2007. &quot;The job opportunity offered to me then was a long-term dream, but I thought it should really come in my 50s or 60s,&quot; says Qassim, 36. &quot;It was a very difficult dilemma.&quot; After eight months of deliberation, one refusal and much persistence from Dubai, Qassim finally acquiesced, and made her way back to her home country. The position was vacant for the three years prior to her appointment, because UAE did not have enough people with both economic and legislative skills to help advance its laws. &quot;Three months into the job and I never looked back,&quot; she says. &quot;UAE at the time desperately needed to reform its economic laws. It was my way of giving back to my society, my country. That&apos;s the passion which drives me.&quot; Qassim, 36, was the only woman working in her sphere. &quot;It&apos;s not a minority, I&apos;m the only one!&quot; she says. &quot;Not only did I have to deal with the gender issue, but also the challenge of age. I was working with very much older men, who had been in government for many years. It was very difficult, psychologically, for male colleagues to take orders not only from a woman but from someone so young.&quot; Promoting women in leadership roles is high on the political agenda in UAE, says Qassim, but the country still has some way to go to improve how women in senior positions are treated by their peers. &quot;I would not call it discrimination,&quot; she says. &quot;I would call it lack of experience. We are talking about men who have never worked with women at this level.&quot; UAE is very young \u2013 only gaining independence from the UK in 1971 \u2013 and Qassim is part of the third generation of her country.

They come together at a point in world history where greenhouse gases are reaching levels not seen for at least 800,000 years. Their mission is to take a number of fundamental steps towards a critical climate change agreement in 2015, and they will achieve this by discussing ways to act immediately to curb greenhouse gas emissions, and by helping people adapt now to the effects of climate change. While a renewed sense of urgency provides the backdrop for these negotiations, it is accompanied by a renewed sense of optimism. The world today is politically, practically and economically different from four years ago when the last big attempt was made to achieve a global agreement on climate change. The will to take action on climate change is growing. Not only for the environmental benefits, but for security, energy and governance reasons. On balance, although not everywhere, the political will among our leaders to act is growing and so is the public support and the expectation of leadership. There are strong economic advantages for acting, beyond the fundamental one of radically reducing the consequences of climate change. We\u2019ve seen increased investment in renewable energy throughout the world, driven by those who recognise that a transition to a low-carbon economy spurs economic growth and creates new job opportunities. If we are to tackle climate change with the required urgency however, we must do more to increase and speed this transition. We need more investment \u2014\u00a0and more\u00a0innovative methods\u00a0of investment\u2014in mitigation and adaptation initiatives. It is entirely within our reach. An investment of just one or two per cent of global GDP means we can not only manage the risks of climate change, but also create a global economy that is clean, efficient and fundamentally sustainable. We also know from past waves of major technological change that intense periods of creativity and innovation can transform the world, and we are already witnessing a new energy and industrial revolution take hold. Since 2009, the costs of many clean energy sources have tumbled to record lows, triggering a boom in low-carbon technologies such as wind and solar. A record 115 gigawatts of renewable energy capacity was installed world-wide in 2012. The geographical spread is also widening. No longer are clean energy technologies just limited to developed countries\u2014China&apos;s investment in renewables jumped 22 per cent between 2011 and 2012, and significant investments were seen in a wide range of countries, such as Kenya, Morocco, Chile and South Africa. The Middle East\u2019s biggest solar power plant was officially inaugurated in Dubai with the aim of achieving 1,000 megawatts in output by 2030, equal to five per cent of the city\u2019s total energy consumption. And Ethiopia\u2019s recently-completed 120 megawatt wind farm is expected to produce 400 million kilowatt hours of electricity annually. Today, millions of people work in the renewable energy sector and many more jobs will be created if clean energy investments are further accelerated and scaled-up. We have seen other examples of innovative financing that are making immediate differences and paying increasing dividends. The United Nations\u2019 Momentum for Change Initiative showcases such projects. One example is the International Fund for Agriculture Development, which recently launched the world\u2019s largest climate adaptation program to help millions of smallholder farmers worldwide. The scheme directs funds to smallholder farmers so they can access the tools and technologies to build resilience to climate change. Another example is the work being done in Mexico, where climate change is being tackled by unlocking financing and increasing the number of mortgages to build low-carbon housing. What these projects share is a recognition of the necessity for innovative and successful finance mechanisms and the political will to implement them. We need more of these projects\u2014many more\u2014and at a bigger scale. This works best if governments and businesses work collaboratively. In September, the Global Commission on the Economy and Climate, and its flagship project, the New Climate Economy, was set up to foster and accelerate the transition to a low-carbon economy. The project, with the first report due in September 2014, will help governments, businesses and society make better-informed decisions about how to achieve economic prosperity while also combating climate change. The groundswell of national initiatives both governmental and non-governmental is triggering a real momentum for change. However, while more decisive national action can take us far towards the goal of stabilising emissions in the atmosphere at acceptable levels, it is still not far enough. Warsaw offers an opportunity for all governments, NGOs and corporations to embrace not only the environmental, governance and security advantages of addressing climate change, but the economic ones as well. A new universal climate agreement is within our reach. With clear science and agencies and development banks and investors and subnational governments on board, Parties can join the rising momentum and move together towards success in 2015. \u2022 Lord Stern of Brentford, a professor of economics and government at London School of Economics and Political Science and former chief economist of the World Bank, and Christian Figueres, executive secretary of the\u00a0UN Framework Convention on Climate Change\u00a0(UNFCCC)", "title": "An international deal on climate change is within our reach", "sentences": ["The Middle East\u2019s biggest solar power plant was officially inaugurated in Dubai with the aim of achieving 1,000 megawatts in output by 2030, equal to five per cent of the city\u2019s total energy consumption."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-20T16:11:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/21/gulf-tyrannies-ex-princesses-teach-eat-sandwich", "tags": ["Dubai", "Qatar", "World news", "Monarchy", "UK news", "Food & drink", "Life and style"], "article": "The second world war had many repercussions; perhaps the most trivial is that HRH Princess Katarina of Yugoslavia is now an etiquette consultant. &quot;Would you like a unique opportunity of experiencing an insight into real upper-class etiquette?&quot; asks her website in capital letters, which is the typed equivalent of screaming. It is an interesting predicament; what does a princess without a castle do but teach strangers how to eat a sandwich for \u00a3395? Or preside, maybe, over the London season, the ancient ritual in which debutantes sought husbands, which has mysteriously reanimated itself as an events company and relocated, of all places, to Dubai? The London Season held a ball at the Royal Island Beach Club on The World last week, with Princess Katarina on hand to prevent etiquette terror, which I fondly imagine includes the spraying of menstrual blood. Readers may remember The World, perhaps the silliest construction project ever conceived; it is a series of sand islands in the Persian Gulf in the shape of the countries of the world. Construction was halted after the financial crash, and The World stopped except for Lebanon and its Royal Island Beach Club and, now, a dethroned princess existing in a netherworld of agonised metaphor. Princesses for sale: their marketing material floats in the dark part of the internet that features ancient episodes of Falcon Crest and lessons with the Prince of Wales&apos;s ex-butler Grant Harrold, whose spelling is atrocious. He describes his colleague Princess Katarina as a &quot;great-neice of HM Queen Elizabeth II&quot;, says &quot;there have been many diffrent views from experts on British Etiquette&quot;, and copies out a testimonial from the Daily Mail, which he misspells: &quot;[Harrold is] the perfect man to lead you through an impromptu Dinner Pary&quot;. The London Season&apos;s marketing, meanwhile, is as self-deceptive as the French nobility, pre-revolution; it also holds a Kind Hearts and Coronets Ball. Do they not know that Tennyson&apos;s line is &quot;Kind hearts are more than coronets&quot;? Or that the film of that name is about a serial killer who only targets aristocrats, specifically ones he is closely related to? I did not know this pitch of social anxiety still existed, even less that there is a market to soothe it. For every buyer, a seller; sometimes the market weeps tears of blood. The London Season insists it exists for charity \u2013 we all need charity \u2013 but its emphasis is odd. Dubai, and the surrounding Gulf states, is full of construction workers, toiling in conditions of near slavery. They are building the infrastructure for Qatar&apos;s 2022 World Cup. (How I wish the &quot;vagina stadium&quot; was revenge for their sufferings; but it is, I know from long experience of watching fools plot vanity in mirrors, more likely a mistake.) They will build Entertainment City in Qatar, a metro, a semi-submerged resort, roads, bridges, hotels and more stadiums that look like other things by mistake. Even the authentic London season was not explicitly that cruel \u2013 at least until its central ritual, the curtsey to the monarch, was decapitated in 1958: &quot;We had to put a stop to it,&quot; explained Princess Margaret helpfully. &quot;Every tart in London was getting in.&quot; So the debutantes curtsied to a cake instead (supreme governor of the Church of England or sponge cake \u2013 who cares?) More curious is what possible benefit can a ragtag army of stateless European princesses and over-dressed teenagers bring to the land where Islamism meets hyper-capitalism? Why does Dubai, a tyranny with seven-star hotels, a mountain in a fridge (for skiing), the lost city of Atlantis and politically neutral dolphins need Princess Katarina, pursued by a butler, and the wreckage of the London season? Why does Qatar need a branch of University College London \u2013 for shame? Why does Dubai need a branch of Repton, the famous English public school? Why does the Qatar Museum Authority need a partnership with Prada, makers of strange and ugly handbags? The tyrants of the Gulf do not give frank interviews, except to their couturiers and portraitists, so I must guess. It is surely a combination of greed, snobbery and, perhaps obliviously, revenge; the final victory of new money on old. If only they both could lose.

The hotel worker was Tanzanian and he wanted to know which UK airport I had flown from. The word &quot;Newcastle&quot; prefaced a broad smile. &quot;My life&apos;s ambition is to go to St James&apos; Park; they are my team,&quot; he said. And why not? Freddy Shepherd, Newcastle&apos;s former chairman once claimed he was in charge of the eighth most popular side in the world. Even if that is no longer quite true, earlier this year, Newcastle broke back into the global top 20 revenue generating football clubs with the only puzzle being why potential buyers are not beating down Mike Ashley&apos;s door and persuading the current owner to sell\u00a0up. Seemingly Ashley&apos;s answer would be yes were any would-be purchaser to come up with around \u00a3267m \u2013 thereby covering the \u00a3134m he paid for Newcastle in 2007 plus more than \u00a3150m in interest-free loans he injected to keep everything afloat during the early days of his tenure. Although the club&apos;s most recent accounts, released in March this year, showed that commercial revenue had fallen by \u00a312.7m \u2013 perhaps reflecting Ashley&apos;s failure to exploit fully overseas markets \u2013 Newcastle&apos;s accounts were in the black. Unlike many Premier League counterparts they even posted a profit \u2013 \u00a31.4m after player amortisation. Life is full of mysteries but one of the biggest, most enduring, revolves around why no one has stepped in to relieve Ashley of a most attractive toy he would surely be willing to discard. The billionaire sports retailer once reportedly told one of his former St James&apos; Park managers he had no idea why he bought Newcastle in the first place but, now the international credit crunch has eased, the lack of interest in taking it off his hands appears astounding. Financial types will tell you that wealthy individuals are rarely willing to invest more than 10% of their overall capital in a football club, preferring to borrow the rest. The credit crunch made that tough but now things should be a little less restrictive while the potential rewards of being handed the keys to St James&apos; Park are immense. For a start the stadium \u2013 one of the biggest and best in England \u2013 regularly sells out to its 52,000 capacity and, unusually, it enjoys a prime city centre location within walking distance from scores of restaurants, hotels and shops. If the fact you can be shopping in Fenwick or John Lewis minutes before attending a match may seem slightly irrelevant, the ground&apos;s peerless location boosts the club&apos;s value in the corporate function market appreciably. Derek Llambias, Newcastle&apos;s former managing director under Ashley, used to suggest that people on Tyneside did not have sufficient money to help maximise such revenue streams but his opinion was perhaps coloured by earlier decades spent working in the high-rolling world of Mayfair casinos. Granted there are areas of deprivation in Newcastle \u2013 as in all cities. Yet judging by the amount of brand new expensive cars flying around the area, the invariably packed restaurants, busy shops and some eye-wateringly steep house prices in certain suburbs, Llambias did not grasp the whole picture in what remains a regional capital. Glenn Roeder, sacked as Newcastle&apos;s manager shortly before Ashley&apos;s arrival, used to say potential buyers dismissed it, ignorantly, as simply too far north and, even though that sounds absurd in such a small country as England, he may well have a point. After all, people who have never been to the north-east do often have rather distorted ideas about the region. It seems Manchester City&apos;s current owners did discreetly arrive from Abu Dhabi to explore the possibility of buying Newcastle before heading south and west to Manchester but since then little substantive sales talk has gone on. Everton, a club Bill Kenwright has made clear is up for grabs, may represent a rival interest for anyone looking for a Premier League stake but to truly prosper Everton need to leave Goodison Park and finding a new home has proved an enormous problem. Newcastle, then, should be top of any self-respecting billionaire&apos;s shopping list. But if someone really is serious about buying Ashley out the overwhelming likelihood is that \u2013 as happened with Manchester City \u2013 no media outlet would have an inkling of anything happening until the formal, bombshell, announcement. Clues will not be scattered and advance warnings should not be expected. Maybe that is what will happen at St James&apos;. We will wake one morning to an early club statement and later discover that, unnoticed, a delegation representing the new owner flew into Newcastle airport on a private jet from Russia or the United States. Or perhaps on the daily Emirates service from Dubai, possibly having connected from elsewhere in the Middle East, east Asia or the Indian subcontinent. There was a time, a few years ago when the club was very publicly for sale, that a group of Malaysian \u2013 or at least that&apos;s where they were supposed to be from \u2013 businessmen stepped out of Emirates business class and were whisked the few miles to St James&apos; and then the training ground for a less than private tour. New owners? Of course not, just a bizarre publicity stunt or perhaps a little joke on Ashley&apos;s part. No one ever appeared quite sure. One day though it will happen for real. Sooner or later?

Is it a &quot;career best&quot; (1)?It is. I felt like I had a lot to prove, I&apos;d had so many negative reactions to my recent films and people constantly mocking me. I was just like: &quot;Fuck you \u2013 I&apos;m an actor. I&apos;m a serious actor.&quot; Do you feel that your personal life overshadowed your acting?For some people, yeah. It&apos;s like, OK, you need to re-evaluate things, maybe you&apos;ve become more of a personality, a celebrity than being an actor. There are some actors out there that are brilliant at just being the actor and not giving the interview, mainly because they&apos;re boring as shit and they&apos;ve got absolutely nothing to talk about. But if there&apos;s one thing I regret about my career it&apos;s that I didn&apos;t let my acting do the talking (2). Harold Pinter mentored you as a young actor. What do you remember about him?I miss him, you know, he was a good influence on me. He was the only person who I feared but loved. He had faith in me, he suffered all my shit because he knew I was a talented actor. He was a fucking tyrant, too, you know, but he could get away with it because he was so enchanting. He was a poet. Do you think he&apos;d like Vendetta? I&apos;d love to know what he thought of Vendetta. If he didn&apos;t like it he&apos;d tell me straight; there were no airs and graces about him. I learned so much from him that set me up for the rest of my career. The first time I saw you was when you played a pilled-up clubber in 1999&apos;s Human Traffic. How much research did you have to do for that role?That role was me \u2013 I was still living it then. That audition is the only one I ever had where the first question was: &quot;Do you take drugs?&quot; I said: &quot;Yes. I love drugs.&quot; They were like: &quot;Perfect.&quot; Do you still take drugs?Don&apos;t be ridiculous. It&apos;s not ideal, is it, taking drugs and going home to a newborn child? But listen, I fucking ripped the arse out of it for many, many years, you know. But you have to find a point in your life where you&apos;re like: &quot;Time to grow up. Time to let some brain cells regenerate.&quot; There are lots of videos of you DJing on YouTube, looking a bit worse for wear.I&apos;ve always been fascinated by the idea of DJing and then I sort of got famous so people were asking me to DJ in the clubs. I did Ibiza, Majorca, Dubai, Bahrain, I&apos;ve done some major places. But I&apos;m pushing 40 so I was like: &quot;Should you really be in a club? You&apos;re not fucking Pete Tong, you know what I mean?&quot;            Reading this on mobile? Click here to view the Vendetta trailer Last year you tweeted that it was &quot;freaking my nut&quot; that it was 11 years &quot;since them slags smashed into the twin towers&quot;. Can you please define the word &quot;slag&quot;?Slag means dirty, horrible, nasty \u2013 it&apos;s just a terminology for not very nice person. So I called them terrorists slags and I had a real backlash. It&apos;s the way I speak, but people said I was being disrespectful to the dead. How was I being disrespectful? For me, Twitter is a thought, an idea. It&apos;s not me selling a product like most fucking celebrities (3) \u2013 that fake shit. I say what I think and I get respected for it or I get assassinated for that. Speaking of speaking your mind, in 2010 you wrote in your column in Zoo magazine that a man who had been dumped by his girlfriend should cut her face &quot;so no one will want her&quot;. At first you said you&apos;d been misquoted in the magazine, then you said you said it as a joke. Which was it?To be fair, I had a column I never wrote. You dictated it to a journalist down the phone?Sometimes. Sometimes I missed it because I was busy. And I trusted a journalist and that actual line is from when I played a pimp in Prime Suspect. It was a ridiculous line. And I said it, in a jokey, ridiculous way \u2026 To the journalist?You know, when you say something that&apos;s so ridiculous. But there is not a misogynistic bone in my body. They obviously wanted to get rid of me, Zoo magazine, so they printed it. Maybe they thought it was funny, or they were sick of paying me two grand a pop for a column I never wrote. I don&apos;t know, but I was absolutely devastated. And of course Zoo, the most misogynistic magazine out there, jumps straight on the bandwagon and says: &quot;All our proceeds next month are going to domestic violence.&quot; I thought: &quot;You printed that!&quot; The same magazine that talked about how a boyfriend turned his girlfriend into a porn star! So it upsets me, people thinking that I could say that. It&apos;s a sad thing but if you write the column, write the column. Yeah? You&apos;re about to start on EastEnders, but you&apos;d previously turned the show down. Why do you feel ready now?It&apos;s the part now for me. They&apos;ve asked me to come into the Vic and take charge and be an alpha male, but an alpha male who&apos;s a family man (4), who loves his children and loves his wife. Not a gangster. If you cross me, then you know about it, but I&apos;m just a lovely, good-hearted, hard-working man and that&apos;s what made me think: &quot;Yeah, I want to do it.&quot; Is it true you have an AstroTurf lawn in a figure of eight?Yeah, it&apos;s true.

And it might perplex him more. Unlike some of the England sides humiliated down under in the early 90s when Gooch was playing, this one is supposed to be rather good. Hence subsiding from 82 for two to 91 for eight and then 136 all out is a source of some concern for Gooch in his role as England&apos;s batting coach. A couple of decades ago he could at least tunnel his vision and try to sort out his own game. Now Gooch has to fret about half a dozen of his charges, who came and went with bewildering speed on an afternoon, redolent of those dire days of the 90s. He may not have much time to dwell upon the dismal deja vus. But yesterday Melbourne 1990 might have sprung to mind. There, just before Gooch was dismissed for 58, England were doing rather well: 103 for one, which, added to a lead of 46, meant that he might have sensed the chance to set Australia a challenging target. Soon England were all out 150, crumbling, as they did on day two at the Gabba, to a left-armer of West Australia (Bruce Reid) and a modestly rated off-spinner (Greg Matthews). At one point they contrived to lose six wickets for three runs, even worse than six for nine on day two here. Later on that tour England subsided from 191 for two to 244 all out in Perth thanks to Craig McDermott, Australia&apos;s current bowling coach, who seems to be doing a fine job, grabbing eight wickets. Gooch might also like to swap notes \u2013 though I doubt it \u2013 with McDermott about England&apos;s 92 all out in Melbourne in 1994 (McDermott five more wickets and a young Shane Warne three). So this collapse was not unprecedented but it was very unexpected. This England side are not awed by Australia; they are accustomed to beating them but there is a frailty that they have to acknowledge \u2013 how else can they improve? \u2013 when the ball is bouncing more than usual. This was evident in Perth on the last tour in a Test, which provides some echoes of this contest: in Australia&apos;s first innings Brad Haddin and Mitchell Johnson came to the rescue just as they did here, after which Johnson and Ryan Harris shared 18 wickets. Australia were cock-a-hoop here in Brisbane because so many of the England players were dismissed in the manner prescribed by the think-tank before the game; they bowled consistently full and just outside off stump to Alastair Cook; they dried up Kevin Pietersen but most satisfying of all \u2013 because this had been talked about so much \u2013 was the wicket of Jonathan Trott. Once again this dismissal would have caused shudders in the Gooch memory bank, transporting him back to Adelaide in 1991 with lunch approaching. At the other end soon after the Tiger Moth episode was David Gower. McDermott (again) elaborately set a leg-side trap. It was so obvious, so predictable and now it seems so inevitable that Gower should hole out on the leg side. Gooch was not amused. The two batsmen did not leave the Oval together in pursuit of their lunch. Here, the trap was set for Trott. Michael Clarke had been constantly fiddling with the leg-side field. Johnson had settled on his chosen line and length; short, fast, at leg stump and the body of the batsman. Trott in response was darting towards the off side and had been flicking at those deliveries with a hint of defiance, picking up a few runs in the process but this was the last over before lunch. Johnson delivered; Trott flicked again and Haddin caught the edge down the leg side. Had Gower played that shot he would have been painted as a carefree dilettante wantonly incapable of recognising the gravity of the situation. Trott is spared that depiction but, in this instance, being caught down the leg side was not an unlucky dismissal, it was a bad one. Gooch may well be working overtime between now and the Adelaide Test. The hierarchy might have found some encouragement in the innings of Michael Carberry, the highest scorer with 40. Until Johnson came around the wicket he had dealt with the bouncing ball with the minimum of fuss but, as wickets fell at the other end, his calmness gave way to excessive caution. It is vital for newcomers to remember that they should not restrict themselves in high-intensity Test situations any more than they do when playing county cricket. Otherwise they can stagnate completely because the number of loose deliveries received at this level is so small. So there is much work to be done for the England batsmen, especially in preparation for Perth where the ball usually bounces more extravagantly than here. This batch of England players have been prepared to do that most diligently in the past. They did so after their trials in Dubai against Pakistan&apos;s spinners two years ago. But there is a difference. Weakness against spin is deemed to be one of those things. Weakness against pace, for no logical reason, often has undertones of a dearth of moral fibre or courage. Hence the reluctance to acknowledge it. So it may be that Gooch&apos;s first challenge is to convince some of his men that there is a bit of problem here.", "title": "Ashes 2013-14: England collapse recalls dark days of the early 90s", "sentences": ["They did so after their trials in Dubai against Pakistan&apos;s spinners two years ago."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-22T08:46:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/22/ashes-2013-14-england-collapses", "tags": ["Ashes 2013-14", "England cricket team", "Australia cricket team", "Cricket", "The Ashes", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "article": "The Ashes The Oval, 1882, 51 for 2 to 77 all out The ninth Test and a taste of things to come over the next 131 years.

Something similar is happening across London. If property values could be made visible (and often they are, by increases in new construction), you would already see a long strip of intensification, in a city that already is hardly a desert, running from east to west. Over the next few years, it will become more and more apparent. This is the effect of the underground Nile called Crossrail and it will show what happens when \u00a314.8bn of public money is streamed underground in order to irrigate a city and its development opportunities above. Its current signs include diversions, closed roads, trucks of dirt scaring cyclists, references in estate agents&apos; particulars, fluorescent-suited workers, hoardings that give no clue to the chasms behind them, informative graphics and the saturated light that shines in computer-generated images of future buildings. Also such things as a once-ramshackle city farm in Stepney, east London, now spruce and confident, various redecorated community centres and support for a literary festival in Islington. This is due to a programme which obliges Crossrail&apos;s contractors to make donations to the communities in which they are working. Whether Crossrail is value for money is disputed or, according to one expert, unknowable. What it is is a line or, rather, a stretched, horizontal letter Y that runs from the gin-and-golf territories of Maidenhead in the west, through Heathrow airport, and then the dense mass of underground tunnels that already serve the West End and the City of London. It continues east, nourishing property development as it goes, and bifurcates beneath that city farm. The northerly arm goes on past 2012-land, stopping at Stratford, the place where in the name of regeneration almost every new London railway in the last two decades has been obliged to call, before heading off to the Essex suburb of Shenfield. The southern arm burrows under the Lehman-haunted blocks and towers of Canary Wharf, crosses the Thames and finds a place, Woolwich, that benevolent transport initiatives have until now mostly forgotten. This branch ends at Abbey Wood, in a part of south-east London whose hills and woods, if it were not also the most forgotten corner of the capital, could almost be as famous as Hampstead&apos;s. Abbey Wood is also close to Thamesmead, the 1960s utopian-dystopian new town (they filmed Clockwork Orange there) that, along with Canary Wharf, the Olympic Park and Heathrow airport, makes the Crossrail route into a tour of government-encouraged megaprojects. It is a heavy railway running through the middle of a city whose 200m-long trains will carry up to 1,500 passengers, which is nearly twice as many as existing tube trains, 24-30 times per hour. This means that, if you stand on a platform in, say, Bond Street at a busy time, the contents of a Premier League football stadium could go past you in 60 minutes. Crossrail is 118km long, partly with the help of reusing existing track, but also with 42km of new tunnels. It promises to increase London&apos;s public transport capacity by 10%, and dramatically reduce journey times: 26 minutes from Bond Street to Heathrow, seven minutes from the City of London to Canary Wharf, 40-50 minutes from its extremities in Essex and Berkshire to the West End. It comes with obligatory superlatives. It is the largest infrastructure project in Europe, costing more, for example, than the London Olympics. Less expectedly, it claims to be the largest archaeological site in Britain, an inadvertent probe through a plague pit, a Roman road, a madhouse cemetery, a Mesolithic &quot;tool-making factory&quot;. It is, apparently, the largest art commission in Britain: Crossrail is an urban and a cultural event, as well as engineering. &quot;Because we believe,&quot; goes the official explanation, &quot;in the value of art and architecture, place-making and cultural identity, we have established the Crossrail Art Programme, bringing together world-class architects and designers, business-world sponsors, artistic creativity and local identity.&quot; Partnerships have been formed with some of London&apos;s most famous galleries: the Lisson, White Cube, Victoria Miro, Sadie Coles and Gagosian. One of the resulting works has so far been revealed: Cloud Index by the American artist Spencer Finch. Here, images of clouds, &quot;in the tradition of Turner and Constable will be embedded into the 120m-long glass canopy of Paddington&apos;s new Crossrail station, with 25\u00a0different types identified&quot;. Above ground, Crossrail is a cross-section through steep gradients of wealth and property, suburb and city, world-famous cityscape and obscure brownfield. Below, such distinctions disappear. It is a uniform republic of artificial light, grey-brown mud dotted with orange workers and puddled here and there with water. There is precision and roughness, both engineered machinery and expedient temporary structures of nailed-together planks. After grinding through virgin muck for several miles, the tunnels arrive within 5mm of their intended position. At Tottenham Court Road, Crossrail&apos;s construction had to pass within 80cm of the Northern Line&apos;s tunnel, a feat that in engineering terms involved both the accuracy and potential for disaster of William Tell&apos;s thing with the arrow and the apple.     The vast cavern beneath Stepney Green where the line divides into two spurs, to Abbey Wood and to Shenfield in Essex. Photograph: Courtesy of Crossrail    Everyone has been drilled in safety procedures and wears the helmets, glasses, jackets, gloves and boots now obligatory on building sites, while also carrying metal tags, as miners do, which means they can be identified if incinerated. For additional insurance, the entrances to excavations are watched over by statues of St Barbara, patron saint of tunnelling. Workers won&apos;t go in unless tunnels have been blessed. The stars, underground, are four pairs of 1,000-tonne tunnel boring machines, or TBMs, which work almost nonstop. They are like long subterranean ships, steel structures with gangways, machinery and control rooms, together with canteens and lavatories, compactly arranged into just-enough space. They also resemble worms: they chew earth, excreting it along their 140 metre length into conveyors that carry it to the surface. Three-quarters of it is then transported by truck, rail and river to form a new nature reserve at Wallasea island in Essex. Just behind the chewing part, three-tonne segments of concrete are vacuum-lifted into place to form the circular tunnel lining. A man deftly finishes the job, flicking and turning a huge bolt with more ease than one might turn an Allen key on an Ikea table. Unlike an Ikea table, the results of his work will last for centuries \u2013 the minimum design life is officially 120 years. The German-made TBMs cost \u00a310m each and are part of a global economy of digging machinery. They get taken apart, shipped and reassembled in other countries, used again and again over years in countries all over the world. The Crossrail ones are new. They also, like ships, have been given women&apos;s names, including Elizabeth and Victoria after the queens, and Jessica and Ellie after the beloved Olympians. They move at speeds of up to 260 metres per week, and 100 metres per week on average, subject to the state of the ground. Their route has been investigated in advance for obstacles such as sewers and electrical cables, between which the huge machines have to thread their way, but they are also preceded by sensors in case of surprises. At Canary Wharf, they unexpectedly met some concrete test piles inserted in the early days of the development&apos;s construction and then forgotten. Their crews work briskly, in eight-hour shifts, incentivised for speed. Many are in their 50s, men from coalmining communities with Welsh and Yorkshire accents who, since the closing of the pits, have moved on to the Channel tunnel and the Jubilee line extension. They are well paid, I am told, for their skill and for the deprivation of spending so much of their lives cut off from the sky. Miners, I am also told, make the best gardeners, as they want to spend as much of their leisure time as possible in the fresh air. The grandest part of this underworld is at Stepney Green. Above ground, through half-closed eyes, you could imagine yourself in Somerset, with the medieval church of St Dunstan, ringed by mature trees, and foregrounded with the farm&apos;s sheep and chickens. If you turn around, Crossrail&apos;s gantry crane, which among other things lowers and raises bits of the TBMs, punctures the illusion, but even this does not prepare you for the huge shaft dropping into a huger pair of brown caverns below ground. It is one of the the largest such spaces in Europe, apparently. This is where the eastern arms of the Y join, which means that for a while the space has to be the width of two tunnels plus a bit extra, and, since its cross-section is circular, its height increases with its width. In its underground-ness and abundant volume, there might be some resemblance to a Bond villain&apos;s lair or an Indiana Jones treasure chamber, but it&apos;s superficial. The atmosphere is calm and methodical, of routinely performing tasks that have been done thousands of times before, and with the fundamentally simple aim of getting from A to B. If engineering is sometimes called an adventure, down here every effort seems to be made to neutralise it. For very good reason, I imagine: over-excitement is not conducive to safety or getting the job done. Even above ground, when talking to the chief executive of Crossrail, Andrew Wolstenholme, in his Canary Wharf office, I find he speaks in risk-managed sentences, their content differing not much from the organisation&apos;s press releases and website. He tells me that construction work is half complete and that the project is &quot;absolutely within its funding envelope&quot; and on target for its phased openings in 2018-19. &quot;Every train will arrive all the time on the time.&quot; The project will generate &quot;\u00a342bn of economic value&quot;. Ninety-five per cent of a &quot;Crossrail pound&quot; is spent with British-based companies, 60% of them small or medium-sized, and 57% of them in the regions. (In Sheffield, an entire station has been prefabricated for erection in London.) It will be a &quot;world-class railway&quot; with a &quot;legacy of skills and training&quot;, which will also &quot;leave a healthier and safer industry&quot;. Its procurement of contracts has been a &quot;fantastic achievement&quot;, with &quot;not a single legal challenge&quot;. It is, he says, an example of a relatively new-found ability for large British construction projects to run smoothly. Not that long ago, it was taken for granted that the budgets for projects such as Crossrail would be vaporised by overruns and that completion dates were works of fiction. Heathrow&apos;s Terminal 5, bar some soon-forgotten glitches with baggage handling, helped to change that perception, as did the Olympics, even if the latter&apos;s claim to be on budget was helped by the early more-than tripling of the fancifully low figure set when London was bidding. In the case of Crossrail, the project seems to be proceeding with a remarkable lack of disturbance. &quot;Do not underestimate UK plc&apos;s ability to deliver such projects,&quot; pronounces Wolstenholme; Britain &quot;has developed a skill set and a reputation second to none&quot;.     Tunnelling machine 'Elizabeth' breaks into the specially built chamber at Stepney Green earlier this month. Photograph: Courtesy of Crossrail    Projects this big make their own universe, including nine new stations, and new developments that exploit the increased land values that go with Crossrail&apos;s arrival. Also the Tunnelling and Underground Construction Academy, or Tuca, a large hangar-like building in Ilford, Essex, the majority of whose cost has been paid for by Crossrail. Here, in a facility that &quot;doesn&apos;t exist anywhere else in the world&quot;, full-size mock-ups of tunnel building sites are created, where noise and hazards are simulated. They have a large robotic machine for spraying concrete, which Boris Johnson, never shy of either toys or photo-opportunities, has test-driven. Tuca&apos;s purpose is to train new engineers, to expand the workforce and replace, when they retire, the fiftysomethings who currently make up much of it. It is built in the belief that there will be more tunnels to be dug in the indefinite future. Those involved believe the skills will be needed on HS2, the high-speed rail route from London to the north, and on Crossrail 2, which would run north-south across the capital. The need to sustain this successful industry becomes part of the case for further huge rail projects, which begins to suggest a backwards logic: big things must be built to keep busy the people who build them. The stations, according to the ubiquitous lingo of projects such as this, are &quot;world class&quot; and Wolstenholme says that &quot;we hold design very high up in our value set&quot;. Crossrail is acutely conscious of the precedent of the Jubilee line extensions that, under the leadership of Roland Paoletti, who died recently, were much admired for their architecture and won several awards. They were also over budget, for reasons that were disputed. The Crossrail stations have been designed more than once during the long gestation of the project. The versions that will be built will be a touch more cautious than those built under Paoletti&apos;s reign \u2013 there won&apos;t be quite as much of the plunging drama of the Jubilee line stations at Westminster or Canary Wharf, or the heroic cast-iron and concrete details of those works, although the long glass canopy at Paddington will not be exactly modest. The most expressive architecture will be found at Whitechapel, seemingly to honour the area&apos;s exciting vibrant diversity, which is probably a mistake: the station&apos;s multiple levels would have enough drama without the swooping, curving roofs and straining metal struts, which the architects have felt obliged to add to the design. With the stations goes 3m square feet (or about six Gherkins) of commercial development, spread across the capital and managed in partnership with property developers, which are mostly in the gridded style of rectangular windows and straight pillars and lintels currently favoured by the more respectable end of the business. Specifications of the cladding materials vary depending whether you are in Woolwich or Bond Street, while in Soho the developer Derwent London will make its building swing a bit, with shiny black, gold and ripples of multicoloured strips. The architecture lets its hair down a bit more with a crystalline, gold-clad mountain of flats in Holborn and the Goslett Yard theatre, a cantilevered glass ziggurat near Tottenham Court Road. At Canary Wharf, a shiny cylinder designed by Foster and Partners, which is supposed to look like a ship in the dock, will surmount several layers of subaqueous retail. Beyond the commercial development on Crossrail&apos;s own territories, there will be yet more in areas surrounding the stations, initiated by others. An effect of Crossrail, combined with the earlier Thameslink project, will be to make Farringdon the only station with direct connections to four of the city&apos;s airports. Farringdon was formerly a lull in central London&apos;s rush, the dreamy volumes of whose Victorian station served one of the least useful stops. Now it is intensifying, with Amazon and Goldman Sachs moving into the area. At Whitechapel, the borough of Tower Hamlets has sponsored a masterplan whereby the station&apos;s former backlands will be made into a mini-Dubai, with a mini-skyscraper, which seems positively to welcome the sort of trashy architecture that generally needs no encouragement. In unsung places such as Hayes and Abbey Wood, the effect will be profound. Then, finally, there is the 1m square feet of public realm that comes with Crossrail: squares, plazas and pedestrianised streets designed mostly by the large engineering consultancies to whom our cities&apos; open spaces are now entrusted. At Paddington, Tottenham Court Road, Liverpool Street and elsewhere, they convert places previously full of traffic into zones distinguished by what can now be recognised as Crossrail&apos;s default style: responsible, uncontroversial, a bit arid. An expanse of paving next to Centre Point looks particularly desolate, but it will be an improvement on the big roads that were there before. Crossrail, then, is a mighty work of engineering more dramatic in its making than its completion. It doesn&apos;t have the romance of a Channel tunnel or a high-speed train, its model being the not-especially-sexy Parisian RER regional transport system. It is most significant as an urban engine, a device to serve the continuing expansion of London&apos;s population and the city&apos;s continuing success as a vast re-circulator of money. It has got to this point with a relative lack of controversy. There have been objections to the fact that not all its stations will be wheelchair-accessible and the Financial Times has argued the government missed an opportunity to harvest the increases in property values around stations, with the result that private landowners get windfalls and the public purse gets less return than it might for its investment. There were disputes about the locations of some of its holes and spoil heaps, which sometimes resulted in victories for the objectors. More serious is the fact that someone has to pay, sometimes those who do not obviously benefit. Business rates are going up for large and small companies, whether or not they gain from the minutes saved travelling to Heathrow or Canary Wharf. Almost any improvement to British cities means gentrification, which means unequal effects for those communities in whose name such projects tend to be promoted. National government has so far lacked the will or wit to make places better without also making them less affordable. It has also been asked whether Crossrail is the best way of spending nearly \u00a315bn on the country&apos;s infrastructure. It doesn&apos;t connect with other recent transport investments such as the Eurostar station at St Pancras and, somewhat bizarrely, Terminal 5 at Heathrow. It doesn&apos;t necessarily serve the areas of greatest expansion around London. These oddities reflect the fact that it has been extraordinarily long in the planning. Versions of it were proposed in the 19th century and in the 1940s and the 1970s, before being put forward again in 1989. Parliament deemed it too expensive in 1994 and it was nearly frozen again in 2008, when the looming financial crisis made such huge expenditure look like a bad idea. It is rumoured that it only got through because the then transport minister, Andrew Adonis, also an enthusiast for HS2, slipped it under Gordon Brown&apos;s nose when the prime minister was distracted by thoughts of holding a snap election. According to Tony Travers, an expert in London planning at the London School of Economics, &quot;putting the funding together took years and required valiant efforts by London First and the City of London Corporation.\u00a0 The government had to be lobbied for nearly two decades.&quot; Travers adds: &quot;Crossrail is an example of the odd way we plan projects. In brief, either you get this one big project or the money disappears. There is never an alternative use for the public resources. It is very hard to be sure about value for money. Having said that, major railways in London or the south-east are almost always going to give better cost-benefit figures than the same project anywhere else in the UK.&quot; In other words, Crossrail is being built not because it is definitely the best way of spending the money, but because it was so large and so persistently put forward that the government grew tired of saying no. Jessica and Ellie don&apos;t know all this, as they bore inexorably on, and their crews probably don&apos;t care much. There is a marked contrast between the certainty and clarity of purpose underground and the confusion that swirls on the surface.

The contest, which translates as Champ of the Camp, is open to 70 labour sites, with workers singing to win cash, flights and flat-screen TVs, as well as taking part for the sheer homesickness-numbing fun of it. Many of the songs are the equivalent of traditional blues and folk, their lyrics about the pain of missing home and loved ones. Founded seven years ago by Western Union, the company through which workers typically send their entire wages back to their families, the first competition saw 30 entrants. This year there were 3,000, with a finale watched by a reported 10,000 people. While much of the controversy of 2008 surrounded workers who were residing in Dubai illegally in unregulated camps, Camp Ka Champ&apos;s contestants are labourers working in regulated camps, with visas, though conditions are still tough. Most workers live eight to a room and work long, gruelling days in the sweltering heat. One of the few non-construction workers to catch Camp Ka Champ last year was Lebanese documentary-maker and long-term UAE resident Mahmoud Kaabour. Unhappy with his lack of interaction with this vast part of Dubai society, he&apos;d longed to gain entry to the camps to see how labourers lived. Camp Ka Champ provided the necessary key: Kaabour&apos;s documentary is set to have its (uncensored) world premiere at Dubai International Film Festival next month. &quot;[Covering] the musical competition was a portal to facilitate the legal permits,&quot; Kaabour explains. &quot;At the same time, it&apos;s a second layer to the film.&quot; Once the crew were inside, they met dozens of labourers, many of whom introduced themselves by stating which Dubai landmark they&apos;d built, including one man who&apos;d helped construct Ski Dubai, without knowing what it was used for. &quot;We had to explain that it&apos;s a big indoor place where people ski in the middle of the desert. He was quite amused,&quot; recalls Kaabour. Another, Adnan from Pakistan, helped build the tallest man-made structure in the world, the Burj Khalifa. &quot;It was difficult,&quot; he deadpans to camera \u2013 yet hadn&apos;t been inside the finished product until he was taken as part of the film. Were conditions shocking? Kaabour stresses that the filmmakers did not want to moralise; he wanted the voices heard to be those of the labourers: &quot;Many told us they are here by choice; others were excited that the camps have running water, they had come from slums in India. The whole comparison that has been applied to the camps suddenly shifted, as labourers compare them to their home countries. But even those who are happy don&apos;t have an easy life. The camps help an entire economy in the subcontinent of Asia, but it doesn&apos;t make them a pleasant experience.&quot; And what did the camp champ do, after his win \u2013 any diva behaviour? &quot;The first thing he bought was a couple of torches, because they don&apos;t have power back in his village.&quot;", "title": "Champ of the Camp: The X Factor in Dubai's labour camps", "sentences": ["When international media descended on Dubai&apos;s labour camps in 2008, aiming to expose the plight of the city&apos;s construction workers, there was one thing they didn&apos;t report on: Camp Ka Champ, the X-Factor-meets-Bollywood knock-out singing competition, then already in its second year.", "While much of the controversy of 2008 surrounded workers who were residing in Dubai illegally in unregulated camps, Camp Ka Champ&apos;s contestants are labourers working in regulated camps, with visas, though conditions are still tough.", "Unhappy with his lack of interaction with this vast part of Dubai society, he&apos;d longed to gain entry to the camps to see how labourers lived.", "Camp Ka Champ provided the necessary key: Kaabour&apos;s documentary is set to have its (uncensored) world premiere at Dubai International Film Festival next month.", "&quot;At the same time, it&apos;s a second layer to the film.&quot; Once the crew were inside, they met dozens of labourers, many of whom introduced themselves by stating which Dubai landmark they&apos;d built, including one man who&apos;d helped construct Ski Dubai, without knowing what it was used for."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-24T18:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/nov/24/cootamundra-navan-willie-mullins-ruby-walsh", "tags": ["Ruby Walsh", "Willie Mullins", "Horse racing", "Ryan Moore", "Sport"], "article": "Cootamundra, a 25-1 chance and a maiden over fences, won nearly \u00a350,000 for his owners at Navan on Sunday with a late charge past Mad Brian and Colbert Station to win the Troytown Handicap Chase.

He had failed to win in 10 starts over fences before Sunday&apos;s three-mile contest, however, and Robbie Moran, his jockey, judged the waiting tactics to perfection to give John Berry, Cootamundra&apos;s Wexford-based trainer, only his fourth win of the season. &quot;He just needs to arrive on the line,&quot; Berry said. &quot;He&apos;s been second and third, getting seven and 10 grand here and there, and you think he&apos;s going to bolt up but when he hits the front he lets them come and get you. &quot;I didn&apos;t think he&apos;d win until he passed the line. He was always going to win a big one one day and we can look at all the good staying handicaps now.&quot; Apache Stronghold, third home behind The Liquidator in the Champion Bumper at Punchestown in April, was an easy winner of the Grade Two Monksfield Novice Hurdle on the same card. &quot;I thought it was a very strong race beforehand and to win like that is a real bonus,&quot; Noel Meade, the winner&apos;s trainer, said. &quot;Paul said he was cantering all the way and he jumped well apart from the last. &quot;He&apos;s something to look forward to and the obvious race is to come back here for the Grade One Navan Novice Hurdle [on 15 December].&quot; Moyle Park, who took the opening maiden hurdle for Willie Mullins and Ruby Walsh, is another possible runner in the same race after a six-length success. &quot;He jumped fine,&quot; Patrick Mullins, representing his father, said, &quot;and Ruby said the only three he really raced over in the straight were his best three jumps.

Andy Flower may not quit at the end of this series, as reports in the summer suggested he would, but he is surely well past the midway point of his career as England manager. Come next spring, it will have been five years since he first took charge of the team. The lines on his face suggest it has been longer still. The job is a hard one, and his commitment to it unstinting. The effort has aged him. He may well have woken with his first wrinkle right after his first Test. In Kingston, England \u2013 mentally shot, technically inadequate \u2013 were befuddled by a fast bowler, bowled out for 51 in the first match of the series. &quot;A new low,&quot; we said in this paper at the time. But it was the first of a succession of such performances since, the latest arriving in Brisbane last week. Flower has built one of the strongest sides in the history of English cricket. Under him, England have won 30 of their 62 Tests. Which gives them a win-loss ratio of 2.30. South Africa, who have played 38 and won 19 in the same time, fare a little better, with a figure of 2.37. But no one else comes close, no one else even gets more than 1.76. But for all their success, Flower&apos;s England have always been bad losers, the peaks studded with spectacular defeats, many worse than the one just gone. They have only lost 13 Tests while he has been in charge, but a lot of those have been horrors, the kind that provoke crisis-clarion headlines and calls for culls from the XI. In those 13 they have only once come within 50 runs or five wickets of winning. There was the innings and 80-run defeat against Australia at Headingley later in 2009, the 267-run loss at the Waca in the return series, two thrashings against Pakistan in Dubai and another, worse still, in Abu Dhabi. Two more innings defeats, one home and one away, against South Africa at the Oval and in Johannesburg, the nine-wicket ignominy in Ahmedabad. And now this. Flower and his team have endured harder matches and darker patches, and those who feel they have reached a nadir now must have forgotten both how poorly they have played at points in the past, and how well they have tended to rally and respond when they have been written off. Pakistan are the only team who have beaten them twice in a row. You&apos;d think we would have long since learned not to over-react, that the team deserve a little more faith than their more fickle supporters show them, that even the more excitable members of the media might cut them some slack. But the long view seems to have become something of a luxury. We all rush to judge. But then sensible opinions seldom sell papers, and for fervent fans, febrile reactions are half the fun. Flower, thankfully, is a phlegmatic man. He has a calmer mind and a cooler hand. He and his team have survived similar situations, been badly beaten in the first game of series, often enough before, against West Indies in 2009, Pakistan and Sri Lanka in 2011-12, South Africa that summer, and India in 2012-13. In the first instance, Flower called a team meeting at the hotel the next day which he told the players: &quot;It is all of our jobs to do something about this, and if we don&apos;t we will be out of jobs.&quot; A frank conversation followed, which cut across the rifts which had riven the team in the run-up to Peter Moores&apos; sacking. Ian Bell was dropped for the next match. It was a defining moment. It helped secure Flower his job. His appointment was temporary at the time, but became permanent soon after. And it set the tone for his tenure in the weeks, even years, which followed. The side had started to forge the strength of character which served them so well in Ashes later that year, and in South Africa the following winter. England&apos;s experiences in Ahmedabad are more pertinent now. Cook says he will draw on what his team did there. Then it was reckoned the batsmen were suffering from a constitutional inability to play spin, much as many now say they cannot play pace. Cook scotched the first theory in the second innings of that match, and if the 65 he made in Brisbane wasn&apos;t nearly so emphatic a rebuttal, it still contained glimpses of the reserves of resilience he and his team have, and will need to draw on in the games ahead. After Ahmedabad, Flower dropped Tim Bresnan so that he could bring in Monty Panesar, and replaced Ian Bell, who had flown home to be there for the birth of his baby boy, with Jonny Bairstow. Similar decisions to the ones he has to make now, with Jonathan Trott out of the squad, and uncertainty about his best bowling attack. The lessons England need to learn now are ones they started studying a long time ago, which makes them well equipped for this particular task. If the Australians, a team who have just won their first Test in 10, make the mistake of thinking they have the beating of England, who have lost just once in 12 months, off the back of that one game, so much the better for Flower. Any hubris can only help. England will be regathering, readying themselves for a second Test which will be played on an altogether different type of pitch.

Punk. When I was about 15, I made friends with some hippies who lived close to the estate where I grew up. One of them turned out to be Astrid Proll (1), although I didn&apos;t know it at the time as she had a pseudonym. They taught me about art and photography. I\u00a0discovered punk, situationism (2), and the connection between art and politics. I never looked back. What was your big breakthrough? Attending Central St Martin&apos;s, then a sort of Oxbridge of art schools. Also, being funded by Channel 4 to create the Sankofa Film and Video Collective (3), and making the film Looking for Langston (4). Have you considered becoming a more mainstream film director? I viewed myself as that when I made Young Soul Rebels (5). But that was a long time ago and the film industry was very different. The main challenge now is to bring one&apos;s language from visual art to commercial cinema without compromising it. When certain voices \u2013 Derek Jarman, Steve McQueen \u2013 are able to do that, really exciting things happen. Where do you find inspiration? In contemporary events. My work Ten\u00a0Thousand Waves (6) is about the fact that people came from such a distance to meet such a tragic end. My new project, Playtime (7), is about capital: the crash and the current global crisis. Who or what have you sacrificed for your art? Friends and family. But I&apos;m lucky to have a partner, Mark Nash, who has been a film-maker and producer. He understands what I do. Is there an art form you don&apos;t relate\u00a0to? No. Film combines so many of the arts \u2013 music, theatre, opera, dance \u2013 that they become part of the vocabulary. Complete this sentence: At heart, I&apos;m just a frustrated\u2026 Painter. What one song would work as the soundtrack to your life? Ain&apos;t Nothin&apos; Goin&apos; On But the Rent by Gwen Guthrie. The people who work with me in my studio bought me it as a\u00a0present. What&apos;s the worst thing anyone has ever said about you? The worst experience I&apos;ve had was at a talk by Spike Lee in London, quite a long time ago. It was a mainly black audience and someone said: &quot;When will we have our own Spike Lee?&quot; Someone else said: &quot;We have one \u2013 his name&apos;s Isaac Julien.&quot; And then the whole audience hissed. I put it down to a kind of homophobia. It was painful, but it reminded me of the importance of remaining a dissident voice. How would you like to be remembered? Do people get remembered?

And do any own any particularly random modes of transport, such as tanks and the like?&quot; &quot;I give you ex-Celtic, Rosenberg and Norway marksman Harald Brattbakk,&quot; trumpets Paul Lang, sending us a link to this feature detailing Brattbakk&apos;s airborne second career. Having got his private pilot&apos;s licence not long before the end of his playing days, Harald got his commercial papers after retiring from football and now flies over the Lerkendal Stadium, home of Trondheim, almost every day. &quot;I was pretty much fed up with football and wanted to do something else with my life,&quot; he said. &quot;Being a pilot is much harder than being a footballer, though.&quot; &quot;It is hard to get a tougher story than that belonging to Ron Dellow,&quot; Tim Dockery interjects, &quot;who until earlier this month [when Ron died aged 99] was the oldest former player for Manchester City. Following his stint at City he played 104 games for Tranmere Rovers. The outbreak of the second world war interrupted Ron&apos;s transfer from Tranmere to Carlisle United, as he joined the R.A.F. Ron served as a pilot of Lancaster Bombers, flying to Germany on 31 sorties and safely landing 29 times \u2013 on the other two occasions he wound up in the North Sea. After seven years in the armed services, Ron returned to civilian life and completed that transfer to Carlisle, playing one full season for them. He went to the Netherlands in 1948 to coach and stayed there for the next 65 years.&quot; As for our own search, the first name that sprang to mind was that of Marcus Hahnemann, the former Wolves goalkeeper. Unlike Michael Owen, who splashed out two million quid on a helicopter (more on that below), Hahnemann was basically being tight when he decided to become a qualified pilot. &quot;The last two summers, we ended up going to Vancouver Island, where my buddy lives,&quot; he told the Guardian&apos;s very own Stuart James, in an interview in the spring of 2011. &quot;It&apos;s a 10-hour drive or a two-hour flight in a small plane, so we chartered a small plane. You pay $1,000 to get there. I thought that if I had my pilot&apos;s licence, I could rent the plane for $115 an hour.&quot; Back then Hahnemann wanted to finish his playing career back in Seattle before getting a part-time job flying Seattle-Vancouver; he recently confirmed that he&apos;ll be playing for Sounders again next season. But why wait until the end of your footballing career when you can combine visits to the physio with learning to fly a helicopter, eh? One of several things to rub Newcastle United supporters up the wrong way was the news, in 2006, that Michael Owen had bought a helicopter to trim his commute from north Wales to Newcastle. Word was that he had a pilot take him to and from until he got his own licence, but in an interview with the Evening Chronicle this summer Owen insisted that it was just a convenient way to get his family to matches. Owen did get his licence in the end, but apparently not in time to film this wonderful advert for Dubai without a green screen. &quot;It may look a bit small from up here, but it is quite large.&quot; No wonder BT Sport signed him up. It also seems that Newcastle banned Owen from flying his helicopter during his time at St James&apos; Park \u2013 the insurance premiums were high enough, thank you \u2013 but they didn&apos;t manage to stop Les Ferdinand, as our reader James Straughan reminded us. When Small Talk asked how the club felt about him getting his licence, Sir Les said with a chuckle: &quot;I may have sort of done it secretly.&quot; Last we heard, mind, he&apos;d sold his underused chopper and was looking to share one. &quot;I tend to just go for jolly-ups,&quot; he said back in 2007. &quot;You know, fly around for an hour or two at 1,500 to 2,000 feet just to get away from it all.&quot; Perhaps Giulio Migliaccio might like to join him. After all, it&apos;s got to be a bit more relaxing than inadvertently driving a tank over cars daubed in the colours of your new club&apos;s rivals. GOALS GOALS GOALS &quot;Perusing the Evo-Stik League Northern Premier League Premier Division (now there&apos;s a snappy title) table, as one does, I noticed that the 18 games involving Worksop Town this season have produced 98 goals (just shy of 5.5 goals per game).&quot; This is from Michael St John-McAlister. &quot;So, that got me thinking. Which team&apos;s league games have produced the most goals in a season, and which team has the highest aggregate total of goals scored in league matches they&apos;ve been involved in. And what&apos;s the best average goals per game in a season, and overall? To give you a fighting chance of finding an answer this side of Christmas, shall we restrict it to England&apos;s top four divisions from 1946-47 season onwards?&quot; Fighting chance? You say it like we don&apos;t relish spending the afternoon getting bloodshot eyes looking at the web! Steady. We&apos;re talking about statto.com. Now, we should state for the record that Worksop have now played 19 games, involving 101 goals, which makes a current average of 5.32 goals per game. When your team is as likely to win 6-1 as lose 6-1, you can&apos;t be bored! We couldn&apos;t find stats to match that in any league in Europe this season. In fact, looking back through the years since the end of the second world war, we can&apos;t find an English league side to have sustained a 5+ goals-per-game rate for an entire season; we&apos;ll leave Worksop fans to decide whether that&apos;s good news or bad. Manchester City came closest, in the top flight in 1957-58, when the crowd saw an average of 4.86 goals per game. In the space of a few weeks they lost 6-1 to Preston North End, 9-2 to West Brom, and then beat Spurs 5-1 (Tottenham finished above City that year, by the way, in third. Consider that a bone, Spurs fans! Not a very meaty one, but there you go). No team has seen more than the 204 goals City scored or conceded in that 42-game season, but since the top flight has been 38 games per season, Manchester United&apos;s 142 (97 for, 45 against) is highest. That&apos;s a mere 3.74 per game, of course. In the second division, crowds at Newport County&apos;s 42 league matches in 1946-47 saw 194 goals go in at a rate of 4.62 per game \u2013 sadly 133 of them were scored by the opposition, and Newport were relegated with a goal difference of -72. In case you were wondering, Crystal Palace witnessed most goals when the second division season was 44 games long, with 145 going in in 1987-88. Meanwhile, Manchester City saw most in a 46-game second division season, with 160 in 2001-02. They scored a whopping 108 of them as they won promotion 10 points clear at the top of the table. The third division is all about Tranmere Rovers: in the 1960-61 season, they scored or conceded 194 goals at a rate of 4.22 per game. Mostly conceded; they were relegated in 21st place. A 9-2 tonking at Queens Park Rangers was their worst defeat, though a 7-1 hiding from Bury, at home, probably wasn&apos;t all that enjoyable either. In the fourth division, Chester City&apos;s 200-goal record in 1964-65 has yet to be beaten, with the average game involving 4.35 goals. Colchester United and Mansfield Town got nowhere near that rate in 1992-93 and 1994-95 respectively, but having scored or conceded 143 goals each, they top the table for 42-game seasons in the fourth division. Going by statto.com&apos;s all-time stats for the English leagues (not a foolproof way, but Doctor Who was on this week, so, you know), it seems that games involving Wolverhampton Wanderers have been the highest scoring, with 14,258 goals in 4,641 matches. Derby County and West Bromwich Albion aren&apos;t far behind on 13,861 and 13,830 respectively. Of the clubs whose post-WWII records are full enough to make the calculation worthwhile, Bradford Park Avenue (currently playing in the Conference North, and yes, we&apos;re counting all their incarnations) have averaged 3.24 goals per game (but that&apos;s with an all-time goal difference of -66). Gateshead (Conference Premier) average 3.16 (-43 GD); Barrow (Conference North) 3.10 (-743!). Wolves pop up again with an average of 3.07 goals per game (and a +574 goal difference), as do Aston Villa (with a +818 goal difference. Manchester City aren&apos;t far behind with an average of 3.06, and a goal difference of +832. INTERNATIONAL DEBUT CAPTAINS &quot;After playing at multiple youth levels for the Spanish national team, Mallorca&apos;s Emilion Nsue decided earlier this year to play for his father&apos;s native country Equatorial Guinea,&quot; says Luke Povey. &quot;He then captained his side against Benin in an unofficial friendly, and against Cape Verde in World Cup qualifying (in which he scored a hat-trick). He was then ruled to be ineligible, but will finally make his debut against his native Spain on the 16th November. My question is twofold: has a player ever been made captain on his international debut?

To read the headline &quot;Celebrity has splashed out on a private island&quot; is to know that the opposite is axiomatically true. This week, it was the turn of Angelina Jolie. &quot;Angelina Jolie is splashing out \u00a312.2m to buy Brad Pitt a heart-shaped island,&quot; the Daily Mirror informed us of an island 50 miles north of Manhattan. Or as a representative of the family who own the island told the New York Post: &quot;I\u00a0don&apos;t have any idea where that came from. The family threw it out there to see if anyone was interested, but so far no [potential buyers] have [come forward].&quot; Excitingly, this isn&apos;t even the first time Jolie has not splashed out on a private island \u2013 the last one she had absolutely no intention of splashing out on was in that much-vaunted Dubai development, The World.

It seems to have gone mostly tits-up since the financial crisis, with subsequent descriptions ignoring its intergalactic desirability, and referring to it instead as &quot;the world&apos;s largest shipping hazard&quot;. Anyway, back in the day, celebrities were reported to be splashing out on it left, right and centre. Rod Stewart had splashed out on Scotland, and Angelina and Brad \u2026 well, they had splashed out on Ethiopia. (It was just after the couple had adopted an Ethiopian-born daughter, so you can imagine The World&apos;s marketing &quot;guru&quot; reckoning it\u00a0was worth a punt.)

What she does know, however, is what she doesn&apos;t want: the current Thai prime minister to stay in power. &quot;She is stupid! And all of Thailand knows that,&quot; said the whistle-wielding 27-year-old of Yingluck Shinawatra as she marched through Bangkok&apos;s downtown with thousands of others on Friday. &quot;I am Thai and this is my country, my government. I want her out!&quot; Primary school teacher Thanita could not answer what kind of government she would prefer, or just who she hoped would rule if Yingluck \u2013 who was democratically elected to power two years ago on the back of her ruling Puea Thai party \u2013 were to be toppled. &quot;Her brother Thaksin wants to destroy the monarchy,&quot; she shrugged, citing a familiar belief among anti-government protestors. &quot;I just want someone suitable to be prime minister.&quot; Other protestors marching alongside Thanita held up caricatures of a singing Yingluck with the message &quot;It&apos;s all lip-synching&quot;, a reference, it seemed, to the leader acting as a supposed puppet of her brother Thaksin, the former PM ousted in a military coup in 2006 who was widely accused of being anti-monarchy. The business tycoon now lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai after being convicted of corruption, charges he claims are politically motivated. It has been one week since whistle-blowing demonstrators in their thousands have taken to the streets to overthrow Yingluck&apos;s government \u2013 which they brand the &quot;Thaksin regime&quot; \u2013 storming army compounds, shutting off power to national police headquarters and occupying ministerial buildings. Although the embattled prime minister this week survived a parliamentary no-confidence vote and the number of protestors has dwindled as the week has worn on, more demonstrations are planned for Saturday, with protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban \u2013 a former deputy premier in the previous government \u2013 vowing to topple the government by Sunday. The instability has led many to worry that there could be a repeat of the violent 2010 clashes between pro-Thaksin &quot;red shirts&quot; and pro-monarchy &quot;yellow shirts&quot;, which saw over 100 killed and 2,000 injured when clashes turned violent. But there have already been reports of violence and intimidation against journalists during these most recent protests. A German photojournalist was assaulted at a rally on Monday after a protest leader singled him out in the crowd, and several Thai TV channels have been accused by demonstrators of being biased, with one Thai journalist coerced by a crowd into blowing a whistle \u2013 a symbol of the protestors calling out government corruption \u2013 before he was allowed back into his office building. Senior researcher Sunai Phasuk of Human Rights Watch said the &quot;showdown&quot; between protestors, government forces and all those in between was &quot;leading to a very precarious situation where violence seems to be inevitable&quot;. He added: &quot;Now the situation is so volatile and so fluid that we have to make an assessment on an hourly basis, chasing different strands of information from different factions [of the government].&quot; Yingluck has made numerous calls for negotiations with protestors and has prepared for violence by invoking the internal security act (ISA), which calls for road closures and curfews. Police have also issued an arrest warrant for protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban. But there have not yet been any explicit attempts to arrest the politician, with the government seemingly keen to wait out the storm rather than act on it. &quot;The government will not instigate a violent situation because that is exactly what Suthep wants,&quot; said Udomdet Rattanasatein, a Puea Thai lawmaker. &quot;We will not be provoked.&quot; Suthep himself has rejected any form of negotiation or dialogue until the so-called &quot;Thaksin regime&quot; has been ousted, and on Friday vowed to cut telecommunications and seize a number of government ministries, police headquarters and a zoo over the weekend. Protestors are operating from five different locations, including three downtown, one in a ministry and another in the northern suburbs. &quot;We all not let them work anymore,&quot; Suthep said of the current government. Suthep accuses Thaksin \u2013 and by default, his sister Yingluck \u2013 of having destroyed not only democracy in Thailand, but the &quot;virtues and ethics of the people&quot;. His plan, which critics have said is both too bold and too vague, is to overthrow the government and begin anew with a temporary, unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; formed of various representatives, with the king as head of state. &quot;Then the country could get on the path to perfect democracy,&quot; he told the Thai news website Prachathai. The current instability in Thailand hinges on an ill-conceived amnesty bill promoted by Yingluck&apos;s government as an attempt to help calm simmering tensions after the 2006 coup. But critics believed the bill would have seen Thaksin&apos;s corruption conviction cleared and allowed the half-reviled, half-loved former leader to return to Thailand. Although the Thai senate rejected the bill and Yingluck said she accepted the decision, it stirred an already simmering pot of political tension between Thailand&apos;s rural poor and urban elite, with demonstrators voicing their grievances at what they allege is a puppet-led, corrupt administration, despite the fact that the ruling Puea Thai party has won a number of democratic elections over the last decade. Speaking to the BBC, Yingluck said the current political situation very sensitive but dismissed any possibility of an early election. &quot;I love this country. I devote myself to this country. I need only one thing for the country,&quot; she said. &quot;We need to protect democracy.&quot; Chulalongkorn University political scientist Panitan Wattanayakorn, a former government spokesman for Abhisit Vejajjiva, who ousted Thaksin in the 2006 coup, said this would be the prime minister&apos;s biggest political test, and could potentially work in her favour. &quot;This is the fight for her survival,&quot; said Panitan. &quot;Let&apos;s hope in the end the prime minister is now able to come out on her own and talk on her own agenda. That is what we are expecting if we want to get out of the crisis.&quot; Analysts believe both sides should reach some form of negotiation before the king&apos;s birthday on 5 December \u2013 a gesture of reverence to the much-loved monarch.", "title": "Repeat of 2010 Bangkok clashes feared as anti-Thaksin protesters march on", "sentences": ["The business tycoon now lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai after being convicted of corruption, charges he claims are politically motivated."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-29T16:51:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/29/soap-opera-nigeria-hiv-problem-tv-shuga-sex", "tags": ["Aids and HIV", "Nigeria", "Africa", "World news", "Society", "Television", "Culture", "Television & radio", "Health", "Sex education", "Sexual health", "South Africa"], "article": "A Nigerian university student wakes up with her middle-aged sugar daddy one morning and suggests that they start using condoms. &quot;Baby,&quot; the man croons smoothly, before brushing off her concerns with a Yoruba phrase that translates roughly as &quot;an orange is not savoured with its peel on&quot;. When the university student \u2013 who lives off handouts from multiple sexual partners \u2013 confronts him after discovering he is HIV positive, he tries to appease her with a shopping trip to Dubai. The scenes are being played out by actors, but activists say Shuga, a gritty sex and relationships TV drama, is reaching young people in a way traditional Aids campaigns have rarely done. For decades, attempts to curb HIV in Africa have either focused on medical solutions or behavioural changes \u2013 normally tied in with Christian-based abstinence messages. That has rarely worked in the continent&apos;s countries which have borne the brunt of a 30-year epidemic. Now the producers behind Shuga, which has aired for two hugely successful seasons in Kenya, have shifted the drama to Lagos in the hope of tapping Africa&apos;s most populous country \u2013 and the continent&apos;s movie powerhouse. The show premiered to rave reviews this week at a Lagos event studded with Nollywood stars, Afrobeats luminaries and some of the ordinary Nigerians who shine in the series. &quot;The issues are so real, but people can relate because it&apos;s not preachy or trying to change society,&quot; said Maria Okanrende, a DJ who plays a student trying to break into the music industry as an ex-boyfriend waltzes back into her life. &quot;A lot of people are not going to like its rawness, but if you&apos;re watching it, you&apos;re going to talk afterwards. Everybody knows someone like my character.&quot; The producers believe it is that ordinariness which appeals to young people, among whom Aids-related deaths have soared even while they fall within the general population, as the World Health Organisation reported this week. &quot;My 15 year-old hates it when I say this, but my belief is that in order to conquer HIV we really need to talk more about sex,&quot; Georgia Arnold, of MTV&apos;s Staying Alive Foundation, which has backed the series, said as clusters of teenagers tried to sneak into the star-studded event. When she repeated that message later in front of a packed cinema audience, a nervous murmur ran through the crowd. But as the lights dimmed, it was clear just how much they were drawn by the painfully realistic depictions of campus life: the booze-fuelled mishaps with exes, wayward visiting younger sisters, friends in abusive relationships and the room-mate with an unwelcome live-in girlfriend. The crowd roared with appreciative laughter when one character, at an HIV testing centre, struggled to remember how many sexual partners she had had, furtively counting on her fingers under the table. Eventually she asks the unimpressed counsellor: &quot;This year?&quot; Fighting an epidemic With around 3.3 million patients, Nigeria&apos;s HIV rate is second only to South Africa globally. But in an often deeply religious and conservative society, social taboos about discussing sex mean up to 80% of people don&apos;t know their HIV status. &quot;When you talk to people about HIV in Nigeria, they say: &apos;We really don&apos;t have that problem here&apos;,&quot; said Biyi Bandele, one of the show&apos;s writers, best known for directing the hit film Half of a Yellow Sun. He said research trips to clinics had been an eye-opener. &quot;There were people you would never guess had Aids queuing up, literally everybody you could ever meet. My hope is that this story will go into living rooms, and families will discuss it across whole generations.&quot; There is evidence that initiatives such as Shuga are already doing that. When South African health professor James Lees saw the first series screened in Amsterdam, he was gobsmacked: &quot;At the end of it, I felt completely emotionally wrung out. I&apos;d been waiting for this series for 20 years.&quot; Lee said he had since handed out thousands of copies of the film to community health workers and teachers. A study this year found watching the series produced dramatic results in both awareness and willingness to talk about the disease among Lee&apos;s pupils \u2013 a breakthrough in a country where discussions around Aids are emotionally charged. &quot;What a lot of people sitting at their desks in Geneva or Brussels don&apos;t understand is that in the middle of an epidemic is a lot of trauma. When you have watched two, three, four loved ones, even the guy at the post office, go through incredibly painful deaths, would you be able to talk about it? Ironically,many teachers have vast personal experiences of HIV within their families, [but] most have been unable to bring that experience to their classrooms.&quot; Lees said he hoped the next series would be set in South Africa. For now, many of Shuga&apos;s Nigerian fans say the series has raised a crucial bar in the country&apos;s film industry. &quot;That kind of quality and social lifestyle it discusses is really important because Nigerian films have a way of catching fire online \u2013 you have people from London to Rio to Houston who are going to be watching this,&quot; said one enthusiast at the Lagos screening. For Treasure Uchegbu, whose on-screen role as an Aids counsellor mirrors her real profession, filming was so realistic it brought back memories of one of her most heart-breaking experiences. &quot;There was a 22-year-old who had never had sex; never done drugs. She fainted when we told her she was positive. But immediately before the test she had told me the place where she got one very small tattoo done, and I just knew what I was going to [have to] tell her.&quot; As night approached, Treasure left the after-party to prepare for a 6am start at her mobile testing clinic.", "title": "Shuga: the soap opera helping Africa confront HIV", "sentences": ["When the university student \u2013 who lives off handouts from multiple sexual partners \u2013 confronts him after discovering he is HIV positive, he tries to appease her with a shopping trip to Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-11-29T16:53:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2013/nov/30/said-and-done-george-osborne", "tags": ["Real Madrid", "Sepp Blatter", "Fifa", "George Osborne", "Diego Maradona", "Football politics", "Finances", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Gesture of the week  George Osborne \u2013 tweeting his plan for new grassroots tax breaks: community clubs sharing benefits worth up to \u00a380,000 as part of the Big Society Olympic Legacy vision.

Thousands of demonstrators took to the streets on Sunday in what organisers said was a final push to topple the embattled government. Some 30,000 protesters have gathered in various locations around the city \u2013 including government ministries, police headquarters, the prime minister&apos;s office and television stations \u2013 to take part in the so-called &quot;people&apos;s revolution&quot; with the aim of wresting control from the PM, Yingluck Shinawatra, and installing a &quot;people&apos;s council&quot;. Sporting whistles, flags and anti-government banners, protesters at Government House \u2013 home to Yingluck&apos;s offices \u2013 were met with teargas as they repeatedly attempted to break through concrete barriers and razor wire protecting the compound. Teargas and water cannon were also used in two other areas in the city. Many central businesses, including five major shopping malls, were closed for the day. The protesters believe Yingluck is a puppet of her brother Thaksin, the former PM ousted in a military coup in 2006 who was widely accused of being an anti-monarchist. The tycoon lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai after being convicted of corruption charges he claims were politically motivated.     The shootings on Saturday night occurred after scattered violence during the day. Photograph: Damir Sagolj/Reuters    The current instability in Thailand hinges on an ill-conceived amnesty bill promoted by Yingluck&apos;s government as an attempt to help calm simmering tensions after the 2006 coup. But critics believed the bill would have seen Thaksin&apos;s corruption conviction cleared and allowed the polarising former leader to return to Thailand. The prime minister was forced to flee to an unknown location after a planned press conference was scrapped when protesters stormed the police building where it was to be held, Reuters reported. While wresting control of the media is often seen as standard practice during a coup, the group leading the protests, the Civil Movement for Democracy (CMD), said it was not occupying the TV stations but merely negotiating with them to air an afternoon speech by the protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban. The managing director of Thai PBS, Somchai Suwanban, one of the stations taken over by protesters, insinuated otherwise, however. &quot;The longer the protesters occupy a public service TV, the more damage they have done to their pro-democracy claim&quot;, he tweeted. As protests continued late into Sunday afternoon, the government said it would send riot police to both the finance ministry and government complex in order to &quot;reclaim space&quot; from protesters, with unconfirmed reports of rubber bullets also being used against demonstrators. Unarmed troops were sent to rescue stranded students from Ramkhamhaeng University, near the spot where at least two people were killed on Saturday night during attacks between anti-government protesters and &quot;redshirt&quot; government supporters in a sports stadium. The two dead were a 21-year-old student anti-government protester and a 43-year-old redshirt guard. Fifty-four other people were injured. Redshirt leaders attempted to reduce tensions by calling on their supporters to go home; many of them returned to their northern provinces by bus. The head of the army, General Prayuth Chan-ocha, has offered to mediate between the two sides, the English-language paper the Nation reported, but it is unclear what Suthep will do next, as he has ignored repeated calls by Yingluck for negotiation and insisted that laws must be broken for protesters to achieve their goal \u2013 a vague plan for a non-elected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; to run the country with the king as head of state. The current protests are the largest since the 2010 demonstrations in which nearly 100 were killed and 2,000 injured.", "title": "Bangkok protesters make 'final push' to topple Yingluck Shinawatra", "sentences": ["The tycoon lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai after being convicted of corruption charges he claims were politically motivated."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-01T11:05:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/dec/01/rory-mcilroy-australian-open-adam-scott", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Adam Scott", "Golf", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "article": "     A win in the Australian Open may not rank among the most high-profile in Rory McIlroy&apos;s career but it is unquestionably one of the more significant. Encouraging signs that McIlroy has indeed emerged from the slump which has overshadowed his game this year arrived at Royal Sydney, where he dramatically pipped Adam Scott to his home Open title. McIlroy thereby ends his season on a high note and avoids a winless year, which would have been in stark contrast to his epic success during 2012. &quot;Since the end of September I have felt better with how my swing was, I felt that everything was coming together the way I wanted it to,&quot; McIlroy explained. &quot;It has been a frustrating year \u2013 I have worked hard and it&apos;s been a process, trying to get back to winning golf tournaments again. It was nice to be able to do it.&quot; The style displayed by McIlroy in victory was as important as the result itself. The Northern Irishman had trailed Scott by four strokes heading into the final round but returned a 66 to win by a shot. By the 8th, McIlroy tied the lead having followed up an eagle with a birdie. As Scott stumbled to a bogey on the 72nd hole and a fourth-round 71, McIlroy birdied. Scott had missed the green, before overhitting a chip. Scott thereby failed in his quest to win a second Australian Open title and the triple crown of Australian golf \u2013 the Australian Masters, PGA and Open in the same season \u2013 achieved only once before, by Robert Allenby in 2005. &quot;I wanted to get a win by the end of the season and finally I have been able to get one,&quot; added McIlroy. &quot;But more satisfying than that is being able to take one of the best players in the world down the stretch and come out on top. &quot;Adam is a phenomenal golfer and a great competitor, and probably even a better guy. I feel a bit sorry I was the one to ruin the triple crown for him. Adam should be very proud of himself. He is a credit to the game and a credit to this country. &quot;It is a very prestigious tournament. Jack Nicklaus, Gary Player, it seems like most of the greats of the game have won this tournament, and I am honoured to put my name on that trophy.&quot; Scott, the Masters champion, did little to hide his disappointment. The one negative, recurring aspect of his career has been the failure to close out victories when within his grasp. Scott&apos;s talent, in short, has not delivered the number of successes it should have. &quot;I felt I did everything right,&quot; he said. &quot;I was concerned how I was going to hit it today because I haven&apos;t been swinging the club very well for the last two weeks and I played really nicely, but the putter didn&apos;t behave itself. But that&apos;s the way golf is. &quot;I&apos;m gutted, I felt I&apos;d never have a better chance to win the Aussie Open. I just slightly misjudged a few putts, overplayed the break, missed a lot of putts on the high side and didn&apos;t quite have the eye in. And it always gets a lot trickier on the Sunday. &quot;I just misjudged on the last and a player as good as Rory is going to take that opportunity.&quot; McIlroy admitted during last month&apos;s DP World Tour Championship in Dubai that distractions away from the course had affected his game. The former world No1 remains locked in a high-profile legal battle with his former management company. Earlier, during the Open Championship at Muirfield, McIlroy had offered an alarming insight into his mindset by claiming he felt &quot;brain dead&quot; during tournament play. In Sydney, John Senden, Rhein Gibson and Bryden Macpherson also had cause for summer celebration, having become the first players to qualify for the 2014 Open at Royal Liverpool via the newly introduced Open Qualifying Series. This series involves 14 nominated events in nine countries and five continents. Peter Unsworth, the chairman of the Royal &amp; Ancient&apos;s championship committee, said: &quot;I would like to congratulate John, Rhein and Bryden on qualifying for the Open Championship. We have introduced the new Open Qualifying Series to further enhance the global appeal of the Open and improve the qualifying process for the players. &quot;The series has got off to an excellent start here in Sydney and we have received very positive feedback from the players who relished the opportunity to qualify at a 72-hole championship. We look forward to the series continuing next year as we build up to the Open.&quot;", "title": "Rory McIlroy's Australian Open victory ends fear of a 2013 whitewash", "sentences": ["&quot;I just misjudged on the last and a player as good as Rory is going to take that opportunity.&quot; McIlroy admitted during last month&apos;s DP World Tour Championship in Dubai that distractions away from the course had affected his game."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-01T16:15:37Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/01/bangkok-protests-residents-violence-yingluck", "tags": ["Thailand", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "Asia Pacific", "Protest", "World news"], "article": "The Thai government has urged residents of Bangkok to stay indoors after about 30,000 protesters took to the streets in a violent &quot;people&apos;s coup&quot; that saw at least four killed and more than 100 injured. In a televised address, deputy prime minister Pracha Promnok stressed that the embattled administration was still in control of the nation, even though Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra had been forced to flee protesters earlier in the day and her whereabouts were still unknown late on Sunday. Throwing stones and petrol bombs, and wielding knives and sticks, the protesters gathered in various locations around the city \u2013 including government ministries, police headquarters, the prime minister&apos;s office and television stations \u2013 with the aim of wresting control from Yingluck&apos;s democratically-elected government and installing a &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; of unelected representatives. After a week of largely peaceful demonstrations, during which anti-government protesters managed to cut electricity and telecommunications of state buildings, storm army headquarters and occupy ministerial offices, protests took a violent turn over the weekend as government opponents and supporters clashed across the city. Those killed were shot at a sports stadium early on Sunday where some 70,000 &quot;red shirts&quot; rallied in support of the government amid skirmishes with anti-government protesters, many of them students. There were also unconfirmed reports of another death after bones were allegedly found inside a burnt-out bus near the stadium later in the day. Yingluck&apos;s government has been careful to use as little force as possible against the protesters, but at Government House \u2013 home to the prime minister&apos;s offices \u2013 they were met with teargas as they repeatedly attempted to break through concrete barriers and razor wire. Teargas and water cannon were also used in two other areas in the city, with about 50 injured in the clashes, local media reported. Many businesses, including five major shopping malls, were closed for the day, with a number of schools and universities planning closures on Monday. The protesters \u2013 most of whom support the opposition Democrat party \u2013 believe Yingluck is a puppet of her brother Thaksin, the former PM ousted in a military coup in 2006 who was widely accused of being an anti-monarchist. The tycoon lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai after being convicted of corruption charges he claims were politically motivated. The instability in Thailand hinges on an amnesty bill promoted by Yingluck&apos;s government as an attempt to calm tensions after the 2006 coup. Clashes between &quot;red shirt&quot; Thaksin supporters and &quot;yellow shirt&quot; opponents have occurred on and off for the past seven years, the most violent taking place in 2010, when some 2,000 were injured and nearly 100 killed during a violent military crackdown. Critics believed the amnesty bill would have seen Thaksin&apos;s corruption conviction cleared and allowed the polarising former leader to return to Thailand, where many believe he would again try to run the country. Despised by the urban, educated, royalist elite, Thaksin and his allies hold the support of the poor rural north thanks to populist policies such as farming schemes and universal healthcare. Although Yingluck shelved the amnesty bill, protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban \u2013 a former deputy prime minister in the previous Democrat government \u2013 has vowed to keep fighting and, in a brief meeting with the leader said he had given the prime minister two days to &quot;return the power to the people&quot;. Suthep has so far ignored requests for mediation and negotiation, including those by Yingluck herself, and said their meeting today was &quot;no negotiation and no compromise&quot;. &quot;This is the only [meeting] and there will be no more until a victory for the people,&quot; he added. It was unclear why police \u2013 who have taken out a warrant for Suthep&apos;s arrest given his role in the protests \u2013 did not detain him at the time. It was still unknown where Yingluck was riding out the political storm, but Thaksin&apos;s lawyer, Noppadon Pattama, told Reuters she was still in Bangkok. &quot;For safety reasons, we cannot disclose her location,&quot; he said, adding that Thaksin himself had also pleaded with the government to show restraint with the protesters. &quot;The government must be the bigger person in this scenario,&quot; he said. Yingluck had previously told the BBC that she would not step down, nor would she dissolve parliament.", "title": "Bangkok protests: residents told to stay indoors as violence spreads", "sentences": ["The tycoon lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai after being convicted of corruption charges he claims were politically motivated."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-01T17:50:06Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/dec/02/defeat-cannot-dampen-buzz-surrounding-adam-scott", "tags": ["Golf", "Australia sport", "Rory McIlroy", "Adam Scott"], "article": "The world\u2019s number two and number six golfers were walking up the 18th fairway at Royal Sydney on Sunday as the Australian Open championship approached its denouement. As they came to their perfectly-struck golf balls sitting mid-fairway like magical orbs, my mate Brian, relaxed from an afternoon\u2019s spectating in the Emirates marquee, assessed the scene and mused: \u201cI love Adam Scott.\u201d Brian, a man of East Maitland not normally given to such pronouncements, then added: \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t love him like a man loves a woman, or indeed a man. But I love everything about him. I love how he swings the club. I love how good he is. I love his goodness. \u201cI mean \u2026 imagine being him.\u201d Imagine that, indeed. Even without a second Australian Open and the fabled triple crown, Scott has been the best Australian golfer with a bullet shot from Goldfinger\u2019s gun. Everything (bar the approach shot on 18 yesterday, and the chip back onto the green, and the quintuple-bogey 9 at Royal Melbourne) he\u2019s touched has turned to gleaming gold bullion. He has built it and they have come. And he\u2019s turned 45-year-old coal miners from Maitland into simpering schoolgirls. Yet like his mentor and fellow Superman of golf, Greg Norman, Scott remains fallibly human. And when he left the door ajar for Rory McIlroy on 18 yesterday, the Ulsterman of La Mancha pounced like a mountain cougar on a chunk of osso bucco. His approach shot landed top tier and stayed, spin-less. Any friction and his putt would have been 40 feet up a swale instead of 12-feet inside right-edge. His putt to win the championship tipped into the hole like the last golden swallow of beer. So yes, top golf from a tip-top player, and McIlroy\u2019s 6-under 66\u00a0was a hot round, reining in Scott\u2019s four-shot lead like Sharky Norman hauling in a massive tuna onto the deck of his 500-foot fishing boat. He even left a couple out there. He is a worthy champion.              Scott? Will be gutted like a catfish. Yet he can probably console himself. As Geoff Ogilvy said in the Emirates marquee after his round of 1-over (-2 for the championship) yesterday, even though you haven\u2019t played super golf, you are still playing golf. And people are paying you quite well to do it. And it is hard to be very angry. And as my man Brian would tell you, being Adam Scott appears to be quite good. Indeed it appears to be very good. After all the practice and travel and hotel check-ins, your life would appear to be: play preternatural golf; get adulated within an inch of your life; drive away in a flash car to a flash hotel to eat flash food with flash people before flash women attempt to squeeze their womanly bits between the closing glass doors of the elevator to your penthouse apartment with glittering Harbour views. How good has Scott been this year? He\u2019s number two in the world, friend, and targeting The Tiger. He won the Masters, you may have heard of it. He won $4.9 million on the US PGA Tour. Countless other millions modelling clobber. He has a home in Crans-Montana in Switzerland where his neighbours include Sergio Garcia, the Molinari brothers and Ali Bongo, a magician.     Rory McIlroy of Northern Ireland (L) and Adam Scott of Australia (R) prepare to putt in the final round of the Australian Open. Photograph: WILLIAM WEST/AFP/Getty Images    At pristine Royal Sydney this week, until 18, Scott scorched the very earth with Australia\u2019s best golfers. He owned Royal Sydney, owned the field, owned the week. Owned Australia. Sure, it was a thin-enough field, and Scott and McIlroy were expected to fill the last two groups Saturday and Sunday. And they did. And the crowds flocked like addicts of golf porn. And the two men were well out there in terms of class in this 128-man field, even with former champions Ogilvy, John Senden and Aaron Baddeley. Scott\u2019s golf this year has entered the other-worldly. He\u2019s hitting it pure. When he misses putts they shave the holes like hot bikini wax. And there\u2019s nothing going on in his head but the rent and, occasionally, Big Stevie Williams, a giant-striding authority figure. And that, people, can be all an elite golfer needs to be \u2026\u00a0Number One. I was in Dubai a couple weeks ago watching Henrik Stenson smash the Best of Europe on the Earth Course at Jumeirah Golf Estates. And there was a machine-like quality about the Swede\u2019s work. He thundered drives straight and long, missing but six fairways in 72 holes. He hit greens and stuck. On the rare occasion he missed a green \u2013 four times in 72 holes \u2013 he got up-and-down. He made putts. And he moved inexorably on, racking up stats like the Terminator knocking off Sarah Connors. Scott\u2019s golf is up there with that. In terms of class in Australia he\u2019s Pat Malone. He owns Australian golf at the moment. And though Jason Day came back well to finish 8-under and T6 here \u2013 and every Australian sports hound is hankering to see how he fares at Augusta - Scott is The One. Our Adam.\u00a0Good bloke. Even\u00a0top\u00a0bloke.\u00a0 Top bloke? Consider: he\u2019s just stuffed up the last hole of 72, played across four long days, effectively giving away the tournament \u2013 the one every Aussie kid wants to win \u2013 and the dream of a clean-sweep of the Australian majors. He\u2019s just spent four hours \u201cholding off\u201d this preternaturally talented Irish wolfhound with every ounce of nous, skill, smarts, nerve and will. And that, folks, is draining stuff, as anyone who\u2019s done a very hard four-hour maths test while every few minutes playing a game of Whack-A-Mole in which every time you miss it costs you 10 thousand dollars would tell you. Yet there\u2019s our Adam at the presentation where he\u2019s got the grace and composure to congratulate McIlroy, and obviously mean it, and still throw in a friendly little jibe about the champion&apos;s thus far winless season. \u201cAbout time, mate,\u201d he said with a grin. To which Rory grinned. And we all grinned. Because while winners are grinners, copping a loss like that and still smiling about it, that\u2019s the mark of a top bloke.\u00a0And there&apos;s no higher accolade in the Australian man-rating system.\u00a0 In describing Scott\u2019s work and the crowds that stood 10-deep to see him, Golf Australia CEO Stephen Pitt twice used the term \u201cphenomenal\u201d. You can excuse Pitt for waxing lyrical. Outside November, or Scott and Day contending in Majors, golf in Australia struggles for column inches. But invoking the ghost of the Great White Shark man and placing Scott in that rarefied air is still, even after this year, this month, and his ascension to world\u2019s-hottest-golfer-with-Henrik-Stenson-right-now, premature. Scott does not yet command the adulation of the charismatic, blonde-haired buccaneer. But it\u2019s in the post people.

Protest leaders had stressed they would not negotiate and promised to continue their efforts to oust Yingluck Shinawatra&apos;s administration. But with Tuesday came an unexpected twist as police took down barriers shielding their headquarters and let protesters in \u2013\u00a0seemingly to defuse demonstrators threats&apos; to seize the building by force. Police also watched idly as crowds breached the barricades around Government House, the prime minister&apos;s offices. It had earlier been speculated that some kind of an understanding was being brokered to allow the protests to pause for King Bhumibol Adulyadej&apos;s birthday on Thursday. The king, who turns 86, is highly revered by all Thais and is seen as the sole uniting figure in the country. After breaching the barriers on the road, protesters milled outside the gates of the prime minister&apos;s office. Many took pictures of themselves. &quot;This is a victory for the protesters,&quot; said Kusol Promualrat, wearing a military camouflage green jacket in front of the gate. The man leading the demonstrations, Suthep Thaugsuban, 64, a former opposition lawmaker, had earlier issued Yingluck an ultimatum to &quot;return power to the people&quot; by Tuesday. He and his Civil Movement for Democracy (CMD) aim to overthrow the democratically elected government and install a so-called &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; manned by unelected representatives under the king as head of state. The CMD argues Yingluck&apos;s administration is a puppet of her brother Thaksin, the former PM who was ousted in a 2006 military coup and now lives in self-exile in Dubai and London.

Photograph: Dylan Martinez/Reuters    Yingluck on Monday vowed to do whatever it takes to &quot;bring peace back to the Thai people&quot; after the protests continued in the capital, where at least four people have been killed and 200 injured in a push to overthrow the government. Seemingly contradicting an interview she gave to the BBC last week, in which she said she would neither step down nor hold early elections, Yingluck told a press conference that &quot;the government is not trying to cling to power&quot;. &quot;I am not against either resignation or dissolution of parliament if this solution will stop the protests,&quot; she said. &quot;If there&apos;s anything I can do to bring peace back to the Thai people I am happy to do it. The government is more than willing to have talks but I myself cannot see a way out of this problem that is within the law and in the constitution.&quot; Protesters had said they were unwilling to negotiate and would only back down once the &quot;Thaksin regime&quot; was fully overthrown. In a televised address on Monday night Suthep vowed to fight as long as need be, even alone, until Yingluck had been removed from office. &quot;They can always come back to suck the blood of people, steal from people, disrespect the constitution and make us their slaves,&quot; he said in an apparent reference to the Shinawatra family.

Photograph: Narong Sangnak/EPA    While protests have taken place throughout the past week around Bangkok \u2013 primarily in relation to a proposed amnesty bill that would have paved the way for Thaksin&apos;s return from exile and squashed his corruption conviction \u2013 the violence only really ramped up on Saturday, when pro-Thaksin redshirts fought with anti-government student demonstrators near a sports stadium. At least four people have been killed and over 200 injured since. On Monday much of the violence had centred around Government House, the seat of the prime minister&apos;s offices, and police headquarters. Protesters threw rocks, bottles and homemade explosives at police in riot gear, who retaliated with water cannons and rubber bullets, and faced a standoff after protesters used rubbish trucks and bulldozers to try to overrun barriers. Doctors at a Bangkok hospital confirmed on Monday that two patients had been treated for gunshot wounds from live rounds, although it was not clear who the gunmen were. Thai police insist they are only using rubber bullets, and Yingluck&apos;s government has taken great pains to use as little force against protestors as possible. Although Suthep has claimed that the military is on his side, Yingluck told the nation that the military was acting neutrally and &quot;wants to see a peaceful way out&quot;. &quot;I believe that no one wants to see a repeat of history, where we saw people suffer and lose their lives,&quot; she said.

The two-day hearing at Strasbourg was the first time a European country has been taken to court for allowing US agencies to carry out &quot;enhanced&quot; interrogation and &quot;waterboarding&quot; programmes. In a highly unusual legal move, the media and public were barred from the opening day&apos;s session. The military base at Stare Kiejkuty, north of Warsaw, it was revealed, had previously been used by German intelligence and later the Soviet army during the second world war. One of the men, it was alleged, was subjected to mock executions while hooded and otherwise naked. Abd al-Rahim Hussayn Muhammad al-Nashiri, a Saudi Arabian national of Yemeni descent, and Zayn al-Abidin Muhammad Husayn, also known as Abu Zubaydah, a stateless Palestinian, maintain they were waterboarded and abused during interrogation in Poland. Both men are being held by the US in Guant\u00e1namo Bay, Cuba. The court also heard a submission from Ben Emmerson QC, the UN special rapporteur on counter-terrorism, who argued that where gross or &quot;systematic human rights violations are alleged to have occurred, the right to know the truth is not only an individual right that belongs to the immediate victim of the violation, but also a collective right that belongs to the whole of society&quot;. Nashiri, who was born in 1965, is the prime suspect in the terrorist attack on the US navy ship USS Cole in the harbour of Aden, Yemen, in October 2000. He is also suspected of playing a role in the attack on the French oil tanker MV Limburg in the Gulf of Aden in October 2002. Husayn, born in 1971, was considered by US authorities to be an important member of al-Qaida and is alleged to have been involved in planning the 9/11 attacks on New York and Washington. They claim that after being captured by the CIA they were transferred on the same &quot;rendition&quot; plane in December 2002 to a secret detention site in Poland, with the knowledge of the Polish authorities, for the purpose of interrogation and were tortured. Nashiri maintains he was seized in Dubai in October that year and subsequently moved around secret CIA detention facilities in Afghanistan and Thailand before being taken to Poland. He remained in a secret detention centre until early June 2003, when he was secretly transferred, with the assistance of the Polish authorities, to Morocco and then, in September 2003, to Guant\u00e1namo Bay. He claims he was subjected to the so-called &quot;waterboard technique&quot;, where a detainee is tied to a bench with his feet elevated above his head, a cloth placed over his mouth and nose and water poured on to the cloth producing the sensation of drowning and suffocation. Nashiri alleges he was also forced into prolonged stress positions \u2013 kneeling on the floor and leaning back \u2013 and was threatened that his family would be abused if he did not provide information. Amrit Singh, of the Open Society Justice Initiative who represented Nashiri, said that her client had been repeatedly tortured. &quot;The court heard expert testimony [on Monday] confirming how Polish officials filed false flight plans and assisted in the cover-up of CIA operations,&quot; Singh said. &quot;In a secluded villa, hidden from sight, CIA interrogators subjected him to torture: to mock executions while he stood naked and hooded before them; to painful stress positions that nearly dislocated his arms from his shoulders; and to threats of bringing in his mother to sexually abuse her in front of him.&quot; He now faces the death penalty before a US military commission, she added. Husayn alleges that, having been captured in Pakistan in March 2002 and subsequently transferred to a secret CIA detention facility in Thailand, he was brought to Poland in early December 2002 where he was held in a secret CIA detention facility until September 2003. According to his submissions, Husayn was waterboarded, placed in a box and exposed to extreme noise. Communication with his lawyers is restricted, making it impossible to pass on information or evidence directly from him to the ECHR. The presentation of his case is principally based on publicly available sources. P\u00e1draig Hughes, a lawyer with Interights who presented Husayn, said before the hearing: &quot;We hope that the court&apos;s ruling will make it clear that the actions by the Polish authorities were a clear violation of human rights and should never be repeated by any country that properly respects human rights and the rule of law.&quot; Crofton Black, a researcher with the London-based human rights organisation Reprieve, who has been researching the issue of secret prisons in Europe during the &apos;War on Terror&apos; sat in on the first, closed day of the hearing. &quot;We have now heard overwhelming and uncontested evidence that the CIA was running a secret torture prison on Polish soil, with the Polish Government&apos;s knowledge,&quot; he said. &quot;Despite being given many opportunities to do so, the Polish Government has failed to contest that it knew prisoners were being held beyond the rule of law and tortured by the CIA inside their own country. &quot;It has also become clear that the Polish government&apos;s investigation into the issue was in reality nothing more than a smoke-screen, which was neither designed nor intended to get to the truth. A Polish offical told the court that his country was the only European state that was &quot;conducting a real investigation&quot; and that the inquiry had been hindered by the fact that it was difficult for the prosecutor to talk to the complainants. Relations between Poland and the US, he added, were subject to secrecy. Romania and Lithuania also have cases pending at the ECHR for hosting secret CIA prisons.

After a night of fighting between demonstrators and police in which rubbish trucks and bulldozers were rammed into barriers and fireworks and rockets were fired at officers, the mood in the capital on Tuesday had turned to jubilant. Police stood down and dismantled barriers and razor wire, allowing protesters to wander freely among previously secured buildings and to snack on the lawn of the prime minister&apos;s offices. Policemen handed out red roses, posed for photos and sang love songs on ukuleles, while others snoozed in the shade. &quot;We&apos;re done here,&quot; one policeman said with a smile. &quot;We&apos;re going home.&quot; But Suthep Thaugsuban, the organiser behind the protests that have rocked Bangkok for more than a week, said this was only a &quot;partial victory&quot;. &quot;You cannot go back home yet,&quot; he told protesters at a rally. &quot;We must continue our struggle.&quot; Suthep, along with his Civil Movement for Democracy, aims to remove Yingluck&apos;s democratically elected government and install a &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; of unelected representatives, with the king \u2013 seen as the single unifying force in the country \u2013 serving as head of state. Protesters view Yingluck as a puppet of her brother, Thaksin Shinawatra, the former PM who was ousted in 2006 in a military coup. He now lives in Dubai in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction that he claims is politically motivated. Angered by an amnesty bill that would have allowed Thaksin to return and quashed his corruption conviction, protesters rallied in their thousands to call for an end to the &quot;Thaksin regime&quot;, although their numbers have dwindled as the days have worn on. Suthep, a former lawmaker in the opposition Democrat party who served as deputy premier in the last government, has plans for further rallies on Wednesday and said full demonstrations would resume after the king&apos;s birthday, only ending &quot;when we reach our goals&quot;. &quot;This isn&apos;t about political parties, it&apos;s about the people,&quot; he said. &quot;The ultimate goal is to rid the Thaksin regime completely from Thailand.&quot; Yingluck has offered to negotiate several times. On Tuesday she said she hoped all sides would come together for talks. However, Suthep has said his movement will not stand for any negotiation. Nor will it abide by a dissolution of parliament, any form of coalition, or a new appointment for prime minister vetted by Yingluck and approved by the protesters. He said he had clear reasons for an unelected people&apos;s council formed of &quot;good people&quot;. &quot;From a western point of view, &apos;democracy&apos; is an elected government serving as the people&apos;s representative. Unfortunately, elections in Thailand do not represent people&apos;s [real] choices because their votes are bought.&quot; It is unclear just what will happen next, with rumours circling of army involvement in the crisis, and many looking to a speech by the king on Wednesday for any insinuation of political unity or strategy. Analysts warn Suthep&apos;s refusal to negotiate could spell disaster for Thailand&apos;s fragile democracy, putting it at potential risk of total upheaval. &quot;If he succeeds in his plans [to oust Yingluck], we will see huge turmoil in Thailand,&quot; said political scientist Thitinan Pongsudhirak of the Thai Institute of Security and International Studies. &quot;When he refers to &apos;the people&apos;, he is not talking about the 67 million people in Thailand or the eligible voters among\u00a0them. &quot;He&apos;s talking about a lot of people in Bangkok, and some in the south; so this is a big problem. If he somehow succeeds with this people&apos;s council, we will see a\u00a0backlash.&quot;", "title": "Bangkok truce as police swap teargas for red roses", "sentences": ["He now lives in Dubai in self-imposed exile to avoid a corruption conviction that he claims is politically motivated."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-03T18:27:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/05/american-teacher-ronnie-smith-shot-dead-jogging-benghazi", "tags": ["Libya", "US news", "World news"], "article": "Gunmen shot and killed a young American teacher as he was jogging in the eastern Libyan city of Benghazi on Thursday, amid an upsurge of violence between radicals and security forces. Ronnie Smith, a chemistry teacher at the city\u2019s international school, was killed while on his regular afternoon running route in Dubai Street, an upmarket area of the city. His death comes with Libya enduring some of the worst violence since the 2011 revolution, with nearly three weeks of clashes between militias and the army in both Benghazi and Tripoli, the capital. Three Libyan army soldiers were killed in the eastern port city earlier on Thursday. Last week the army stormed four bases of Ansar al-Sharia, the Islamist militia blamed by some for the killing last year of American ambassador Chris Stevens at the US consulate. Bombings and assassinations have continued on a near-daily basis. The principal of the international school, Peter Hodge, who has kept the school open despite the violence, told local media Smith was \u201cmuch loved.\u201d Smith had worked in the city for 18 months. On the profile of his Twitter account, he described himself as \u201cLibya\u2019s best friend\u201d.\u00a0But his tweets were also critical of Islamist militias. In October he tweeted: \u201cLibya Islamists are threatening kidnappings. As if they can fit kidnapping into a 2hr (sic) work day that already includes a nap. Losers.\u201d Then on 5 November he tweeted: \u201cI understand I teach at a school of rich kids, so if (and when) I\u2019m kidnapped by Ansar Al-Sharia, who\u2019s gonna pay the ransom?\u201d Diplomats in Tripoli have previously cautioned against making derogatory or insulting remarks on social media, which is widely read in Libya. Smith graduated from the University of Texas , Austin, with a masters degree in chemistry in 2006. The university said in a statement that its community was &quot;shocked and saddened&quot; by Smith&apos;s death. It added: &quot;He was an enthusiastic and outgoing student. His death is a tragedy for the campus and our nation.&quot; A wave of attacks against western targets has left Benghazi almost empty of foreigners. Both the American and British embassies have advised against all travel to Benghazi for their citizens. The US embassy website posted a warning on 16 November telling its citizens to exercise \u201cextreme caution\u201d after the upsurge of violence. In October the Maltese consul fled the city after death threats and last month a bomb exploded outside the joint Finnish and Swedish consulate. Britain\u2019s consulate was closed after a rocket attack on the ambassador in June last year. The latest upsurge of violence began with the killing of 47 protestors, and wounding of 538 by a militia in Gharghour, Tripoli, on 15 November. The massacre prompted anti-militia protests and violence across the country. The Libyan prime minister, Ali Zaidan, declared this week that Benghazi militias must disarm by the middle of the month, but it remains unclear if Libya\u2019s security forces are strong enough to enforce the order. The army this week announced it lacked the troops to maintain security in Benghazi. Four protestors were shot and wounded in anti-militia protests in the eastern city of Derna on Monday. Many Benghazi residents feel afraid. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to go out, it is not safe, bombings and killings all the time,\u201d said Mohammed, a local businessman, who declined to give his full name fearing reprisals. Central government control remains weak outside the capital, Tripoli. Much of the country is a patchwork of militia fiefdoms. Striking militias and army units continue to blockade the bulk of Libya\u2019s exports, with the government declaring this week that it is running out of currency reserves. Libyans are traumatised by the violence. \u201cThe trend of targeting foreigners can easily spread to other cities if things aren&apos;t dealt with immediately,\u201d said Mohamed Eljarh, a prominent Libyan journalist. \u201cThere is an absolute and urgent need for reinforcement of security in Benghazi. Libya cannot deal with the security situation on its own.\u201d Additional reporting by Tom Dart in Houston, Texas", "title": "American teacher Ronnie Smith shot dead while jogging in Benghazi", "sentences": ["Ronnie Smith, a chemistry teacher at the city\u2019s international school, was killed while on his regular afternoon running route in Dubai Street, an upmarket area of the city."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-05T18:13:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/dec/08/horse-racing-tips-monday", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Lingfield Park   12.00 Special Miss 12.30 Sheila&apos;s Footsteps 1.00 Kodafine 1.30 Gregori (nap) 2.00 Apostle 2.30 Soul Intent 3.00 Mahadee 3.30 Street Power Musselburgh   12.15 Lord Of Drums 12.45 Momkinzain 1.15 Population 1.45 Goodacres Garden 2.20 Merchant Of Dubai 2.50 Bertie Milan 3.20 Katachenko Wolverhampton 2.10 Itsnowcato 2.40 Exceeding Power 3.10 Lacey 3.40 Powerful Pierre (nb) 4.10 Track Of My Tears 4.40 Doldrums 5.10 Jaladee", "title": "Horse racing tips: Monday 9 December", "sentences": ["Lingfield Park   12.00 Special Miss 12.30 Sheila&apos;s Footsteps 1.00 Kodafine 1.30 Gregori (nap) 2.00 Apostle 2.30 Soul Intent 3.00 Mahadee 3.30 Street Power Musselburgh   12.15 Lord Of Drums 12.45 Momkinzain 1.15 Population 1.45 Goodacres Garden 2.20 Merchant Of Dubai 2.50 Bertie Milan 3.20 Katachenko Wolverhampton 2.10 Itsnowcato 2.40 Exceeding Power 3.10 Lacey 3.40 Powerful Pierre (nb) 4.10 Track Of My Tears 4.40 Doldrums 5.10 Jaladee"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-08T20:10:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2013/dec/09/horse-racing-tips-tuesday-10-december", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Fontwell 12.40 Muhtaris 1.10 Beforeall 1.40 Brantingham Breeze 2.10 Pete The Feat (nb) 2.40 Mixologist 3.10 Midnight Charmer 3.40 Tang Royal Southwell 12.00 Pensax Lad 12.30 Tobrata 1.00 Bunce 1.30 Dubai Hills (nap) 2.00 Even Stevens 2.30 Hussar Ballad 3.00 Ivy Port 3.30 Guishant Uttoxeter 12.20 Salford Lady 12.50 Ballinahow Star 1.20 Leviathan 1.50 Premier Portrait 2.20 Wintered Well 2.50 Molko Jack 3.20 Onenightinvienna", "title": "Horse racing tips: Tuesday 10 December", "sentences": ["Fontwell 12.40 Muhtaris 1.10 Beforeall 1.40 Brantingham Breeze 2.10 Pete The Feat (nb) 2.40 Mixologist 3.10 Midnight Charmer 3.40 Tang Royal Southwell 12.00 Pensax Lad 12.30 Tobrata 1.00 Bunce 1.30 Dubai Hills (nap) 2.00 Even Stevens 2.30 Hussar Ballad 3.00 Ivy Port 3.30 Guishant Uttoxeter 12.20 Salford Lady 12.50 Ballinahow Star 1.20 Leviathan 1.50 Premier Portrait 2.20 Wintered Well 2.50 Molko Jack 3.20 Onenightinvienna"], "publicationDate": "2013-12-09T18:01:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/dec/09/yingluck-snap-election-thailand", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "The decision on Monday by Yingluck Shinawatra, Thailand&apos;s embattled prime minister, to dissolve parliament and call a snap general election seems unlikely to cure the latest violent spasm gripping the Bangkok body politic, stemming from more than a decade of indigestible north-south, rich-poor social divisions and visceral personality\u00a0politics. Despite the PM&apos;s ostensibly placatory announcement, protest leaders and opposition parties vowed to continue mass anti-government demonstrations, suggesting the proposed 2 February poll amounted to a trick to perpetuate the rule of the Shinawatra &quot;regime&quot;. But so far they have failed to come up with a viable alternative plan for running the\u00a0country. The standoff threatens further to undermine democratic governance in a country where military coups have been commonplace and where parties defeated in elections have rarely accepted their fate with grace or dignity. Some Thai political scientists, in the style of America&apos;s Tea Party, are now claiming that winning the most votes is not necessarily the most important qualification for legitimately holding political office. Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy PM who leads the protests, said early elections would make no difference. &quot;The dissolving of parliament is not our aim,&quot; he said. Suthep has instead been calling for a new prime minister to be chosen by King Bhumibol Adulyadej, Thailand&apos;s ageing and influential monarch. He has also floated a proposal for an appointed &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; comprising &quot;decent men&quot; whose main task would appear to be the reconfiguring of the electoral system to ensure Yingluck, and her exiled elder brother and former PM, Thaksin Shinawatra, never again hold political power. Suthep suggests his Platonic wise-men oligarchy would eventually give way to an elected government, but has not said how long this would take. Opportunistic opposition parties, who also abhor Thaksin and his kin, have shown a similar lack of responsibility. In 2010, then prime minister Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of an unelected government installed by Thaksin&apos;s opponents, survived a similar wave of street protests by pro-Thaksin &quot;red shirts&quot;. He had the army to thank for his rescue; about 90 people died during the unrest. Now Abhisit, leader of the main Democratic party opposition, is also refusing to say whether he will participate in the proposed February election. Most opposition MPs resigned from parliament on Sunday. &quot;House dissolution is the first step towards solving the problem,&quot; Abhisit said. &quot;Today, we march. I will walk with the people to Government\u00a0House.&quot; Yingluck&apos;s decision to allow Thailand&apos;s 66 million-strong population what is effectively a referendum on her Puea Thai government, which won in\u00a0a\u00a0landslide result in 2011, looks statesmanlike on the face of it, but is not quite what it seems. &quot;The government does not want any loss of life \u2026 At this stage, when there are many people opposed to the government from many groups, the best way is to give back the power to the Thai people and hold an election. So the Thai people will decide,&quot; she said in a televised speech. Yet the near certainty that Puea Thai will win again accounts for Suthep&apos;s and Abhisit&apos;s reluctance to go down the electoral route. While the opposition can count on support from middle-class Thais in Bangkok and the non-Muslim areas of the south and from pro-establishment royalists, they have been permanently outnumbered, electorally speaking, since Thaksin first won office in 2001 backed by the poorer, rural masses of the north and east. A telecoms billionaire whose populist presumption deeply offended traditional Thai hierarchies, Thaksin was deposed during his second term in 2006 by an army coup and fled the country two years later amid corruption and bribery allegations. Thaksin now lives in exile in Dubai, from where, his detractors allege, he controls the Bangkok government from a distance. The present unrest was sparked last month when Yingluck proposed an amnesty law that would have allowed her brother to return. Yingluck might also be congratulated for avoiding the violent clashes that have disfigured previous upheavals, and for keeping the army out of the fray. Thailand&apos;s military has staged or attempted 18 coups in the past 80 years, and is no stranger to political meddling. On the other hand, the generals, like the king, are no friends to the Thaksin clan. This time around, the army has said it does not want to get involved, although it has tried to mediate. Both sides have invoked the authority of the king to boost their positions. Both observed a truce last Thursday, the monarch&apos;s 86th birthday. But the reality is that Bhumibol is ill, frail and rarely seen. Nor is it wholly clear that the monarchy will survive his passing. Thais must find another way out of the blind alley into which they have blundered.", "title": "Yingluck's snap election will not cure Thailand's ills | Simon Tisdall", "sentences": ["Thaksin now lives in exile in Dubai, from where, his detractors allege, he controls the Bangkok government from a distance."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-09T20:02:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/middle-east-qatar-business-human-rights", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainability", "Human rights", "Middle East and North Africa", "Saudi Arabia", "Qatar"], "article": "In June this year, police reportedly dispersed a group of protestors outside Orange&apos;s headquarters in Amman, Jordan, with batons and tear gas. The protesting activists and journalists alleged Orange had helped stifle freedom of expression, by complying with a temporary government shut-down of nearly 300 online news websites. When my colleagues at Business &amp; Human Rights Resource Centre invited Orange to respond to this, it said: &quot;Nous ne souhaitons pas faire de commentaire sur ce sujet.&quot; (&quot;We do not wish to respond on this matter&quot;). A month later another scene, this time in Egypt. The Habi Center for Environmental Rights claimed that Helwan Fertilizers company was using a new &quot;thuggery law&quot; against residents of Arab Abu Saa&apos;id who were protesting against alleged pollution from its plant. This time the company did respond to us. It said that its emission levels are lower than nationally-permitted limits and pollution is far less than the coke plant that had preceded it on the same site. It also claimed the protestors were motivated primarily by demands to be employed at the plant, and that it took legal action because they had been obstructing the entrance to the plant, including with burning tyres. These two cases illustrate the complex environment for business and human rights in the Middle East. There is increasing scrutiny of and protest against company conduct. But frequently those protests are met with intimidation and force. There are close connections between government and business in many countries in the region (and strong influence by both over the mainstream media), which means that human rights and labour rights groups are often mistrustful of the private sector. At the same time, however, the private sector has an essential role to play if enough jobs are going to be generated to meet the 100 million challenge that the World Economic Forum has highlighted, looking to provide opportunities for the &quot;100 million youth between 15 and 29 years old ... in dire need of an economic future.&quot; On Tuesday last week for example, the council of Saudi Chambers and the IMF held an event in Riyadh specifically on the role of the private sector in creating jobs in the country. In the challenging environment of the Middle East many companies, whether headquartered there or outside the region, might be tempted to hold on to the local context and local laws to guide their operations. As the briefing that we launched today, Business &amp; Human Rights in the Middle East and North Africa, demonstrates, that is not enough \u2013 just as it is not enough in other parts of the world. Workers, and a civil society that is increasingly active on social media, know what the international expectations of business are: even if they don&apos;t cite those standards themselves. They include the ILO fundamental principles on freedom of association; the elimination of forced or compulsory labour; effective abolition of child labour; and the elimination of discrimination in employment. They also include the UN guiding principles on business and human rights. Bahrain, Qatar and Saudi Arabia were on the UN human rights council when it unanimously endorsed the UN guiding principles \u2013 and Jordan and Turkey co-sponsored the resolution endorsing them. As well as detailing the state duty to protect citizens from human rights abuses, they provide guidance on the independent corporate responsibility to respect, acknowledging that this responsibility exists &quot;over and above compliance with national laws and regulations protecting human rights&quot;. Many other guidelines that are well known in the Middle East and beyond, such as the IFC performance standards and ISO26000 guidance highlight that when national laws are in conflict with international standards \u2013 for example on freedom of association \u2013 companies should take steps to adhere to the latter. The UN Global Compact has issued a briefing note on ways to handle these situations. None of these standards alone go far enough to address root causes of human rights abuses by business. But if they are adhered to, the situation would be far better than it is at present. Our briefing summarises the exploitation faced by migrant construction workers in Gulf countries, including in Qatar in preparation for the 2022 World Cup that has been the subject of a major Guardian investigation. Change must come from the top, from Sheikh Tamim. But until it does, companies operating in the country do not have an excuse for exploitation. When the Building and Woodworkers International Union returned from their recent mission to Qatar, they said they met &quot;with many young men from Nepal, India, Bangladesh and the Philippines who have found that their dreams of improving their lives and their families have been shattered by the harsh realities of their living and working conditions in Qatar&quot;. Yet, they also said that they saw good working conditions at projects of the Spanish construction firm OHL and Norwegian aluminium firm Qatalum. FSI Worldwide is a Dubai-based recruitment company that helps make the business case for ethical recruitment \u2013 in January its chief executive, Tristan Forster, won the Business Leaders award to fight human trafficking. Workforces that are not exploited are more productive, trained for the work at hand; turnover is less frequent; employment costs can be less because corrupt middle men are eliminated from the chain. Other examples of companies aiming to do the right thing in a repressive environment include those who strive to empower women in the workplace in countries such as Saudi Arabia. As PepsiCo puts it on its website: &quot;Tailored programs enable progress. For example, in Saudi Arabia, where women represent less than 5% of the workforce, the lowest proportion in the world, we have constructed workplaces that respect local customs while enabling women to work and advance.&quot; Its Saudi team includes 25 women in both management and frontline roles. Human rights are not &quot;values&quot; imported from one region to another, and do not have to involve ignoring local contexts. They simply mean ensuring all people are treated with the same respect wherever they are in the world.

PowNews, an often provocative Dutch television show, decided to explore precisely how far football clubs in the Netherlands would go to secure funding from rich Arabs. After approaching officials at nine teams they received apparent encouragement from two executives at Den Bosch, currently 14th in the 20-team Eerste Divisie, Dutch football&apos;s second tier. An undercover PowNews video now widely available on the internet shows the fictitious Dubai-based &quot;Al Massir Group&quot; \u2013 represented by &quot;Sheikh Rashid bin Abdulaziz al-Massir&quot; \u2013 negotiating with the club over a potential \u00a340m investment. Den Bosch claim they were in on the joke all along but discussions between the fake sheikhs and two relatively junior employees, William Lord, the safety co-ordinator, and Guido van der Kamp, who works in the commercial department, were duly filmed in secret. The recording shows the latter pair proving extremely open to the idea of not only sacking their coach, Ruud Kaiser, but allocating separate entrances for men and women at the stadium, banning gay players from the club and barring alcohol sales. The lure of Middle Eastern money was seemingly such that a potential name change to Dragons Den Bosch, a switch in kit colour and even the suggestion that &quot;black [market] money&quot; be used to fund transfers were all deemed perfectly acceptable notions. Meanwhile Zeljko Petrovic, most recently Guus Hiddink&apos;s old assistant at Anzhi Makhachkala and before that the No2 to Avram Grant at West Ham United was suggested as Kaiser&apos;s replacement. The sting has shocked many in the Netherlands but Fred van der Horn, a Den Bosch director, is adamant he and everyone at the club were merely joining their television colleagues in having a bit of fun. &quot;We already knew it was a joke,&quot; he said. &quot;We played a game; we never went seriously into it.&quot; It seems some squad members possibly thought otherwise. Commenting on the squad&apos;s &quot;towel-head&quot; pictures, Benjamin van den Broek, Den Bosch&apos;s captain, said: &quot;We, as a group of players are ready to take over. Ha-ha.&quot; Email correspondence subsequent to filming \u2013 written in English and released by the TV company \u2013 suggests the playing staff&apos;s suspicions may not be quite without foundation. Following a full fortnight&apos;s worth of correspondence with lower-level club executives, the Den Bosch president, Maarten de Gruyter, finally intervened, raising a red flag. &quot;Although anxious to improve the overall level of our club by partnering up with a respectable and influential foreign investor, we&apos;re also very restrained in changing our club traditions,&quot; De Gruyter wrote. He then expressed surprise at being unable to find any information on the al-Massir Group anywhere and concern that neither the Dutch embassy in the United Arab Emirates nor his Dubai-based business associates were aware of their existence or, indeed, the sheikh&apos;s. &quot;There were email exchanges but we never took them seriously,&quot; Van der Hoorn said. &quot;We were on to them.&quot; He did, though, acknowledge that Kaiser is owed an explanation, along with Den Bosch&apos;s players. &quot;We will have to remedy this,&quot; he said. &quot;If the board decide I have to leave my post, I will accept that.&quot;", "title": "Den Bosch deny promising fake sheikh that they would ban gay players", "sentences": ["An undercover PowNews video now widely available on the internet shows the fictitious Dubai-based &quot;Al Massir Group&quot; \u2013 represented by &quot;Sheikh Rashid bin Abdulaziz al-Massir&quot; \u2013 negotiating with the club over a potential \u00a340m investment.", "He then expressed surprise at being unable to find any information on the al-Massir Group anywhere and concern that neither the Dutch embassy in the United Arab Emirates nor his Dubai-based business associates were aware of their existence or, indeed, the sheikh&apos;s. &quot;There were email exchanges but we never took them seriously,&quot; Van der Hoorn said."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-10T20:51:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/australia-news-blog/2013/dec/11/lavish-gifts-abbott-off-limits", "tags": ["Tony Abbott", "Australian politics"], "article": "Never look a gift horse in the mouth, so the saying goes, but for the modern politician a gift should be handled like a black snake.

Abhisit, 49, stands charged with the deaths of a 43-year-old man and 14-year-old girl during a military crackdown against protests in 2010, when 90 people were killed and 2,000 injured during violent protests against his leadership. The UK-born and Oxford-educated Democrat party leader was indicted along with his former deputy premier Suthep Thaugsuban \u2013 who has been leading month-long protests against the current PM, Yingluck Shinawatra \u2013 for authorising the use of live ammunition against protesters and deploying snipers. The two deny the charges against them. The political scientist Panitan Wattanayagorn \u2013 himself a former spokesman for Abhisit&apos;s government \u2013 told the Guardian the indictment could be used to stoke further protests calling for Yingluck&apos;s resignation, which have so far seen five people killed and hundreds injured. &quot;The timing of this formal charge by the state attorney could be seen by the demonstrators as an injustice \u2026 against their leaders, Mr Abhisit and Mr Suthep, which could be used at the rallies to increase the intensity of the protests,&quot; he said. &quot;As the police, Department of Special Investigations [Thailand&apos;s FBI] and state attorney are seen as tools of the current government, they may say this is a politically motivated case.&quot; Abhisit was released on \u00a334,280 bail and a pre-trial hearing is expected in March next year. Suthep, who in 2010 headed a crisis control centre that authorised &quot;live fire&quot; zones during the protests, did not attend Thursday&apos;s hearing, as he was leading further demonstrations against Yingluck&apos;s government, a spokesman said. &quot;It just so happens that he&apos;s in the middle of this movement and it&apos;s very important, so there&apos;s no reason he couldn&apos;t postpone [the court date],&quot; said Akanat Promphan of Suthep&apos;s People&apos;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC). &quot;This movement is not motivated by himself but by the people, and the people are not here to help Mr Suthep with his charges but because they want change. They want reform.&quot; The charges against Abhisit \u2013 who came to power after a 2006 military coup ousted Yingluck&apos;s brother, the former PM Thaksin \u2013 come at a time of significant political unrest. Hundreds of thousands of yellow-shirted anti-government protesters have taken to the streets demanding an end to Yingluck&apos;s government, which they see as a proxy administration led by her brother, who lives in self-exile in Dubai to escape corruption charges that he claims are politically motivated. Although Yingluck dissolved parliament on Monday and has called for snap elections, the protesters \u2013 who stand behind Abhisit and Suthep \u2013 want to see her ousted and an unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; installed. &quot;I will do everything to stop the next election,&quot; Suthep said of the planned snap polls. &quot;I&apos;m confident that I can do it.&quot; Ultra-royalists, such as Dr Tul Sittisomwong of the Citizen Protecting Homeland, have vowed to stand behind Abhisit and Suthep, whatever the charges against them. &quot;At the time, he was PM and he had to do [that] to keep the peace,&quot; said Tul of Abhisit&apos;s murder charges. &quot;I support Abhisit and if he needs a witness, I will agree to be a witness for him.&quot; Analysts warn that the indictment, coupled with Yingluck&apos;s call for elections, could further stoke an already volatile situation, sparking further protests and potential violence. Government supporters, known as red shirts, have warned that they will lead their own protests in support of Yingluck and that Suthep &quot;should be worried&quot; by their numbers. &quot;[Yingluck&apos;s party] Puea Thai have obviously raised the stakes by calling a snap election, essentially daring the opposition to &apos;put up or shut up,&apos;&quot; said the IHS Asia analyst Omar Hamid. &quot;[The] yellow-shirt protests are likely to continue, because an election was never the objective of the yellow shirts, as they know they are unlikely to win.&quot; However Suthep, a career politician who stepped down as opposition MP to lead these protests, remains undeterred. &quot;We will escalate our protest until you and the rest of the Shinawatra family are unable to stand it any more,&quot; Suthep publicly warned Yingluck this week. Suthep claims the government has violated the constitution in several ways and has vowed reform under his &quot;people&apos;s council&quot;. In return, he has been charged with insurrection, but as yet there has been no attempt to arrest him.", "title": "Thai opposition leader charged with murder", "sentences": ["Hundreds of thousands of yellow-shirted anti-government protesters have taken to the streets demanding an end to Yingluck&apos;s government, which they see as a proxy administration led by her brother, who lives in self-exile in Dubai to escape corruption charges that he claims are politically motivated."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-12T17:20:34Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2013/dec/13/cheap-trick-double-points-f1-nerve", "tags": ["Formula One", "Bernie Ecclestone", "Sport", "Formula One 2013", "Sebastian Vettel", "Formula One 2014"], "article": "If Sebastian Vettel sees it as a bad idea, perhaps it&apos;s time to think again. This week&apos;s announcement that Formula One will be awarding double championship points for the final race of the season, due to take place in Abu Dhabi next November, has not pleased the four-times winner of the world title. Perhaps even he regards it as yet another sign of a sport in big trouble, desperate to ward off the threats to its existence, almost all of which are of its own creation. Suddenly all sorts of gimmicks are being imposed on the sport of Juan Manuel Fangio and Jim Clark. In addition to the double-points wheeze, some genius has decided that individual drivers will carry the same racing number, between 2 and 99, throughout their careers, to be emblazoned for the first time on their helmets, with No1, as has long been the case, reserved for the reigning champion. The driver who claims the fastest lap in practice for each race will also be awarded points towards a new pole-position championship. And those who commit behavioural offences on the track will receive penalty points leading, when they reach a total of 12, to a one-race suspension. These are supposed to be the solutions to the problems faced by a sport whose ringmaster, Bernie Ecclestone, is fighting accusations in the high court of handing a $44m bribe to a now-jailed German banker in order to facilitate the sale of a majority share in the sport&apos;s commercial rights to a private equity firm, CVC Capital Partners; this firm continues to employ him as its CEO while spending the past seven years creaming off half of the sport&apos;s huge profits. Ecclestone claims the $44m was intended to prevent the German tipping off Britain&apos;s tax authorities to his alleged control of the offshore trust, which holds much of the estimated personal fortune of \u00a33bn he has accrued from his Formula One deals, something he also denies. Emily Thornberry, the shadow attorney general, told Newsnight on Thursday that she has long felt Ecclestone&apos;s financial affairs deserve scrutiny. &quot;What is the Serious Fraud Office for,&quot; she said, &quot;if not for investigating cases like this?&quot; In a better ordered world, more of CVC&apos;s profits would have been distributed between the teams and the race promoters, without whom the sport would not exist. Instead, more than half the teams are in some sort of financial distress and gifted young drivers are forced to stand aside in favour of those with personal sponsors. Many of the circuits \u2013 forced to pay vast fees to Ecclestone, who also keeps all the sponsorship, trackside advertising and corporate-hospitality revenue \u2013 are in a constant battle for survival. And as the foundations decay, the sport fiddles with gimmicks that, while intended to attract new audiences, continue to alienate those loyal to the principles that sustained it for more than a century. Who let the drivers&apos; behaviour deteriorate to the point where a disciplinary system is required in a sport that could once lay claim to a measure of dignity, even nobility? In a sport that is supposed to be dangerous \u2013 although perhaps not dangerous enough these days \u2013 any kind of offence ought to be punished by an instant ban. The penalty-point system effectively legitimises the kind of offences it is ostensibly being created to reduce. In recent years Formula One has been tarted up and weighed down with all sorts of nonsense. New circuits look as though they were laid out in vast shopping-mall car parks, with painted lines indicating the track boundaries. Devices such as DRS zones and Kers buttons are intended to disguise the sport&apos;s competitive shortcomings. A perfectly respectable tyre manufacturer finds itself being instructed to manufacture products with a limited life, to spice up the contest. Designers, hemmed in by technical regulations, waste their time on arcane wind-tunnel research with negligible relevance to the real world. And now here comes another bunch of cheap tricks, led by the double-points notion. The teams, who must have endorsed the decision, are concerned only with their own short-term interests. Clearly they are happy to distort the basis of their own championship, presumably glimpsing an antidote to Vettel&apos;s steamroller supremacy. In the longer perspective, however, Formula One has a good recent record of championships going down to the wire under the present scoring system \u2013 think of Kimi Raikkonen&apos;s last-gasp victory at Interlagos in 2007, or Lewis Hamilton snatching the title on the final corner at the same track in 2008, or Vettel dashing the hopes of Fernando Alonso and Mark Webber under the floodlights in Abu Dhabi two years later. To feel the need for a mechanism intended to ensure that every season reaches a cliff-hanging climax is to severely underrate the audience&apos;s intelligence. It&apos;s like expecting every Premier League season to be decided by a penalty shoot-out. When Chelsea won the Premier League in 2004-05 with a 12-point margin, or when Manchester United took the title three seasons in a row between 2007 and 2009, no one lost their nerve and demanded changes to the format. It&apos;s hard not to be cynical when looking at the sport&apos;s introduction of the double-points award in Abu Dhabi, newly reinstalled as the climactic race of the season. The UAE is where the money is, as golf decided when it created the Race to Dubai. As for the numbering idea, presumably this is an attempt to raise the income from the sales of merchandising, under the guise of making it easier to identify the drivers. But if that were a serious consideration, they would simply clear some of the space currently devoted to sponsors&apos; logos on the wings and bodywork. What Formula One needs is not the enforcing of reliability rules for engines and gearboxes, created to reduce costs. It needs more uncertainty, more surprises, more bad luck on the track. As a writer in Autosport magazine suggested this week, it could make a start by banning the pits-to-car radio transmissions that do nothing but infantilise the drivers. Get them making their own in-race decisions again, gambling on experience and intuition rather than relying on drive-by-numbers instructions from their engineers. The problem is that the sport&apos;s management is in the hands of a bunch of very clever people with a penchant for making stupid decisions based either on greed or an inability to see beyond their own front wheels. They haven&apos;t yet announced that the Formula One championship will henceforth be known as the Race to Abu Dhabi, but it&apos;s surely just a matter of time.", "title": "Cheap tricks which point to fact that  Formula One has lost its nerve | Richard Williams", "sentences": ["The UAE is where the money is, as golf decided when it created the Race to Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-13T13:59:18Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/15/dixons-half-year-profits-rise-expected", "tags": ["Dixons Retail", "Retail industry", "Tesco", "iPad", "Apple", "Computing", "Tablet computers", "Samsung", "Business", "Co-operative Group", "Smiths Group"], "article": "Ah, the traditional Christmas. The festive tree, the turkey, the mince pies\u2026 the unwrapping of the latest expensive piece of whizzy multimedia kit. That at least is the dream of Dixons Retail, and on Tuesday we will find out how close it is to reality. The business is pretty much last man standing in the electrical retail sector, having seen off Comet and likely to benefit from moves by Tesco to trim its electricals offering. Dixons has also been tidying up its own affairs, selling unwanted businesses in Turkey and Italy, as well as its European online-only business Pixmania, thus removing around \u00a346m of annual losses. Dixons&apos; half-year figures are expected to show profits of around \u00a323m before exceptional items, compared with a \u00a312m loss last time around. And with tablet computers still likely to be a festive must-have item, helped by the launches of the latest iPad and Samsung Galaxy models, the City is expecting good news. Analysts at Investec said: &quot;Tablet penetration is still relatively low, at 33% according to eMarketer. In computing, Dixons has a strong heritage and the category continues to innovate as Apple, Microsoft and Google all look to grow market share for their operating systems.&quot; So expect a post-prandial lull on 25\u00a0December as millions of app stores are scoured for the latest free games. Should Smiths investors be given a break? Breaking up is hard to do, and technology group Smiths seems to have been doing its best to prove the point. Despite a number of approaches for its medical business in recent times \u2013 private equity group Apax was said to be offering around \u00a32.5bn, California&apos;s Carefusion \u00a33bn \u2013 Smiths has held on to the division, although to be fair, it has made the usual noises about considering all options in the best interests of shareholders. The FTSE 100 company holds an investor day this Tuesday, mainly to talk about its John Crane oil and gas division. But questions about the future of the medical division should by rights also be on the agenda. Analysts at Morgan Stanley pointed out last week that there is consolidation under way in the medical sector, and they believed Smiths could get between \u00a32.5bn and \u00a34bn if it sold the business. They believe the shares are undervalued because the company is seen as a conglomerate, something a break-up of the business could resolve. Next week&apos;s meeting \u2013 being held in Dubai \u2013 should focus the attention of both investors and the company itself on the way forward. Co-op takes a step out of the mire Co-operative Bank has hardly been out of the headlines for all the wrong reasons, with &quot;crystal methodist&quot; Paul Flowers the most glaring example of how not to run a financial institution. But next week should finally see the resolution of the financial trauma surrounding the bank, as it plugs a \u00a31.5bn capital shortfall with a complex restructuring. Institutional bondholders, including hedge funds, vote tomorrow on whether to accept the proposed deal, that would see them take control of the bank, leaving the Co-operative Group itself owning just 30%. Given that retail bondholders, who were most likely to balk at the terms, voted in favour of the deal last week, this latest vote is expected to get the go-ahead. Wednesday would then see a court hearing to sanction the scheme, with settlement due on Friday. Meanwhile, former City minister Paul Myners is joining the Co-op Group \u2013 receiving a token \u00a31 annual salary \u2013 as an independent director and will conduct a review of its management structure.

He said the good news was that &quot;we&apos;re not dead yet&quot; but described the recommendations of the government-appointed independent commission led by Sir Howard Davies, as a &quot;fudgerama&quot;, saying his own proposal was now &quot;half in and half out&quot;. He argued that the commission had left a clear choice between going for Heathrow or his own option, arguing an extra runway at Gatwick airport south of London &quot;would not make a bean of difference because the airlines will still want to go to Heathrow&quot;. &quot;To build another runway in a west London suburb is completely crackers,&quot; he told BBC Radio 4&apos;s Today programme. He added that as soon as the third runway is completed in 2030, it would &quot;as sure as eggs are eggs be accompanied by an insatiable and vociferous clamour for a fourth runway&quot;. Even a third runway, he said, would be catastrophic for the quality of life consigning millions of people to extra noise pollution. He promised he could allay the fears of Davies about the cost of an airport on the Thames estuary saying the transport infrastructure would cost \u00a320bn, and the airport itself less. He indicated that Davies had agreed a stay of execution for his plan in the past few days, and said this would give him the chance to highlight to the commission the huge regeneration benefits for the east of London. Johnson said: &quot;What is being proposed at Heathrow is not some oven-ready peasy scheme. Both the Heathrow options require concreting the M25, probably closing it for five years and doing major realignments of the M4 at a cost of \u00a310bn. Why entrench a huge planning error and consign future generations to misery?&quot; Johnson acknowledged that he had yet to convince the commission that there was an inexorable demand for a hub airport but insisted that was clear from the demand curve for air travel in the past 50 years, pointing to what is happening in China India, Istanbul and Dubai. Johnson insisted he was not giving up on the estuary plan, but said of the three main options selected by Davies, Gatwick was &quot;the least injurious to Londoners&quot;. But he said it would not produce the competitive boost the country needs since the airlines would not migrate to Gatwick.

The US banker, often criticised for the level of his pay during his 15 years at Barclays, has become a nonexecutive director of a cash shell that has raised \u00a3200m from a stock market listing in London, although registered in the British Virgin Islands. Along with his co-founder, Ashish Thakkar \u2013 a British national now based in Dubai \u2013 Diamond has special &quot;founder-preferred shares&quot; in the new vehicle, known as Atlas Mara Co-Nvest, which give the pair payouts if the share price rises above a certain level. Atlas Mara Co-Nvest is based on Diamond&apos;s New York firm Atlas Merchant Capital and Thakkar&apos;s Mara range of businesses in 19 African countries. The two companies have invested $20m in the cash shell. Thakkar, often described as Africa&apos;s youngest billionaire, started his first IT companies in 1995 at the age of 15 in Uganda and is one of the World Economic Forum&apos;s young global leaders. In a stock market announcement, Atlas Mara Co-Nvest said that although it was not involved in any discussions with target companies it could make acquisitions anywhere in the world, and was likely to pick Africa. To counter concerns that shell companies often tie up investors&apos; cash without making deals, the business will be wound up in 12 months if no deals have been concluded by then. Arnold Ekpe, a former boss of Africa&apos;s Ecobank, has been appointed chairman of the company, on an annual fee of $125,000. The company has also named a number of non-executive directors, including Rachel Robbins, a former vice-president of the International Finance Corporation, who will get $85,000 a year. Ekpe is also receiving 50,000 five-year options over the shares, which listed at $10, and the non-executive directors are getting 37,500. Neither Diamond nor Thakkar is receiving any options or fees. The prospectus shows a higher fee, of $500,000, will go to Jyrki Koskelo, a former executive of the World Bank who will advise on potential acquisitions. The founder-preferred shares give a payout if the shares rise above $11.50 for 10 consecutive days after an acquisition. The payout is based on 20% of the difference between $11.50 and the share price. The 133-page prospectus said that while Barclays could face litigation over Libor fixing, Atlas Mara Co-Nvest does not believe it will have &quot;an adverse impact on the company or its ability to make the acquisition (or subsequent acquisitions) or on MrDiamond&apos;s ability to perform his role for the company&quot;.", "title": "Bob Diamond could gain millions from new African investment venture", "sentences": ["Along with his co-founder, Ashish Thakkar \u2013 a British national now based in Dubai \u2013 Diamond has special &quot;founder-preferred shares&quot; in the new vehicle, known as Atlas Mara Co-Nvest, which give the pair payouts if the share price rises above a certain level."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-17T10:32:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2013/dec/17/wpp-buys-stake-richard-attias-associates", "tags": ["WPP", "Advertising", "Media business", "Media", "WPP", "Business"], "article": "Sir Martin Sorrell&apos;s WPP, the global marketing services company, has taken a 30% stake in the company responsible for events including World Economic Forum in Davos.

The annuals remain as comprehensive and compelling as always, with both the literal and metaphorical weight that has always been a hallmark. They still have that special Timeform annual smell about them, too. It is just that in the age of big data \u2013 not to mention austerity and the soaring cost of paper \u2013 the \u00a370 Timeform annual appears to be a dangerously inefficient way to market information. There are significant tracts of the annuals upon which no human eye is ever likely to set. There may be owners who buy a copy to mark an obscure horse&apos;s achievements, or lack thereof, in the same way that parents feel obliged to record every minute of school sports day. And there are probably a fair few monomaniacs, too, who manage to work their way through the better part of one annual just in time to start on the next. And for as long as the numbers add up, so the annuals will continue on their splendidly old-fashioned way. But the vast majority of us just read the juicy bits, so what if the numbers stop adding up? Any print journalist will tell you that the internet has been busily stamping out inefficiencies in data marketing for two decades now, and quality and tradition rarely offer much defence. So while Timeform&apos;s Modern Greats (\u00a325) inevitably looks back, and does so by drawing on the annuals of the past 15 years or so, it may also offer a glimpse of the future, a time when even racing&apos;s most respected commentator has decided to extract the wheat from the chaff. If so, then the future will be different, but not necessarily unbearable. Timeform&apos;s Modern Greats is an obvious attempt to broaden the firm&apos;s market, since its most loyal supporters will have read 95% of what is inside it already in one of the annuals. It is also, in effect, a follow-up to Favourite Racehorses, its 1997 synthesis of several decades of work by its essayists, and which occupied the No1 position when the Racing Post compiled a list of the 100 Greatest Racing Books in 2005. It is quite an act to follow and the relatively limited time frame of Modern Greats means that it has been left 20 lengths at the tapes in terms of the number of candidates for inclusion. A few, in fact, are not just modern greats but active ones, too, in the case of Sprinter Sacre and, rather refreshingly, the Southwell specialist Dubai Hills, nominated as a &quot;great&quot; in a final chapter thrown open to writers from outside the Timeform operation. And, of course, they also have Frankel, whose final Timeform rating was a trump for all that had gone before. Frankel was responsible for several thousand words in the annuals of 2010, 2011 and 2012, and the best of these occupy 22 pages as the first and defining entry of the (latest) modern age. It cannot have been an easy task, since Timeform essays are supreme examples of the style, and difficult to condense into excerpts without losing the sense of flow. The format \u2013 excerpt, link, repeat \u2013 does take some getting used to, but what emerges is a memorable and compelling summary of this outstanding racehorse and what it was that made him so special. And only Timeform could mention Diogenes in relation to a racehorse without resorting to a hefty crowbar. Putting Frankel up first is a bold move because those that follow will, inevitably, be also-rans in relative terms. Black Caviar and Sprinter Sacre are the only other entries to get a chapter all to themselves, and the latter&apos;s story is, we hope, still far from complete. Three more horses \u2013 all from the Flat \u2013 make the cut for a chapter entitled &quot;The Other Greats&quot;, while the remainder of the best performers over the past decade and a half, Kauto Star included, receive only a generic chapter heading such as Globetrotters, Milers or Staying Chasers. If it is an attempt to provoke arguments, nominating Harbinger as a &quot;Great&quot; on the back of a single outstanding performance which he never had the chance to confirm will certainly rankle with plenty of readers, given the long list from both codes who are not accorded the same status, never mind anything like as much space. At least Kauto Star gets the lion&apos;s share of the 14 pages dedicated to the best staying chaser of recent decades and his rivalry with stablemate Denman. Peintre Celebre, who took a second and a half off the course record in winning the 1997 Arc and was rated just 3lb lower than Harbinger&apos;s 140, is dismissed in less than half a page. Timeform&apos;s Modern Greats is, in essence, a compilation album, the greatest hits from the past 14 years pulled together for the Christmas market. It has all the content that anyone could expect, but without the context that the annuals provide. As a result, it also lacks the commentary on weighty issues of the time which the once-a-year publication can provide.

The 17-year-old, who is the newly announced Rookie of the Year on the Ladies European Tour, has just admitted that, if she had not completed her home education, &quot;I would have probably still left school at 16. My friends are beauticians and hairdressers and stuff like that. My friends who are boys are mostly builders. So I&apos;d have probably gone down the beautician road \u2026 even if I would&apos;ve preferred becoming a spy.&quot; Hull achieved five second-place finishes in her first six tournaments. She was also the star performer in the Solheim Cup, the women&apos;s equivalent of the Ryder Cup, and the youngest player to be picked for either Europe or the United States. While some of her American counterparts vomited with nerves, Hull was startlingly assured. It&apos;s a shame, I joke, because such steely attributes would have been handy as a double agent. &quot;How do you know I&apos;m not one?&quot; Hull says, narrowing her eyes. It would be some cover, having the persona of the most promising young women&apos;s golfer on the planet. &quot;Yeah,&quot; she says, her poker-face breaking into laughter. &quot;Everyone thinks I&apos;m flying away to some golf tournament but I&apos;m actually on a secret spying mission. I could be doing that anyway. You never know \u2026&quot; Hull, instead, has been nominated for BT Sport&apos;s Action Woman of the Year \u2013 alongside more established champions such as Christine Ohuruogu, Ellie Simmonds and Laura Robson. She sits in their cafeteria and, because awards are becoming so familiar, tells me about her imaginary alter ego. &quot;When I was younger I used to have these obsessions of spying on my sisters. I had these little beeping things and if someone walked past it would beep. I also had a gun \u2013 which shot out flying saucers. I shot my sisters a few times. But most of the time I just spied on Nicole and Lisa. I don&apos;t think they knew I was doing it \u2013 I was that good.&quot; Eight years ago, when she was just nine, Hull won the British Ladies National Championship at Turnberry. Her manager, Joe McQuade, an old family friend, tells me a lovely story about how the lady captain of Kettering Golf Club picked up Hull on the way to the tournament. Hull was still so small she needed a booster seat. Once they reached the course, Hull headed out to compete in a championship for which 24,000 women had tried to qualify. They were down to the best amateurs in Britain but nine-year-old Charley Hull trounced them all \u2013 and jumped back on her booster seat for the journey home. &quot;I remember different things about that tournament,&quot; Hull says. &quot;It was really funny because I was so light I actually got blown over by the wind.&quot; Did she appreciate the significance of winning such a prestigious tournament? &quot;You know what?&quot; Hull asks, her eyes widening. &quot;I didn&apos;t want to hang around and get the trophy they&apos;d asked David Wilkie, the old Olympic swimmer, to hand over. I wanted to be inside playing on my Nintendo DS. I had this Harry Potter game that I loved.&quot; What prompted Hull to start hitting golf balls at the age of two? &quot;It was probably because my dad played the game. And my next-door neighbour, Ben, also played. We&apos;d toddle around in my garden with these plastic golf clubs and try to hit balls against different branches of a big tree. We were both pretty good.&quot; Ben, presumably, no longer lives next door to Hull&apos;s family home in Burton Latimer, near Kettering? &quot;He does \u2013 but he doesn&apos;t play golf any more. He went into football. But if he&apos;d carried on he would definitely have become a professional. He was ever so gifted. My dad says he had great hands.&quot; Hull won \u20ac135,994 on the European Tour this year, and so, presumably, Ben is kicking himself for giving up golf? &quot;Probably,&quot; Hull says with a shrug. &quot;I stopped hanging out with him a couple of years ago because we went to different schools. He was a good lad.&quot; There is something reassuringly normal about Hull \u2013 and, unlike many prodigies, she held on to her childhood even if she was so skilled at golf that her parents agreed to take her out of school and have her tutored at home from the age of 13. &quot;I always wanted my childhood,&quot; she says. &quot;Like now I just want to be an ordinary teenager and have banter with my friends on Facebook \u2013 even if a lot of them are older, like 22 or 23. I always get on with mature people but we can still be silly and have fun.&quot; McQuade insists that Hull&apos;s mental strength is her most formidable quality. &quot;Charley&apos;s totally different between the ears,&quot; he says. Hull likes simple phrases \u2013 &quot;All I really do is just hit it, find it and hit it again&quot; and &quot;I&apos;m not going to die if I hit a bad shot, am I?&quot; \u2013 which fuse teenage nonchalance with worldly pragmatism. She also suggests that the contrasting story of her Polish grandmother, Irena Pernak, might explain her own apparently fearless character. &quot;Her life was amazing,&quot; she says of her mum&apos;s mother. &quot;I&apos;ve not read the book [The Red Beads] written about her but that&apos;s where I get my competitiveness from. She had to fight a lot.&quot; Is her grandmother still alive? &quot;Oh, yeah. She&apos;s in an old people&apos;s home.&quot; &quot;A care home,&quot; McQuade corrects her gently from an adjoining table. &quot;Right,&quot; Hull nods. &quot;Joe, how old is Babi? About 87?&quot; McQuade establishes later that Irena is 91. Hull looks shy as she tries to explain her extraordinary story. &quot;I know Babi was taken by the Russians and put in a prisoner-of-war camp. She met my grandad and they got taken to Siberia and Iran and all them countries \u2013 and she escaped. Joe, do you know the details?&quot; It emerges that Pernak worked for the Polish resistance in the second world war \u2013 after her town, Lvov, was invaded by the Germans and then the Russians. At the age of 15, Russian soldiers forced her on to a cattle truck which took her to a labour camp in Siberia. Eventually, Pernak was part of a small group who escaped. They made the long trek across Siberia, scavenging for food, and ended up in Baghdad where she met a Polish solider, Josef, who became her husband. After the war, Polish refugees such as Josef and Irena Pernak were given the choice of starting a new life in America, Argentina or Britain. They decided to start again in England \u2013 and found themselves in Kettering. Hull points out that her golfing battles are almost absurdly insignificant in comparison to her grandmother&apos;s struggles. &quot;I should&apos;ve asked her more about it but you know what you&apos;re like when you&apos;re young. My mum would try and get me to speak Polish but I wasn&apos;t having it.&quot; Does she feel Polish in any way? &quot;I&apos;m so English. But I feel a bit Polish when I speak about my grandmother. Babi&apos;s got Parkinson&apos;s but I get my fight from her. And I&apos;m fearless on the golf course because I&apos;m just hitting a little white ball. It&apos;s not life and death. I played in Dubai the other week. I was in really thick rough. I needed to get it over the water and I didn&apos;t think I could do it. But then I thought, &apos;It&apos;s just a game. It&apos;s not like I&apos;m going to die if I hit it in the water.&apos; So I hit it, hard, cleared the water, and plonked it on the green. I was like: &apos;Hmmm, that&apos;s good.&apos;&quot; A similar expression echoed in the minds of the two coaches who have done most to hone her instinctive brilliance. As soon as they saw her play, Kevin Theobald [the pro at Kettering golf club] and Lee Scarbrow [who mentored Ian Poulter] realised that they were witnessing a remarkable talent. &quot;Kevin got me hitting it hard,&quot; Hull says. &quot;I was hitting the ball like a girl and he&apos;d say: &apos;No. Hit it like a man.&apos;&quot; I was about six when he told me that. Lee got my technique really good. He tidied me up and Lee is still my main coach. The first time Lee saw me I was nine. He had me hitting all kinds of shots \u2013 flopping it over trees, chipping it round bushes. It was weird. I was just gifted. At my auntie&apos;s parties I&apos;d stand on a football. On the other side of the garden there was a basket about where that man in the orange T-shirt is [Hull points to the distant figure of a BT man in the cafeteria]. I&apos;d have the football on one leg and I&apos;d chip the golf ball into the basket.&quot; She produced more party tricks at this year&apos;s Solheim Cup \u2013 particularly in the singles when Hull crushed America&apos;s Paula Creamer, the former world No2 and major winner, 5&amp;4. Hull then promptly asked Creamer to autograph her golf ball. &quot;It was for my mate,&quot; she says. &quot;James wanted Paula Creamer&apos;s signed ball. He was very happy. I said: &apos;That&apos;s worth a few bob \u2026 don&apos;t you sell it.&apos;&quot; Scarbrow claims that Hull, more than Poulter, is the most talented golfer he has coached. But she seems more excited to have won a Rolex watch as Rookie of the Year \u2013 and only mildly irked that she could not receive it this month in Dubai. &quot;It was the Omega Ladies tournament so I couldn&apos;t get my Rolex then. I&apos;ll get it soon. But I haven&apos;t really spoiled myself apart from two things. When I played my first tournament in Morocco and finished second I bought myself a Mulberry handbag. That was cool. After the Solheim I bought a second Mulberry handbag. I still love Topshop and Zara \u2013 but my fashion sense is getting a bit more expensive because I&apos;m doing really well.&quot; She whips out her phone and starts showing me photographs of her and her older sisters shopping in John Lewis in Milton Keynes. &quot;Mum took the photos so they&apos;re pretty bad \u2026&quot; Hull laughs and I suggest it must be good to put the clubs away for a while. &quot;No,&quot; she protests, &quot;I&apos;ll never put them away. Me and my mates are going to Mallorca for five days \u2013 they&apos;re good golfers so we&apos;ll have five fun rounds. I never stop practising. I&apos;d feel guilty if I did. I like the feeling of accomplishment. If I go shopping in the afternoon it always feels important that I&apos;ve practised in the morning. Even on Christmas Day I&apos;ll hit a few putts in the garden while Dad is making breakfast.&quot; After finishing sixth in the European Order of Merit, Hull looks ready to achieve her ultimate ambition. &quot;I want to be the best golfer in the world. I want to do that by the time I&apos;m 21. Until then it&apos;s a learning curve but I&apos;m going to get much better. And you know what? I reckon becoming world No1 will be even better than being a spy.&quot; Hull has been shortlisted for the BT Sport Action Woman Awards.

Their new coaching arrangement, which took tennis by surprise this week, could be a great fit. Or it could all be over by Christmas \u2013 next year, not this one. Quite why the German has agreed to cut into his agreeable schedule as a television pundit (how easy a gig is that for a former world No1 with a good line in off-the-wall quips?) to return to the grind of the ATP Tour is slightly easier to understand than why Djokovic needed a new coach in the first place \u2013 his game is not exactly crying out for an overhaul. Certainly he was disappointed to add just the Australian Open to his CV in 2013, but the 26-year-old reached the finals of the other three majors and lost to inspired tennis by great players each time: Rafael Nadal, twice, and Andy Murray. On the other hand, Nadal did leapfrog him to No1 in the world, and Djokovic did not like that \u2013 as was evident in his powerful win over the Spaniard at the ATP World Tour Finals in London. So this is the perfectionist in action. This is the man who allowed himself one square of chocolate to celebrate beating Murray in the Australian Open final. This is the man whose obsession with food is so complete he was inspired to write in his quirky 2013 tome, Serve To Win: &quot;To ensure my diet is the best possible, I get a blood test at least every six months to check my levels of vitamins and minerals and see whether my body is producing higher levels of anti-bodies, an indication I might be developing a sensitivity to a certain food. I sometimes use biofeedback machines to test my stress level.&quot; However, there is not much wrong with the Serb&apos;s game that a bit of fine-tuning at the net couldn&apos;t fix, so Becker looks as if he might be a very expensive volley coach doubling up as a high-profile motivator. As an energetic all-courter, Becker spent plenty of time killing points on the full behind a powerful serve, although it is inconceivable that Djokovic will be charging in from the baseline (his preferred place of work) on serve too often. Instead, he will look for incremental changes to his game that might be apparent in those close-quarter exchanges where his tentative racquet has sometimes let him down on key points. More fundamental to the success of their partnership will be how they get on off the court, and how Becker might sustain Djokovic&apos;s already solid sense of self-worth. Becker will trek with Djokovic&apos;s substantial team through airports and hotels in Melbourne, Paris, London and New York for the majors, as well as Dubai, Miami, Monte Carlo, Rome, Cincinnati and Shanghai for the Masters events. It sounds glamorous, and it is \u2013 but it is also a lot of jet lag, a lot of room service, a lot of hard work, and that is a recipe for stress - or a quick spell on one of Novak&apos;s biofeedback machines. The relevant dynamic will be Becker&apos;s relationship with Djokovic&apos;s box, already a Serbian version of a travelling frat party. Becker is taking over from the 48-year-old Slovak Marian Vajda, who reached a high of 34 in the world and who has guided Djokovic&apos;s career for the past seven years. Vajda will be in the background and seems to have taken his demotion in good grace. &quot;Becker&apos;s assignment will not affect much my position in the team,&quot; Vajda said, &quot;since I will do all I can for Novak, just like I did before. On the other hand, choosing Boris as the head coach is a good solution. I am sure we will get along very well, and that Novak will continue to progress.&quot; For further insight, Djokovic, again from his book: &quot;I travel everywhere with my team: my manager, Edoardo Artaldi, who keeps me on schedule and some; my physiotherapist, Miljan Amanovic, who monitors my physical well-being; my coach, Marian Vajda, and assistant coach Dusan Vemic, who makes sure my technique never varies; and my girlfriend, Jelena Ristic, who cooks with me, trains with me, and keeps me on an even keel.&quot; If that sounds like a backstage take from This Is Spinal Tap, there is clearly an established posse for Boris to crash. Tellingly, Djokovic adds: &quot;Most of my inner circle is Serbian; they share the same terrible, war-torn past, and understand what it took for me to get to this point in life \u2013 and how impossible it once seemed.&quot; That is not to say Becker, the most sociable of tennis animals, will not fit in. But it may be a challenge. It is being said that Djokovic is copying Murray, who appointed another legend from the past in Ivan Lendl (one of Becker&apos;s fiercest adversaries) but that is too simplistic. It would be perverse if he hired Becker just to ape Murray. And there is no guarantee that Becker can emulate Lendl in coming virtually untested to the job of coaching to find almost instant success. Celebrity coaches do not guarantee results, as Jimmy Connors&apos;s one-tournament gig in Cincinnati with an injured and out-of-sorts Maria Sharapova illustrated, although Becker has been closer to the game than Connors in recent years and is probably more aware of what awaits him. Whichever way it goes, it will make for good entertainment: especially when Boris and Ivan line up opposite each other in their respective player boxes, possibly at the Australian Open next month.", "title": "Novak Djokovic's search for perfection leads him to Boris Becker | Kevin Mitchell", "sentences": ["Becker will trek with Djokovic&apos;s substantial team through airports and hotels in Melbourne, Paris, London and New York for the majors, as well as Dubai, Miami, Monte Carlo, Rome, Cincinnati and Shanghai for the Masters events."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-19T09:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2013/dec/19/enhance-brain-power", "tags": ["Efficiency", "Guardian Small Business Network", "Small business", "Business"], "article": "When you run your own business, the pressure to get the most out of your working hours and to come up with brilliant ideas on the spot is immense. But study of the brain and the way people work shows that 10-hour days in the office are not necessarily the right way to achieve productivity and creativity. To get your day off to the right start, write your to-do list first thing in the morning, not the night before, says Amy Brann, author of Make Your Brain Work. &quot;Prioritisation is a brain-energy-intensive process, so you need to do that at a time where you can think clearly,&quot; she says. She says that the old advice about taking breaks to improve efficiency is true. &quot;Your prefrontal cortex, the area of your brain involved in cognitive work (planning, decision making, thinking) gets tired easily,&quot; says Brann. &quot;The best breaks are things that get your heart pumping, stimulate your appreciation for life or make you laugh.&quot; So going for a run, playing a game or having a joke with colleagues is not skiving off, but the best way to be the most productive. And switching from writing a report to checking your emails doesn&apos;t count. &quot;It needs to be from a cognitive task to something else,&quot; says Brann. It can be easier to work efficiently when you run your own business. Jonny Weston says the motivation that led to him setting up his design studio, itcouldbelikethis, is usually enough to get him through his working day. &quot;If you do something you like, you&apos;ll learn, work and rest better than if you don&apos;t,&quot; he says. Faye Andrews, who co-founded the sports communications specialists, The Emilia Group, says it&apos;s easier to be efficient when you run your own business because you can work to your own natural rhythm. &quot;I&apos;m not a morning person. My optimum day, if I&apos;m just working straight through with no meetings, is 11am to 7pm,&quot; she says. Sometimes small business owners not only need to be productive, but creative, to come up with a killer new idea. Rod Judkins, a painter and teacher at Central Saint Martin&apos;s art college, advises businesses on creative thinking and has written a book, Change Your Mind, which argues that creativity is not something you are, but something you believe you are. &quot;Creativity is a skill that everyone can learn, and everyone can benefit from,&quot; he explains. Judkins says that fear of failure is a huge obstacle to creativity. &quot;People are so worried about notching up a failure that they become too frozen to do anything,&quot; he says. &quot;In the work environment, there is often pressure to be seen as sensible and logical. This stops people suggesting anything that might be seen as crazy.&quot; Judkins sites Hubert Cecil Booth&apos;s idea of sucking dust up in a vacuum cleaner rather than blowing it away as a concept that was laughed at first but has become the norm. Doing daily tasks the opposite way, or in the opposite order, encourages creativity in the workplace, Judkins suggests. He ran a creativity workshop with a Dubai soap opera who had run out of ideas and suggested that the team \u2013 camera people, script writers, actors \u2013 swapped roles to stimulate new ways of working. &quot;At first they were angry and resistant, but they eventually opened up and had a go,&quot; he says. &quot;Fear of failure vanished because the weight of expectation had been lifted. New, original ideas poured out.&quot; Many small business owners report being struck by inspiration just as they are falling asleep. Justin Hillier, who runs a translation business called Justification emails himself when he thinks up the perfect turn of phrase just before drifting off. Andrews keeps a notebook by her bed. Weston says he gets his best ideas when he&apos;s feeling child-like. &quot;The ease and playfulness with which children think can generate lots of new ideas,&quot; he says. &quot;Most people find that their best ideas come at times when they aren&apos;t &apos;working&apos;,&quot; agrees Brann. &quot;Rarely do people share stories of brainwaves when they are sat in front of their computer. One of the best strategies for coming up with a great creative idea is to stop trying.&quot; But once you have an idea, it&apos;s important to develop it straight away. &quot;You get a shot of energy and excitement from an idea,&quot; says Judkins. &quot;If you put work aside for a while and come back to it, you lose that excitement and start to question what you do, doubt sets in and the energy level drops.&quot; So, when the lightbulb appears there&apos;s no more excuses for taking breaks \u2013 it&apos;s time to get to work.

Meanwhile, the dented doors of the arrivals building slowly disgorged dazed and exhausted oil workers in filthy overalls. They had fled to the capital from the further reaches of the world&apos;s youngest country, on the first leg of journeys home, bringing with them news of factional fighting that has taken the country to the brink of civil war. Many of them such as Hassan Ali, a Pakistani engineer, with dark circles around his eyes, had just escaped from Unity state with terrifying accounts of killing in the vast oil fields that feed oil production in both Sudans. For the last three days terrified oil workers have listened to the carnage beyond the perimeter. &quot;It was Sudanese killing Sudanese,&quot; he said. &quot;They were killing each other with stones and knives,&quot; said one of his colleagues before making a cut-throat gesture. A third man, who gave his name as Dabeer, spoke of one attacker whom he had seen chopping the hands from victims. The men said that at least 16 people had died, many of them ordinary South Sudanese out of uniform. On their way to the airstrip in Unity town they had seen scores of scorched huts. &quot;There were more than 20 burnt to the ground,&quot; said Ali. Unity state, which provides much of the crude on which South Sudan&apos;s fledgling economy relies, has become the centrepiece of a power struggle between government forces and an emerging armed opposition. A stream of defections by senior military officers has split the Sudan People&apos;s Liberation Army (SPLA), with Major General James Koang Choul, commander of the division that controls the state, emerging as the latest to turn his back on President Salva Kiir yesterday. Heavy fighting between ethnic Dinka, who hail from the same tribe as the president, and the Nuer kinsmen of the fugitive former vice president Riek Machar have been struggling for control of the oil which is pumped by Chinese and Malaysian companies. With a haze coming off the rough concrete blocks, outside Juba&apos;s squalid airport snaking lines of hundreds of Chinese oil workers tried to hide from the sun by putting coats and T-shirts over their heads. Song Liu had been waiting for nearly four hours for his company, the China Petroleum Engineering &amp; Construction Corporation (CPECC) to get him out via Dubai to Beijing. &quot;There are some people who have died up there,&quot; he said of the fields in Unity. &quot;We are all leaving.&quot; All around him men and women in their khaki overalls with CPECC badges trudged slowly forward while foremen barked orders. Nearby Saeed Mansour, an Indian freshly arrived in Juba from Unity state, spoke of emergency shutdowns at four oil facilities in the state while fighting raged around them. One week on from a dispute in South Sudan&apos;s presidential guard that escalated into street fighting in the capital and accusations of a coup, thousands of foreign nationals have crowded the airport to escape with RAF flights and US airforce transport planes, while oil companies scramble to evacuate personnel. Meanwhile, an attempted airlift by US forces from the restive state of Jonglei ended in their aircraft being fired upon by militia loyal to the rebel commander Peter Gadet. US helicopters were en route to an evacuation site near the state capital of Bor when they came under fire with four American personnel wounded. &quot;The aircraft diverted to an airfield outside the country and aborted the mission,&quot; the US Africa command said in a statement. In the red dust outside the airport among the throng of soldiers, oil workers and South Sudanese waiting to leave Juba, James Marial Achak was still struggling to comprehend his own good fortune. He was one of the lucky few to catch the last flight out of Akobo, a tense outpost to the far east of South Sudan where a UN base was overrun on Friday, resulting in the deaths of two Indian peacekeepers. An ethnic Dinka, he was in the UN outpost just hours before it was stormed by a mob of two thousand Nuer youths, many of them armed. &quot;If I hadn&apos;t got on that plane I would have died,&quot; said the aid worker. &quot;My children would have been orphaned.&quot; His friend and fellow Dinka, Deng Majok was not so fortunate. When the crowd swarmed around the small base firing weapons, the Indian peacekeepers were forced to let them in. The UN soldiers were then tricked into gathering nearly two dozen Dinkas, mainly local government officials into one place with assurances that they would be protected from the mob. Once in the same spot several men opened fire on the peacekeepers, killing two of them and hitting a third in the chest. Then they massacred the Dinka. Majok survived by covering himself with the corpses of the others and not responding when one of the crowd trod on him. He was later smuggled out of Akobo as far as Malakal, in Upper Nile state. &quot;There was nothing the peacekeepers could do,&quot; said Marial Achak, who had reached his friend by phone on Friday night. &quot;The Nuer were so many and they were so few.&quot; In Juba itself a form of calm and normality has returned to some parts of the city. Shops have reopened and civilian traffic has returned to the streets where only a few days ago battles raged between different army factions. But there are signs everywhere of what has passed. A battle tank is parked next to the entrance to the president&apos;s residence and a trio of pick up trucks mounted with anti-aircraft guns are parked on the corner. Only a few hundred metres away, the residence of President Kiir&apos;s rival, Riek Machar, is pockmarked with craters from heavy calibre bullets and a corner wall has been demolished by artillery. &quot;This calmness is ambiguous,&quot; said Patrick Kapukha, a Kenyan aid worker with four years&apos; experience in the country. &quot;A cycle of revenge and fear is building momentum.&quot; He said that his staff were relaying reports of large-scale mobilisation among different ethnic communities intent on revenge for what they see as targeted killings. &quot;The leaders have got to come together and do so on television or this is going to get much worse,&quot; he warned.", "title": "Fleeing workers tell of brutal killings as South Sudan edges towards civil war", "sentences": ["Song Liu had been waiting for nearly four hours for his company, the China Petroleum Engineering &amp; Construction Corporation (CPECC) to get him out via Dubai to Beijing."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-21T21:42:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/dec/22/abu-dhabi-happiness-island-misery", "tags": ["United Arab Emirates", "Employment", "Bangladesh", "Pakistan", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Global development", "Migration and development"], "article": "     It is one of the world&apos;s largest construction projects \u2013 to turn a desert island, known only for its turtles and soft sand dunes, into the greatest intellectual and cultural powerhouse of the Middle East. Saadiyat Island (&quot;Happiness Island&quot; in Arabic), a once uninhabited stretch of coastal desert close to Abu Dhabi&apos;s city centre, is steadily being converted by tens of thousands of migrant workers into a $27bn (\u00a316.5bn) cultural metropolis. The centrepieces will be a New York University campus, a $1.3bn Jean Nouvel-designed Abu Dhabi Louvre and the Frank Geary-designed Guggenheim. Close by, the British Museum is chief partner on the Zayed National Museum, created by Norman Foster. Along with 600,000-year-old cave art and abstract expressionism, the National Museum will include glass cases of memorabilia dedicated to the founder of the United Arab Emirates, Sheikh Zayed al-Nahyan. Already, the growing hub is surrounded by five-star hotels and hundreds of luxury villa and apartments. But amid the splendour, opulence and massive investment, there is a dark side to life on Happiness Island, particularly if you are unlucky enough to be one of the foreign legions of migrant workers charged with building the dream. In a three-month investigation, the Observer has uncovered evidence of intimidation, strike-breaking, mass riots and an employment system trapping thousands of labourers on poverty pay. It was not supposed to be like this. At the outset the Louvre, Guggenheim and New York University paused before agreeing to become involved in the Abu Dhabi projects, fearing the Gulf&apos;s reputation for harsh working conditions would cause uproar among board members, donors and students. It was insisted that worker rights would be guaranteed. The cultural institutions involved point to an independent audit of working conditions commissioned by the Tourism Development and Investment Company (TDIC), the main developer on Saadiyat. A second audit report is expected to be delivered this month. The first, which was published in December 2012, found that, while the TDIC &quot;faces significant challenges ... in a region with established practices and norms&quot; when it comes to working conditions, there had been improvements \u2013 for example, in relation to allowing workers access to their passports. New York University, the only non-TDIC project on Saadiyat, said it had its own independent auditors to assess compliance with agreed standards. Meanwhile, to reassure its foreign partners, the UAE has built the world&apos;s greatest labour camp, complete with manicured cricket grounds, a chess centre, a multilingual library with works by Ayn Rand and Barack Obama, the UAE&apos;s first multi-denominational prayer hall, film screening rooms, tug-of-war competitions, a coffee shop and landscaped grounds. Regular government press releases show groups of smiling dignitaries who have come to admire the Saadiyat Construction Village, while promotional videos show smiling workers playing cricket in spotless whites. &quot;The only thing these men lack is room service,&quot; Nabil al-Kendi, chief development officer for TDIC,\u00a0told an international conference last year.\u00a0 So far, so admirable. But to encounter an alternative reality, one needs only to travel 20 miles from Saadiyat village, along sandy desert roads, to the most remote corner of the Mafraq industrial area, the location of Al Jaber Construction&apos;s Worker City No. 1. Here, workers are surrounded not by landscaped gardens, but by a trail of rubbish trucks snaking their way around the camp to the city tip next door. Next to the tip, on top of a hill, sits the city&apos;s sewage treatment plant, where lorries dump raw human faeces, the stench of which wafts down to the camp on the warm evening air. At the back of the camp is a large stretch of desert wasteland, where workers cut up raw meat and fish surrounded by piles of rubbish, stepping on shaky planks of wood to avoid the streams of polluted water running down from a nearby industrial reservoir. The company insists it has tried to shut this place down many times but the men would not listen. Meanwhile, workers complain of bad food and needing somewhere to cook their own meals.\u00a0 The tales from inside the camp are poignant and pitiful. Take the case of Mohammed Arif, whom the Observer finds climbing the stairs using a cheap, ill-fitting artificial leg donated by the Red Crescent. His stump is red and bruised and Arif is in constant pain, but the company refuses to move him from the cramped third-floor bedroom he shares with eight other men.\u00a0 &quot;My big hope is to go back to India, to Jaipur city. They make good artificial legs. I want one of those legs, they are light, not cheap like this one,&quot; he says.\u00a0 Arif got his Red Crescent leg only in November after his employer, Al Jaber Construction, refused to pay for one. For a year he had to get around on one leg and a pair of crutches he bought in Abu Dhabi. &quot;I could not balance on one leg, I fell down the stairs many times,&quot; he says.\u00a0 He shows the spot at the back of his head that smashed into the stairs in his worst fall. &quot;My head was bleeding, but I still went to work.&quot;\u00a0 Arif lost his leg in November 2012 \u2013 he claims a barrel of waterproof chemicals fell on him in a store room on Saadiyat, where Al Jaber is building more than 1,000 luxury villas.\u00a0The company is adamant that Arif had a pre-existing condition that led to the loss of his leg. Al Jaber has refused all requests by Arif and a supervisor to allow him to sleep in ground-floor accommodation. He has also fought an unsuccessful court case to try to get the company to pay for his artificial leg and medical bills. &quot;Why don&apos;t they just let him on the ground floor? All year we see him on one leg trying to get to the top of the stairs,&quot; said one Al Jaber official who wished to remain anonymous. A short drive from Arif&apos;s camp, past sheets of sand that frequently cover the road, lies the sprawling, featureless complex of Worker City No.\u00a02, home to hundreds of workers on the Louvre site, along with over 20,000 other men. Here, we meet Hamdan (whose name has been changed to protect his identity). Hamdan is from the mountains of Pakistan. His face is worn with care. He paid $1,624 (\u00a31,000) to a Pakistani recruiter who told him he would have a job with the UAE&apos;s largest construction firm, Arabtec, as &quot;a carpenter in Dubai&quot;, earning between $217 and $300 a month. When he arrived in Dubai, he was placed in a vast industrial zone outside the city, where he learned he would be working six days a week on the &quot;museum site&quot; in Abu Dhabi, earning just $160 a month. Arabtec had already taken his passport and he was trapped. His only choice was to work for 10 months \u2013 11 hours a day, with an extra two hours&apos; travel time, to repay the agent before he could start to save anything for his family.\u00a0 &quot;They cheat us,&quot; he says. &quot;I would tell anyone not to come here.&quot; Beside him sits another Arabtec worker, &quot;Omar&quot;. He says he was assaulted by a camp boss just days earlier, after they discovered he had made a complaint to the police. &quot;He was very angry. He hit me hard in the chest and he said: &apos;You never go the police. Not even if you are being killed. Never&apos;.&quot;\u00a0 Living conditions for migrant workers elsewhere can be even worse. The Observer followed one bus coming out of the New York University construction site, the only non-TDIC project on Saadiyat. It led to a filthy, overcrowded camp housing 43 Bangladeshi workers at the heart of the polluted, industrial Musaffah area, next to car repair and welding businesses. There the men, hired to paint the campus, complained of being trapped by recruitment fees that exceeded a year&apos;s salary and of the high cost of even the most basic healthcare. Some, hired from myriad unregulated subcontractors, had to pay for their own work clothes on a salary of \u00a3149 a month. The men were crammed nine or 10 to a windowless room measuring 13x14ft, and had to put up a sheet over the corridor toilet for privacy. All said they hated the camp and had been tricked by their recruiters. One man said: &quot;Look how we live. We are no better than animals. That is all we are to them. Sheep that are to be sold, and nobody in the world is listening.&quot; Challenged by the Observer to explain why the evidence suggested that only a small minority of the workers on the island appeared to be living in the Saadiyat village, a TDIC spokeswoman said that &quot;in principle&quot; all workers are housed on Saadiyat. Last May, the frustration and resentment felt by Abu Dhabi&apos;s migrant workers boiled over. In a country in which trade unions, strikes and protests are strictly prohibited, thousands of Arabtec workers went on strike. For a full day, the Louvre site fell silent. By 2am, workers could be seen gathering in groups of 30 or 40 in the Saadiyat Construction Village, listening to strike leaders, while police were assembling at the camp entrance. By the next morning a combination of the Labour Ministry, the police and Arabtec bosses had confronted the workers head on. The strike leaders were arrested and mass deportations began. Arabtec warned that &quot;this unwarranted stoppage was instigated by a minority who will be held accountable for their actions&quot;. Dubai police estimated that more than 460 workers were &quot;helped to go home&quot;, but the Arabtec workers said the real figures are much higher.\u00a0 In an apparent effort to divide the men, the deported Bangladeshi workers were replaced by Pakistanis, which soon became a new source of strife. In August, riots broke out between rival groups. Workers described men being beaten with lump hammers and stabbed with spears in the dining halls. Golf carts, normally used to carry diplomats around on tours, were being used to ferry injured workers to ambulances. Video smuggled to the Observer from within the camps shows men jumping out of windows to escape the onslaught, while police fire into the air to try to stop the rampage. One Louvre worker said he was sure he was going be killed. &quot;I was hiding in my room, praying to God for mercy. I could hear the screams outside. They came to our room and we could see they were Pakistanis. I shouted in Urdu: &apos;We are Pakistanis. Don&apos;t kill us!&apos; Don&apos;t kill us!&quot; Three months later, the cream of the global art industry gathered for Abu Dhabi Art, a fair that showcases work on the Louvre, Guggenheim and Zayed National museums. Red carpets were rolled out for dignitaries and Asian waiters carried canap\u00e9s to the milling crowds. Guggenheim director Richard Armstrong said the museum was working closely with its partner, TDIC, to provide &quot;exemplary&quot; treatment of workers.\u00a0 Louvre Abu Dhabi architect Jean Nouvel said he had not visited the Saadiyat Construction Village, but had visited the Louvre site the previous day and saw nothing unusual. &quot;I saw very good conditions at work today,&quot; he said. Both the Louvre and the Guggenheim talk of constructive and continuing dialogue with the TDIC over working conditions and point to the employment practice policy for Saadiyat workers, which they say sets high standards. As the recent festival took place, however, Louvre worker Amraz Shadrat and 19 other Arabtec men were being led under tight security to Abu Dhabi airport to be sent home to Pakistan for refusing to work for wages which left them struggling to pay the recruitment fees to the agents who took them to Abu Dhabi in the first place. It was an unusually wet night, after the worst storm Abu Dhabi had seen in years, and large puddles filled the mud outside the Worker City No. 2 camp, as Hassan hugged his fellow labourers to say goodbye. At the airport the Arabtec men said they were not allowed to go the toilet in case they tried to escape. Hassan managed to have a brief conversation with the Observer. Tired and frustrated, he said that, after discovering he would make only $160 a month, he had demanded better pay to compensate for more than $2,000 he paid to an agent. &quot;I was three months in this country, three months with no money,&quot; he said. How can I work for this? I would spend a year trying to make the money. The whole thing is cheating.&quot;", "title": "In Abu Dhabi, they call it Happiness Island.

One of my oldest friends, Shak, was with me, and he just looked at me, half proud, half shocked. That was a good moment. A few years ago, I had dropped out of university and was working at Domino&apos;s Pizza. My auntie wanted to go on Deal Or No Deal, so I decided to apply too. It looked like the easiest game in the world! I ended up winning \u00a344,000. The money saved me, enabling me to build a studio in my shed and start making music seriously. My first hits were behind the scenes, producing songs for Chipmunk and Wiley and working with Emeli Sand\u00e9. I used to be too shy to show my own face. I was afraid of telling my story and talking about having been on a gameshow, because I thought people would think I wasn&apos;t serious. But I got over that this year. This has been the best year of my life. I released my own album, had a hit single, met people like Annie Lennox and Stevie Nicks. I even won an Ivor Novello award. I mean, it&apos;s crazy. I guess I&apos;m humbled because I&apos;ve spent time in the pinde [village] that my family are from in Pakistan, so it gives you a sense of perspective about it all \u2013 no matter how big I get, they&apos;re not playing my song there, I&apos;ll tell you that. My parents are immigrants and until recently they were still holding out for me to get a real job. After the initial surprise of finding out you&apos;re No\u00a01, all week you&apos;re waiting for something more to happen, for more of a feeling, but it is what it is. It can&apos;t really live up to the hype that you&apos;ve created in your head as an artist, wanting it to happen over years and years. But you do get a certificate and an award from the Official Charts Company, which my mum has. Parents, especially Asian ones, like knowing that their kids are the best at something.            La La La is everywhere now. I heard it in John Lewis a few weeks ago and ended up getting spotted near the perfumes. I love it, though, so I&apos;m not sick of it. But the song Lifted might be overplayed. Even Ed Miliband played it after his speech. My first thought was: &quot;Isn&apos;t he supposed to ask permission?&quot; I&apos;m not sure I would have said yes. I notice the changes in my life all the time. I was performing in Dubai this year and noticed that the most beautiful girls in the world were coming up to me \u2013 they didn&apos;t know who I was, but they knew I was &quot;somebody&quot;. It was funny \u2013 they were the kind of girls who would have avoided me a year ago because I was a hoodie-wearing rudeboy. That&apos;s when I thought: &quot;Shit, not only is this international \u2026 I can get girls!&quot; Even my rider has changed over a year. I used to be the shyest rider person and would never use it. Now it has to have Grey Goose and Nando&apos;s chicken wings on it. I was at the Capital FM party this year and Robbie Williams stopped me. He was like: &quot;We should do some tracks.&quot; I went back to my dressing room and was like: &quot;Robbie Williams knows who I am \u2026 now, where&apos;s the Nando&apos;s chicken wings?!&quot; If I get shy now I think: &quot;Well, I&apos;m a little Pakistani boy from Watford and I&apos;ve just sold 2m singles.&quot; That helps.", "title": "Naughty Boy: my first year as a pop star", "sentences": ["I was performing in Dubai this year and noticed that the most beautiful girls in the world were coming up to me \u2013 they didn&apos;t know who I was, but they knew I was &quot;somebody&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-22T19:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/23/fca-suspicious-trades-libor-rigging", "tags": ["Financial Conduct Authority", "Regulators", "Financial sector", "Stock markets", "London Stock Exchange", "Banking", "Libor", "Business"], "article": "The number of suspicious trades reported to the City regulator has rocketed in the last year, according to official figures. The Financial Conduct Authority said there has been a 43% increase in cases of suspected market rigging since the Libor scandal and a clampdown on rogue traders. In response to a freedom of information request, the FCA said it had received 117 self-reported cases over a 12-month period of possible distortion and manipulation of various markets, believed to include energy, minerals and financial securities. The suspicious transaction reports that relate to &quot;the misuse of information&quot;, or insider dealing, have increased to more than 1,000, up from 739 in the last equivalent annual period. Earlier this year the FCA fined day-trading business Swift Trade \u00a38m for moving share prices on the London Stock Exchange by rapidly placing and then cancelling orders on low-trades companies. The FCA also slapped a \u00a31m fine on stock-market trader, Samuel Nathan Kahn for share &quot;ramping&quot; and before that a \u00a36m penalty on one of India&apos;s richest businessmen, Rameshkumar Goenka for market manipulation. The watchdog said the increase in suspicious transactions was not a sign of increased wrongdoing so much as a greater understanding by traders of their need to be vigilant about their activities. &quot;The FCA has been working with the industry over the past 18 months to improve the standard of market surveillance undertaken by authorised firms, with a particular focus on increasing the scope of products and behaviours covered,&quot; said a spokesman for the City watchdog. &quot;This, alongside recent actions in relation to market manipulation, such as Swift Trade, Samuel Kahn and Rameshkumar Goenka, have helped firms better understand the types of behaviour we consider manipulative and therefore expect to be reported as suspicious,&quot; said the spokesman who believed that Libor fines also contributed to the increased number of potential misconduct. The FCA said the latest figures on suspicious trades were current up to the end of August but the statistics had not yet been broken down into financial or commodity trades. There has been increased focus on the regulation of oil and gas trading activities since the FCA and energy watchdog, Ofgem, undertook a probe into wholesale gas trades after reports of suspicious trading on 28 September 2011, from a price reporter and whistleblower, Seth Freedman, who worked for Icis-Heren. An investigation is still being carried out by the European Commission into suspected oil price collusion by BP, Shell and Statoil. Companies have long been under obligation to self-report any potentially fraudulent trading activities they detected in their own organisations, but in previous years they have been slow to do so. More publicity along with growing fines have made banks, energy companies and other trading houses aware their chances of being treated more leniently are much improved if they are shown to be proactive, say industry experts. &quot;Regulated businesses now know just how seriously regulators and politicians will treat market manipulation \u2013 they know that they can only expect leniency if they report proactively suspected cases of market manipulation that they come across,&quot; said Mark Spiers, head of wealth management at regulatory consultancy Bovill. &quot;The FCA has really clamped down on banks and individuals for a range of offences from manipulating oil futures to global depository receipts in the past year, as well as taking action against those who have allowed it to take place such as brokers and even compliance officers.&quot; &quot;It is sending out a clear reminder of the tough line it is prepared to take, not just towards the perpetrators themselves but anyone who fails in their duty to take appropriate steps to prevent others from committing market abuse.&quot; This year the FCA has also issued fines for a number of manipulation offences including a \u00a3598,000 fine in July against US-based trader Michael Coscia for manipulating oil futures and the price of other commodities, such as wheat and soya beans. In August it also fined a broker and compliance officer \u00a346,000 and \u00a370,000 apiece for actions enabling market abuse of securities traded on the London Stock Exchange by a Dubai-based private investor. Royal Bank of Scotland was hit with a \u20ac391m (\u00a3324m) fine earlier this month after a European Commission investigation into Libor rigging that has seen eight major financial institutions hit with penalties totalling \u20ac1.7bn.

He was sentenced for allegedly threatening UAE security and endangering public order with an online satirical video mocking affluent Emirates youth who mimic gangster street behaviour while actually enjoying pampered lifestyles. Cassim was arrested and imprisoned last April, charged with breaking strict new UAE cybercrime laws.\u00a0He was sentenced on Monday to a year\u2019s imprisonment after already serving almost nine months in custody while awaiting trial. The video, Satwa Combat School, was posted to YouTube as a lighthearted parody, Cassim\u2019s supporters say. The video began with a disclaimer stating it was fiction and not intended to offend anyone.\u00a0\u201cThe authorities have never stated why they feel this is a breach or a danger to national security. Shezanne has not been allowed to say anything in court,\u201d said Jennifer Gore, a spokeswoman for the Cassim family.\u00a0\u201cHe is scared, he is despondent, he has lost a lot of weight,\u201d Gore added. She said Cassim enjoyed making comedy videos \u201cin the spirit of Saturday Night Live\u201d that were meant to be lighthearted, inoffensive and far from anything that a government would find threatening. Cassim moved to Dubai after graduating from the University of Minnesota in 2006 and began working for the international consultancy giant PriceWaterhouseCoopers.\u00a0He and several friends made the satirical video in October 2012 and state-owned UAE media said the group was accused of \u201cdefaming the image of United Arab Emirates society abroad\u201d. His supporters and human rights campaigners are trying to discover if he is the first person sentenced under the new cyberlaws.

After Brisbane he lost his No3 batsman, Jonathan Trott, who hopes to return to Test cricket; after Perth his best spin bowler has decided to head for home, never again to don his England cap. Thus the spine of his team has started to disintegrate. Yet amid all this Cook remains remarkably sanguine and simply grateful for the contribution of Swann over the last five years. Cook did not even express much surprise at Swann&apos;s determination to retire in the middle of an Ashes series once he had spoken with his off-spinner soon after the Perth Test. &quot;Obviously, it is a huge decision to make,&quot; said Cook. &quot;Knowing you are never going to pull on an England shirt again must be quite a scary feeling, especially when you make that decision yourself. &quot;I think it is a very brave decision for him to do it now in terms of what he is giving up. I think he knows deep down he had no more to give and he didn&apos;t feel he could perform to the standards that he set for himself. He is going to be missed hugely.&quot; Unlike many others, who have been infuriated that Swann, 34, should give up in the middle of a series with his team fast becoming a laughing stock in Australia, it does not grate with Cook that his withdrawal should be so rapid. &quot;When you talk to him and see in his eyes that he&apos;d had enough, I think it made it an easy decision for him. He could have turned up to training and gone through the motions. Who knows how selection would have gone this week? Speaking to old players about when to retire, they say when you know, you know. And speaking to Swanny over the last couple of days, he just knew this was the time. There was no point hanging on for a couple of games. He&apos;d given his all in the England shirt and can be very proud of his achievements.&quot; Swann may not be quite so proud of some of the remarks he made after the announcement of his retirement when he described some (unspecified) players as being &quot;up their own backsides&quot; \u2013 this must break some sort of record for the speed in which a retired cricketer laments the outlook of those in the modern game. Cook did his best to defuse the mini-furore that these remarks have triggered. &quot;When we heard about it this morning, it was a surprise comment. But we know the media can take things out of context and jump on a quote. We all know how these things can be blown out of proportion. Hopefully, it has been dealt with now. Swanny has made it very clear to the lads that he didn&apos;t mean any England player.&quot; In his assessment of Swann, Cook outlined how much England will miss him. &quot;He&apos;s had a fantastic career. The great skill he had was to balance a four-man attack. Sometimes, especially in the first innings, he had to do the holding role on flat Test wickets, and still bowl attackingly. &quot;He has been an integral part of our success, both on and off the field. He can take a lot of credit for the way he managed to bring that more relaxed atmosphere to the team. I played a year or two before he came into the side but I noticed straightaway that he made people enjoy playing cricket for England, maybe more than when I first started.&quot; With Swann out of the equation, Monty Panesar, who took the precaution of playing grade cricket for West Magpies in Sydney, which just happens to be Michael Clarke&apos;s club, is well nigh certain to play in Melbourne on Boxing Day. Perhaps he would have done any way. Cook would not reveal how the selectors were leaning before they became aware of Swann&apos;s unprecedented withdrawal \u2013 it&apos;s hard to think of anyone who has retired in the middle of an Ashes series. &quot;It was taken out of our hands by Swanny telling us he was going to retire,&quot; said Cook, who went on to scotch suggestions that Swann&apos;s imminent omission from the Test team led to the decision to go. &quot;No. He came pretty much straight after Perth and told us. We hadn&apos;t even let the dust settle on that game.&quot; Although Durham&apos;s Scott Borthwick will be in Melbourne before Boxing Day (James Tredwell arrives on 28 December) Panesar can now contemplate a resumption of his Test career. He has played alongside Swann for both Northamptonshire and England over the years as spin partners rather than bosom pals. He was just as happy as Cook to sing Swann&apos;s praises (and why shouldn&apos;t he, since Swann&apos;s departure could now rejuvenate a career that was off the rails in Brighton four months ago?) &quot;Richie Benaud got 248 wickets, Swann got 255, that&apos;s elite class,&quot; said Panesar. &quot;He&apos;s been an icon character and a match winner. If I achieve half of what he&apos;s done I&apos;ll be ecstatic. He&apos;ll be remembered as one of the greats.&quot; So Monty is back and Cook, amid the apparent disarray, is determined to be cheerful about that. &quot;Monty bowled pretty well in Adelaide, didn&apos;t quite get the results, and he&apos;ll be favourite to take that position. He has had an outstanding career as well. If he plays, it will be his 50th Test match and these achievements shouldn&apos;t be taken lightly. He&apos;s done very well when he&apos;s played for England. Monty has the chance now to establish himself.&quot; Indeed, in India and Dubai within the last year or two we have seen that Panesar could sometimes match or even surpass Swann with the ball.

At Wentworth in May, O&apos;Grady&apos;s attempt to diffuse the racism storm which surrounded Sergio Garc\u00eda and his &quot;fried chicken&quot; jibe towards Tiger Woods merely turned the focus on the chief executive himself.

As and when he does depart, the Northern Irishman is confident he will leave behind an organisation in rude commercial health. &quot;I could leave now and the tour would be in a phenomenally successful position,&quot; O&apos;Grady says. &quot;Golf is in the Olympics, we&apos;ve got big broadcast contracts in place and we have really big sponsors coming on board.

Atena Yazdi, the wife of Abbas Yazdanpanah Yazdi, a UK citizen originally from Iran, has told the Guardian that before his disappearance in June, her husband was intending to take legal action against the SFO because they were co-operating with Iranian prosecutors and handing over private information. Iran&apos;s state general inspection organisation, which was investigating Yazdi over a bribery investigation involving the Norwegian oil giant Statoil, wrote to the SFO to obtain information about him in February 2013. The Guardian reported in July that the SFO, which had searched Yazdi&apos;s home in London in 2003 and copied the contents of Yazdi&apos;s computers, had passed across some of its contents including his address book to the Iranian authorities. Atena Yazdi said she was puzzled why the SFO did not destroy her husband&apos;s documents even though, she said, he has never been charged either in UK or Norway in connection with the Statoil trial. &quot;I believe that prior to his abduction he had contacted the SFO regarding documents that they removed from his office and the extent of the SFO co-operation with Iran and its agents,&quot; she said. &quot;He had formally warned the SFO that the transfer of documents by the SFO [to the Iranians] would put not only his life into danger, but also the lives of many other innocent people. &quot;There is a clear and compelling body of evidence in my view that officers within the SFO indirectly aided my husband&apos;s abductors,&quot; she said. &quot;Indeed two weeks before his abduction, my husband visited the UK with a view to commencing proceedings against the SFO.&quot; She added: &quot;I retain the firm belief that my husband is alive and no one has produced any evidence to the contrary.&quot; According to Atena Yazdi, her husband went missing from his Dubai office on the evening of Tuesday 25 June. The address of that office features on a document \u2013 passed to the Iranians \u2013 shown to the Guardian beneath the words: &quot;The UK passport authorities have provided a new address for Abbas Yazdi.&quot; Atena added: &quot;On Monday 5 August, officers from SO15 Scotland Yard&apos;s counter-terrorism command informed me that Abbas died at the moment of abduction. To date, I have been given no proof of this.&quot; She said that the Dubai authorities had denied reports that her husband has died and said they were still hopeful to find him alive. &quot;After nearly five months since I last saw my husband and my children last saw their father, we are struggling to get through,&quot; she said. &quot;We miss Abbas desperately and each day we hope and pray to hear news.&quot; Scotland Yard declined to comment on the allegations that officers told Yazdi that her husband was dead. It said it does not comment on private conversations with families. The only response was: &quot;We can confirm that SO15 Counter Terrorism command is investigating the disappearance of Abbas Yazasanpanah Yazdi, aged 44 years, on the 25 June in Dubai. We are providing family liaison support at this time. Inquiries continue.&quot; The Home Office said: &quot;As a matter of long-standing policy and practice, we neither confirm nor deny the existence of mutual legal assistance requests.&quot; Yazdi claimed the FCO has previously told her &quot;with great certainty&quot; that her husband had been killed in the UAE. Asked about Atena Yazdi&apos;s claims, The Foreign Office said: &quot;We are liaising with the Emirati authorities who are investigating Mr Yazdi&apos;s disappearance. It would not be appropriate to speculate on that investigation until it has concluded.&quot; Anglo-Iran relations were cut in 2011 following the storming of the British embassy in Tehran by angry mobs but has since been upgraded to non-resident charge d&apos;affaires. Responding to allegations that the SFO had passed on Yazdi&apos;s address to the Iranians, the SFO said: &quot;We do not comment on mutual legal assistance.&quot; In May, it was reported that French judicial authorities had requested Abbas Yazdi and two other individuals face criminal charges in connection with a bribery investigation involving the French oil giant Total. Atena Yazdi said she had no knowledge that her husband was under investigation in France. The French prosecutor&apos;s office in Paris told the Guardian that Yazdi has already been charged with corruption and that there is a warrant for his arrest. A spokeswoman said she did not know where he was and that he could be tried in his absence. This month, Iran&apos;s foreign ministry vehemently denied reports that the country has had any role in Yazdi&apos;s disappearance and it said it was pursuing his fate with the UAE authorities. &quot;There have been conflicting reports over the past few months about the disappearance of Mr Yazdanpanah who resided in the UAE,&quot; said the foreign ministry spokeswomen, Marzieh Afkham, according to quotes carried by the state English-language television station Press TV. &quot;The foreign ministry has submitted an official note to the UAE foreign ministry upon receiving the news, asking it to pursue Yazdanpanah&apos;s case and to inform [Iran] about his fate.&quot; She denied Tehran had anything to do with his disappearance. &quot;Reports accusing Iran of being involved in his Yazdanpanah&apos;s disappearance or murder is \u2026 ridiculous and completely false. The individual in question was considered a very important witness in \u2026 the Crescent [Petroleum] \u2026 [arbitration] case, and his [testimony]\u2026 would be in Iran&apos;s interest,&quot; she said. According to Press TV, Iran&apos;s national oil company had a contract with Crescent Petroleum to export natural gas to the UAE, but cancelled it in 2010 due to &quot;technical issues&quot; including pricing.", "title": "Wife of UK businessman who vanished in Dubai demands answers from SFO", "sentences": ["The wife of a UK businessman who went missing in Dubai has accused the Serious Fraud Office of providing Iranian prosecutors with detailed personal information about her husband, including the address from which she believes he was abducted.", "&quot;Indeed two weeks before his abduction, my husband visited the UK with a view to commencing proceedings against the SFO.&quot; She added: &quot;I retain the firm belief that my husband is alive and no one has produced any evidence to the contrary.&quot; According to Atena Yazdi, her husband went missing from his Dubai office on the evening of Tuesday 25 June.", "To date, I have been given no proof of this.&quot; She said that the Dubai authorities had denied reports that her husband has died and said they were still hopeful to find him alive.", "The only response was: &quot;We can confirm that SO15 Counter Terrorism command is investigating the disappearance of Abbas Yazasanpanah Yazdi, aged 44 years, on the 25 June in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2013-12-26T13:07:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/dec/29/signs-slowdown-prime-london-property", "tags": ["Housing market", "Real estate", "London", "House prices", "Property", "Money", "UK news", "Housing", "Business"], "article": "Soaring house prices in London&apos;s prime locations are showing signs of a slowdown, according to new figures. Estate agent Knight Frank, which monitors prices in the capital&apos;s most exclusive boroughs, reports that prices of properties in prime central London locations ended the year 7.5% higher \u2013 outperforming gold, which fell in value by a quarter between January and mid-December. However, the annual rate of increase was below the 8.7% recorded last year and the 12.1% seen in 2011. Prices in Chelsea rose by 2.7%, with growth of 5.8% in Mayfair and 6.7% in Knightsbridge, meaning that all three areas underperformed the wider prime central London average for the first time in a decade. Areas such as Islington and Marylebone saw prices rise by about 12%. Knight Frank predicts that this year prices in the most desirable areas will rise by just 4%, which suggests a cooling-off in the market is on the cards, possibly as investors look to buy in other countries. The slowdown is unlikely to ease concerns that parts of the UK property market are in danger of overheating. The expansion of the help-to-buy scheme, when the government gives guarantees to lenders on properties up to the value of \u00a3600,000, is expected to fuel further interest in the property market in the coming months as banks release new mortgages.

From the unveiling of its pioneering design in 2004 to the first delivery in 2011, there was an industry buzz. Then mutterings of concern grew into a chorus of alarm in January, when safety authorities grounded the fleet after a spate of incidents, including a burning battery. But after a few relatively trouble-free months, Boeing&apos;s insistence that these were just teething troubles has been accepted and orders have grown. Randy Tinseth, Boeing&apos;s vice-president for marketing, landed on a lot of tarmac during 2013, selling the plane and restating its merits to customers anxiously reviewing their purchases. &quot;It wasn&apos;t a great start,&quot; he admits. &quot;We clearly had challenges early in the year \u2026 and the disruption that presented.&quot; The most alarming challenge was a battery that caught fire on a Japan Airlines plane, fortunately on the ground at Boston airport. Other 787s suffered fuel leaks and one was forced to make an emergency landing. By mid-January the US federal aviation authority had grounded the worldwide fleet.     A Japan Airlines Boeing 787 Dreamliner is towed back to the gate after a fuel leak at Boston's Logan airport. Photograph: Zuma/Rex Features    &quot;As you can imagine it was a very difficult situation. It&apos;s very rare when you have to \u2026 take planes out of service. We had an unprecedented response inside the company to identify the work we had to do with the testing, and to incorporate the fix for those in service and those in production.&quot; The 787 returned to the skies in April and glitches have been rare. The last high-profile incident was a fire on an Ethiopian Airlines plane at Heathrow in July. &quot;The airlines are telling us it&apos;s delivering,&quot; Tinseth says. The feedback from passengers has been amazing.&quot; Boeing&apos;s marketing boss would say that, but people at the sharp end seem to agree. British Airways pilot Mitch Preston flew the first 787 in BA livery and is managing the model&apos;s entry into service. He says passengers consistently say they arrive feeling better. &quot;It&apos;s not marketing fluff, it really isn&apos;t.&quot; Low fuel consumption and reduced noise have been the big selling points, but a key part of the 787&apos;s appeal to passengers is the increased cabin pressure said to alleviate the ill-effects of flying. Preston says: &quot;Typically I get off a 787 flight feeling less tired and dehydrated.&quot; He also likes the lighter cabin and the views from its bigger windows. BA waited decades for a pioneering new plane, then two turned up at once. The Dreamliner arrived in the same week as BA&apos;s first Airbus A380. Both had been ordered years earlier, but the 787 was delayed in production hell and A380 was deferred by BA itself as recession made it wary of the doubledecker superjumbo.     An Airbus A380 'superjumbo' wows onlookers at Farnborough air show. Photograph: Lefteris Pitarakis/AP    Captain James Basnett is Preston&apos;s counterpart for the A380. &quot;Everybody who flies the A380 loves it. It&apos;s very impressive, efficient, reliable. We did all the flying without a hitch and crews love it,&quot; he says. As with the 787, the plane may be dramatically different but the cockpit is designed for continuity for pilots, albeit with a host of technological improvements. &quot;The flightdeck is slightly more complex, but with more tools to help us \u2013 cameras, electronic flight displays and an electronic flight bag.&quot; The latter, which the 787 also offers, aims to reduce the headaches and weight of paperwork. Passenger feedback has been effusive, Bassnett says. &quot;You notice the width and height in the cabin. It&apos;s noticeably quieter.&quot; One downside of which is that &quot;you can hear people snore&quot;. But not the co-pilot, he adds. The A380 has &quot;the best of a small aircaft on a big aircraft and a lot of technology you don&apos;t see elsewhere&quot;, he says. There wouldn&apos;t be a pilot on the fleet who wouldn&apos;t prefer it. They&apos;d say it was the most enjoyable plane they&apos;d ever flown&quot;. Preston, however, says: &quot;There are very few pilots in the world who&apos;ll not say the plane he&apos;s flying is the best thing. I don&apos;t begrudge James what he&apos;s flying, but on this issue he&apos;s wrong.&quot; Size isn&apos;t everything? &quot;Indeed.&quot;     A flight attendant on a Boeing Dreamliner 787 at Heathrow airport. Photograph: Steve Parsons/PA    The earlier problems with the 787, he says, never enter his mind. A more important endorsement came this month from his employers, who booked 18 more Dreamliners \u2013 the pending &quot;double-stretched&quot; 787-10 model. BA has also ordered the same number of A350s, widely seen as Airbus&apos;s riposte to the Dreamliner. It uses similar lightweight composite materials and by the time of delivery may include a version of the lithium-ion batteries. The airline&apos;s stance reflects the broader aviation picture. The purchase of an A380 or 787 is far less a decision between manufacturers than a question of competing visions of the economics and future of air travel. Airlines carrying high volumes of passengers on major routes favour the A380, and Emirates - by far the largest customer - has refitted its Dubai hub to service its fleet, which is set to reach 140 planes. Five depart Heathrow for Dubai daily. At crowded airports where slots are at a premium, putting more customers on each plane taking off can make real sense. But if the A380 is, as an Airbus spokesman put it, a &quot;congestion buster&quot;, the 787 is better known as a &quot;hub buster&quot; \u2013 one that rewrites traditional models of funnelling connecting passengers onto the jumbos that make long-haul flying viable. With fewer seats, its fuel efficiency and range are enabling the likes of a direct Heathrow-Austin connection \u2013 BA&apos;s next new route for 2014 \u2013 even with less passenger demand than established routes. On the simple comparison of orders, the 787 is beating the A380, though Airbus has the satisfaction of knowing its superjumbo is slowly wiping the ageing Boeing 747 from the skies. Technical problems did ground a Norwegian Air Dreamliner last week in the US, but burning batteries and emergency landings are slowly becoming a more distant chapter in the 787&apos;s story. It is now approaching 100m miles in service and last month surpassed 1,000 orders. Tinseth says: &quot;The technologies are being proven \u2026 Was it a risk worth taking?

Four years after retiring from Ferrari, where he won five of his world record seven titles, Michael Schumacher made a comeback with Mercedes in 2010. It was not a success. But his passions for skydiving and motorcycling, as well as his more moderate pastimes of football, horse riding, swimming and skiing, always suggested he was not ready to settle for country strolls and catching up with old friends over a game of dominos. Few sportsmen are as innately competitive as racing drivers, and the instinct lives on. When asked what gave him the biggest buzz outside F1, Schumacher replied: &quot;Skydiving,&quot; even though he once said he didn&apos;t like heights. Earlier this year he took part in a skydive with ex-heavyweight boxing champion David Haye in Dubai. On two wheels, he has raced alongside John McGuinness, the 19-times Isle of Man TT winner, as well as US GP racer Randy Mamola. He has always enjoyed horse riding and bought a ranch for his wife, Corinna, in Givrins in Switzerland, with a number of magnificent horses. And his love for skiing led him to buy a house in Courchevel, in the popular ski region of the French Alps. When he retired from F1 for good in 2012 he said: &quot;From now on life will offer me plenty of new possibilities. I&apos;m looking forward to them. I prefer to be described as a fighter, someone who never backed down.&quot; When Ernest Hemingway said: &quot;I would hate to die, ever, because every year I have a better time fishing and shooting, I like them as much as when I was 16,&quot; he was 44, the same age as Schumacher today. Papa would surely have approved of the German man of action and his reluctance to concede to the advancing years. Schumacher, of course, as well as being among the very greatest of F1 drivers \u2013 though not, perhaps, as pre-eminent as his dominating CV would suggest \u2013 was also one of the sport&apos;s most ruthless practitioners, as former world champion Damon Hill would ruefully testify. The German, in his pre-Ferrari Benetton years, deliberately drove into Hill as the British driver attempted to overtake him, putting both men out of the race. He was utterly single-minded. Schumacher was linked to a number of other teams after he was effectively forced to quit Mercedes when the team decided to sign Lewis Hamilton at the end of the 2012 season. For those of us who remember the great driver he undoubtedly was, and witnessed the extent of his decline at Mercedes, his reluctance to return once more came as an epic relief. Schumacher was the greatest driver between the era of Ayrton Senna and Alain Prost and the modern age of Fernando Alonso and Lewis Hamilton. In his time \u2013 and it was a long time \u2013 probably only Mika H\u00e4kkinen provided the challenge everyone longed to see.           The fact that he won more championships and races than any other driver in the history of the sport \u2013 though his compatriot Sebastian Vettel threatens to dismantle his records \u2013 tempts some people to judge him as the greatest driver of them all. Most judges, though, stick with Senna and Jim Clark as the champions among the champions. Red Bull may dominate the current F1 scene but even they don&apos;t stand out as Ferrari did in the early years of the century. Schumacher was joined there by his old colleagues at Benetton, Ross Brawn, the technical director, and Rory Byrne, the chief designer. And team boss Jean Todt built the most effective outfit in the paddock. Also, Schumacher had tyres virtually custom-made for him by Bridgestone. It was a team that could scarcely fail. But, as today with Vettel and as before with Lotus and Clark and Senna and McLaren, the best team usually ends up with the best driver. Schumacher was ruthless and unpopular but he was also very fast. And he brought to his driving a level of\u00a0consistency his rivals could only envy. He was always destined to continue to be fast, even if he altered his mode of transport. Schumacher broke most of the important records in F1, so by the time he finally retired in 2012 he had more championships (seven) more race wins (91) and more pole positions (68) than any other driver in the history of the sport. His 13 wins in 2004 was also a record for a single season until Vettel equalled it last year. In 2002 he also became the only driver to finish with a podium place in every race. His record, without any doubt, placed him among the leading handful of drivers of all time, though his ruthless streak \u2013 there was a crash with Jacques Villeneuve in 1997 in addition to the Hill incident in 1994 - prevented some from taking him to their hearts. Senna&apos;s death in 1994 \u2013 he was the last driver to be killed in a race \u2013 robbed the sport of what could have been one of its greatest confrontations. But Senna, at the end of his life, was convinced he was not racing Schumacher on a level playing field \u2013 he believed the German was benefiting from electronic driver aids that had been banned after 1993. Schumacher made an eye-catching F1 debut with Jordan in 1991 and was immediately signed up by Benetton.
