Sports most famous couple \u2013 the Northern Irishman, twice a major golf winner, and Wozniacki, the former world No1 tennis player \u2013 took to Twitter to post photos of the fireworks over the Sydney Harbour Bridge and of Wozniacki&apos;s unusually large diamond engagement ring. McIlroy tweeted: &quot;Happy New Year everyone! I have a feeling it&apos;s going to be a great year!! My first victory of 2014 #shesaidyes!!&quot; A three-part photo of McIlroy and Wozniacki together, the Sydney fireworks and the Dane&apos;s diamond ring was attached to the golfer&apos;s post.

Wozniacki, after all, has previous for practical jokes via social media, including one infamous picture of an open-mouthed McIlroy mid-sleep in September, which supposedly riled her 24-year-old partner. Wozniacki, the world No10, is preparing for the Australian Open but withdrew from the Brisbane International on Sunday because of an injured shoulder. McIlroy, who won the Australian Open on 1 December by a single shot from Adam Scott, will return to competitive golf in Abu Dhabi in mid-January. McIlroy&apos;s Sydney win was his only one in 2013. He made a lucrative change to Nike equipment after a highly successful 2012, in which he led golf&apos;s world rankings. In mid-October it was reported in the Irish media that McIlroy had told Wozniacki their relationship was over. A month later, however, Wozniacki was present for all four competitive days of the DP World Tour Championship golf in Dubai. During that event McIlroy said: &quot;She started her pre-season a couple of days ago and was on court this morning at seven o&apos;clock. So she got some practice in before coming to see me. It&apos;s good to have her here.&quot;    Happy New Year everyone! Rory and I started 2014 with a bang! ... I said YES!!!! pic.twitter.com/J7c2pXgsdC&mdash; Caroline Wozniacki (@CaroWozniacki) December 31, 2013    McIlroy staunchly refused to discuss speculation about his relationship with Wozniacki, whom he started dating in 2011. &quot;My private life is private and I would like to keep it that way,&quot; McIlroy has said. Wozniacki was more forthcoming, stating: &quot;All is well. I just want to be allowed to live my life off the court without all the speculation.&quot; The news creates an intriguing scenario for bookmakers. In January Ladbrokes offered odds of 5-1 on McIlroy and Wozniacki becoming engaged during 2013.

Tens of thousands of people lined the banks of the River Thames as the chimes of Big Ben rang in the new year in the capital, while an estimated 80,000 descended on Edinburgh for its famous Hogmanay street party. Fireworks events also took place in Cardiff and Belfast, while Londonderry marked its final few hours as the UK City of Culture in 2013 with a cathedral service. Some 50,000 revellers in London braved the threat of rain to enjoy what was billed as &quot;the world&apos;s first multi-sensory fireworks display&quot;, when peach snow and orange-scented bubbles descend on a section of the crowd. Partygoers queued for hours to get a prime spot near the London Eye, where an enormous fireworks display lit up the skyline.  Up to 100,000 are thought to have enjoyed the display, during which people were given LED wristbands and fruit-flavoured sweets that linked to the tastes and smells of the multi-sensory display to bring something different to the new year festivities. After watching the fireworks, revellers joined in a traditional rendition of Auld Lang Syne. London mayor Boris Johnson said there was &quot;no better way to celebrate the highs of 2013 and the start of an exciting new year&quot; than enjoying one of the world&apos;s most dazzling fireworks displays&quot;. The Metropolitan police said it had 3,800 officers on duty for the event, while London Ambulance Service received 1,100 calls between 7pm and midnight, and 469 in the first hour of 2014. Travel on buses, the Tube, trams, Docklands Light Railway and the London Overground remained free until 4.30am. In Edinburgh thousands of people counted down the last moments of 2013 before fireworks over Edinburgh Castle and Calton Hill marked the start of the new year. The Pet Shop Boys headlined a concert in Princes Street Gardens, while there was also a Keilidh playing traditional Scottish music. Today around half a million people are expected to attend the annual New Year&apos;s Day Parade in London, which could be hit by rain and strong winds. The celebration parade will feature music from around the globe, leaving the Ritz Hotel at noon and winding through Piccadilly, Pall Mall and Trafalgar Square before ending in Parliament Square. In New York a sea of horn-tooting, hat-wearing revellers cheered and kissed as the famed crystal ball dropped in a freezing New York City Times Square to ring in 2014, capping a worldwide wave of celebrations that included a dazzling 30-minute fireworks show in Dubai.

Photograph: Adrees Latif/Reuters    US supreme court Justice Sonia Sotomayor led the 60-second countdown and pushed the button that unleashed the shimmering orb with 2,688 crystals, a role usually filled by the New York City mayor. Michael Bloomberg, on his last day in office, was sitting the celebration out after 12 years on the job, while newly elected mayor Bill de Blasio took the oath of office just after midnight at his Brooklyn home. The New York celebration featured performances from artists such as Miley Cyrus, Macklemore &amp; Ryan Lewis and Blondie There were spectacular displays in Rio, Brazil, where thousands watched as fireworks lit up the skies over Copacabana Beach. In Russia, where two suicide bombings in two days killed 34 people, eerily empty buses lumbered through the streets of Volgograd, where authorities canceled mass events for New Year&apos;s Eve and asked residents not to set off fireworks. President Vladimir Putin, in his New Year&apos;s Eve address to the nation, vowed that the fight against terrorists will continue &quot;until their destruction is complete&quot;, Russian news agencies reported. In Dubai on the Persian Gulf officials sought to break another record by creating the largest fireworks show. The skyline was a canvas for a dazzling 30-minute show. The display capped off with six minutes of fireworks that engulfed the city&apos;s manmade, palm-shaped island, with its fronds and trunk shimmering in thousands of lights. In Ukraine anti-government protesters hoped to set their own record for the most people to sing a national anthem at the same time. On Kiev&apos;s main square at least 100,000 Ukrainians sang their national anthem in a sign of support for integration with Europe. The square has been the scene of massive pro-European protests for more than a month, triggered by President Viktor Yanukovych&apos;s decision to ditch a key deal with the European Union. In the Philippines two people were killed and around 600 injured by firecracker blasts and celebratory gunfire as the nation marked the end of a year of tragic disasters, including an 8 November typhoon that left more than 6,100 dead and nearly 1,800 missing.

New Zealand concluded 2013 with its own fireworks that erupted from Auckland&apos;s Sky Tower while cheering crowds danced in the streets. In Tokyo five priests at the Zojoji temple used ropes to swing a wooden pole against a large bell, sounding the first of 108 gongs to mark the new year. Simultaneously, &quot;2014&quot; lit up in white lights on the modern Tokyo Tower in the background. China had light shows at part of the Great Wall near Beijing and at the Bund waterfront in Shanghai. The city of Wuhan in central Hubei province called off its fireworks show and banned fireworks downtown to avoid worsening its smog. Pope Francis used his year-end prayer service of thanksgiving to urge people to ask themselves: fid they spend 2013 to further their own interests or to help others? The pontiff asked people to reflect if they used the past year to make the places where they live more livable and welcoming.

Captain America: The Winter SoldierMarvel Films just keep churning them out. This is the ninth recent derivation from The Avengers family, a follow-up to 2011&apos;s Captain America: The First Avenger, and a side-project of all those Iron Man and Thor movies. If the title is anything to go by, this one features the Cap&apos;s former sidekick Bucky, revived and transformed into a Soviet-era assassin. The usual Marvel crew are due to put in an appearance, led by Chris Evans and Scarlett Johannson (as\u00a0Black Widow).

The Amazing Spider-Man 2Hands up if you think there&apos;s been too many Spider-Man films? Well, it doesn&apos;t matter: here&apos;s another, courtesy of studio Sony&apos;s desire to keep hold of its rights to the material. Admittedly, the new series of Marc Webb-directed webslingery infuses the Spidey story with a roughhouse, skater-chic charm, with Andrew Garfield one of the classiest performers to ever don Spandex. Not too much has yet emerged of this one&apos;s plot, except that the Rhino (Paul Giamatti) and Electro (Jamie Foxx) appear to be the big villains. AP April. Dawn of the Planet of the ApesTim Burton&apos;s 2001 Planet of the Apes remake encouraged studio 20th Century Fox to punt a hopeful new series of the simian-bothering sci-fi. Now Cloverfield director Matt Reeves is in charge, filling in events well before the classic Charlton Heston story. Gary Oldman is the human talent, facing off against the apes. AP 17 July. Sin City: A Dame to Die ForAlmost a decade after the first instalment, here&apos;s a second collection of Frank Miller&apos;s sicko noir stories, with Miller again sharing directorial duties with Robert Rodriguez. Many of the same characters (and actors) are returning, including Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen and Bruce Willis; expect another dose of highly stylised comic-panel noir, with stunning visuals doing their best to compensate for the rampantly creepy sexism. AP 29 August. The Hobbit: There and Back AgainCritical opinion has held that things have picked up with Smaug, after the bloat of the first film, An Unexpected Journey, so here&apos;s hoping Peter Jackson can keep the standard up. Presumably There and Back Again will take in the aftermath of the dwarves&apos; takeover of the Lonely Mountain, their confrontation with the Wood-Elves and humans of Lake-town, and the climactic Battle of the Five Armies. After that, we&apos;ll all need a rest. AP 19 December. ExodusRidley Scott is offering up a Cecil B DeMille-ish answer to Darren Aronofsky&apos;s Noah, by retelling the Moses story with Christian Bale as the Jewish law-maker. Joel Edgerton is the Pharaoh Rameses, Sigourney Weaver the Pharaoh&apos;s mum Tuya, and Aaron Paul the Mosaic sidekick Joshua. As the founding myth of biblical Israel, this could be controversial territory, but Scott has successfully handled this type of tricky material before, in the crusades movie Kingdom of Heaven, and we expect him to be as agile here as before. AP 5 December. Theatre Shakespeare in LoveThe film made Joseph Fiennes. And, thanks to a smartly self-aware script by Tom Stoppard and Marc Norman, wasn&apos;t too bad for Shakespeare either. Screen-to-stage musicals have become almost as predictable as traffic jams in the West End, but thanks to the involvement of adapter Lee Hall (Billy Elliot) and director Declan Donnellan (of Cheek by Jowl), hopes are high that this might not pale beside the Shakespearean glories of West Side Story and Kiss Me Kate.

Art Matisse: The Cut-OutsThere is no more enigmatic masterpiece of modern art than Matisse&apos;s Snail, a huge paper cut-out whose revolving planes of colour have been delighting visitors to the Tate since it was bought by the museum in 1962. A toddler can enjoy this work of art \u2013 and recognise the shape of a snail \u2013 but is it an image or an abstract decoration that happens to be snail-like? This feast of colour and movement that Matisse created in 1953 exceeds any possible pictorial intention. Matisse made his cut-outs when the art world was transfixed by American abstraction. Yet the French painter asks more profound questions about the nature of meaning in art than Jackson Pollock ever did. His Snail is a sly subversive mocking all attempts to interpret it. Promises to be the most popular and beautiful artistic event of the year. Jonathan Jones Tate Modern, London SE1, 17\u00a0April to 7 September. VikingsThe world shuddered. Monks in Lindisfarne lay awake listening for war cries. On the far side of the world, native Americans saw sails on the horizon. The Vikings were a power in the world, a demonic force of pagan mayhem that threatened to destroy the frail beginnings of Europe and even put a frostbitten toe in Newfoundland. Yet a lot of the time, these Scandinavians farmed and told stories. To be a &quot;viking&quot; was a seasonal occupation: it meant to go out on the summer seas looking for trouble. Destructive as these warriors were, their myths are fascinating, their art has a rugged splendour, and this show \u2013 which includes a real longship \u2013 should thunder like Thor&apos;s hammer. JJ British Museum, London WC1, 6 March to 22 June. Mondrian and Colour Two major shows focus on the impeccable Dutch abstractionist Piet Mondrian. Mondrian and Colour at Turner in Margate considers the significance of colour in\u00a0his early career, bringing together around 40 paintings by the artist from the Gemeentemuseum Den Haag and other collections in Europe and the US. Tate Liverpool will present the concurrent show Mondrian and his Studios: Abstraction into the World. This will explore the artist&apos;s importance both as abstractionist and in his relationship with architecture and urbanism, and the spaces and places, in Amsterdam, Paris and New York, where he worked. The show will also include his wonderful 1914 series Pier and Ocean. Do that geometric boogie-woogie thing! Adrian\u00a0Searle Turner Contemporary, Margate, 24 May to 21 September; Tate Liverpool, 6 June to 21 September.  ColourColour in painting is as much the product of chemistry and the availability of pigments as it is of an artist&apos;s perceptions. Colour can be symbolic, it can imitate nature, it can be as earthy, ethereal and fugitive as it can be poisonous and exorbitantly expensive and rare. The history of painting is, in part, a history of materials and their uses. The development of impressionism and plein-aire painting was as much related to new industrially manufactured pigments and their availability in tubes as it was to artistic theory. Trade routes and artistic experiment, technical innovation and an almost alchemical search for the lost secrets of the old masters changed the way paintings looked and were made in radical and far-reaching ways. Each room will be devoted to a different colour, and will look at the National&apos;s own collection in relation to minerals, textiles, ceramics and glass on loan from major national and international cultural institutions. AS National Gallery, London WC2, 18 June to 7 September.     Photograph: The National Gallery    Rembrandt: The Final YearsForty paintings, 20 drawings and 30 prints by an artist doesn&apos;t sound a lot, but when the person we&apos;re talking about is Rembrandt and the focus is on\u00a0the works he created in the last two\u00a0decades of his life, expect something magisterial. Like late\u00a0Titian, Rembrandt&apos;s style towards the end of his life became ever more frank and unconcerned with\u00a0the kind\u00a0of painterly decorum\u00a0and\u00a0detail expected by\u00a0his patrons. With his churned-up surfaces, harsh lighting and dramatic settings, his manner achieved more than an illusion of directness. Nowhere is this clearer than in his drawings and etchings. And when we look at Rembrandt looking at himself, in his late self-portraits, we get the feeling that he just doesn&apos;t care what we think. Which is exactly what makes us care as much as we do.

Architecture Shanghai Tower, by GenslerAs America bickers over which of its towers is tallest, the new World Trade Center or the Sears Tower, China is busy building soaring totems that will outshine them all. Next year will see the completion of the gargantuan Shanghai Tower, the second tallest building in the world after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, at 632 metres. Designed by anonymous corporate giant Gensler, it climbs in a spiral like a frozen whirlwind, captured in glass, housing a stack of offices, shops and vertical gardens, and accommodating up to 16,000 people.

Antonio Pappano: Verdi RequiemFew conductors today bring out the drama of Verdi better than Pappano. His 2009 recording of the Requiem with his Rome-based Orchestra of Santa Cecilia won rave reviews, not only for its moments of blazing theatricality, but also for its finely crafted details and quality of intense inwardness. For these two UK concerts he&apos;s joined by top-notch soloists, including tenor Joseph Calleja, in what promises to be an unbeatable live experience.

John Eliot Gardiner: MonteverdiFifty years ago a Cambridge undergraduate assembled a group of singers to perform what was then still an extreme rarity, Monteverdi&apos;s great 1611 setting of the Vespers, in King&apos;s College Chapel. Those singers formed the nucleus of what became the Monteverdi Choir and have continued their close association with that concert&apos;s conductor, John Eliot Gardiner, ever since. On the exact anniversary Gardiner and his choir and\u00a0orchestra, the English Baroque Soloists, return to King&apos;s to recreate that debut; even though Monteverdi&apos;s Vespers is much more familiar now than it was in 1964, it is always thrilling to hear it live.

The man who ruled Pakistan for nearly a decade until he was deposed in 2007 had already missed appearing in the dock twice in the past two weeks after small bombs were found on the route of his convoy. A bomb scare on Wednesday prompted a large security operation to be launched on Thursday to protect the former president as he travelled from his mansion on the outskirts of Islamabad. His non-appearance has been a source of frustration for judge Faisal Arab, who repeated a threat to have Musharraf arrested to force him to appear. News that Musharraf had been diverted to hospital was broken by a senior police official to a court sitting in Pakistan&apos;s national library building. The timing of Musharraf&apos;s aliment was greeted with incredulity by observers whose suspicions were further aroused by the fact the former army chief had been taken directly to a military hospital for treatment. &quot;All medical excuses must be verified by an independent board of doctors,&quot; said Bilawal Bhutto Zardari, the 25-year-old joint chairman of Pakistan&apos;s biggest opposition party. &quot;I have an ouchy is no excuse to skip your treason case,&quot; he wrote in a tweet. Throughout a morning marked by heated exchanges between defence and prosecution lawyers, Musharraf&apos;s team made arguments designed to postpone his court appearance. It is the first time in the short history of a country that has been repeatedly punctuated by periods of military rule that a former dictator has been held to account for his actions. Aasia Ishaque, a spokeswoman for Musharraf&apos;s political party, the All Pakistan Muslim League, said Musharraf had been seen by doctors the previous evening because of stress surrounding the case. Musharraf was travelling in an armoured car when he began sweating and felt &quot;heaviness in his chest&quot;. &quot;They told him to take rest but he had got up early in the day because he was keen to disprove claims in the press that he wanted to avoid the court,&quot; Ishaque said. She said tests carried out at the Armed Forces Institute of Cardiology showed he had suffered from a mild heart attack. Ishaque denied rumours that circulated within hours of Musharraf&apos;s trip to hospital that he would be moved overseas for treatment. Observers of Pakistan&apos;s byzantine political scene have long suspected an excuse would be found to take Musharraf back to a life of exile in Dubai and London, which he had enjoyed until March last year when he returned to the country in a bid to stand for election. Large numbers of supporters failed to turn out to welcome him home, he was barred from running in the elections and became embroiled in legal cases, including one alleging he was complicit in the killing of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto in 2007. But it was the decision in June of prime minister Nawaz Sharif, the politician who Musharraf overthrew in a coup d&apos;etat in 1999, to order a trial for the capital crime of treason that has created the greatest trouble for the former army chief. Legal experts have said he has little chance of successfully defending himself against charges that he illegally suspended the constitution in 2007 when he introduced emergency rule and deposed senior judges. Members of Pakistan&apos;s commentariat say the still-powerful military establishment will never allow Musharraf to go on trial. But neither the government nor the judges have indicated that, and the efforts by his defence team to keep him from the courtroom have begun to sound desperate. On Thursday morning the lead lawyer, Anwar Mansoor Khan, began proceedings with a statement saying he could not continue his work on the case after his sleep had been disturbed all night by mysterious banging on his door and ringing of his bell. &quot;I&apos;m not interested in security,&quot; he retorted when the judge asked whether he had anyone to protect him. &quot;Let someone come and kill me, I am not a weakling.&quot; He said the government was behind efforts to intimidate members of the defence team. He later left the court amid angry jostling between the two legal teams after a defence lawyer accused Akram Sheikh, the special prosecutor in the case, of issuing threats in private against his adversaries. Citing the &quot;high temperature&quot; of the mood in the courtroom the lead defence lawyer, Sharifuddin Pirzada, asked the judge to adjourn proceedings.

And then imagine having to pick up and return the food containers, collect the money, and pay the drivers \u2013 most of whom cannot read or write. The logistics and organisation needed would almost certainly defeat the best efforts of any European or US food chain, airline or supermarket group, perplex corporate distribution teams, and bamboozle efficiency-conscious business leaders. But the old ways are often the best ways; in a world of innovation, sometimes the most innovative thing you can do is to keep doing what you always did. Such is the case in Mumbai, where a small miracle has been taking place daily for more than 100 years. Nearly every working day, 5,000 or more white-capped &quot;dabbawallas&quot; get on their pedal bikes, each loaded with about 40 lunches packed in steel or plastic containers called &quot;tiffins&quot;. Weaving their way through the throngs of India&apos;s business capital, they deliver to workers in shops and offices, factory hands, and businesses. Their products include everything from daal, vegetables, chapatis and rice to exotic Mexican and macrobiotic specialities. On average, just one meal in 16m gets delivered late. It is testimony to what ordinary people can achieve. But what excites corporate leaders such as Richard Branson, Harvard business school professors, and even governments is that the dabbawallas are turning western business models inside out. Dabbawallas are recognised as a textbook example of efficiency and organisation but, instead of using a complex, technology-driven administrative system, they have built a giant buiness on trust, experience and, above all, the knowledge and intelligence of families. The dabbawallas do not need layers of complicated management, computers or even mobile phones. Earlier this year, Arvind Talekar, who worked as a dabbawalla for two years and is now a spokesman for the Nutan Mumbai Tiffin Box Suppliers, came to Dubai for the Gulf Co-operation Council Third and Fourth Line Leaders&apos; Development Conference. &quot;We keep it simple,&quot; he says. &quot;I have seen that many times technology doesn&apos;t work. So, it is best not to use it because if it fails, then we can&apos;t deliver the lunch boxes on time. We are illiterates and we prefer to keep a mental note. We don&apos;t depend on gadgets.&quot; In an increasingly globalised world, the west is now looking east and south, to emerging economies, for new business models. In the process, it is finding some unique ways of doing things; it&apos;s a case of &quot;the children teaching their parents&quot;, says Alexander Settles, a professor of corporate governance at Moscow State University. Africa, once considered hopeless for business innovation, is now exporting pioneering ideas that are being picked up in Europe and the US.

The point at issue was when a youngster called Unscripted should make its debut, the older man being understandably keen to run him in December and enjoy one final winner to go with the previous 4,197. &quot;I said, no, no, the right race for him is after New Year&apos;s Day,&quot; says Hannon Jr with a broad grin. &quot;I rang the owner quickly, got my point across.&quot; The horse duly became his first runner and first winner at Wolverhampton on Friday night, hacking up by 10 lengths. &quot;Fantastic,&quot; he says of the experience. &quot;I was there myself, I haven&apos;t been to Wolverhampton for two years but it was great. Nice to actually be there. First race I&apos;ve watched live for a long time.&quot; Hannon Jr was the label attached to him for the past 15 years as he served a long apprenticeship under his father but he will appear on racecards simply as Richard Hannon, offering a reassuring sense of continuity. He is plainly gratified to be the man in charge but the job will still be shared between the pair and there is a good deal of amiable clowning between them. On New Year&apos;s Day, as they went out to lunch, the handover was marked by what seemed, to the new trainer, a significant moment when his father donned the jacket marked &quot;Jnr&quot;. &quot;He didn&apos;t know, I had to tell him. He said: &apos;I wouldn&apos;t have put that on if I&apos;d known&apos;. Next thing, he&apos;s down the pub, showing everybody he put it on by mistake.&quot; The oft-repeated line here is that nothing is new beyond the man holding the licence but in fact several things are, notably Hannon&apos;s mint home which he and his young family have been trying out for two months. Both front and rear offer perfect views of the stable&apos;s gallops, though the trainer does not expect to benefit, planning to be on the ground, examining his horses from yards away. Eliza, his two-year-old, stands on the dining table to observe each day&apos;s work. Jack, born on Christmas Day, watched Unscripted&apos;s race with his eyes closed and will therefore make a good trainer, his father says. Also new is the office, larger and smarter than the one before, a fit place to welcome Qatari royals and the other powerful, deep-pocketed owners who have joined the yard in recent years. It has something of the Bond villain command centre about it now, with seven tall computer screens mounted on the far wall, facing a row of staff who use them to sort through the details of 240 horses, each in need of a suitable race. Another innovation: horses are weighed at regular intervals, and before and after each race. &quot;Dad would never have had that. &apos;What do you need scales for, the best pair of scales you&apos;ve got are your eyes.&apos; I used to think I&apos;d rather not go and do a job with that guesswork, I&apos;d rather have facts written down in front of me that I know are correct.&quot; The intuition of the Hannons will still play a large part in how the job is done. &quot;The system is the same as it always has been and I think you can say that it works, so there&apos;s no reason \u2026 if it ain&apos;t broke, don&apos;t fix it, you know?&quot;  Richard Hannon on \u2026 His team for 2014 We&apos;ve got some really, really nice two-year-olds. Spent a bit more money this year than we have done in the past, just because we had the firepower, and obviously Sheikh Hamdan&apos;s brought some lovely horses here. He has about 20 here. He sent us 12 yearlings, smashers, all of them. We&apos;re very lucky to have his patronage. Toormore The champion two-year-old. He gets no penalty for the Greenham [a 2,000 Guineas trial at Newbury in April]. And he won his maiden on soft ground, so if it turned up soft there, it wouldn&apos;t do him any harm. Bunker He won the Francois Boutin, which is normally a good race, and he beat the subsequent Lagardere winner, Karakontie. And then we put him away for the year. So hopefully he&apos;s going to go for the Dante and then the Derby. He&apos;ll definitely get the trip, he&apos;s by Hurricane Run. Shifting Power A really nice, dark horse. He won his first two races very easily. He beat Treaty Of Paris six lengths in a conditions race at Newmarket. He has done well, he&apos;s as big as any [horse of his age] I&apos;ve seen in this yard, ever. He&apos;s really filled out and done well. I don&apos;t know where we&apos;re going to go with him yet because we have to sort the others out. Night Of Thunder A really nice horse. He&apos;s done very well. For some reason, Hughesie [Richard, stable jockey and the trainer&apos;s brother-in-law] always bangs on about him. Hughesie loves him, he obviously gave him a great feel at Doncaster. The owner had the third in the 2,000 Guineas last year, so hopefully this horse can go a couple of places closer, you never know. He&apos;s got loads of speed. Up to now, he&apos;s done extremely well. He&apos;s filled out. He wasn&apos;t the biggest of horses last year but he&apos;s plenty of size now. Toronado There&apos;s a chance he might go to Dubai but I would think unlikely. I&apos;d like to save him for Royal Ascot and then his season will start from Royal Ascot forward. The Queen Anne would do him. Sky Lantern There&apos;s the obvious races like the Falmouth and go on from there, the Rothschild and, if she gets a mile and a quarter, we&apos;ll cross that bridge when we come to it. She&apos;s away at Highclere now, having a very nice rest. She went there last year and it did her the power of good. She&apos;s going to stay there a bit longer this year, a couple of months, because she had a bit of a hard trip to Hong Kong. It was the end of a long year and she was only three. Olympic Glory His first target will be the Lockinge at Newbury in May. Piping Rock, who died from colic recently That was a big feather in my cap, to train one for Godolphin. I was looking forward to that. Just having a foot in the door. But there was nothing the vets could do, they tried their best and that&apos;s that. We might get another chance, you never know. It was a big thing for them to show support and it was a shame we couldn&apos;t repay Sheikh Mohammed. But hopefully we&apos;ll get another chance. When I was growing up as a kid, I was at school, always had the Racing Post, I always used to say, &apos;Oh, I&apos;d love to train for Sheikh Mohammed, imagine if you had one for him!&apos; So I get one and that happens. But, you know we&apos;re all in long trousers, as Simon Crisford [Godolphin spokesman] said to me. These things happen, it&apos;s very unfortunate and it&apos;s a big loss for both teams. Domestic ambitions I&apos;d like to train more Classic winners [than Hannon Sr]. English Guineas, he won with Mon Fils, Don&apos;t Forget Me and Tirol. Sky Lantern, if you get my drift, was a bit of a grey area, because that was mine but it went under his tally. So he trained four. Obviously, I&apos;d love to train a Derby winner. You&apos;d love to do all those things but, if it doesn&apos;t happen, we&apos;re not going to get massively disappointed. We want to keep it existing as a thriving business and a place where people come and are able to enjoy their horses. As long as we enjoy it, then they&apos;ll enjoy it. I think setting goalposts is quite a dangerous thing to do but we&apos;d love to train 200 winners [this season] and win a lot of prize money. If that means we&apos;re champion trainer, that would be fantastic. It&apos;s not necessarily about me, the place is run as an outfit and it&apos;s a very big team, good lads, riders, jockeys, my Dad. It&apos;s everybody, though it&apos;s my name at the top. International ambitions I&apos;d love to train more winners abroad. The way racing&apos;s gone now, with Dubai, America, Hong Kong, Australia, everybody&apos;s really got the bug for it and the prize money is fantastic, but the prize money in England for these top-class horses is also very, very good. I like keeping them here and racing them here but you&apos;ve got to be international nowadays to appeal to everybody and that&apos;s one thing I would like to improve on our scoresheet, to have more winners internationally. Sheikh Fahad, he&apos;s always taking the mickey out of me because, most of these international meetings, I meet him there and we haven&apos;t had a great record there, he always reminds me of it. But you never know, I might get my day when I can go up to him and shake his hand.

The first of those to return to the racecourse are likely to be Artigiano and Steeler, both entered to run at Meydan in Dubai on Thursday. Twenty-two Godolphin horses were prevented from running in Britain last year on the grounds they had been given steroids by Mahmood al-Zarooni, employed by Sheikh Mohammed as a trainer in Newmarket until being found guilty and banned from the sport. The horses were unable to run for six months each but those suspensions ended in October. &quot;We decided recently to continue with some of the horses who did not race last year,&quot; said Simon Crisford, Godolphin&apos;s spokesman, in a short statement quoted on the operation&apos;s website. In addition to the two horses entered on Thursday, Crisford specifically named Certify and Encke, the two most high-profile of the 22 horses, as being among those now back in training. Certify, a leading contender for the 1,000 Guineas at the time of her ban, &quot;will be aimed at the top fillies&apos; contests during the [Dubai] Carnival,&quot; Crisford said. Encke&apos;s targets are said to be &quot;in Europe later in the year&quot;; he will be remembered as the horse who foiled Camelot&apos;s attempt on the Triple Crown by beating him in the 2012 St Leger, his most recent race. Crisford did not respond to a request for further information and it is not known how many more of the 22 horses are expected to race this year. However, one of them, the unraced Orkney Island, still holds an entry in the Derby on 7 June. Racegoers and punters may respond with suspicion to runners known to have received steroids up to April, none of which have raced in the past year. However, Robin Mounsey, a spokesman for the British Horseracing Authority, defended the decision to let them race again. &quot;The science on anabolic steroids in horses is far from clear, substantially less so than in humans,&quot; he said. &quot;It is feasible that horses will benefit from steroids for a period of time after the substance has left the horse&apos;s system. &quot;However it is unlikely that these beneficial effects would last in perpetuity. This is why the BHA has made the decision to suspend all horses found to have been administered with anabolic steroids for six months.&quot; That view was cautiously supported by David Mountford, the chief executive of the British Equine Veterinary Association, who said: &quot;There isn&apos;t a black and white answer. The reason is that using steroids in sport is against the rules, so there isn&apos;t any research on their effects and there would be all sorts of practical difficulties in carrying out any research. &quot;So it&apos;s virtually impossible to be definitive but my understanding is that all the scientific indicators are that the residual effect of these drugs would be likely to have gone by now. The amount of time the BHA has banned those horses is enough to allow the effects to pass and the present state of knowledge suggests they would now be competing on level terms.&quot; Bryan Cooper rode his first winner in the Gigginstown colours since being hired as their main jockey on Toner D&apos;Oudairies at Thurles on Monday.", "title": "Godolphin say horses banned for steroids will return to racecourse", "sentences": ["The first of those to return to the racecourse are likely to be Artigiano and Steeler, both entered to run at Meydan in Dubai on Thursday.", "Certify, a leading contender for the 1,000 Guineas at the time of her ban, &quot;will be aimed at the top fillies&apos; contests during the [Dubai] Carnival,&quot; Crisford said."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-06T18:40:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/07/american-consultant-uae-satirical-video-release", "tags": ["United Arab Emirates", "US news", "World news"], "article": "An American consultant, jailed for a year in the United Arab Emirates for making a spoof video about his host country, is likely to be released within days, his family said on Tuesday. Shezanne Cassim, 29, from Woodbury, near St Paul, Minnesota, has been moved from the federal prison in the desert outside Abu Dhabi where he was being held to a deportation centre nearby in preparation for being flown back to the United States. \u201cHe is going to be released, we hope it\u2019s this week, but we are not sure. He has been moved to a deportation centre in anticipation of being released within a few days,\u201d said Susan Burns, a US lawyer who has been working on behalf of the Cassim family to secure the man\u2019s liberty. As part of the sentence he received in a UAE court, Cassim was ordered to be deported at the end of his prison term.\u00a0Cassim\u2019s family in Minnesota and local political representatives had been lobbying the State Department to help secure his early release.\u00a0\u201cHis family is ecstatic,\u201d said Burns. But she added that it was \u201cterrible\u201d that the consultant would be deported \u201cfor posting a comedy video\u201d. Cassim was sentenced for allegedly threatening UAE security and endangering public order with an online satirical video mocking affluent Emirates youth who mimic gangster street behaviour while actually enjoying pampered lifestyles. He was arrested and imprisoned last April, charged with breaking strict new UAE cybercrime laws, and on 23 December was sentenced to a year\u2019s imprisonment, followed by deportation. The video, Satwa Combat School, was posted to YouTube as a lighthearted parody, Cassim\u2019s supporters say. The video began with a disclaimer stating it was fiction and not intended to offend anyone. Defenders of the young American said the video was intended \u201cin the spirit of Saturday Night Live\u201d and was not meant to be taken seriously or cause offence. \u00a0\u201cI can\u2019t tell you how relieved our family is by this turn of events,\u201d said Cassim&apos;s brother, Shervon Cassim. \u201cWe are very excited, and we are grateful to everyone who worked to free Shez.\u201d Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, who campaigned for Cassim&apos;s release, said the decision was &quot;wonderful news&quot; and the &quot;right thing to do&quot;. She added:\u00a0\u201cJailing this young man for months for posting a harmless video made absolutely no sense, especially in a country that prides itself on being a tolerant and just nation. In contacts with the UAE ambassador to the US, and his American counterpart in Dubai, Klobuchar advocated for Cassim\u2019s sentence to include his time served, which she said was a major factor in the UAE\u2019s decision to release him. Cassim moved to Dubai after graduating from the University of Minnesota in 2006 and began working for the international consultancy giant PricewaterhouseCoopers. He and several friends made the satirical video in October 2012 and state-owned UAE media said the group was accused of \u201cdefaming the image of United Arab Emirates society abroad\u201d. It is not yet clear what effect Cassim\u2019s stretch in custody and now his deportation will have on his employment situation, or to what extent official American diplomacy helped with his early release.\u00a0\u201cWe just don\u2019t know yet,\u201d said Burns. But she added that his family and supporters were relieved that he would be freed.\u00a0\u201cHis family can\u2019t wait to see him again,\u201d she said.

A couple of weeks after that, the British Horseracing Authority disclosed that subsequent tests on Zarooni&apos;s entire string had produced seven further positives for steroids, including Steeler. As with all those to test positive, Steeler was banned from racing for six months and any hope of a Classic campaign was over. He will finally be the centre of attention in Dubai on Thursday, however, when he and Artigiano, who finished a length behind Steeler in second place in the 2012 Royal Lodge Stakes, become the first of the horses doped by Zarooni to return to racecourse action. In theory, any lingering performance-enhancing effects from the powerful steroids administered by Zarooni should have left their systems several months ago. These are just ordinary, talented racehorses again. In practice, considerable attention will inevitably focus on Steeler and Artigiano when they line up for races on the first card of this year&apos;s Dubai Carnival meeting, as it would with any human athlete returning from an absence having been tainted by controversy. Steeler is likely to be among the favourites for the feature race on Thursday&apos;s card \u2013 the \u00a3150,000 Group Two Al Maktoum Challenge Round One over eight furlongs. Artigiano, meanwhile, lines up for the preceding event, the Listed Singspiel Stakes. Both horses are trained by Charlie Appleby, Zarooni&apos;s former assistant, who took over the licence after Zarooni was banned from racing for eight years. Other horses doped by Zarooni, including Certify, who was one of the favourites for the 2013 1,000 Guineas before her six-month ban, and Encke, who foiled Camelot&apos;s attempt to win the Triple Crown in the 2012 St Leger, will also return to action later this year. Encke in particular will attract considerable attention, but today&apos;s runners still mark another step in Godolphin&apos;s long rehabilitation after the biggest doping scandal in British turf history. High-class racing from Dubai will now be a weekly feature of the programme on Thursdays until the Dubai World Cup meeting at the end of March. Leading jockeys with rides on the card on Thursday include Hayley Turner, Christophe Soumillon, Mickael Barzalona and James Doyle, while there were 26 individual Group One winners among more than 200 foreign-trained entries for the Carnival meeting. Moonlight Cloud, one of the best of recent racemares, has been retired and will be covered by Galileo within a few weeks. Freddy Head&apos;s six-year-old won six Group One races, including a three-race sequence in autumn 2013 culminating in a brilliant display in the Prix de la Foret on Arc day. After Treve&apos;s five-length success in the Arc, few spectators would have believed that her performance might have an equal on the same card, but Moonlight Cloud was breathtaking as she stalked the field in the Foret from well off the pace before showing exceptional acceleration to pass every rival in scarcely a furlong. &quot;She was a great mare, probably one of the best I&apos;ve trained,&quot; said Head. &quot;But when you&apos;ve also trained Goldikova it is difficult to say she was definitely the best. Let&apos;s say that she was definitely in the same league. &quot;What she did at Deauville this season [winning Group Ones on successive weekends] was amazing. She had a lot of class, maybe not quite the same amount of stamina as Goldikova, but she had a very smart turn of foot. She stayed an extended seven furlongs but a mile just stretched her.

Both were promising juveniles in 2012 when they were last seen in public. Steeler, then trained by Mark Johnston, beat Artigiano into second place in the Royal Lodge, a Group Two, before finishing third in the Group One Racing Post Trophy, while Artigiano was sixth in the Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile Turf.

It gives him a bit more time after his race at Ascot [in mid-December] and then it will give him plenty of time before Cheltenham as well. &quot;My Tent Or Yours did it last year, running in the Betfair Hurdle and then the Supreme. We just thought it might be more sensible.&quot; Solwhit, the winner of the Ladbrokes World Hurdle at Cheltenham last year, will be unable to defend his title as the result of a fetlock injury, Charles Byrnes, the 10-year-old&apos;s trainer, said. Solwhit had been quoted at around 5-1 for the World Hurdle in the ante-post markets, despite having been withdrawn from his intended seasonal debut at Leopardstown&apos;s Christmas meeting. He could yet recover in time to run at the Punchestown Festival in April, however. Several bookmakers reacted to the news by cutting the price against Big Buck&apos;s, who has won the World Hurdle a record four times but was himself ruled out of last season&apos;s renewal by a leg injury. Paul Nicholls&apos;s gelding, now top-priced at 5-2 to win a fifth World Hurdle in March, is due to run for the first time in more than a year when he lines up for the Cleeve Hurdle at Cheltenham later this month. Mad Moose, who refused to race at both the Cheltenham and Aintree Festivals last season and then all but did the same in the Tingle Creek Chase at Sandown in December, has been banned from racing with immediate effect by the British Horseracing Authority. The 10-year-old, who is trained by Nigel Twiston-Davies, also refused to race when a 7-1 chance for a Listed event at York in May last year and had either refused to start, been reluctant to race or tailed himself off six times in the last 14 months.", "title": "Godolphin's steroid horses beaten but promising on return in Dubai", "sentences": ["Controversy was avoided, for now, as the first two Godolphin horses to return from steroid bans were beaten in Dubai on Thursday night."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-09T19:52:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/10/three-arrested-dubai-disappearance-british-iranian-businessman", "tags": ["Dubai", "Iran", "Foreign policy", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Politics", "UK news"], "article": "Three men have been arrested in Dubai on suspicion of kidnapping a British-Iranian businessman, Abbas Yazdi, who disappeared from the Gulf state in June 2013. The suspects are alleged to be Iranian nationals who recently returned to the United Arab Emirates to clean up the scene of their crime. The abduction of Yazdi, 44, has raised awkward questions about British legal co-operation with Iranian prosecutors at a time when the two countries had no diplomatic relations. Yazdi&apos;s disappearance was raised by the foreign secretary, William Hague, with his then counterpart in Iran, Ali Akbar Salehi. Yazdi&apos;s wife, Atena, has accused the UK&apos;s Serious Fraud Office (SFO) of providing Iranian prosecutors with detailed personal information about her husband, including the address from which she believes he was abducted on 25 June. Iran&apos;s state general inspection organisation, which was investigating Yazdi over bribery claims involving the Norwegian oil giant Statoil, had written to the SFO to obtain information about him in February 2013. The case has also been taken up by the shadow attorney general, Emily Thornberry MP, who is seeking information about the SFO&apos;s co-operation and is to raise Yazdi&apos;s disappearance in the Commons. In a letter to the attorney general, Dominic Grieve QC, she wrote: &quot;What are the rules governing interactions between UK prosecutors and their counterparts in countries where diplomatic ties have been renounced? Was co-operation between the SFO and the Iranian authorities a regular occurrence during the period that ties were broken? Has the SFO, or the Crown Prosecution Service for that matter, recently assisted any other regimes that the UK government does not recognise and/or that practise or are suspected of practising extrajudicial execution?&quot; Atena Yazdi believes her husband is still alive despite initial reports from the Foreign Office that he had been killed during the kidnapping. She told the Guardian: &quot;I am extremely happy about the news of these arrests. It made me and our children so happy that the investigation is going at least one step forward. We now look forward to hearing any information that these detainees could provide on where Abbas has been taken and what have they done to him. &quot;We also hope that the UK government engages more in this case and negotiates with Iran about Abbas. We have no doubt that the people who have been arrested had direct involvement in Abbas&apos;s disappearance.&quot; The Dubai government press office issued a statement late on Thursday saying its security service had arrested the three men on suspicion of kidnapping Yazdi, who owns a general trading company in the emirate. &quot;The security apparatus identified the group members and \u2026 was able to uncover the method they had used to kidnap the suspect,&quot; the statement said. It quoted Dhahi Khalfan, Dubai&apos;s deputy chairman of police and general security, as saying that the three were about to dispose of Yazdi&apos;s personal effects when they were arrested. The three were being questioned to find out Yazdi&apos;s whereabouts, it said. A Foreign Office spokesperson said: &quot;We welcome the arrests of three men by the Emirati authorities in connection with the alleged kidnapping of British-Iranian national Abbas Yazdi. The UK will continue to liaise closely with the Emirati authorities on the investigation.&quot; Yazdi, who holds both British and Iranian citizenship, moved to Dubai around 10 years ago. Iran&apos;s foreign ministry has vehemently denied reports that the country has had any role in Yazdi&apos;s disappearance. Responding to allegations that the SFO passed on Yazdi&apos;s address to the Iranians, the SFO has said: &quot;We do not comment on mutual legal assistance.&quot;", "title": "Three people arrested in Dubai over disappearance of British-Iranian man", "sentences": ["Three men have been arrested in Dubai on suspicion of kidnapping a British-Iranian businessman, Abbas Yazdi, who disappeared from the Gulf state in June 2013.", "We have no doubt that the people who have been arrested had direct involvement in Abbas&apos;s disappearance.&quot; The Dubai government press office issued a statement late on Thursday saying its security service had arrested the three men on suspicion of kidnapping Yazdi, who owns a general trading company in the emirate.", "It quoted Dhahi Khalfan, Dubai&apos;s deputy chairman of police and general security, as saying that the three were about to dispose of Yazdi&apos;s personal effects when they were arrested.", "The UK will continue to liaise closely with the Emirati authorities on the investigation.&quot; Yazdi, who holds both British and Iranian citizenship, moved to Dubai around 10 years ago."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-10T13:26:16Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/jan/11/readers-recipe-swap-smoothies-and-juices", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Life and style"], "article": "Though I&apos;m not one to\u00a0spend January in\u00a0a hair shirt of self\u2011denial, I have to say that this week&apos;s liquid theme came as a bit of a relief \u2013 especially to a household struck down by seasonal sniffles.

Pick out any large bits of pith. 2 Puree together the pomegranate jewels and the peeled satsumas. Push through a fine metal sieve to remove pith, and serve. A splash of vodka is optional.

Police and soldiers maintained a low profile as the &quot;shutdown Bangkok&quot; drive got under way in Thailand&apos;s capital. The mood was festive, with many protesters singing and dancing in the streets.  Led by former deputy premier Suthep Thaugsuban, thousands of protesters have set up permanent barricades and encampments at seven sites across the city. Major intersections that normally teem with cars and trucks are blockaded, but city trains and river ferries have been operating, most shops are open and motorbikes have plied the roads freely.  &quot;Don&apos;t ask me how long this occupation will last,&quot; Thaugsuban said in a speech to supporters carried by the movement&apos;s BlueSky television channel. &quot;We will not stop until we win.&quot;  Suthep \u2013 a career politician who has led the People&apos;s Democratic Reform Committee against Yingluck Shinawatra&apos;s government for the past two months in a bid to rid the country of corruption - has threatened to shut down Bangkok for up to 20 days in order to replace Yingluck&apos;s caretaker government with an unelected people&apos;s council. This so-called Bangkok shutdown is the latest move by Suthep and his largely urban, elite followers, who have been calling since November for an end to the &quot;Thaksin regime&quot; \u2013 a reference to Yingluck&apos;s brother and former prime minister Thaksin, a hugely divisive leader who won over poor northern farmers with his rice subsidy and healthcare schemes, but fell foul of Bangkok&apos;s elite, who hated the telecoms tycoon&apos;s cronyism and money politics. Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and now lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai to avoid corruption charges. Yet he is considered to be the man pulling the strings behind the current government, and any new elections \u2013 such as those most recently called for 2 February, which the opposition Democrat party has already boycotted \u2013 will more than likely see a return of the popular Pheu Thai party to power. Yingluck on Monday invited leaders of anti-government protesters and political parties to discuss a proposal to push back the date of the election. Ministers have until now said a delay would be impossible under the constitution, but the Election Commission has said it could be pushed back and one member has suggested 4 May.  Suthep, who served as deputy PM after Thaksin was ousted, has called the shutdown the protesters&apos; last battle \u2013 a term he has admittedly used multiple times before \u2013 but vowed in an interview on Sunday that it would be non-violent and to call off his protest if civil war were instigated. Yet violence remains a real threat, with businesses grounding employees and embassies worried about a return of the 2011 rioting that saw storefronts burned to the ground, 100 people killed and about 2,000 injured during similar anti-government protests. Even army commander General Prayuth Chan-ocha has not ruled out the possibility of a military coup, and 10,000 police and 8,000 soldiers have been deployed to maintain security across the city. Yet observers say that \u2013 for a country that has seen 18 actual or attempted coups since 1932 \u2013 the army has been remarkably reserved throughout this so-called &quot;people&apos;s coup&quot;. They point to past military intervention \u2013 such as in 2006 and 1991 \u2013 as proof that the army may have learned that coups can often lead to prolonged political and civil unrest. &quot;The army is fighting tooth and nail from intervening and rolling out the tanks,&quot; said political scientist Thitinan Pongsudhirak. &quot;So short of a direct army intervention, something is likely to give in the coming days, because the deadlock will intensify and become unbearable, untenable.&quot; At least eight people have been killed so far in the latest political unrest, with the US embassy in Bangkok issuing a statement to citizens recommending that they stock at least one week&apos;s supply of cash and two weeks&apos; worth of food, water and medicine.", "title": "Thai protesters blockade roads in Bangkok for 'shutdown'", "sentences": ["Thaksin was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and now lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai to avoid corruption charges."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-13T11:50:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2014/jan/13/ghana-hope-city-african-white-elephant-projects", "tags": ["Cities and development", "Global development", "Ghana", "Africa", "World news", "Urbanisation", "Cities"], "article": "Hope City does not yet exist, except as shimmering images of giant beehive towers bathed in a golden light. But Ghana is pressing ahead to build this $10bn (\u00a36.6bn) technology city outside the capital, Accra. Designed by OBR architects, the city will consist of six towers, including a 75-floor, 270m-tall (885ft) building, the highest in Africa, where 25,000 people will live and 50,000 will work. There have been teething problems, with the site moved to a larger one at Pampram. Residents at the original location, Dunkunaa, claim the project had incurred the displeasure of the gods when the developers refused to acknowledge the chiefs and elders of the area. That could be the least of Hope City&apos;s problems, warns Professor Vanessa Watson of the University of Cape Town. She has flagged up concern not just over the Pampram project, but over other &quot;urban fantasies&quot; involving large-scale reconfigurations of existing cities (such as Kigali in Rwanda, and Addis Ababa in Ethiopia) or the construction of satellite cities (such as Tatu, outside Nairobi in Kenya, and Kigamboni, outside Dar es Salaam in Tanzania). These new city plans are a relatively recent phenomenon, most dating from the past five or six years, with the private sector playing a dominant role in nearly all the projects. In the paper African urban fantasies: dreams or nightmares?, published by the International Institute for Environment and Development on Monday, Watson casts doubts over whether these grandiose urban projects, driven by local politicians and global investors who see Africa as the &quot;last frontier&quot;, will meet the real needs of most people. &quot;The bulk of the population in sub-Saharan African cities is extremely poor and living in informal settlements,&quot; she writes. &quot;Some of these settlements are on well-located urban land that is also attractive to property developers. Attempts to implement these fantasy plans within existing cities will (and is already) having major exclusionary effects on vulnerable low-income groups through evictions and relocations.&quot; She questions the premise on which these big projects are based: rapid urbanisation in Africa and the growth of a middle class on the continent. Watson cites studies arguing that claims of very rapid urbanisation may be overstated and rates may be higher in smaller towns. The Africa Development Bank defines the middle class as those spending $2-20 a day, and the upper middle class as spending $10-20 a day. &quot;It is difficult to imagine how households with such minimal spending power can afford the luxury apartments portrayed in the fantasy plans (as well as the vehicles needed to move around these new cities), and it may be that prospective property developers are seriously misreading the African market,&quot; she writes. As an example of an architectural white elephant, Watson cites the Chinese-built &quot;ghost towns&quot; outside the Angolan capital, Luanda \u2013 cities comprising of tower blocks of apartments selling at $150,000 to $200,000 each. Ambitious urban projects may have worked in Shanghai, China and Ho Chi Minh City, and cities such as Dubai, Shanghai and Singapore are clearly the models for the new African cities. But Watson doubts whether African governments have the capacity to pull them off. On a mundane level, she wonders how cities, invariably described as smart and sustainable and consisting of tower blocks reliant on lifts and air conditioning, can function in an environment where power cuts occur several times a day. &quot;Maybe they will be able to, but what nobody can tell me is what will happen to the people living in shack settlements in those cities,&quot; Watson says. Satellite cities are frequently justified on the basis that they are located on empty land. But it is rare, she argues, for larger cities to be empty, and if such land is not within an environmentally protected area, then it is likely to be actively farmed. &quot;In all kinds of eviction processes, landowners rarely hold land title, and full compensation for land, shelter and livelihoods is unlikely,&quot; she adds. The desire to construct fantasy cities is bound to divert scarce resources from meeting the basic services and housing needs of the much larger poor urban populations. &quot;What seems most likely is that the majority of urban populations will find themselves further disadvantaged and marginalised,&quot; writes Watson. &quot;It is access to land by the urban poor (as well as those on the urban periphery and beyond) that is most directly threatened by these processes, and access to land in turn determines to urban services, to livelihoods and citizenship.&quot;", "title": "Will Ghana's Hope City join Africa's herd of white elephant projects? | Mark Tran", "sentences": ["Ambitious urban projects may have worked in Shanghai, China and Ho Chi Minh City, and cities such as Dubai, Shanghai and Singapore are clearly the models for the new African cities."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-13T15:17:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/13/thai-protests-bangkok", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Protest"], "article": "Thousands of anti-government protesters took to the streets of Bangkok on Monday in their push to oust the government, closing down major intersections and blockading avenues through the city centre. &quot;This is the only way to force the government out,&quot; said Ban Jon, 52, a durian fruit farmer who had travelled 120 miles in a convoy to the Thai capital, where he planned to sleep on the street &quot;for as long as it takes&quot;. &quot;When you compare governments [in Thailand], yes, they are all corrupt, but this one is the worst.

Probably not &quot;quick wit&quot;. Gooch though, has always had neat turn of phrase. He has 15 entries in David Hopps&apos; collection of Great Cricket Quotes, as many as Neville Cardus and CLR James muster between them. Gooch reckoned Phil Tufnell &quot;confused notoriety for celebrity&quot;, asked Ian Botham &quot;who writes your scripts?&quot; and said of Shane Warne&apos;s famous delivery to Mike Gatting: &quot;If it had been a cheese roll it would never have got past him.&quot; And, of course, he summed up the 1990-91 Ashes with the memorable phrase, &quot;a fart competing against thunder&quot;. That line came to mind again this weekend, when the Sydney Thunder lost to the Hobart Hurricanes by 73 runs. The marketing department who cooked up that name must have imagined it had all the right connotations. It would have seemed especially apt when, in the Thunder&apos;s very first match, David Warner scored a century off just 51 balls, and again in their second, when Chris Gayle hit another off 54. Sadly, that was back in December 2011, and the team have since lost 19 straight games. The Sydney Thunder have stunk out the Big Bash. Sorry as they are, the Thunder aren&apos;t even the best of the worst. In Pakistan the Quetta Bears lost 27 consecutive matches between 25 April 2005 and 7 December 2012, when they tied against the Abbottabad Falcons. Then lost the ensuing super over. Despite that, the Thunder have been drawing crowds of around 11,000 to the ANZ Stadium for their matches this season. Who knew there were that many masochists in Sydney? Perhaps, as one of Cricket Australia&apos;s own consultants has suggested, the results don&apos;t matter much. Dan Migala, an American who has been hired by Cricket Australia to work on marketing strategies for the Big Bash League, recently told the Financial Review: &quot;One of the mantras we have worked on with the BBL is to deliver entertainment that also happens to have a cricket match involved.&quot; It&apos;s a new spin on Rodney Dangerfield&apos;s old saw &quot;I went to a fight the other night and a hockey game broke out&quot;. Migala says this was a lesson he learned in minor league baseball, where &quot;exit polls show that up to 90% of fans can&apos;t necessarily remember the result of the game. But they have been entertained.&quot; England, unfortunately for them but thankfully for all right-thinking sport fans, don&apos;t have that luxury. Much as their supporters may want to forget the series just gone, and A&amp;E departments across the country have seen a spike in self-inflicted head wounds as fans try to beat out the memories, no one, least of all those who paid so much money to follow the team to Australia, walked away from this fiasco thinking &quot;at least I was entertained&quot;. Elements of the Australian press, for want of anything else to talk about, are already weighing the odds of whether England&apos;s losing streak will extend to the point where it becomes the worst in their history. England have only lost their last seven international matches, so they have a way to go yet. In 1993 they managed to lose 10 in a row, from an ODI against India in Gwalior through a short tour of Sri Lanka and into the Ashes. They did 10 again in the truly dismal summer of 2001, when they were hammered at home by both Pakistan and Australia. It wasn&apos;t so long ago that Australia were in a similar slump. They lost nine matches last year, though there was a wash-out in the middle. Their 4-0 defeat in India, along with the two back-to-back Ashes, contributed to one of the more extraordinary statistics of 2013, which is that among 41 Tests played outside neutral venues last year, only two were won by the away side. And they were both against Zimbabwe. South Africa also beat Pakistan in Dubai. That&apos;s the lowest number of away wins in a calendar year since 1990. For comparison&apos;s sake, between those two troughs there have been 10 or more away wins in 16 of the 22 years. Tempting as it is to extrapolate conclusions about how hard it has become to win away from home, 2013 may just be an outlier. There were 16, nine, 14, 13 and 12 wins away from home in the five previous years. One definite trend, though, is that clean sweeps are becoming more common. There have been 51 sweeps in series that are at least three Tests long, and 19 of them have occurred since 2000. In the last three years England have lost 5-0 to Australia, who lost 4-0 to India, who lost 4-0 to England and 4-0 to Australia. There have only been 16 4-0 and 5-0 whitewashes in the history of Test cricket, but a quarter of them have come in the last two years, and half in the last 15. Of course there is more cricket being played, but that rise is outstripped by the increasing frequency of series in which one team whitewashes the other. The shortened structure of modern tours means that teams have less time to acclimatise to conditions and, more tellingly, fewer opportunities to find or maintain form against lesser opposition in between Test matches. As Ian Chappell says, out-of-form players are left feeling like they are &quot;at the bottom of a well with no step-ladder and no way out&quot;. It is exacerbated by the strain of the relentless international schedule, which shuffles a player from one series to the next, Test to ODI to T20. And the truth is, this is unlikely to change. Much as it may be a good idea, it&apos;s unlikely that the boards are going to make tours longer by adding more warm-up matches, which attract small crowds and scant interest from broadcasters. But there is, for England at least, some hope. In the time it has taken to write this article, the Thunder have managed to beat the Melbourne Renegades. Just like that, the streak is snapped. \u2022 This is an extract from the Spin, the Guardian&apos;s free weekly cricket email.

The stud reported that the foal is &quot;a handsome colt with a good head, a white blaze and great presence&quot;. The news has been greeted with delight at his owner-breeder Khalid Abdullah&apos;s Banstead Manor Stud in Newmarket, where Frankel stands. Juddmonte Farms general manager Philip Mitchell said: &quot;From the reports that I have received, Frankel&apos;s first foal is everything we could have hoped for. These are very exciting times for everyone who has supported the horse and we much look forward to the rest of his first crop of foals.&quot; 11.25am O&apos;Brien praises &apos;special&apos; St Nicholas Abbey Joseph O&apos;Brien said he was indebted to St Nicholas Abbey, who died on Tuesday, for being the fulcrum of his emerging riding career. The Aidan O&apos;Brien-trained seven-year-old, winner of six races at the highest level, including three Coronation Cups at Epsom, had to be put down after he suffered another bout of colic. O&apos;Brien jnr rode him to two Coronation Cup triumphs and also secured notable victories on the worldwide stage in the 2011 Breeders&apos; Cup Turf, where he became the youngest winning rider in the meeting&apos;s history, and in the 2013 Dubai Sheema Classic at Meydan. Reflecting on his Breeders&apos; Turf success, the jockey told the Telegraph: &quot;He will always be very special to me, and so will that day. &quot;It was my first big win on the world stage, and it was my first big win outside Ireland. He&apos;s a horse I will never forget. I think his best win was in the Sheema Classic in Dubai, but he was very good in his third Coronation Cup, as well. &quot;In his last season, he was so much better than he had ever been. He was so relaxed. He loved his racing and he loved his work. It is sad to see him go that way, we would all have liked to have seen him go to stud. He has given us all here at Ballydoyle some great days.&quot; St Nicholas Abbey&apos;s third Coronation triumph last June - his final racecourse appearance - took his career earnings to almost \u00a35m. PA Wednesday&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook Frankel&apos;s first foal has been born, it emerged this morning; indeed, he&apos;s been a daddy since about 8.30pm on Saturday night when Chrysanthemum gave birth to a bay colt. Coolmore&apos;s manager, Philip Mitchell, described the foal as &quot;everything we could have hoped for&quot;. This is also Chrysanthemum&apos;s first foal. Now six, she won a couple of Group Threes in Ireland for David Wachman, who trained her for Coolmore. She ran in two Group Ones and was third in the Pretty Polly of 2011, a respectful distance behind Misty For Me and Midday. We&apos;ll link to any pictures of the foal when they are published, which is surely only a matter of time. There&apos;s been another 4mm of rain overnight here at Newbury but the going is only soft, officially. It will be back to heavy all round for tomorrow&apos;s jumps action at Ludlow, Rasen and Wincanton, so this might not be a bad day to take an interest. I&apos;m looking at Railway Dillon (2.25) in the only handicap on the card here. From the Donald McCain yard that has sent out 11 winners in the past fortnight at a 35% strike-rate, he looks value at 15-2 to give the yard a rare winner in Berkshire. He found it hard going last season, stepping out of the novice ranks on a mark of 137, and he was highly tried on several occasions. Having dropped to 121, he scored on his return at Bangor last month in a race that became rather a slog. Just 5lb higher, he should still be competitive today and, although he doesn&apos;t have a great reputation for consistency, he strikes me as the most likely candidate to run to his form in these conditions. I can see the appeal of Financial Climate but he scrambled home from four other finishers last time and looks vulnerable from 8lb higher, especially with his weakness for hitting the odd fence. As for Restless Harry, he must be one of the worst 4-1 favourites ever (yes, I know what I&apos;m inviting with stuff like that). His sole win in 10 chase starts was in a weak graduation race and he will not have things falling so kindly against a dozen rivals today. Daryl Jacob could really use a winner for the Paul Nicholls yard, just to stop people talking about his standing there, and the odds-on Dark Lover looks a decent opportunity in the novice chase, won by Nicholls four times in the past five years. But Dark Lover would probably be winless over fences if Balder Succes had jumped the last two cleanly at Cheltenham in October and he has not been seen in the two months since falling at Exeter. This looks like an attempt to find an easy reintroduction and odds-on would not tempt me. Brick Red (1.20) hosed up on his chasing debut at Plumpton recently and comes from the Venetia Williams yard, which is in peak form. He was a smart novice hurdler last year and will give the favourite a proper test at 5-4. Tipping Huzzah (4.25) has been fraught with danger for many years. The veteran runner hasn&apos;t won since May 2008 but he has dropped like a stone in the ratings and a move to Michael Appleby, renowned for improving horses who arrive at his stable, has already provided evidence that Huzzah is ready to come good now. He has obvious prospects at Kempton today following a narrow defeat at Wolverhampton last time and will get very few better opportunities in his current form. Prohibition, who is on a handy mark, is strong in the betting this morning and the top weight is worth noting if that support continues on track. However, Huzzah is 5-1 currently with Wiliam Hill and that looks an each-way steal in this race. Tipping competition, day two Our winners so far: Monday No Buts 11-4 Virginia Ash 11-4 Our Gabrial 4-5 Tuesday Barton Gift 3-1 Pineau De Re 11-4 Admiral Blake 11-2 And our leader is: Rivercity +12 . . . who was perfect yesterday, adding all three winners to Virginia Ash from Monday.

Garc\u00eda&apos;s form in 2013 saw him move back to his rightful place among the top 10 golfers in the world. A serious controversy, namely his infamous &quot;fried chicken&quot; jibe towards Tiger Woods at a European Tour dinner, overshadowed that fine work. Speaking in Abu Dhabi before his appearance at the HSBC Golf Championship, Garc\u00eda reflected on last year&apos;s troubles. Most specifically, he addressed the reaction of American golf fans when he appeared at the US Open in June. A small section of the Merion crowd subjected Garc\u00eda to abuse. &quot;I don&apos;t know if I was prepared for it,&quot; he said. &quot;I mean, it wasn&apos;t certain to know what was going to happen, more than anything at the US Open. It was my first week back there [in the United States]. And it was rough, it was difficult. Only by a minority, but they made themselves heard. &quot;But the good thing is the majority of the people knew me and what happened so they accepted my apologies and they could see that it was truthful. So that&apos;s what helped me to keep going. &quot;You know, it wasn&apos;t easy because I guess that minority are always the loudest and they made themselves heard. It&apos;s never nice to be reminded of something that you don&apos;t like and you don&apos;t enjoy. &quot;I guess the only thing you can do is keep going, do what you love to do and try to show everybody what you are. Hopefully that&apos;s good enough for them to like it.&quot; Asked whether he had spoken at length to Woods, as had not been the case at the time of the US Open, Garc\u00eda said: &quot;We have seen each other at tournaments, yes.&quot; On closer scrutiny regarding a direct apology to the world No1, he added: &quot;I can&apos;t apologise any more. I have apologised and reapologised, so I think it is all over.&quot; Garc\u00eda insisted he can take something positive out of the Woods affair. It will be a small relief to the 34-year-old that this year&apos;s Ryder Cup meeting with the United States, in which he is almost certain to play a part, will take place in Europe. &quot;It was probably a tough three months at least,&quot; the Spaniard said, &quot;but it was a good learning experience. I thought that we learned a lot from it and I think that it made us even stronger. &quot;It has been nice to play a little bit, maybe not think so much about it and then just get your game in shape, your head in the right way.&quot; Garc\u00eda closed 2013 with victory in the Thailand Golf Championship. Earlier, he had criticised the schedule of the European Tour&apos;s inaugural Final Series and controversially opted not to attempt to qualify for its last event in Dubai. &quot;I did talk to George [O&apos;Grady, the European Tour&apos;s chief executive] and Keith [Waters, the tour&apos;s chief operating officer] and the rest of the group,&quot; Garc\u00eda said. &quot;We tried to figure out the best way possible. &quot;I think they realised that for players like me that play on both tours, it&apos;s difficult to put ourselves under so much pressure of playing a lot of tournaments in a row. Our season is so compact in the United States that we play a lot of tournaments and, for me, that&apos;s what happened last year. &quot;I played eight out of nine weeks, or eight out of 10, during the summer and it was just a lot of golf. I needed to rest a little bit and that was towards the end of the year when I wanted to take a couple of breaks. I wanted to play in Dubai but for me to qualify for it, I needed to play pretty much six out of seven weeks. &quot;So it was just too much for me, thinking not about last year but thinking about this season and how I would start it. It was disappointing. I would have loved to be in Dubai and play there, but it&apos;s one of those things that happened.

Usually the supporting cast, the dung beetles, shrews and mice living in Africa and the Sonoran desert in North America are the stars of this opener.

Criquette Head-Maarek&apos;s Treve stretched her unbeaten record to five with a mesmerising display in Europe&apos;s premier middle-distance contest in October, earning her a rating of 130. Frankie Dettori missed the Arc ride after suffering a late injury setback, but can look forward to being reunited with Sheikh Joaan Al Thani&apos;s filly in some of the calendar&apos;s top events later this year. Treve is the highest-rated European three-year-old filly since Bosra Sham earned a mark of 131 in 1996. Peter Moody&apos;s Black Caviar retired unbeaten after 25 career starts. Successful at Royal Ascot in 2012, she won three races in 2013, taking her Group One tally to 15, and finished her career with that rating of 130. She achieved her career-high mark of 132 in 2011 before being rated 130 in each of the following two years, in the process becoming the first racehorse to hold the title of best filly/mare in the world in three consecutive years. With Treve and Black Caviar sharing the title of the world&apos;s highest-rated racehorse, it is the first time since the commencement of the International Classifications in 1977 that the top two racehorses in the world are both female. The pair are rated 10lb below Frankel, who topped last year&apos;s rankings on 140. Joint third in the list are Japanese superstar Orfevre and American ace Wise Dan on 129. Orfevre finished runner-up in the last two renewals of the Arc and brought the curtain down on his career with a brilliant display in the Arima Kinen in Japan last month. Charles LoPresti&apos;s Wise Dan secured successive victories in the Breeders&apos; Cup Mile at Santa Anita and remains officially the best North American turf horse, along with Northern Spur (1995), since North America joined the official world rankings in 1995. Andreas Wohler&apos;s King George VI And Queen Elizabeth Stakes winner Novellist is joint fifth in the rankings with Japanese sprinter Lord Kanaloa on a mark of 128, the first time ever a German horse is overall rated the best colt in Europe. Four horses make up the top 10 on ratings of 125 - Graham Motion&apos;s Dubai World Cup winner Animal Kingdom, Breeders&apos; Cup Classic hero Mucho Macho Man and the Richard Hannon-trained duo Olympic Glory and Toronado. Toronado enjoyed his big day when defeating Dawn Approach (124) in a thrilling Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood. Olympic Glory was narrowly denied by brilliant French mare Moonlight Cloud (123) in the Prix Jacques le Marois at Deauville before an impressive victory in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on Champions Day at Ascot. PA 10.40am Toormore tops juvenile ratings Richard Hannon&apos;s unbeaten juvenile Toormore has been crowned champion two-year-old in the European Thoroughbred Rankings. Owned by Middleham Park Racing, Toormore won each of his three starts in 2013, completing his hat-trick with a most impressive display in the Group One National Stakes at the Curragh in September. He ended his juvenile campaign with a top rating of 122 and is a best priced 10-1 for the 2000 Guineas at Newmarket in May. The son of Arakan is now officially in the care of Hannon&apos;s son, Richard junior, who took over the licence on New Year&apos;s Day. Toormore is rated 2lb below Dawn Approach&apos;s mark of 124 when he was crowned champion juvenile after winning each of his six starts at two in 2012. Second in the juvenile list behind Toormore on a figure of 120 is the Roger Varian-trained Kingston Hill, who won his three outings in little over a month culminating in a dominant display in Doncaster&apos;s Racing Post Trophy in late October. He is also a 10-1 shot for the Guineas, as well as the Epsom Derby. Wesley Ward&apos;s American star No Nay Never and Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s War Command are joint third on 119. No Nay Never won the Norfolk Stakes at Royal Ascot before heading to France to win a hot renewal of the Prix Morny at Deauville. War Command was a brilliant winner of the Coventry Stakes at the Royal meeting and although he suffered defeat on his next start, he went on to win his next two including the Dewhurst Stakes at Newmarket. Jonathan Pease&apos;s Prix Jean-Luc Lagardere winner Karakontie is next in on 118, ahead of Australia, Outstrip and top juvenile filly Chriselliam on 117. O&apos;Brien&apos;s Australia, a son of Galileo out of Ouija Board, won twice from three starts in 2013, signing off with a smart performance at Leopardstown to take him to the head of ante-post lists for the Derby. Outstrip was third in the Dewhurst before winning the Breeders&apos; Cup Juvenile Turf for Godolphin trainer Charlie Appleby. The Charlie Hills-trained Chriselliam proved her Group One victory in the Fillies&apos; Mile was no fluke by showing a blistering turn of foot to win the Breeders&apos; Cup Fillies Juvenile Turf. Spain&apos;s Noozhoh Canarias, narrowly beaten by Karakontie in the Lagardere, and David Wachman&apos;s three-times winner Sudirman are rated on 116. In total 50 two-year-olds achieved a figure of 110 or above, with one of those on 111 being John Gosden&apos;s unbeaten Kingman, who had his season curtailed by a setback but remains prominent in the Guineas betting. PA Thursday&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook There aren&apos;t many tough aspects to this job but one would be having to go and interview the jubilant connections of a winning horse after you&apos;ve embarrassed yourself by ruling him out of contention. So it was with Restless Harry at Newbury yesterday, when I had to plaster a smile on my phizog for Robin Dickin, his trainer, despite having called the beast one of the worst 4-1 shots ever in my preview on here. Dickin is a lovely man and it&apos;s easy to be pleased for him, though I thought he was rubbing it in rather by saying: &quot;The handicapper didn&apos;t ask him to win today, he begged him to win. We&apos;re talking a 157-rated hurdler here that&apos;s run the likes of Teaforthree to a couple of lengths off levels and here he is off 122.&quot; I was wishing I&apos;d heard him before the race saying things like this: &quot;He is temperamental but I&apos;ve felt I&apos;ve had him in such a good place all year and today he just felt a million at home before he came here. If he hadn&apos;t won today, God knows what I would have done. Retired him, I think.&quot; And you just want to hug someone who, when asked how he thinks the handicapper might react to a 17-length success over 10 rivals, replies: &quot;You&apos;d like to think he wouldn&apos;t crucify him all in one hit. I&apos;d like to think, over the years, I&apos;m fair with the handicapper and he&apos;s fair with me. There&apos;s no hokey-pokey at my place. Races are hard enough to win. My horses are very black and white, without pointing any fingers anywhere.&quot; &quot;Point those fingers, Robin!&quot; we begged, but he wouldn&apos;t do it. Restless Harry is likely to have a target, as yet unspecified, at the Cheltenham Festival, possibly taking in a Haydock race en route next month, but the trainer did not appear in the least tempted by Grand National talk. That seems a pity. I&apos;d have thought the National would be in the mind of anyone whose horse bounds up the Newbury straight, well clear of his rivals in a three-mile handicap chase. Restless Harry is likely to be on a rating that will put him near the bottom of the National weights after this, while still being about 20lb below his peak rating, and the Aintree fences these days take much less jumping than those at Newbury. Opportunities for further mortification begin at Ludlow today, where the newly popular Lizzie Kelly rides under rules for the first time since scoring at Cheltenham on New Year&apos;s Day. She has a big chance on Shalimar Fromentro (2.10), a 5-1 shot trained by her stepdad, Nick Williams. This beast hasn&apos;t won for a long time but he&apos;s dropped to a mark that looks handy on the pick of his form and he hasn&apos;t exactly been presented with many straightforward opportunities, doing a lot of his racing in France and in cross-country races. He went well for a long way in the cross-country at Cheltenham last month on ground that would have been too lively for him. In the closer at Market Rasen, Murtys Delight (4.00) is very interesting on his handicap debut, having earned his mark, for the most part, on good to soft, whereas he won his Irish bumper on heavy, which will be rather closer to today&apos;s conditions. His Worcestershire trainer, Dr Richard Newland, has a good record at the track and puts up his useful claiming jockey Christopher Ward for the first time.

Maybe, but also because it is \u201cinspired by the strong iconic value of jade discs and numerological tradition of feng shui.\u201d How so? Because not only does the 50m-wide hole punched through the centre make it look like an ancient Chinese coin, but when the building is reflected in the river it forms the lucky number eight.

Photograph: MAD Architects    A new luxury spring resort on the edge of Taihu lake in China&apos;s eastern Zhejiang province, the Sheraton Huzhou shows that it&apos;s not only western architects that are capable of bringing clunking orientalist symbolism to Asian shores. Designed by Beijing-based MAD Architects, the 27-storey ovoid arch apparently draws on the ancient humpback bridges of the region, and has been souped-up into a space-age glass and steel loop. \u201cHuzhou itself is a place famous for traditional ink paintings and splendid water views, and the arch bridge is one of the key elements of traditional architecture,\u201d says the building&apos;s architect, Ma Yansong. \u201cBy incorporating this iconic ring-shape, my goal was to design a contemporary resort that seamlessly integrates with the surrounding environment while evoking the beautiful arch bridge over Taihu Lake.\u201d The melty hole     Ice cube chic &hellip; Zaha Hadid's design for the Opus Office Tower in Dubai. Image: ZHA    Modelled on what might happen to an ice cube left out in Dubai&apos;s midday sun, the Opus tower by Zaha Hadid looks like an office block mid-thaw, as if buckling under the heat of the financial meltdown. Planned for the centre of Dubai&apos;s Business Bay, it is in fact two blocks, say the architects, conceived as \u201ca single cube eroded by a free-form void, which appears to &apos;hover&apos; above ground level.\u201d A pixelated reflective facade makes it look solid by day, while by night, it \u201cdematerialises, as light floods the void\u201d. Launched at the British Museum in pre-crash euphoria, when the model was dramatically revealed from a block of ice, it has since been on hold \u2013 although may soon return, its innards effortlessly transformed from offices to a luxury hotel. The sky-high piazza hole     Flipped plaza &hellip; MVRDV's Mirador apartment block in Madrid has a public \"look out\" square cut out of the building. Photograph: MVRDV    Designed as an entire city block flipped 90 degrees, the Mirador apartment tower, by Superdutch dreamers MVRDV, erupted on to Madrid&apos;s skyline in 2005 as a vertical stack of neighbourhoods, each with its own colour combo and joined by an eye-searingly orange route of stairs and corridors. And what lies at the centre of every good neighbourhood, but a big open space? So the architects duly flipped that too, creating a \u201clook-out\u201d 40m above ground, an outdoor piazza and a community garden for \u201cmonumentalising life and space\u201d. It&apos;s just a shame most parents find the 12-storey drop a bit of an off-putting place to let their toddlers loose. The broody pixelated hole     Fun with shipping containers &hellip; OMA's proposal for Hamburg was formed of a stack of Tetris-like blocks. Image: OMA    It looks like someone had a wild time with the shipping container crane in Hamburg docks. Either that, or OMA is in town. Conceived as a great pile of Tetris blocks stacked in a crooked loop, the Hamburg Science Centre was planned for the entrance to Magdeburger harbour in 2004, and would have included an aquarium, science theatre and exhibition spaces. Ever the pragmatists, OMA justified the form on purely practical grounds, explaining that \u201cthe function of the 10 blocks that make up the building allow for large-scale programmatic changes on a daily basis.\u201d And, by pure subliminal coincidence, it bore a striking resemblance to a sculpture outside OMA&apos;s Rotterdam HQ.

Photograph: Frans Lemmens/Getty Images    More of a hole with a building around it than a building with a hole in it, La Grande Arche de la D\u00e9fense terminates the end of Paris&apos;s great Axe historique with a monumental void, big enough to hold Notre Dame cathedral. Designed by Danish architect Johann Otto von Spreckelsen in the 1980s, it was the winning scheme in a competition for a \u201cmodern Arc de Triomphe\u201d, conceived as a \u201cmonument to humanity\u201d rather than military victory. As if trying to suck the entire French capital in through its gaping mouth, it stands like a sinister portal to another dimension, subtly tilted off axis to connect with the Eiffel and Montparnasse Towers and the Louvre, forming a grand masonic geometry of which Baron Haussman would be proud. The spiralling worm-hole     Swiss cheese &hellip; BIG's design for a technology centre in Taiwan features a spiraling public route cut through the building.

A great shed of shops, showrooms, offices, conference rooms, exhibition spaces, restaurants and galleries, it is livened up by having a spiralling wormhole drilled all the way through the building, designed to suck the public in through its irresistible vortex. The entire block will be clad with step-spaced concrete fins that recede inwards, allowing people to climb into the facade and walk all the way up to the roof. The sinister Eye-of-Sauron hole     Mordor awaits &hellip; Shanghai's World Financial Centre has a hole cut out to reduce wind loading. Photograph: KPF    When the architects of Shanghai&apos;s 500m-tall World Financial Centre began to worry about wind loading at the top of their twisting tower, they did what any sensible person would do and just cut a big hole out of the top to let the wind go through it. The hole was originally going to be round, with a plan to install a ferris wheel inside it, but costs \u2013 and the potential terror factor of spinning around 500m in the air \u2013 meant the plan was binned. Still, despite looking like it might shoot out an Eye of Sauron deathray any second, it will make a nifty bottle-opener when the giants arrive.

When one of McIlroy&apos;s playing partners, Phil Mickelson, described the 24-year-old&apos;s driving as &quot;impeccable&quot; there was no sense of exaggeration.

He had been called in by the tournament referee on Friday morning to explain his perfectly legal repairing of a pitch mark on the 18th green on Thursday. A TV viewer had reported the incident, a turn of events that riled the Spaniard. &quot;Being related to that word is the most disgusting thing that can happen to someone, and someone like me that has never, ever cheated,&quot; Garc\u00eda said. &quot;It does feel quite bad to be related to that word, to the word cheating, when you have no proof and when I&apos;ve never, ever cheated in my whole life.&quot; England&apos;s Tommy Fleetwood clearly believes that the best way to impress a Ryder Cup captain is to do so in person.

For days Team Miliband had been trailing the Labour leader&apos;s upcoming economic speech, promising that, in the manner of a vengeful action hero, he would call down &quot;a reckoning&quot; on the heads of those renegade bankers, part of an election-winning crusade that would heal, once and for all, &quot;Britain&apos;s broken banking system&quot;. And then George Osborne just happened to mention in a BBC interview that \u2013 this wasn&apos;t his decision of course \u2013 but the Low Pay Commission could probably now consider restoring the minimum wage to its &quot;real value&quot;. How much was that? Well, if Nick Robinson twisted his arm for a figure, how about an 11% bump next year to \u00a37 an hour? If your core message is the cost of living crisis, and you&apos;re about to make a major speech on the economy the next day, this is what is known as an unhelpful intervention.

His theme, instead, was the &quot;new economy&quot;, a phrase repeated six times in his speech, though not \u2013 it was a political address, after all \u2013 defined in any intelligible sense. Cameron and Osborne&apos;s plan was &quot;not a recipe for building a new economy&quot;, it was &quot;a recipe for clinging on to the old economy&quot;. Only in tackling the banking system could Labour prove it was serious about constructing said novel economy. The stakes, friends, were &quot;incredibly high. To build the new economy, to leave behind the old economy in the past&quot;. Got that? Good. Ed Miliband may not \u2013 unlike some at the Treasury, as it emerged this week \u2013 have had taxpayer-funded acting lessons at Rada, but he has certainly mastered the key prime ministerial requirement of delivering a lengthy speech without notes. And yet he&apos;s much more human and convincing when speaking for himself than when repeating from memory, and occasionally garbling, the metaphors of his speechwriters. &quot;The cost of living crisis is about the pound in people&apos;s pocket. But it&apos;s much, much deeper.&quot; Deeper than people&apos;s pockets? Well I suppose they aren&apos;t deep pockets, which is why there&apos;s a cost of living crisis in the first place. &quot;And because the problems are deep, the solutions need to be deep as well. Friends, that is the task of the next Labour government.&quot; That&apos;s deep \u2013 I think. By contrast, the Miliband who took questions from the floor was relaxed and funny. His problem was that his awkwardly off-message supporters kept asking about things other than the economy. &quot;First of all, can I thank you for your stance on Syria,&quot; said one elderly questioner. Secondly, could he promise that a future Labour government wouldn&apos;t engage with &quot;backward states like Qatar and Dubai&quot;? There was then something about fracking and the selling of Heathrow airport to France. &quot;What are you going to do about that?&quot; &quot;Well, I&apos;m really pleased I called on you,&quot; said Miliband. His next questioner was from the Financial Times, who obligingly asked about bankers&apos; bonuses. &quot;I will say one nice thing about the banks,&quot; said Miliband, suggesting that some at the top now did recognise the need for major change.

A draft proposal to be presented to an ICC board meeting in Dubai on 28 to 29 January will call for wholesale reform of international cricket, in a move with far more significant implications than the scrapping of the World Test Championship. A position paper from the ICC&apos;s financial and commercial affairs group advocates the formation of a new executive committee, with responsibility for &quot;all constitutional, personnel, integrity, ethics, development and nominations matters, as well as all matters regarding [financial] distributions from the ICC&quot;. Crucially, three of the members of this committee would come from England, Australia and India, with a fourth to be nominated by the ICC&apos;s executive board. The chairmanship of the ICC, a new position due to be filled this year, would also rotate between England, Australia and India. This may be interpreted as a power grab, although the draft argues that it merely recognises the existing reality \u2013 that England, Australia and India are &quot;the primary revenue contributing members&quot; of the ICC \u2013 and &quot;structurally commits [them] to the leadership and continued success of the ICC as a member-led, member-driven organisation&quot;. Giles Clarke, the chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board who is also the chairman of the F&amp;CA group, was noncommittal when contacted by the Observer, stressing: &quot;There&apos;s not much I can say about a draft. We get through a lot of those.&quot; The rest of the 21-page document contains a combination of carrot and stick for the other cricketing nations. A new Test Cricket Fund would be set up &quot;to encourage members to play and grow the success of long-form cricket within their countries&quot;. That would be targeted specifically at six established ICC member nations who &quot;are currently faced with the increasing challenge of uneconomic or unfeasible tours&quot; \u2013 Bangladesh, Zimbabwe, Pakistan, West Indies, New Zealand and Sri Lanka. But the Test cricket strugglers would also be threatened with losing their place at the top table for the first time by the introduction of a two-tier system, with the winners of a second-level Intercontinental Cup given the opportunity to challenge the lowest-ranked of the eight team elite in a four-Test series every four years. More generally, the F&amp;CA state that &quot;a better and stronger ICC needs its members to be financially strong and independent&quot;, in contrast to the current position whereby &quot;most members \u2026 expect the ICC to solve any financial problems that they may encounter&quot;. So &quot;a key objective of this review is to provide for changes so that members accept they are responsible for cricket in their countries and are responsible for running the game in a sustainable way so that cricket thrives in their region&quot;. The draft also contains an admission that the World Test Championship, which was to have been held in England in 2017, has run into &quot;insurmountable difficulties in finalising a workable format&quot;, and recommends that the Champions Trophy is revived to take its place. In one more proposal that provides an easy target for those concerned about the big three of England, Australia and India seizing control of the game, it is recommended that they are given exemption from being relegated from the top tier of Test cricket \u2013 &quot;solely to protect ICC income due to the importance of those markets and teams to prospective ICC media rights buyers&quot;.", "title": "England, Australia and India could get more control under ICC proposals", "sentences": ["A draft proposal to be presented to an ICC board meeting in Dubai on 28 to 29 January will call for wholesale reform of international cricket, in a move with far more significant implications than the scrapping of the World Test Championship."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-18T15:40:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/18/nigerians-gay-hatred-sexual-freedom", "tags": ["Nigeria", "Africa", "World news", "LGBT rights", "Sexuality", "Uganda", "Sharia law", "Religion", "Islam", "Law"], "article": "The party had just started when the gunshot pierced the music. Instantly the men scattered, knowing what it meant: a police raid. They had gathered in a hotel in the northern Nigerian state of Bauchi, renting out almost a whole floor for a surprise birthday party. But in the minaret-dotted city, where sharia in theory requires gay men to be stoned to death, such stolen moments are fraught. Someone had tipped off the Hisbah \u2013 the religious police. As officials stormed in on that night in 2007, John (not his real name) felt numb with fear. He ran to a room, switched off the lights and crawled under the bed. &quot;They checked room by room. They opened the door and flashed a flashlight, but they thought it was empty.&quot; They arrested 18 others. A week later, John went to Friday prayers at the mosque. He prayed for 18 of his friends who faced sodomy charges in a sharia court. He prayed for their lawyer, who was forced to sneak into the first hearing via a side door as a mob threatened to stone him for defending &quot;gay marriage&quot;. He prayed for strength to do what he had decided to do next. &quot;That incident really gave us the courage to start doing something. We couldn&apos;t hide any more,&quot; recalls John. And so, in one of the most conservative states in Nigeria, he started holding underground meetings with other gay people. They supported each other when neighbours accused them of being &quot;demons&quot;. Sometimes money was pooled together to pay bail or buy condoms, handed out to those who couldn&apos;t afford them. Mainly, though, they helped each other cross the lonely horizon of living each day in denial, finding solace in mutual acceptance. For years, they gathered in secret. But last week Nigeria&apos;s president, Goodluck Jonathan, signed the same-sex marriage (prohibition) bill, unleashing a wave of homophobia that threatens to sweep away seven years spent building a fragile haven. The far-reaching law targets not only homosexuals but also those who support their rights, or who fail to report gay people. At least 40 arrests last week swelled the number of those incarcerated to almost 200 across Nigeria, rights groups told the Observer. One by one, John and his friends fled the city. &quot;More than 90% of Nigerians are opposed to same-sex marriage. So, the law is in line with our cultural and religious beliefs as a people,&quot; said Reuben Abati, the presidential spokesman. The president&apos;s approval ratings soared after months of dismal news about corruption, political violence and a radical Islamist insurgency in the north. From his location in hiding, John thinks about what to do next. &quot;I&apos;m not comfortable here at all. I cannot stay here doing nothing.&quot; In a hotel room in the capital, Abuja, two women in hijabs are visiting Dorothy Aken&apos;ova to buy goods considered contraband: sex toys. Providing a rare place where society women feel comfortable enough to buy roleplay lingerie without being judged is just one way Aken&apos;ova tries to liberate her sexually repressed country. Another is hiring lawyers to defend men or women arrested for being gay. The mother of three has filled her week with phone calls, trying to find lawyers willing to represent those in detention. One man was arrested after his landlord said it was suspicious he shared a flat with another man. &quot;The lawyers who accept these jobs will charge the skin on your bum. But then the cost of armed guards to accompany them isn&apos;t cheap,&quot; Aken&apos;ova sighs, before telling the two giggling women the price for bottles of massage oil. Money \u2013 sometimes out of Aken&apos;ova&apos;s own pocket \u2013 is no longer the biggest problem. Simply persuading someone to take up cases is much harder, with many fearing they will be targeted by association. &quot;As soon as I mention gender minority rights, people ask me: &apos;Are you a lesbian?&apos; You can tell they&apos;re willing to immediately dissociate with you if you answer in the affirmative,&quot; says Aken&apos;ova, whose quick smile blossoms as brightly as the tattooed flower on her right biceps. Such reactions are common across Africa, where populist bills have cracked down on homosexuality, often tightening colonial-era laws. International pressure against such moves has fuelled anti-gay sentiment, with leaders using anger at perceived western interference as an escape valve. The Ugandan president, Yoweri Museveni, last week said gay people were the product of &quot;random breeding&quot; in the west when &quot;nature goes wrong&quot;, but blocked an anti-gay bill after months of pressure from international donors. Unlike Uganda, about half of whose budget is supplied by western donors, Nigeria is flush with petrodollars and can defy such pressure. For campaigners, the problem starts with the title of the bill. &quot;People read it and think: OK, I agree with this. They don&apos;t question what else is inside that bill,&quot; says Aken&apos;ova, who has never heard of anyone campaigning for gay marriage. &quot;It&apos;s not [just] anti-gay people; it&apos;s anti-people.&quot; Last year, a lawmaker said of the bill: &quot;You have a right to your sexual preference but by trying to turn it into marriage do you realise you could be infringing on the human rights of the other person who finds it repulsive?&quot; So far, they haven&apos;t been the victims. Last week Ibrahim Marafaa, a 47-year-old teacher who was arrested before the bill was signed, was publicly flogged and fined 5,000 naira (\u00a320) after &quot;confessing to his abnormality&quot;. &quot;If he feels an injustice has been done, he has the right to appeal within 30 days,&quot; said Alhassan Zakaria, the sharia lawyer who oversaw the whipping. Down south, too, floggings aren&apos;t uncommon. Lagos-based rights worker Olumide Makanjuola recounts how a friend of his agreed to be flogged in a bid to &quot;whip the devil out of him&quot;. &quot;He just wanted to stop being the subject of hatred,&quot; Makanjuola says, very softly. Immaculately dressed and dreadlocked, he talks energetically, at incredible speed, despite several nights awake fielding dozens of phone calls. Earlier he spent an hour talking to family members to reassure them about his safety. Then two friends called to say they&apos;re leaving the country. One, a doctor, asked if he could be prosecuted for treating gay patients. Last year Makanjuola documented a case where four men suspected of being gay were publicly stripped, beaten, tied together and paraded naked in a south-western village. The police said they had no evidence of the incident, captured on camera by a jeering mob, but opened investigations to find out if the men were &quot;sodomites&quot;. Makanjuola refuses to believe the mob&apos;s anger was about homosexuality which, he says, was a scapegoat for their desperation in a country where mismanagement and corruption have left most people jobless and poor. &quot;They&apos;re a clear example of people who are frustrated by the system. But they should be directing it at our leaders who are buying houses in London and Dubai using looted funds,&quot; he says. Others have little truck with that argument. &quot;Being gay is due to lack of parental care,&quot; says Abdullahi Sani, a policeman who took time off work to attend the lashing in Bauchi. &quot;Twenty lashes is child&apos;s play compared to the offence. The victim has ceased to be a normal human being. He has lost sight of God.&quot; It&apos;s in this climate John has worked to forge his place in the world. And life was beginning to make sense, he says. His goal was clear: to act as a point man in a quiet but growing underground movement. This despite his father sitting him down last month and telling him about a gay friend who had recently been beaten up, to stop &quot;associating with that gay boy&quot;. &quot;I&apos;ll try but it&apos;s not good to suddenly start avoiding a friend. He&apos;s a human being,&quot; John told him. Once, his mother, who died last year, took him aside. &quot;She told me: People will always talk. Forget about them. Just be careful and concentrate on your studies,&quot; he recalls. &quot;She loved me so much because I was the last-born son,&quot; he says, his voice breaking. John tries to remember that advice now, sometimes turning to Aken&apos;ova as a mother figure. Earlier in the day he called her and said he wanted to return home. &quot;Just stay where you are until things calm down,&quot; she told him gently. But the longing to be among his friends, including those released from jail, is unbearable. &quot;I just want to be with them. Even if it&apos;s just for 30 minutes.&quot; Besides, he wants to get information to pass to the lawyer. He will return to the city under cover of nightfall. He will go to meet the parents of one of the jailed men, and help them with bail money. Do I think that&apos;s a good idea? Love can make you do crazy things, I say. &quot;Yes,&quot; he agrees despondently. After a pause, he speaks again. &quot;But if people can learn to hate, do you think they can learn to love?&quot;", "title": "The Nigerians who dare to speak of love as a tide of anti-gay hatred rises", "sentences": ["But they should be directing it at our leaders who are buying houses in London and Dubai using looted funds,&quot; he says."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-18T19:34:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/19/england-australia-india-reform-cricket", "tags": ["Sport"], "article": "Cricket: Big three bid to wrest control of ICC spoils England, Australia and India could take far greater control of world cricket if a proposed shake-up of the global game goes ahead.

Two years ago, the Northern Irishman was pipped to first place by a stroke and Robert Rock. McIlroy had been penalised two shots during round two for illegally brushing sand away while not on a putting surface. Another penalty situation undermined McIlroy this time round. After his Saturday sanction, again two shots, for not taking full relief from a spectator walkway, McIlroy watched history repeat itself. Pablo Larraz\u00e1bal claimed the trophy, at 14-under par, by a shot from McIlroy and Phil Mickelson, who also had just cause to ponder what might have been. Whereas on Saturday evening McIlroy&apos;s temper snapped, he was outwardly more relaxed 24 hours later. Perhaps the surprise appearance of his fiancee Caroline Wozniacki, who arrived in Abu Dhabi on Sunday morning after her third-round exit from the Australian Open, lightened his mood. Understandable traces of frustration, though, remained. &quot;I feel like I&apos;m standing here and I should be 15-under par for the tournament and win by one,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;But that&apos;s the way it goes. I played the least shots of anyone this week. So I can count it as a moral victory more than anything. &quot;It&apos;s frustrating. I have played well the whole week. It&apos;s a very positive start to the season so I&apos;m not going to let one little negative ruin that. This is going to be my third second-place finish at this tournament. I have had a few good finishes here and not quite won it. &quot;On the 18th it started to dawn on me if that [penalty] had not happened, I would have won. But that&apos;s the way it goes. I tried to win today and nearly did. &quot;Pablo played very well. I can&apos;t take anything away from him. When he needed to, he hit the shots, and the two shots he hit into 18 were straight out of the top drawer. So fair play to him. It&apos;s good to see, he&apos;s a good guy, one of my closer friends out here and good to see him get the win.&quot; Mickelson&apos;s aberration was every bit as bizarre as that of McIlroy. The Open champion&apos;s wild tee shot at the 13th came to rest under a bush. As he attempted to play his way \u2013 backhanded \u2013 out of this terrible predicament, Mickelson performed a double-hit. A triple-bogey seven followed and while the American came roaring back with typical appetite, the affair cost him victory. &quot;It never crossed my mind it might double-hit,&quot; Mickelson said. &quot;I was just trying to dribble it out of the bush because I couldn&apos;t get the unplayable lie to give me a shot without stroke and distance. I felt it was worth the risk. &quot;When it hit the club, not only did it cost me a penalty stroke but it also stopped the ball from going to a spot where I could hit it again. So it was like a two-shot hit of the club essentially. If I could just have got the ball to go 10 feet, it would have been fine. I make my bogey, I try to make up ground later on. It happens, though, unfortunately.&quot; Mickelson took heart from playing himself into contention in a tournament at which he had toiled in the early stages. McIlroy, who will spend the coming week practising and fulfilling sponsors&apos; commitments in Dubai, also has every cause to display a positive mindset in the cold light of day. It seems inconceivable that he will not compete regularly at the top of leaderboards this year, in contrast to his troubled form throughout the vast majority of 2013. As much as victory in Abu Dhabi would have been welcome, McIlroy knows his career is once again on an upward curve. His next competitive appearance will be at the 25th anniversary of the Dubai Desert Classic on Thursday week, where he will lock horns with a certain T Woods. &quot;I feel good about my game and feel like I&apos;m back to the place that I want to be,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;I&apos;m driving the ball well, hitting the ball solidly and giving myself plenty of chances for birdies. And if I can keep doing that, the wins will come. I am really excited for the rest of the season.&quot; Larraz\u00e1bal&apos;s name had barely appeared in dispatches until two birdies in his first four holes on Sunday. The Spaniard followed up rounds of 69, 70 and 68 with a 67 which was aided in no small part by a back nine of 33. He retained his nerve wonderfully well to hole from seven feet for birdie on the 72nd green, given Mickelson&apos;s presence in the group behind. &quot;Thank God it went in, because I would not be here if I had to go to a playoff with Phil and Rory,&quot; Larraz\u00e1bal said. Instead, he collected a cheque for \u00a3272,446 to mark his first European Tour victory since 2011. &quot;I beat two of the three most talented guys in my era and in the last era, as well,&quot; Larraz\u00e1bal added. &quot;I was sitting in the prize ceremony saying: &apos;Pablo, what are you doing here?&apos; I had Rory McIlroy to my left and I had just shaken hands with Phil Mickelson.

That is one of the more unlikely and intriguing proposals in the leaked working paper of the ICC&apos;s financial and commercial affairs committee, to be discussed at a board meeting on Wednesday week, which has inevitably been overlooked in the global furore provoked by the desire of England, Australia and India to seize greater control of the game. There is no chance of the ICC leaving the jurisdiction of the United Arab Emirates, where it has been based since leaving Lord&apos;s in 2005. But in its working paper, which has been seen by the Guardian, the F&amp;CA stresses: &quot;Under UAE laws it is not necessary for the management to be located in the same jurisdiction. &quot;This facilitates the possible relocation of ICC management from Dubai to any potentially more favourable location where local talent is also available. The F&amp;CA is currently in the final stages of evaluating these options, including reviewing the comparative advantages and disadvantages of Singapore, Colombo, Cardiff and Dubai as the administrative home of the ICC, and will report back to the ICC executive board on this matter shortly.&quot; The ICC has been linked with a move from Dubai on a couple of previous occasions, with the former England &amp; Wales Cricket Board (and Glamorgan) president David Morgan heading a six-man panel that considered a return to Lord&apos;s in 2009, when Mumbai was also mooted. Singapore missed out to Dubai when the decision was made to leave Lord&apos;s in 2005 and, like Colombo, would recognise the new power-base of the global game in Asia. However, Cardiff has emerged as a more cost-effective British option than Lord&apos;s. It was one of three host cities for the ICC&apos;s Champions Trophy last summer, largely due to financial support from the Welsh government, which would almost certainly be forthcoming in an effort to secure a permanent ICC presence in Cardiff. Reaction to the more contentious aspects of the F&amp;CA&apos;s proposals \u2013 notably the creation of a new four-man executive committee on which England, India and Australia would be permanent members, and the exemption of the same three countries from relegation under a new two-tier system for Test cricket \u2013 has been mostly hostile. Giles Clarke, the ECB&apos;s chairman who also chairs the F&amp;CA, and his major allies \u2013 Wally Edwards of Cricket Australia and N Srinivasan of the Board of Control for Cricket in India \u2013 will not have been remotely surprised by that. But the key for them will be how the numbers stack up when their paper is considered at the quarterly meeting of the ICC board on 28-29 January. If the alternative, as has been suggested, is India walking away from the ICC, then the other seven full members may regard proposals that bind India to a four-man executive committee and maintain some, admittedly reduced, financial guarantees \u2013 including the establishment of a new Test Match Fund to support loss-making five-day cricket \u2013 more sympathetically than most in the media. Martin Snedden, a member of the New Zealand Cricket Board, provided a first hint of the lesser nations&apos; priorities when he conceded that a desire for India to secure a greater share of the revenue for which they are largely responsible is &quot;not unreasonable&quot; but stressed the importance of at least maintaining the current future tours programme, which runs until 2020. &quot;Do we have power at the ICC table?&quot; Snedden asked in Wellington&apos;s Dominion Post, rhetorically. &quot;Not a hell of a lot. Do we have an ability to influence and persuade? A little bit. &quot;The critical thing that [we] have to do is identify those things that are most critical to us and try and ensure we secure the stability of a playing programme and the stability of revenue that we need.&quot;", "title": "Cardiff in contention to replace Dubai as ICC's administrative base", "sentences": ["Cardiff is one of three contenders, with Colombo and Singapore, to replace Dubai as the administrative base of the International Cricket Council.", "&quot;This facilitates the possible relocation of ICC management from Dubai to any potentially more favourable location where local talent is also available.", "The F&amp;CA is currently in the final stages of evaluating these options, including reviewing the comparative advantages and disadvantages of Singapore, Colombo, Cardiff and Dubai as the administrative home of the ICC, and will report back to the ICC executive board on this matter shortly.&quot; The ICC has been linked with a move from Dubai on a couple of previous occasions, with the former England &amp; Wales Cricket Board (and Glamorgan) president David Morgan heading a six-man panel that considered a return to Lord&apos;s in 2009, when Mumbai was also mooted.", "Singapore missed out to Dubai when the decision was made to leave Lord&apos;s in 2005 and, like Colombo, would recognise the new power-base of the global game in Asia."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-19T18:27:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/jan/20/getting-away-murder-bhutto-munoz-siege-taj-clark-review", "tags": ["Politics", "Pakistan", "Benazir Bhutto", "Books", "Culture"], "article": "Decade after decade, Pakistan waxes and wanes as a news story. The early and late 70s, the end of the 80s, the beginning and end of the last decade have all seen spikes of interest in this complicated, troubled nation. In 2007 and 2008, two events in particular focused attention on the country: the assassination of Benazir Bhutto in the northern city of Rawalpindi and the terrorist operation launched by Pakistan-based Islamic militants on the Indian commercial capital of Mumbai, which left 166 dead. Together with new violence along the Afghan-Pakistani frontier as Pakistani troops tried to roll back resurgent extremists and bombings across Pakistan itself, these two attacks signalled the return of the &quot;strategic centre of gravity&quot; of the post-9/11 battle against extremist violence to south-west Asia after the shift to the Middle East following the invasion of Iraq in 2003. Heraldo Mu\u00f1oz is a UN assistant secretary general who led the investigation into the assassination of Bhutto. He tells his story in Getting Away With Murder: Benazir Bhutto&apos;s Assassination and the Politics of Pakistan, a short book which, though oversold by publishers&apos; claims of a &quot;gripping&quot; narrative that goes &quot;further than anyone else to unravel the mystery&quot; of the two-time prime minister&apos;s death, nonetheless makes some interesting points. Central to the narrative is Bhutto herself. I spent much time with this impressive but deeply flawed woman in Pakistan in the late 90s, spoke to her regularly throughout her exile and accompanied her on several days&apos; campaigning close to the Afghan border only a week or so before she died. She was charming, intelligent, moderate and extraordinarily brave. On one occasion, I joined her after she impulsively halted her motorcade and headed off into a market in a violence-prone conservative town to mix with stallholders and shoppers. But Bhutto was also intolerant of dissent, wilfully blind to the faults of key associates and, by the time she returned to Pakistan, in 2007, out of touch with her homeland. It is this latter element that is crucial. Nawaz Sharif, a conservative industrialist, is now prime minister, for the third time. His victory last year in polls that saw the first peaceful transfer of power from one civilian administration that had served its full term to another was not a surprise. Sharif&apos;s brand of business-friendly, pious nationalism matches the aspirations and values of the Pakistani &quot;man in the street&quot; in a way that the moderate, centre-left, pro-western secularism of the Pakistan People&apos;s party, led until her death by Bhutto, did not. Bhutto was a canny and acute politician but had spent too much time in Washington and Dubai during her eight-year exile and, as her campaign speeches in the weeks before she died showed, had not yet adjusted to the great changes urbanisation, a post-9/11 atmosphere of radicalisation throughout the Islamic world and a short-lived but powerful economic boom had wreaked in her homeland. These changes, particularly the cultural swing of Pakistan away from south Asia and towards the Middle East, are likely to continue in the years to come. Mu\u00f1oz is rightly angry that US and UK diplomats brokered a deal to get Bhutto back into Pakistan but then made no real effort to ensure her safety once she was there. His comprehensive overview of US-Pakistani relations since 1947 makes salutary reading. But though he mentions some of the faults of the brilliant, mercurial, charismatic and utterly unscrupulous Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto, Benazir&apos;s father, and references his instigation of the training of conservative Islamists to hit hardline leftist nationalists in Afghanistan in the early 70s, some may find the portrayal of this key historical figure a shade uncritical. Bhutto senior&apos;s commitment to socialism or secularism was patchy; his commitment to power was total. He was far from a pioneer of moderation, secularism and economic equity. As for the murder mystery at the heart of the book, Mu\u00f1oz concludes that Benazir&apos;s killer was a teenage suicide bomber dispatched by Pakistani extremists probably from the Pakistan Taliban organisation that may have benefited from the assistance of elements within the country&apos;s security establishment. This is far from revelatory, as the jacket blurb would have us believe, but is entirely reasonable \u2013 a quality often missing from commentary about a country that seems to inspire semi-hysterical scaremongering. It is a shame that this largely careful, sympathetic work by someone who does care about Pakistan, even though he has clearly seen little of it, is marred by several small but serious factual errors. Missile strikes into Afghanistan, after double bombings of their embassies, were launched in 1998 (not 1996). Nor did &quot;Pakistani mujahideen&quot; capture the Indian town of Kargil during clashes in 1999, only a high mountain ridge some distance away. To have taken Kargil itself would have almost certainly triggered a major, possibly nuclear, war so the distinction is important. The attacks in Mumbai constitute one of the most ambitious terrorist operations of recent times. A group of 10 young men landed by boat having travelled from Karachi, the Pakistani port city. Sent by Lashkar-e-Taiba, one of the biggest Pakistani extremist outfits, they shot and bombed hospitals, a tourist cafe, the main railway station, a Jewish centre and two luxury hotels, including the Taj, before eventually all but one were killed by Indian security\u00a0forces. Adrian Levy and Cathy Scott-Clark recount the story of the battle for the Taj with verve, pace and meticulous, if sometimes overwhelming, detail. The Siege: Three Days of Terror Inside the Taj is harrowing and unforgiving. The hotel general manager is unable to save his children and wife from fire and bullets; a father talks to his son on a mobile phone as gunmen approach to shoot him dead; staff watch colleagues die on the floor of their workplace. Even the escapees are scarred for ever. The episode revealed the manifold weaknesses of the Indian government&apos;s security apparatus. Though warned by a series of precise intelligence inputs, Mumbai police, with a few notable exceptions, did almost nothing. When the worst did happen, the response was bureaucratic, inefficient and disastrously slow. It took 12 hours for the nation&apos;s crack anti-terrorist units to be effectively deployed. There has been no real inquiry, few have been held to account and it is far from certain that the response to any similar incident now would be any better.", "title": "Getting Away With Murder by Heraldo Munoz; The Siege by Cathy Scott-Clark and Adrian Levy \u2013 review", "sentences": ["Bhutto was a canny and acute politician but had spent too much time in Washington and Dubai during her eight-year exile and, as her campaign speeches in the weeks before she died showed, had not yet adjusted to the great changes urbanisation, a post-9/11 atmosphere of radicalisation throughout the Islamic world and a short-lived but powerful economic boom had wreaked in her homeland."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-20T10:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jan/20/live-racing-january-20-2014", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "1.30pm Dettori back with three rides on Wednesday Tony Paley: Jockey Frankie Dettori will have three rides when he returns to the sport at Lingfield on Wednesday.

Monday&apos;s best bets, by Greg Wood Banging the drum for Fibresand racing at Southwell can feel like a very lonely business at times, but on an afternoon when the jumping has succumbed to the weather, the card at the Nottinghamshire track is perfectly acceptable. The mile handicap on the card in particular is an intriguing one, as the admirable veteran Noble Citizen attempts to follow up a winning debut on this surface last week. Tatting (3.10) was about three lengths behind him in third place in that contest, and strictly on the book, there is no reason why Chris Dwyer&apos;s gelding should reverse the form. That was an apprentice event so both run off the same marks today, and Noble Citizen, who is off 80, has been competitive in valuable events in Dubai off marks in the mid-90s in the past. Tatting, though, had looked a natural recruit to Fibresand in his previous outing, and last week&apos;s race did not unfold to suit him. He was short of room in the final furlong too, and at the prices on offer, Tatting is worth backing at at around 5-2 to regain the winning thread. Stanlow (4.30) was a winner last week at 6-1 and has every chance of a repeat off a 3lb higher mark at Wolverhampton if he can match the form of his previous start over today&apos;s course and distance. Maakirr (3.40) at Southwell and Spreadable (3.30) at Wolverhampton are worth an interest too.

Members of the marine conservation group Sea Shepherd who are monitoring the annual cull in Taiji, on Japan\u2019s Pacific coast, said local fishermen had started killing an estimated 250 dolphins just before 7.30am. The animals were last week corralled in a cove in the town, which drew international attention in 2009 with the release of the Oscar-winning documentary The Cove. More than 50 of the mammals, including a rare albino calf, were selected and removed from the pod for sale to aquariums and water parks. Together they are expected to fetch millions of dollars. The rest are being slaughtered for their meat, a delicacy that most Japanese shun but which still forms part of the diet in Taiji and other whaling towns. &quot;These dolphins are wrangled and wrestled into the killing cove, where they&apos;ve sustained multiple injuries. Dolphin killers deliberately run over the pod with skiffs, they wrestle them, man-handled them into captive nets before even being slaughtered,&quot; Melissa Sehgal, a Sea Shepherd activist, told Reuters. The methods used to capture and kill the dolphins have attracted widespread condemnation. Fishermen bang metal poles together beneath the water to confuse the animals\u2019 hypersensitive sonar before herding them into shallow water, where they are left for up to several days before being taken to the cove to be slaughtered. Hidden from view beneath tarpaulin covers, the fishermen drive metal rods into the dolphins\u2019 spinal cords and leave them to die. &quot;It takes up to 20 to 30 minutes for these dolphins to die, where they bleed out, suffocate or drown in the process of being dragged to the butcher house,&quot; Sehgal said. They are then taken by boat to a quayside warehouse to be cut up into slabs of meat. \u201cIt is reprehensible that the Taiji dolphin hunters are killing dolphins for human consumption, because all dolphin meat is toxic \u2013 up to 5,000 times more toxic than allowed by the World Health Organisation,\u201d The Cove\u2019s director, Louie Psihoyos, told the Guardian. \u201cThe hunters claim they are poor and need the meat to feed their families, but who would feed poison to their children and parents? The dolphin hunters make up to US$200,000 for each captive dolphin so they are anything but poor. They also claim they are family men, but they have just massacred a whole pod full of families.\u201d The Sea Shepherd activists in Taiji, who call themselves the Cove Guardians, said dozens of animals had been killed by mid-morning, adding that the sea has turned a deep shade of red. \u201cWater of the cove continues to run red with the blood of innocent bottlenose dolphins who have been murdered,\u201d they wrote. In a rare public intervention by a US official, Washington\u2019s ambassador to Tokyo, Caroline Kennedy, expressed \u201cdeep concern\u201d over the dolphin hunt. Kennedy tweeted on Saturday: \u201cDeeply concerned by inhumaneness of drive hunt dolphin killing.&quot; She said the US government opposed the practice. In an open letter  to the people of Taiji released Monday, the Japanese artist and peace campaigner Yoko Ono called for an end to the cull. &quot;I understand how you must feel about the one-sidedness of the west to be angry at your traditional capture and slaughter of dolphins,&quot; she wrote. But, Ono added, the slaughter was harming Japan\u2019s international reputation and gave countries such as China and Russia an excuse to \u201cspeak ill of Japan\u201d. She wrote: &quot;The future of Japan and its safety depends on many situations, but what you do with dolphins now can create a very bad relationship with the whole world.&quot;     The annual dolphin hunt in Taiji, Japan Photograph: Seashepherd.org/EPA    On Monday, Japan\u2019s chief cabinet secretary defended the hunt. &quot;I believe dolphin fishing is one of Japan&apos;s traditional fishing industries and is carried out appropriately in accordance to the law,\u201d Suga told reporters when asked about Kennedy\u2019s comments. \u201cFurthermore, dolphins are not within the management of the International Whaling Commission and it is left to the respective nations to manage this resource. \u201cWe will explain Japan&apos;s position to the American side.&quot; Japanese officials point out that there is no international ban on killing bottlenose dolphins and that the animals are not endangered. Fishermen in Taiji, meanwhile, say the hunt provides a crucial source of income and helps maintain fish stocks in the area. Taiji is regarded as the spiritual home of Japan&apos;s coastal whaling industry. The first hunts took place in the early 1600s, according to the town&apos;s whaling museum, but the industry went into decline after the introduction of a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Dolphins and other small cetaceans are not covered by the ban. But activists questioned Taiji\u2019s claims that dolphin hunting is an important part of the town\u2019s history.\u201cThis claim of \u2018Japanese tradition\u2019 is nonsense,\u201d said Ric O\u2019Barry, a former dolphin trainer who is now director of Earth Island\u2019s dolphin project. \u201cThe dolphin drive hunts, according to the town\u2019s own written history, says a couple of drive hunts occurred in 1936 and 1944, but the current series of hunts only began in 1969. O\u2019Barry said fishermen were killing dolphins for profit under the guise of cultural tradition. \u201cWhat is going on here?\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cThe dolphin hunts are being used by the captivity industry to supply wild dolphins to aquariums in Japan, China, Dubai, and other aquariums all around the world.\u201d Between September and early spring, Japan is permitted to catch up to 20,000 small cetaceans, including pilot whales and porpoises. The meat from a single bottlenose fetches around 50,000 yen, but aquariums and water parks are prepared to pay much more for live specimens.

Two supposedly very intelligent albino dolphins swim alongside it at all times. While the ship in the film is a magical place, its real-life counterpart is the SAS Walvisbaai, formerly the HMS Packington. A ton-class minesweeper that was built in Belfast in 1956, she was sold to the South African navy in 1959, hence the rebrand. Since 2006, she has reportedly been sunning herself in a Dubai marina, awaiting conversion into a yacht. (All right for some.)

Click here to watch the video The Orca is the woefully small fishing vessel that police chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), oceanographer Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw) take on their trip to hunt the huge great white shark that has been plaguing the paddlers and skinnydippers of Amity Island. Originally sold off by the studio to one of the special-effects technicians, it reportedly spent a few years sailing along the California coast as a swordfishing vessel. When the film achieved box-office success, it&apos;s said that the studio bought it back and moored it at Universal Studios. Rotten wood led to the boat&apos;s demise in 1996 \u2013 a somewhat suburban end given its shark-baiting halcyon days.

Photograph: Warner/Allstar    They may not be the grandest old dames of the cinematic waterways, but the canoes in John Boorman&apos;s 1972 thriller about four city types who take to the remote, fictional Cahulawassee river deserve their spot on the list. One of the canoes from this paddling film starring Jon Voight, Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and Ronny Cox had somehow made its way to Ohio and the bar area of the Clarion Inn, Fremont. But in September it was auctioned off for $3,000 to Kevin Meyer, owner of a bar and grill in Hooper, Nebraska.

Thankfully for his own sanity, the chief executive does seem to recognise that sniping towards the European Tour regularly arrives from those who would have no idea how to run it themselves. Take Sergio Garc\u00eda, for instance. When pressed again in recent days on his reasons for opting out of the European Tour&apos;s inaugural Final Series and, thereby, its Race to Dubai finale, the Spaniard offered a long-winded explanation which essentially translated as: &quot;I was too tired.&quot; All that was missing was a violin solo. Citing how heavy a schedule he had and how important it was to prepare for this season, Garc\u00eda was perfectly clear in his own mind about the motivation for missing out on four events between late October and mid-November which carried $30m in combined, guaranteed prize money. &quot;I needed to rest a little bit,&quot; Garc\u00eda insisted. This was lame stuff from a professional athlete, particularly when placed against Garc\u00eda&apos;s decision to head to Malaysia for the Thailand Open in mid-December. An event, incidentally, that offers high appearance fees. Garc\u00eda, and others, would not have turned their noses up at the Final Series earlier in their careers, rendering it rather poor for them to do so now. Given Garc\u00eda&apos;s desire to represent Europe at this year&apos;s Ryder Cup, he should afford those in charge of the tour a little more respect when they are seeking reciprocal support and putting on what are actually impressive events. The reality is that the European Tour has actually performed remarkably well in recent times. Its financial position is the best it has been for decades, even before the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. In the past, it is no exaggeration to claim that the arrival of that event bailed out the tour. O&apos;Grady and his colleagues have no control over economic circumstances in mainland Europe, which have decimated traditional tournament heartlands. Instead, it is to their credit that significant prize funds have been generated from fresh territory. Spain will undoubtedly re-emerge as a key stop on the European Tour rota at some point and a second tournament in England may now be very close to confirmation. The one that does already exist, the BMW PGA Championship at Wentworth, receives a needlessly lukewarm reception from some leading players. There is a recurring theme here, of cosseted golfers forgetting their roots and appearing to reach for excuses when moving further up their professional ladder. In the meantime, blue-chip events have been protected and others which are routinely criticised still hold decent earning appeal to professionals; including those from the United States choosing to carve out a career in Europe. If the figures attached to the European Tour&apos;s highest-profile sponsorship deals were made public \u2013 which won&apos;t happen due to commercial sensitivity \u2013 people would appreciate the work undertaken by O&apos;Grady and his colleagues. Instead, it has become unfortunately commonplace to point out everything that is supposedly wrong with the European Tour. It cannot compete financially with its equivalent in the United States and has made no claims to the contrary. The departure of top European players to the other side of the Atlantic is unfortunate but inevitable. Yet as a stand-alone business, the tour has emerged virtually unscathed through some grim fiscal times; it would be sad if that were to be lost in a now predictable, annual wave of negativity. McIlroy&apos;s loose talk  Rory McIlroy&apos;s weekend brush with golfing officialdom in Abu Dhabi raised several intriguing points. Among them was whether walking rules officials should be present with every European Tour match; a step that should be altogether unnecessary. A more valid argument is how Tiger Woods would have been treated, had he adopted McIlroy&apos;s attitude of &quot;[I have] better things to think about&quot; than the ins and outs of golf&apos;s rulebook. In his defence, McIlroy was consumed by anger and frustration at that point. He will almost certainly have regretted the loose comment. By close of play on Sunday, McIlroy said he was perfectly aware of the rule he broke with such costly repercussions a day earlier. That seems logical; the incident was one of simple carelessness from the Northern Irishman, who gained no advantage whatsoever from playing an approach shot to the 2nd hole with his left foot still on a spectator walkway. But ask yourself this: if a fellow player&apos;s caddie could spot and highlight the infraction, as was the case, what of McIlroy&apos;s own bag man? McIlroy has in the past been fiercely defensive of JP Fitzgerald, a part of his team who has been in position throughout the 24-year-old&apos;s surge to the top of world golf and subsequent struggles. In this instance, though, McIlroy was entitled to expect better care and attention from a trusted lieutenant. Easy does it for Woods The 25th anniversary edition of the Dubai Desert Classic next week will feature Tiger Woods appearing alongside famous names from the past such as Fred Couples, Mark O&apos;Meara and John Daly. First, though, Woods will tee up at Torrey Pines for the Farmers Insurance Open. Despite Phil Mickelson&apos;s appearance in that field, Woods is generally priced as short as 9-4 to prevail. The reasoning for that lies in history. Woods has won this event on seven occasions and has finished inside the top 10 a further five times. He triumphed in the 2008 US Open at Torrey Pines despite serious injury and, with a 62, holds the course record.

The jockey led all the way on his first success, the 8-1 shot Eco Warrior, who bravely fought off the hot favourite Wilhana in the home straight having come under severe pressure from the rider. Dettori then triumphed on the 7-4 favourite Gone With The Wind half an hour later for Newmarket trainer Jeremy Noseda. He returned after the victory on Ecom Warrior to tell waiting reporters &quot;I&apos;m knackered,&quot; before asking winning trainer John Hills: &quot;Could you not have given me an easier one [to ride] at my age?&quot; Dettori then added: &quot;He tested me big time as he was very lazy, but it&apos;s been a fairytale comeback. Thank you to my surgeon Mr Robinson for screwing me back together and to everyone for putting up with me for the last three months. It&apos;s nice to be out of the house and nice to do what I love, racing. &quot;I&apos;ve got no pain, it&apos;s just trying to get my strength back and there&apos;s nothing like race-riding. That was a big pipe-opener and I&apos;ll keep myself busy, it&apos;s the mental awareness of racing, that&apos;s what you have to sharpen up.&quot; Dettori had earlier emerged from the weighing room at 12.41pm to pose for photographs in the blue and white silks of his first mount. As reporters approached, however, he made his excuses. &quot;I&apos;m just going back in the warmth!&quot; When he did emerge from the weighing room for his first mount he quipped to his supporters: &quot;I had better keep my mouth closed now I&apos;m riding on the sand!&quot; The jockey will be making a quick getaway after his trio of rides on Wednesday afternoon and confirmed that he will be catching a flight to Dubai at 4.30pm. Dettori made his racecourse comeback in what is becoming an annual tradition that the sport&apos;s bigwigs should consider preserving. The Italian jockey certainly did better this time than in May, when he finished last on two rides out of three after the end of a six-months drugs ban. That comeback was on the glamorous Epsom stage, the day before the Derby, in front of packed stands. Perhaps fortunately for Dettori, British racing has little of glamour to offer in January, so he made his return from a broken ankle at Lingfield, where literally dozens of paying customers cheered him home. It was a bleak day in this leafy corner of Surrey, but considerably more welcoming than last Friday, when about half the course and all of the car park was under water. In what seemed a slightly optimistic gesture, Lingfield&apos;s staff had arranged all 31 of their park benches on the lawn in front of the winning post, so there was plenty of room for everyone to get a comfortable view. Dettori was lined up for three mounts, starting with the aforementioned Eco Warrior and Gone With The Wind but the jokcey was out of luck with his final ride Exemplary, who was seventh to Arch Villain in the 32Red Conditions Stakes, a fast-track qualifier for the big All-Weather Finals card on Good Friday. The bookmakers William Hill rate Dettori&apos;s chances of riding a Classic winner in Britain or Ireland in 2014 as no worse than 2-1. Hill&apos;s are also betting on how many winners Dettori will ride in Britain this year, with the odds suggesting he is likely to end up on 70 or so. That would be a major step up on 2013, when he had just 16 and went through long winless streaks as he struggled to forge productive links with new trainers in his first year since leaving Godolphin.", "title": "Jubilant Frankie Dettori triumphs on first two rides back at Lingfield", "sentences": ["&quot;I&apos;m just going back in the warmth!&quot; When he did emerge from the weighing room for his first mount he quipped to his supporters: &quot;I had better keep my mouth closed now I&apos;m riding on the sand!&quot; The jockey will be making a quick getaway after his trio of rides on Wednesday afternoon and confirmed that he will be catching a flight to Dubai at 4.30pm."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-22T12:03:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/22/frankie-dettori-double-comeback-lingfield", "tags": ["Frankie Dettori", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Anyone who saw Frankie Dettori as a spent force was put straight when the jockey won on his first two rides after three months spent nursing a broken ankle. His enduring charisma was insufficient to boost the crowd here much beyond the usual few hundred for this drab all-weather card but he certainly seemed to make a difference on the track, despite being manifestly short of peak fitness. &quot;I&apos;m knackered,&quot; he announced, laughing as he dismounted from Eco Warrior, the 8-1 shot that he cajoled to victory over an odds-on favourite in the first race. &quot;Everything burns, my lungs, arms, legs. You can push yourself \u2026 but it&apos;s nothing like [being] in a fight and you want to win. The adrenaline takes over but when I pulled up, I was paying the price.&quot; This was a significantly more positive comeback than the one Dettori made last summer after a six-month drugs ban, when he finished last on two of his first three rides. His problem then was forging productive links with trainers halfway through the season, at a time when most of them had established connections with other jockeys, and he never got over his late start, finishing the year on 16 winners in this country. &quot;At least I&apos;m starting at level terms with the others,&quot; he said. &quot;Last year, I had a very unfair disadvantage when I started almost at Royal Ascot. So this year, I&apos;m a completely different story.&quot; That was presumably news to Dettori&apos;s weighing room rivals, who appear to have forgotten his old reputation for being extremely dangerous when allowed to set the pace. Eco Warrior was gifted an easy lead for the first half of his race and, although Wilhana made a strong challenge, she could never get past and Dettori&apos;s mount had a neck to spare at the line after a protracted battle up the straight. &quot;When the favourite came alongside me, I thought: &apos;I hope he passes me quick, so I can give up,&apos;&quot; the winning jockey said, possibly not entirely in jest. &quot;But then he wasn&apos;t past me and I thought: &apos;Oh God, this is going to be one of those.&apos;&quot; He was not gasping for air in quite the same way an hour later when the more fancied Gone With The Wind gave him another success, albeit also by just a neck. &quot;It felt like I&apos;ve never been away,&quot; was his verdict this time. His final mount, unfancied, finished down the field, which at least had the upside that he was able to slow it to a walk immediately on crossing the line and head straight back to the weighing room as the other horses took their time to pull up. Having delivered a final verdict on the day (&quot;Fucking brilliant&quot;), he jogged to his car en route to a 4.30pm flight to Dubai, where he partners Mshawish on Thursday. Races in Saudi Arabia and Qatar are also in his plans for the next month but he will occasionally be seen on Britain&apos;s all-weather tracks as he works on his fitness. Sheikh Joaan, his main employer, has many horses based in France, where the start of the new season in early March appears to be the most significant date on the rider&apos;s horizon. &quot;I&apos;ve got some purpose to wake up in the morning,&quot; he said. &quot;I&apos;ve got a job, I&apos;ve got some good horses to ride. You wake up with a different way of thinking about life. Last year, I was like a dog chasing my own tail.

Last year, over three days, 67,341 spectators attended. This year, organisers think that record might be beaten. The home team&apos;s coach, however, has something rather bigger on his mind. \u201cEvery second of every minute of every hour of every day, there has to be a plan in place,\u201d says Matt Hawkins. \u201cEighteen months from now, we want to win Pan-American gold and we want to qualify for the Olympics. Everything is building towards that.\u201d To be fair to Hawkins \u2013 and it probably pays to be so, given that though entirely affable off the field the 30-year-old&apos;s nickname, bestowed for his blond hair and ferocious style of play,\u00a0is \u201cthe Polar Bear\u201d \u2013 he is of course aiming for success in Vegas this weekend. \u201cA\u00a0win\u2019s a win, right?\u201d he says. \u201cWe want a winning culture.\u201d His focus on the Olympics, however, would be echoed by most coaches around the world. In 2016, rugby will return to the Games. The USA men&apos;s team is a core member of the HSBC World Sevens Series, and thus always one of the 16 who contest tournaments around the globe. But only 12 can play for Olympic gold. Qualification for Rio can be secured in three ways \u2013 by finishing top-four in the 2014-15 World Series; by winning Pan-American Games gold in Toronto in August 2015; or by winning a repechage tournament, probably in Hong Kong in the spring of 2016. The Pan-American route, which as Argentina will qualify through South America will mostly involve working out a way to beat Canada \u2013 a concept so amenable to USA Rugby that last year\u00a0they tried to turn it into a meme \u2013 is the most likely. Hawkins, who\u00a0was appointed coach in August last year, after a long run in the team that he ended as captain, says:  It\u2019s something I think about daily. How can you not? It\u2019s the Olympic Games. It\u2019s the pinnacle.  To aid his attempt to reach that pinnacle \u2013 and once there to re-plant the American flag, given that the Olympic title still belongs to the Americans who won it in 1924 \u2013 Hawkins has secured an expansion of his team&apos;s presence at the Olympic Training Centre, near his San Diego home. In early January, alongside 18 women, a men&apos;s squad of 25 was announced. \u201cFirst and foremost,\u201d Hawkins says, down the phone from Chula Vista, \u201cfor a lot of national sevens programmes, their success is based around the depth of their squad. It\u2019s been tough to build the depth when we\u2019ve only had 14 or 15 names working full-time.\u00a0So our No1 priority is to have true depth. Hopefully at some point we\u2019ll have 30 guys who can fight for a place on that 12-man squad at each World Series event.\u201d Hawkins&apos; selection for Vegas illustrates his point. Key names such as Zack Test, a former University of Oregon wide receiver who was a tournament MVP last year, the prolific try-scorer Nick Edwards and the storied \u201cfastest man in rugby\u201d, Carlin Isles, are present. But few others, whether named to play at the Sam Boyd Stadium or for a Falcons select in the Las Vegas Invitational, could be considered \u201cnames\u201d anywhere outside their own households. \u201cWe want to show progress,\u201d says Hawkins. \u201cI\u2019ve been with the programme for eight years now and I can promise you, three years ago even though there were 22 guys coming into camp before we selected the squads to travel, there were a good few who at the end of the day really shouldn\u2019t have been there.\u201d         Highlights of the 2013 USA Sevens in Las Vegas.    So should the Eagles be there or thereabouts when the reckoning arrives in Vegas on Sunday? Will they? Based on their displays in 2013-14 so far, the answer has to be a resounding \u201cno\u201d. The US are 4-12 from tournaments in Australia, Dubai and South Africa. In the last two events they have won only once, against the less than mighty Spain, and Canada are five points ahead in the series table. Fortunately, in Vegas the Eagles have been drawn with Spain, Argentina and France. Progress to the cup competition \u2013 first-round losers also play on, for lesser prizes \u2013 should not be an impossibility.\u00a0 Hawkins says \u201cthe players are working extremely hard\u201d, and adds:  I guarantee that they are more frustrated than anyone in USA rugby about the way the results have gone so far. But it\u2019s up to them, and the coaches, to make sure that they go out there now and get the job done.  Nonetheless, he says critics of the team&apos;s displays this season \u201chave to look at the big picture\u201d. \u201cIf you look at the USA last year,\u201d Hawkins continues,\u00a0referring to eye-catching performances in Tokyo, Glasgow and London, \u201cwe really had a three-tournament high. We really needed to stay as a core team, we had a fight to stay alive, we knew we had to fight to finish above three other teams and avoid a relegation tournament. So for those three events we played with pressure and we built something really special. \u201cBut then that pressure was released and we went off to the World Cup and we didn\u2019t produce anything close to what we had produced in those three tournaments.\u201d The US slumped in Moscow,\u00a0the last global showpiece before the Olympics, and there has been precious little encouragement since.\u00a0Nonetheless, Hawkins insists:\u00a0  As a programme we are where we need to be.\u00a0Over the last five years we\u2019ve shown pieces of brilliance and we\u2019ve achieved things \u2013 we made a final [in Adelaide in 2010, losing to Samoa], we made a semi-final. So there are the bits and pieces there. But for us it\u2019s about understanding that we\u2019ve got a lot of young guys. The talent is getting better and it\u2019s getting younger, and we\u2019ve got more of an opportunity to get these guys in and work with them.  Among such talent now working at Chula Vista are five members of the military, supported by the World Class Athlete Program, and two players plucked from the college game. One of those,\u00a0Dartmouth&apos;s Madison Hughes\u00a0(the hard-charging\u00a0Danny Barrett, a recent University of California\u00a0graduate\u00a0who has made the squad for Vegas, is the other), is generating some serious buzz. \u201cHe\u2019s produced some great stuff at the college level and he\u2019s spent a little bit of time at the training centre over the past two years,\u201d says Hawkins of Hughes, who was educated at Wellington College, a power in English schools sevens. \u201cWe\u2019re working with him and working with Dartmouth \u2013 he\u2019s taken a semester off so he\u2019ll be with us for a couple of months. Hopefully he fights his way into the top 12. \u201cI think what people need to understand is that yes, he\u2019s a great college player and an exciting talent, but taking that next step is really tough. We have to manage that process as best we can.\u00a0We\u2019ve got a lot of youngsters like him, showing real promise. What they need is the opportunity to train and develop here at the centre, and to be given guidance about what the next level is.\u201d     Carlin Isles fends off a Kenyan defender. Photograph: Matt Roberts/Getty Images    One man who may continue to be given opportunities despite not being based at the OTC is the Seattle-based\u00a0Miles Craigwell, a former Brown linebacker who was briefly with the Miami Dolphins. He will play in the Invitational this weekend, monitored by Eagles coaches for possible involvement in New Zealand next month. Another gridiron-raised player,\u00a0the extraordinarily swift but still rugby raw Carlin Isles, is set to play in the main event, despite having generated headlines by signing a practice contract with the Detroit Lions. \u201cCarlin is with us, he\u2019s full-time,\u201d says Hawkins. \u201cHe went and did some stuff with the Lions and there is an opportunity for him to do something more with them maybe, to get involved in a rookie camp. We had a conversation when we all came back here and started training again. If he wants to go and become a football player, we will support him in that.  His going to the Lions may open doors for us and for rugby, who knows.\u00a0We\u2019re just not big enough to hold on to people like that if they want to go and look at such opportunities.  Nor, as it happens, have the Eagles been able to hold on to two other players who thrived on the world circuit last season. Luke Hulme had a trial with Gloucester and has now signed for Narbonne; the similarly quick\u00a0Blaine Scully is doing well with Leicester. Again, Hawkins puts his best foot forward. \u201cIt\u2019s a huge positive, it really is. For a long time now we\u2019ve been looking to get some of our guys out into European rugby, because they\u2019re playing a lot there and that\u2019s good for them.\u201d\u00a0 Such players may yet come back into the US rugby mix as the Olympics approach. It&apos;s a mix that, World Sevens stutters notwithstanding, is becoming rather interesting. The 15-a-side Eagles ended 2013 with a tremendous display in defeat by the Maori All Blacks and two victories in Europe, and next face a World Cup qualifier against Uruguay in March. Their highly promising young No8, Cam Dolan, has gone to England to play for Northampton. In November, USA Rugby\u00a0announced a deal with a private company, Serevi Rugby, to run talent-spotting camps across the country. The endeavour begins next month and Hawkins, who also works for Serevi, will be fully involved.     Matt Hawkins takes a youth training session. Photograph: Serevi    So much, one might say, for the future. The present, with sevens heavyweights like New Zealand, South Africa, Fiji and England in town, is demanding enough. But in recent seasons the Eagles have competed well with all those teams and more. The potential is undoubtedly there. \u201cDo we want to get wins in the World Series?\u201d Hawkins asks. \u201cAbsolutely.\u00a0A win\u2019s a win, right? We want a winning culture and the more wins the guys can get the more confidence they can get. It all flows. \u201cBut we\u00a0have\u00a0to understand that 18 months from now it will be really, really important. We have to build now, and then we can build this powerhouse and &apos;awaken the giant&apos; and all the things that people like to talk about when it comes to US rugby. We have to do the hard work now.\u201d That hard work starts at 6.12pm Vegas time on Friday (9.12pm ET),\u00a0when the Eagles face the Pumas of Argentina.\u00a0 The USA Sevens will be\u00a0broadcast live on NBC", "title": "USA rugby coach uses Las Vegas as launchpad for Olympic sevens challenge", "sentences": ["The US are 4-12 from tournaments in Australia, Dubai and South Africa."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-23T13:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/23/horse-racing-tips-24-january-2014", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Doncaster 1.10 Spanish Fleet 1.40 Dubai Prince 2.10 Victor Hewgo 2.45 Honest John 3.15 Atlantic Roller 3.50 Crescent Beach 4.20 Dakar Run  Huntingdon 12.50 Sweet Boy Vic 1.20 Hollow Blue Sky 1.50 New Year&apos;s Eve 2.20 Loose Chips 2.55 Seven Woods 3.25 Moonlight Maggie 4.00 Murtys Delight  Lingfield 1.00 Hellbender 1.30 Spreadable 2.00 Seek The Fair Land 2.30 Your Gifted 3.05 George Guru (nap) 3.40 Global Explorer 4.10 Anglo Irish  Wolverhampton 4.30 Final Delivery 5.00 Shawkantango 5.30 Caramack 6.00 Arabian Flight 6.30 Aureolin Gulf (nb) 7.00 Flash Crash 7.30 Nasijah ", "title": "Horse racing tips: Friday 24 January", "sentences": ["Doncaster 1.10 Spanish Fleet 1.40 Dubai Prince 2.10 Victor Hewgo 2.45 Honest John 3.15 Atlantic Roller 3.50 Crescent Beach 4.20 Dakar Run  Huntingdon 12.50 Sweet Boy Vic 1.20 Hollow Blue Sky 1.50 New Year&apos;s Eve 2.20 Loose Chips 2.55 Seven Woods 3.25 Moonlight Maggie 4.00 Murtys Delight  Lingfield 1.00 Hellbender 1.30 Spreadable 2.00 Seek The Fair Land 2.30 Your Gifted 3.05 George Guru (nap) 3.40 Global Explorer 4.10 Anglo Irish  Wolverhampton 4.30 Final Delivery 5.00 Shawkantango 5.30 Caramack 6.00 Arabian Flight 6.30 Aureolin Gulf (nb) 7.00 Flash Crash 7.30 Nasijah "], "publicationDate": "2014-01-23T16:04:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/24/thorbjorn-olesen-qatar-masters", "tags": ["European Tour", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "When Paul McGinley was appointed as Europe&apos;s Ryder Cup captain for this year at Gleneagles, Thorbjorn Olesen was among those tipped to force his way into the Irishman&apos;s plans. But things have not exactly gone to play for the young Dane since then. Olesen endured a largely difficult 2013, in which he finished a disappointing 32nd in the European Tour&apos;s Race to Dubai. Olesen&apos;s earlier flashes of brilliance, and on the big stage, rendered that as a curious outcome. He had even started last year impressively, with a tie for sixth at the Masters. A new year has thus far triggered an upturn in fortunes. Olesen survived for the weekend at the HSBC Golf Championship in Abu Dhabi and is now just a shot off the lead with 18 holes of the Qatar Masters to play. &quot;I haven&apos;t been up there in while, so it&apos;s nice to be there now,&quot; said the 24-year-old. &quot;I played really well last week and this week. I have holed a lot of putts, that makes it easier, and from tee to green, I have been good. &quot;In Abu Dhabi I played good all four days but didn&apos;t really get anything out of it. So it&apos;s really nice to be in this position now. I&apos;ve not been up in a long time but I have been up there a lot of times.&quot; Olesen also offered an explanation for that recent absence from the summit of leaderboards. His solitary European Tour win came at the 2012 Sicilian Open. &quot;I struggled a bit in the middle of last season and end of the year, last year,&quot; he added. &quot;I had a couple of injuries and I didn&apos;t really take a break. I just carried on playing. &quot;But I&apos;m feeling great, my body feels strong and I am working hard. The last couple of weeks we worked hard on the swing and changed quite a bit and it feels good, it feels very comfortable over the ball.&quot; Olesen is one of around 20 players who could still win in Doha.

I hit 16 greens in the second round, 17 today, so if I can play the same way tomorrow and hole a few putts, I can have a good day.&quot; A 64 from the Frenchman Adrien Saddier on Friday was outstanding considering the windy conditions.

A year ago, a closing round of 66 from Garc\u00eda was not enough to claim the Qatar Masters after Chris Wood&apos;s stunning eagle on the 72nd hole pipped the Spaniard to the trophy. This time around, Garc\u00eda made a 65 on the final day but still had to watch as Mikko Ilonen holed from 20ft to take the tournament to a sudden death play-off. After three holes, Garc\u00eda finally prevailed. &quot;It&apos;s great, I have been coming here for eight years now and have come close before,&quot; Garc\u00eda said. &quot;I have always said this is a golf course I enjoy. Everybody here does such a great job to make us feel at home and I am very happy to finally get my hands on the trophy. &quot;I started playing better and hitting the ball better as the week went on. Today was really, really nice to be able to shoot 65 when you know you need to do something like that.&quot; The victory will bounce Garc\u00eda back into the world&apos;s top 10. It will also, inevitably, trigger discussion as to whether this will be the year he can end his major drought. Few if any golfers with the natural ability of Garc\u00eda have reached 34 without even a single triumph in one of the game&apos;s big four events. In the short term, Garc\u00eda will take some time off before reappearing at the WGC Match Play Championship in Arizona while Ilonen heads for next week&apos;s Dubai Desert Classic. The Finn, a former British amateur champion, had\u00a0never featured in a professional play-off before. Nobody could argue against Garc\u00eda winning his first European Tour event since the 2011 Andalucia Masters, and his 11th overall, the hard way. After 54 holes, Garc\u00eda was three strokes from the top of the leaderboard. He had reached 16 under par and the lead with two regulation holes to play before saving par brilliantly from 10ft on the 17th. A birdie attempt one hole later slid agonisingly past. &quot;It&apos;s funny because I started the day thinking if I can shoot six or seven under maybe I can have a chance, and it turns out I had a very similar putt that I had last year to get it to 17 under on 18,&quot; Garc\u00eda explained. &quot;I hit a good putt and unfortunately it didn&apos;t break.&quot; Garc\u00eda&apos;s problem thereafter was that a batch of players with aspirations of catching him were still on the course. As Thorbjorn Olesen, Steve Webster and Rafael Cabrera-Bello fell by the wayside, Ilonen brilliantly holed out for birdie on the final green after a miscued bunker shot to force the play-off. Garc\u00eda was the first to be afforded an opening but narrowly missed his putt as the hole was halved in four. Ilonen had his own chance to win the title on the second sudden-death hole but failed to take it. Moments earlier, Garc\u00eda had almost holed out from a greenside bunker. The next time the duo played the 18th, Ilonen fatally leaked his drive to the right rough. With 243 yards to the pin, he bunkered his approach and failed to get up and down as Garc\u00eda made his third straightforward birdie four in a row. &quot;I almost feel less pressure because you feel like you&apos;ve had a great week already and if you win it&apos;s kind of like a little bit of a bonus,&quot; said Garc\u00eda of his play-off emotion. &quot;It had been an amazing week already and I was definitely more nervous on my tee shot on the 18th [in regulation] than in the play-off. That&apos;s probably why I hit three better tee\u00a0shots.&quot; Earlier , it was confirmed that a deal to extend the Qatar Masters until at least 2017 had been signed. With some of his ghosts now firmly laid to rest, it seems safe to assume that Garc\u00eda will be back.", "title": "Sergio Garc\u00eda savours redemption after winning Qatar Masters title", "sentences": ["In the short term, Garc\u00eda will take some time off before reappearing at the WGC Match Play Championship in Arizona while Ilonen heads for next week&apos;s Dubai Desert Classic."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-25T17:00:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jan/26/india-icc-proposal-ecb-cricket-australia", "tags": ["International Cricket Council", "India cricket team", "Australia cricket team", "England cricket team", "Australia sport", "ECB", "Sport politics", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "It is almost 70 years since George Orwell published Animal Farm and within it the pig Napoleon&apos;s maxim that &quot;all animals are equal but some animals are more equal than others&quot;. It is an ideal that might apply to the International Cricket Council, except that there is no pretence that all animals are equal in the first place. The controversial &quot;position paper&quot; of the ICC&apos;s financial and commercial affairs committee, due to be presented to the ICC board in Dubai over the next couple of days, makes it clear that future revenues from ICC events, principally from the next round of broadcasting rights and estimated to be around $2.75bn, should, to an almost exponential degree relative to the current agreement, go to India, in the main, the England &amp; Wales Cricket Board and Cricket Australia. The paper, one draft of which was leaked (and written in the knowledge that this would be the case), was devised by these three countries, although the West Indies president, Dave Cameron, is said to have been involved at a preliminary stage. Both the ICC chief executive, Dave Richardson, and the president, Alan Isaac, were also cognisant. The figures are complex but in essence, on an increase in revenue of around $1.25bn, the Board of Control for Cricket in India would be $500m better off, the ECB something over $100m wealthier and CA around $70m; an increase to these three from $85.5m under the current agreement to $770m for the 2015-2023 cycle \u2013 that of a total distribution cost increase of $800m. The surplus, meanwhile, shows an increase from $700m to $940m, to be distributed among ICC full members and its associates and affiliates on a 75:25 basis, with the new proviso that 12.5% goes to the top-six ranked associate members. Thus it is clear that India to a huge extent, but also the ECB and CA, becomes considerably more wealthy relative to other nations. Also enshrined in the position paper is a proposal to create an executive committee, consisting of representatives of the BCCI, ECB, CA and one other nominated person (although it is understood this could be two) that will supersede current decision-making bodies, but will at least mean that India could be outvoted on some issues. So on the back of the leaked document, the opprobrium that is being heaped upon what is being referred to as &quot;The Big Three&quot;, not least from a former ICC president, Ehsan Mani, has been not just predictable but massive. They envisage a fragmentation of world cricket rather than broad growth. It would be naive to believe that the process is not a device to keep India onside, a giant sweetener to prevent them from simply walking away from ICC events such as the World Cup, with the implication that with India would go a huge slice of the revenue from such events. There has already been that threat. The BCCI&apos;s stance tends to ignore the fact that the whole regeneration of its cricket, and the vast wealth it creates, was predicated first on India&apos;s 1983 World Cup win and, at a time when it would not give T20 cricket house room, their victory in the first World T20 in South Africa. In addition, there must surely be some residual value to an ICC global event even without India. However, it was not regarded as an idle threat: Indian cricket is capable of existing nicely on bilateral agreements, so maybe some attention should be paid to what might be termed the quid pro quo. Here there are two elements, one of which, the agreement by the BCCI to negotiate and adhere to a Future Tours Programme (FTP), was not contained in the leaked document at least, because of some sensitivity during the nine months or so that it has taken to draft the proposal. It is believed this programme will see India play each of the other top eight ranked countries, including, significantly, Pakistan, home and away (or in neutral territory), as well as Zimbabwe and Bangladesh away. Getting the BCCI to agree to this when it has been steadfast in its refusal to commit to an FTP represents a considerable diplomatic achievement. Tours by India, both Test and limited-overs, are crucial to the finances of other full members beyond the ECB and CA, as West Indies have admitted. The second element is the proposal to create two Test divisions, one consisting of the top eight ranked sides, and the other containing Zimbabwe, Bangladesh and the six top-ranked associates. Through the machinations of the Intercontinental Cup they will, over an eight-year period, be able to challenge the bottom-ranked top-division side in a home and away, two-match series for the chance to displace that team. The document does recognise that the reluctance of some boards to arrange bilateral Test series derives from the prohibitive cost of staging them, hence the creation of a Test Match Fund which will serve to underwrite the staging costs of a minimum three home Tests a year for those teams, aside from South Africa, in the top division. All other income derived from such series becomes profit for the home board. West Indies against New Zealand, say, becomes financially viable. However, in return, it is expected that each board will file transparent accounts to the ICC each year and will take on responsibility for aggressively promoting Test cricket in particular. It has long been felt that it has been in the nature of some boards simply to take the ICC handout and do little to develop the game. Bangladesh, for example, have played 81 Tests since getting full-member status, won only four of them (two each against Zimbabwe and West Indies) and made little or no progress on developing a strong domestic first-class programme. In the same 13-year period, Zimbabwe have played 54 Tests, winning eight, of which six have been against Bangladesh. The paper proposes not just greater accountability but personal responsibility for developing the game, particularly Test cricket. Countries such as Ireland and Afghanistan have achieved a considerable amount on a relative shoestring, it is argued. Complacency and inertia are no longer options. By no means are these ideal, or even palatable, proposals, but they might just be the best there is to be had at present.", "title": "India's large slice of the ICC cake may be hard to swallow | Mike Selvey", "sentences": ["The controversial &quot;position paper&quot; of the ICC&apos;s financial and commercial affairs committee, due to be presented to the ICC board in Dubai over the next couple of days, makes it clear that future revenues from ICC events, principally from the next round of broadcasting rights and estimated to be around $2.75bn, should, to an almost exponential degree relative to the current agreement, go to India, in the main, the England &amp; Wales Cricket Board and Cricket Australia."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-26T22:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/tvandradioblog/2014/jan/27/celebrity-big-brother-best-season", "tags": ["Big Brother", "Television", "Blue", "Music", "Television & radio", "Reality TV", "Culture"], "article": "This is an incredibly difficult thing to admit. It defies all form of reason or logic. It&apos;s genuinely making me question the sort of person I am. And yet, despite all this, I&apos;m going to miss Celebrity Big Brother when it ends this week. Celebrity Big Brother, for crying out loud. A zombie of a show, killed five years too late by its original broadcaster and resuscitated by a smaller channel that&apos;s really only interested in lorries and comically botched surgical procedures. Worse yet, this series has gone to dizzying extremes to round up some of the most objectively terrible professional attention-seekers that the world has to offer. By rights, I should have died of a stress-related aneurysm the second I saw Liz Jones talking to Jim Davidson on-screen. We all should. And yet, by leagues and leagues and leagues, this has been the best series of Celebrity Big Brother in the show&apos;s entire history. Better than the one where Vanessa Feltz went full Banksy on a kitchen table. Better than when Jack Dee escaped, got bored and came back. Better than the one with Shilpa Shetty. Better, even, than: &quot;Would you like me to be the cat?&quot; For a show this knackered to find a sense of purpose this strong is little short of a miracle. Much of this, of course, is down to the personalities of the housemates. With the possible exception of Ollie Locke, who is basically the world&apos;s most perpetually uncomprehending Easter Island statue tribute act, this year&apos;s crop appears to have been weaponised for full amusement. Obviously Dappy, Luisa Zissman and Jasmine Waltz \u2013 as people who exist solely to break up the monotony of blanket Kardashian in the Sidebar of Shame \u2013 were going to have some entertainment value. But, over the course of the past few weeks, everyone has had at least one moment of borderline transcendence. The show has also done its fair share of expectation-shattering, too. For example, I was expecting Liz Jones to be unwatchably shrill and deluded, but her moment in the bath on Day 17 \u2013 listing all her flaws in a deliberately melodramatic way, and openly wondering how she should kill herself, all just to spook Luisa \u2013 was perhaps the funniest of the series. And it has even shown that Jim Davidson has his good qualities. He&apos;s still the same Jim Davidson whom we exiled to Dubai for his uncomfortable views on everything that doesn&apos;t happen to be a straight white man, but he&apos;s shown flashes of empathy and, it must be said, he dresses quite well. And then there&apos;s last night&apos;s evictee Lee Ryan. Poor Lee. Whatever his reputation at the start of the show, Celebrity Big Brother has doomed him to for ever be seen as a haircut and an erection. His instantly doomed love triangle, dotted as it was with obscene behind-closed-doors slurping noises, was unquestionably boneheaded from the outset. Very much a &quot;love the one you&apos;re with&quot; kind of guy, Lee managed to ping between Jasmine and Casey Batchelor like a dog with several independently-controlled supplementary appendages. He still didn&apos;t fully seem to grasp the error of his ways in his exit interview, despite several explanations and a comprehensive video review. Wherever he is \u2013 which is probably in a room trying to hump a television or a sofa or a bin that he&apos;s drawn a vagina on \u2013 I wish him well. Everything about Celebrity Big Brother this year is a grand step up from before. The tasks have been nothing short of brilliant. In particular, the clock task \u2013 where the housemates were forced to sit completely still as someone crawled into the house and told them they loved them, licked their face, screamed about betrayal or evicted them \u2013 deserves to go down as one of the all-time greats. Even the presentation of the show, now that it&apos;s been wrestled away from the monotonous uncanny valley of the Brian Dowling era and placed in the exceptionally capable hands of Emma Willis, has taken a sudden upward turn. It really is an incredible turnaround. Celebrity Big Brother ends on Thursday. Choosing a winner seems redundant. This is partly because it&apos;s likely to be Jim Davidson, which is clearly a step too far, and partly because the runaway winner of Celebrity Big Brother 2014 is undoubtedly Celebrity Big Brother itself.", "title": "Have you been watching ...

The golfing year got off to an inauspicious start for Woods, who failed to reach the final round of the Farmers Insurance Open at the weekend. He had previously won eight times at the venue, Torrey Pines, but on this occasion slumped to six over after 54 holes. Those struggles, added to Woods&apos;s own admission that age has taken its toll on his swing, should in theory offer hope to other players. Yet McIlroy, who will meet Woods at this week&apos;s Dubai Desert Classic, insists going head to head with his idol is still his golfing pinnacle. &quot;Of course that excites me,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;I grew up dreaming of a scenario like that, taking on Tiger down the stretch of a major. Taking him on down the stretch at any tournament, in fact. &quot;It hasn&apos;t quite happened yet; we have sort of been in contention a few times without having a battle. You always want to put yourself against the best and Tiger has been the best in this game for the last 15-20 years. &quot;It&apos;s great to have him here [in Dubai]. He got off to a bit of a slow start to the season so he will be wanting to make up for that this week. I think he has still got a few good years left so I am looking forward to battling with him down the stretch a few times.&quot; There is no question that McIlroy is in a positive mood. Speaking as he opened a Nike Golf store in the Dubai Mall, he revealed that his new year engagement to the tennis player Caroline Wozniacki has already gone beyond the handing over of a ring. &quot;Obviously things have changed for the better off the course. Getting engaged to Caroline has been fantastic,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;We&apos;re planning the wedding and all that stuff already so that is something exciting to look forward to.&quot; McIlroy finished second in the HSBC Golf Championship in Abu Dhabi after suffering a two-stroke penalty for a rules infraction. The 24-year-old remained in Dubai to practise after that event and will do so again after the culmination of the 25th anniversary Desert Classic. To his credit, McIlroy preferred to focus on the need for short-game improvement rather than any brush with officialdom. The addition of a 52-degree wedge means he has four \u2013 the others with lofts of 47, 54 and 59 \u2013 in his bag. &quot;I have started off the year well,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;I was a little disappointed coming off the second place in Abu Dhabi. I felt like I should have won but there were a lot of positives to take from the week. I played very well. I felt like I could have done a few things better which I have worked on over the last week to go into this tournament in Dubai but all in all I am in a good place and really looking forward to 2014. &quot;Wedge play has been a big thing. I have added that extra wedge into my bag instead of a three-iron. I figured the distance I am hitting the ball just now, I am going to be hitting more wedges into greens than three-irons. To be able to give myself more variety from 150 yards in I have added that extra wedge. &quot;I just thought if I could have got my wedges a little closer in Abu Dhabi, it would have made a difference.&quot; There was even time for a McIlroy assessment of a disappointing season thus far for his beloved Manchester United. Improvement, he reckons, is imminent. &quot;Juan Mata I think is going to be a great signing and is going to give them a bit of a lift,&quot; he said. &quot;I think Wayne Rooney is going to sign for another four years, which will be great, and then hopefully they are going to get this French guy, [Yohan] Cabaye, in the summer.&quot;", "title": "Rory McIlroy dreams of going head to head with Tiger Woods at a major", "sentences": ["Yet McIlroy, who will meet Woods at this week&apos;s Dubai Desert Classic, insists going head to head with his idol is still his golfing pinnacle.", "&quot;It&apos;s great to have him here [in Dubai].", "Speaking as he opened a Nike Golf store in the Dubai Mall, he revealed that his new year engagement to the tennis player Caroline Wozniacki has already gone beyond the handing over of a ring.", "The 24-year-old remained in Dubai to practise after that event and will do so again after the culmination of the 25th anniversary Desert Classic.", "I felt like I could have done a few things better which I have worked on over the last week to go into this tournament in Dubai but all in all I am in a good place and really looking forward to 2014."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-27T17:39:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/28/india-aces-future-of-cricket", "tags": ["Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "&apos;ALL THE ACES&apos; Henry Orenstein holds over 100 patents. Among the various schemes and dreams concocted by this remarkable man are a beautician&apos;s chair, a doll whose hair grows longer when you pull on its arm, and the heat-sensitive stickers that told you whether the Transformer you were holding was an Autobot or a Decepticon. But the single most influential idea of the many that grew out of Orenstein&apos;s fertile mind came in 1981, when he was watching a poker game on ESPN. There were six hands in a row in which nobody called, so the viewers never got to see the who was holding what cards. &quot;The thought struck me,&quot; Orenstein said, &quot;that if we put a camera in there, and we were able to see the pro&apos;s cards, that would make the thing much more interesting.&quot; It took him four weeks to knock up a prototype. As the writer John Vorhaus told Grantland, &quot;With the invention of the hole cam, we have the omniscience as an audience that we never had before \u2026 Suddenly, we can look at poker as an exercise in storytelling.&quot; By 2008, 2.5m people were tuning in to watch ESPN&apos;s coverage of the World Series final. Poker, like chess, is as an oft-overused analogy. But it will serve again here, as we try to make sense of the International Cricket Council&apos;s discussions of the position paper on the restructuring of international cricket. This is a power game between the boards, with the three proponents lobbying, bullying, seducing, each of the seven remaining full members to try and extract the votes they need. It has already been suggested that the idea of promotion and relegation between two divisions of Test teams could be scrapped. That was given away so quickly it is worth asking whether anyone was committed to the concept at all, or if it was simply included to extract leverage. Another concession is that, as Mike Selvey reported on Monday, a fifth member could be added to the new Executive Committee. Poker is also an apt comparison because of the efficacy of this essential image, offered up to Osman Samiuddin by one anonymous board chairman: &quot;All the aces are in the BCCI&apos;s hands.&quot; As is most of the money. The paper states that India contribute 80% of the ICC revenue, and while the exact accuracy of that figure has been questioned by former ICC president Ehsan Mani, no one doubts that the BCCI have by far the largest share of the pot. The 10 full members of the ICC are playing a game in which one controls the cards and the cash. Sadly, the ICC hasn&apos;t had hole cams installed in its conference tables, its fear of transparency outweighing even its love of a quick buck. If we can&apos;t achieve the kind of omniscience that Orenstein introduced to poker, we can, at least, piece together the accurate information we do have from the boards&apos; own financial statements to get an idea about the kinds of cards everyone else is holding, the state of play, and the story unfolding in Dubai. Take the West Indies Cricket Board. During his election campaign, the new WICB president Dave Cameron explained that the organisation was expecting to make an $8m loss for 2012. But in 2011, its financial statements show that it made a profit of $14m. The biggest single reason for the swing is that in 2011 India came to the Caribbean and played one T20, three Tests and five ODIs. The tour brought in $22.3m for the WICB. Next, Sri Lanka. The cost of hosting the 2011 World Cup left the SLCB $69m in debt. As recently as January 2012, they were unable to pay the wages of their contracted players. In the end, they borrowed $3.9m from the Bank of Ceylon. They were able to do that, the SLC treasurer Nuski Mohammad explained, largely because &quot;we knew that the Indian cricket team was due in Sri Lanka&quot;. They came to play five matches and a T20 that summer. Cricket South Africa made a loss of $4.2m in 2012 and more than that in 2013. Despite that, the board&apos;s chief financial officer Naasei Appiah explained in October that he was confident that it &quot;had reserves on hand to see us through to the end of 2013-14&quot; because of the &quot;full end-of-year tour by India&quot; which was later cut short. &quot;Our best years,&quot; he said, &quot;include the ICC World Cup, every four years, and tours against India.&quot; The Pakistan Cricket Board is projecting losses of $5.2m this year. It lost $80m of its $135m broadcasting deal with Ten Sports, which expired last year, because the terms included a clause that stipulated Pakistan &quot;had to play at least two home series with India in a four year cycle&quot;. India never came. Pakistan are currently negotiating their TV deals on a series-by-series basis. New Zealand Cricket returned of a surplus in 2012-13, of $124,000. But the year before that it lost $1.5m. When the team beat West Indies in three days last December, the NZC chief executive David White said that he could swallow the revenues lost from the lack of play on the fourth and fifth days because &quot;our budget for the pre-Christmas Tests is not significant. Our big budget series is the Indian one.&quot; Zimbabwe&apos;s players have been on strike for the last month because they haven&apos;t been paid since the start of the season. This despite the fact India have been on tour to Zimbabwe three times in the last four years. Accurate information about the financial state of the Bangladesh Cricket Board is harder to come by. At least six of the seven players, then, have avowedly expressed their dependence on the BCCI. &quot;All the aces.&quot; The BCCI is clear that the one aspect of the proposal it views as non-negotiable is the redistribution of revenues, and has suggested that it will withdraw from future ICC events unless that, at least, is agreed to. It would still be able to play bilateral series, and, as the list above suggests, wouldn&apos;t be short of opponents. If the damage to the World Cup wouldn&apos;t be as severe as some fear, even the threat of India&apos;s withdrawal would hobble the ICC&apos;s upcoming negotiations of the next round of TV rights. At the same time, the seven boards know there is a real possibility, elucidated in Mani&apos;s paper on the leaked proposal, that the redistribution will leave them even worse off. Which leaves the England and Wales Cricket Board and Cricket Australia. There have been reports that the ECB chairman Giles Clarke has also threatened to &quot;part ways&quot; with the other members in ICC meetings. The two boards best equipped to oppose the BCCI are in league with them. This too must be understood as a two-way power play, with the ECB and CA seeking to grab the BCCI by the coat-tails, and, by holding on, haul themselves on while also pulling the Indian board back. Again, it is worth asking what other cards the ECB and CA have to play. They couldn&apos;t possibly pick up the slack in the finances of those six boards. And by the end of the current Ashes tour, England and Australia will have played each other 25 times in the space of seven months. They are due to play at least 13 more matches against each other in 2015. How much more milk can be squeezed from the cow? Clarke has tried standing up to the BCCI before. On that occasion, the ECB ended up being shut out of the Champions League, and signing up with Allen Stanford. It would take a brave man to call the bluff of an opponent with more money, better cards, and who beat him the last time the two played this game. By allying with the BCCI, the ECB and CA are trying to negotiate a commitment from the BCCI to both the World Cup and a form of Future Tours Programme, just as they themselves have said they will aim to play home and away series against all nine members at least once every eight years. By allying with the BCCI, the ECB and CA have also shafted CSA, who have been frozen out of these negotiations and also of the mooted Test Cricket Fund. This is the single shabbiest aspect of the whole affair. South Africa, the best Test team of this era, and the oldest after England and Australia, are being bullied. It&apos;s not just distasteful, but disgraceful. The associate members, too, must wonder what exactly is in this for them given how much they stand to lose and that the promise of the possibility of promotion may be withdrawn. This strategy has cost a lot, then, and, if it works, there is no guarantee that it will be anything other than a short-term fix which also creates long-term problems. Measured against the abandoned ideals of the Woolf report, it is a desperately poor solution. But then other people&apos;s ideals don&apos;t reckon much when the game is on and the BCCI is at the table with a sizeable pile of chips and a couple of aces in the hole. Four boards, the BCB, SLCB, CSA, and PCB are reported to have agreed to oppose the proposals, but it is conspicuous that they are only to be asking for a deferral on the issue, which would simply allow more time for horse trading. Anyone who is aghast that the individual boards all acting in their own interests may also be startled to discover that dogs bark and shocked to learn that bears crap in woods.

By the 3rd hole, so was the golf. Having already rescued unlikely pars on the first two holes of the Emirates Golf Club&apos;s championship course with scrambling that was brilliantly reminiscent of his father, Javier Ballesteros carved his drive 50 yards wide, into raw desert. Then the student, wearing Seve&apos;s logo on his shirt and golf bag, holed out from 10ft for birdie: like father, like son. As he strode from the 18th green later, the endearing smile remained; a two\u2011over\u2011par round of 74 was never going to diminish that. Not with a knowledge of history. For the 25th Dubai Desert Classic, the organisers came up with the innovative plan of a Tuesday Champions&apos; Challenge. Every past winner \u2013 they all appear on a photograph alongside their trophy at this fine club \u2013 was invited to play, with one notable exception. Almost three years have passed since the untimely death of Seve Ballesteros, the European golfing icon. Seve&apos;s memory will be celebrated with the appearance of his youngest son in the tournament proper, as well as at Tuesday&apos;s special event. Ballesteros Sr won the Dubai Desert Classic in 1992 after beating Ronan Rafferty in a play\u2011off; it was his 41st of 45 European Tour wins outside major championships. Seve had been two shots off the pace with just six holes to play but chipped in on the 13th and hit a four-iron to 4ft on the next to draw level. From there, only a confirmation of the latest Ballesteros triumph was realistically required. &quot;The competitive instinct is still there and I am proud of that,&quot; Seve said at the time. Despite his other failings, that quality had never really been in doubt. Rafferty sportingly remarked that Seve was &quot;still the best in the world&quot;. Javier&apos;s Champions&apos; Challenge draw was entirely appropriate. Miguel \u00c1ngel Jim\u00e9nez, a fellow Spaniard, joined him, as did Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal. The latter was Seve&apos;s regular Ryder Cup partner and brother in all but name. On the first tee, Olaz\u00e1bal&apos;s sentiment was clear as he hugged Javier warmly. &quot;It was really emotional, especially on that 1st tee,&quot; Olaz\u00e1bal later admitted. &quot;When I saw Javier, I saw Seve. He brought back a lot of memories. &quot;I could see a lot of Seve on the golf course. He has the same mannerisms as his father, particularly when he is standing over the ball. His short game is very nice. His chipping and putting are very good \u2013 like his father. &quot;I had never played with him before but I have known him since he was a little kid. When he first came here to Dubai, he was probably four or five years old. It is great that they invited him\u00a0here.&quot; The starter had asked the Dubai crowd to &quot;please give a very warm welcome to Javier Ballesteros&quot;. And they did, with the reception beating that afforded to Tiger Woods, Rory McIlroy et al. Thankfully, special moments still sometimes have a place despite the commercial and cut-throat nature of modern sport. The starter&apos;s request, albeit with the right intentions, was barely needed. Javier&apos;s mother, Carmen, and sister who bears the same name, were among the modest crowd following the Spanish\u00a0trio. Others, perhaps unfamiliar with this amateur golfer playing alongside two European Tour veterans, would not have taken long to deduce the identity of the bright-eyed Ballesteros, who was wearing simple Zara chinos and a pair of well-worn golf shoes. &quot;Being able to play here for my dad, I tried to play my best and make him proud,&quot; said Ballesteros in nearly perfect English. &quot;Playing with Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda and Miguel \u00c1ngel, who I have known many years, made things easier. &quot;I think what my dad did was fantastic, really incredible. I just try to be myself and play golf. I was a bit nervous on the first tee today but that&apos;s normal. I just try to be myself, always.&quot; Comparisons in golfing style were, nonetheless, inevitable and there were some particularly poignant moments. From the instant the 23-year-old horribly duck-hooked his drive on the first, there was intrigue around whether\u00a0he could summon the spirit to hole out for a four. It was to be a recurring theme. &quot;Do I play like my dad? Kind of, but not as [well] as him,&quot; said Ballesteros. &quot;I went everywhere with the driver today, like him, but not as good. &quot;I hit a really bad drive at the first, the ball was in the rough. It was nice to put it on the fairway and I had a good up and\u00a0down. &quot;On seven I hit a really bad drive, way to the right and then I hit a six-iron and then hit a good eight-iron to make a four. I thought I was going to take a seven, hit it into the water something like that, so it was good to make four. I hit five, maybe six of the 13 fairways so 74 was a good score.&quot; It remains to be seen whether or not Javier will follow in Seve&apos;s professional footsteps, with the odds currently against it. &quot;I try to play every day \u2013 sometimes two hours, sometimes six \u2013 not as much as I would like but it&apos;s fine,&quot; he explained. The day job is a law degree in Madrid and, despite scratch golfer status, the reality is that Javier could never match his father&apos;s on-course greatness. It must also be recognised how tough it will always be for the son or daughter of any sporting legend embarking on the same career. &quot;He really needs to improve [for him to make it in professional golf],&quot; Olaz\u00e1bal acknowledged. &quot;He was very erratic off the tee. He is concentrating on his studies in Madrid at the moment. He has another year and a half, two years at least there. We will see after that. He probably needs to put on a little bit of length but the part of the game he is good at is the short game.&quot; A truer test of Javier&apos;s ability will arrive in the heat of proper competition over the weekend. Then, there will be a little less attention and fewer glances towards emotive moments from the past. Yet regardless of the outcome, Javier is unquestionably happy to be here. Given his illustrious stock, too, the tournament has more appeal just because he is taking part. .", "title": "Javier Ballesteros steps in for his late father in Dubai \u2013 and it is uncanny", "sentences": ["For the 25th Dubai Desert Classic, the organisers came up with the innovative plan of a Tuesday Champions&apos; Challenge.", "Ballesteros Sr won the Dubai Desert Classic in 1992 after beating Ronan Rafferty in a play\u2011off; it was his 41st of 45 European Tour wins outside major championships.", "When he first came here to Dubai, he was probably four or five years old.", "It is great that they invited him\u00a0here.&quot; The starter had asked the Dubai crowd to &quot;please give a very warm welcome to Javier Ballesteros&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-28T16:59:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/jan/29/boris-johnsons-abuse-of-planning-power-is-an-assault-on-democracy", "tags": ["Architecture", "Design", "Art and design", "Boris Johnson", "London", "Planning policy", "Regeneration", "Housing", "Society", "London politics", "Social housing", "Heritage", "Culture", "UK news", "Cities", "Thomas Heatherwick", "Ken Livingstone"], "article": " Mount Pleasant, a gentle rise between Kings Cross and Farringdon in north London, has always been something of a misnomer. From the 16th to the 19th century, it was home to a stinking heap of rubbish and human excrement. The great dump was finally cleared in 1794 to make way for an imposing brick prison, the notorious Clerkenwell Gaol, where inmates were forced to grind treadmills and pick oakum amid overflowing sewers. It was cleared again in the 1880s for a gargantuan postal sorting office, the largest in the world at the time, which has stood as a majestic shed ever since.  The three-hectare site next to the sorting office is now subject to a planning application for 700 mostly private flats, to be erected in a series of hefty blocks rising up to 15 storeys, which will frame narrow canyons of \u201cpublic\u201d space in their shadow. Architects should usually be praised for being contextual, but it seems they might have taken the rubbish-dump-prison analogy too far.  \u201cIt&apos;s like a fortress,\u201d says Edward Denison of the Mount Pleasant Forum, the local residents&apos; association that has been battling this oversized scheme for the past few months. \u201cIt&apos;s an exclusive development that completely turns its back on the surrounding area, essentially sticking two fingers up at those that live around it. It&apos;s the profoundly cynical result of trying to cram as many units on to the site as possible.\u201d  The application, submitted by the recently privatised Royal Mail Group to Islington and Camden councils, whose boundary the site spans, has garnered an increasing amount of hostility, with designer and local resident Thomas Heatherwick now joining the calls to see it halted.   \u201cThis proposal is downright lazy \u2013 cheap, bland, generic and misconceived,\u201d he wrote to the council this month. \u201cThe developer is going to make a vast amount of money from this project, but what is being offered in return is empty, cynical and vacuous.\u201d         Animation prepared by the Mount Pleasant Forum, illustrating their concerns.    The saga took a surprise turn last week when London mayor Boris Johnson weighed into the wrangle and called the scheme in to be determined by his own planning team at the Greater London Authority, taking it out of the local councils&apos; hands \u2013 who were set to refuse the application next month. Royal Mail have since slashed their quota of \u201caffordable\u201d housing from 20% to around 12%, though both boroughs have a target of 50%. As a result, this prime plot \u2013 the last major housing site left in Islington \u2013 will probably offer less than 50 social rented homes, in a scheme that will likely fetch around \u00a34bn in private sales. \u201cIt&apos;s outrageous to drop the affordable housing quota as soon as they know it&apos;s going out of the local authorities&apos; hands,\u201d says Denison. \u201cBut they insist it&apos;s the only way to make it &apos;viable&apos;. If Royal Mail can&apos;t make a profit on three hectares of prime real estate in central London, when the land has essentially been given to them by the public for free, something is seriously wrong.\u201d Both councils have reacted with fury, declaring the mayor&apos;s move a circumvention of the planning process and accusing him of making a mockery of local democracy, especially given the scheme had only been submitted in June last year and was due to be determined in the next couple of months. \u201cLondon is growing at an unprecedented rate and it is absolutely vital that we get on with the important work of building thousands of new homes as quickly as we can,\u201d responded Johnson, his usual stock rhetoric ignoring precisely what kind of homes are being built in the rush to fulfil his targets. \u201cBy taking over this application it should be possible to speed up the decision-making process.\u201d It is an intriguing line of argument, given the last scheme he determined \u2013 the 41-storey wedge of Eileen House in Elephant and Castle, granted permission in December \u2013 took him more than two years to decide. While the Mount Pleasant case might be dismissed as the usual cast of nimbys set against the inevitable steamroller of market forces, it in fact reveals some disturbing truths about how the mayor&apos;s planning machine is actively working to make the city a more divided, exclusive place.   \u201cIt is hardly surprising that the mayor has called this in,\u201d says Duncan Bowie, lecturer in planning at the University of Westminster, who worked in the GLA&apos;s planning department under former mayor Ken Livingstone. \u201cThe mayoral planning process is based entirely on achieving the maximum number of housing units on any given site, aimed at selling to an international market. The London-wide target of building 42,000 new units per year is predicated on a lot of very high density developments that don&apos;t even comply with the mayor&apos;s own policies on density.\u201d     Unreasonable and unwarranted? \u2026 Proposals for Convoys Wharf in Deptford. Image: Hutchinson Whampoa    Such a development might be found in Convoys Wharf, a \u00a31bn proposal for 3,500 units in the form of three towers rising up to 40 storeys, planned for the historic site of Henry VIII&apos;s naval dockyard in Deptford. Johnson called in the scheme in October after the developer, Hutchinson Whampoa, wrote a blustering letter accusing the local authority, Lewisham, of making \u201cunreasonable and unwarranted\u201d demands and pushing the scheme&apos;s viability \u201cto its limits\u201d. The move has alarmed local activists, who rightly fear the vast quantity of development is in danger of destroying the area&apos;s character. But do such schemes even follow the mayor&apos;s own guidance? And does that guidance even matter? The GLA&apos;s Annual Monitoring Report, which measures the implementation of the London Plan \u2013 the master document that guides spatial development across the city \u2013 reveals that almost two-thirds of all development has breached the mayor&apos;s density guidelines. Johnson is setting the rules, only to break them with reckless abandon, rendering his plan utterly meaningless. But the real poison is in his approach to housing. \u201cIslington and Camden have acute housing need and desperately want lower rented housing on the Mount Pleasant site,\u201d says Bowie. \u201cThe question is: should the mayor be using his strategic planning powers to actively prevent councils from providing low-rented housing where there is urgent local need?\u201d Under Livingstone, there was an ambition \u2013 rarely achieved \u2013 for 50% affordable housing on new developments (the reality was more like 37%). The idea of a percentage has since been replaced by a numerical target, as has the definition of \u201caffordable\u201d, which now stands at 80% of market rent. Johnson also deleted the idea of social rented housing from the London Plan last year, preventing boroughs from supporting low-rented accommodation \u2013 an act for which they are now taking him to judicial review. \u201cThe mayor is driven by entirely the wrong sort of housing targets,\u201d says Michael Edwards, teaching fellow at UCL&apos;s Bartlett school of planning. \u201cThere is enormous pressure to get the maximum number of units and forget about the affordability. In Mount Pleasant, &apos;affordable&apos; would be totally out of reach of more than half the population \u2013 it makes no contribution to meeting the desperate housing need.\u201d   Obsessed with box-ticking and quota-filling, it is becoming increasingly evident that the mayor&apos;s planning team is a dangerous force. They have presided over a wealth of misconceived, mean-minded schemes that are destroying the social and physical fabric of London, lubricating the path for private enclaves of oversized, poorly designed mega-blocks, to be sold to overseas investors with little care for creating decent places to live.     Teetering towers \u2026 the Spirit of Stratford rises to 42 storeys on the edge of the Olympic site. Photograph: Martin Godwin    A look further east reveals quite what disastrous results the GLA&apos;s eager target-filling frenzy can have, where a gauntlet of teetering towers now stretches down Stratford High Street in a steroidal vision of Dubai-on-Lea. Each dressed in a cheap costume of colourful cladding panels, the towers blare the hollow klaxon of Olympic regeneration, but contain an exclusive world of mostly private one-bed flats behind their gaudy facades and gated podiums. The GLA planners&apos; reports from the time dutifully note that the schemes far exceed the recommended density for the area, but all this is pardoned for the buildings&apos; \u201cpalette of innovative modern materials\u201d and the \u201cactive street frontages\u201d \u2013 which have remained boarded up ever since. Similarly, the GLA&apos;s initial report on the Mount Pleasant scheme betrays a woeful misunderstanding of the site, ignoring such things as the two adjacent schools and praising part of the site that isn&apos;t even within the scheme. A source close to the mayor&apos;s planning team reveals that the officers rarely make site visits, instead judging the context from the submitted plans \u2013 sometimes aided by a quick look on Google Street View. \u201cBoris&apos;s habit of calling schemes in is setting a worrying precedent,\u201d says the source. \u201cDevelopers now think they can go straight to the mayor and bypass local planning entirely. The boroughs are scared to dig their heels in, as they know they can be overridden.\u201d As it stands, the system is not only a benefit for the mayor. By having schemes taken over by Johnson, local councillors can also happily avoid the stigma of being seen to support a scheme that local people are railing against, a particular concern at election time. \u201cThe current two-tier planning structure is basically configured to benefit everyone,\u201d adds the source, \u201cexcept the very residents of London that it should be there for.\u201d", "title": "Boris Johnson's abuse of planning power is an assault on democracy", "sentences": ["Photograph: Martin Godwin    A look further east reveals quite what disastrous results the GLA&apos;s eager target-filling frenzy can have, where a gauntlet of teetering towers now stretches down Stratford High Street in a steroidal vision of Dubai-on-Lea."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-29T11:36:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jan/29/playtime-james-franco-power-money-isaac-julien-capital", "tags": ["Video art", "Art", "Art and design", "James Franco", "Film", "Isaac Julien", "Culture", "Dubai", "World news", "Money", "Business"], "article": "The city rears up around us, lit windows against the night, the corporate buildings blocking the sky. In an all-white empty office, a hedge-fund manager plays a lonesome trumpet. A skittering drum kicks in, adding an urgent pulse. The pulse is money: capital at work. Ranks of computers and servers churn the numbers in a sub-basement world where the capital flows. In an auction room, prices are spiralling. Actor James Franco, playing an art adviser, explains how art has become a hedge against money&apos;s instability. The price of art has nothing to do with the art itself. In another scene, auctioneer Simon de Pury explains the exponential rise of the art market since the 2008 financial crash. Superstitious, he always eats an apple for good luck before working the auction room with his gavel and his wit. And after an auction, he&apos;s always depressed. In Dubai, an isolated Filipina woman, who came here to work as a maid, dusts a desk and stands in an empty desert, a world away from where she sends her money home. Trading-room floors, offices and galleries and auction rooms; the desert, Iceland&apos;s lava fields and steaming vents and an artist&apos;s abandoned fantasy home are the settings in Playtime, Isaac Julien&apos;s new seven-screen film installation. Playtime&apos;s title is borrowed from Jacques Tati&apos;s 1967 movie, and like Tati&apos;s film moves through a series of interconnected stories. While the original Playtime had Monsieur Hulot as its hapless protagonist, here capital is the star, the thread that runs through everything. You can&apos;t see it but you know it&apos;s there. Capital is the ultimate MacGuffin.           Is capital real? Are these people real? De Pury plays himself, but his eager interviewer is a reporter played by Chinese actress Maggie Cheung, who was also in Julien&apos;s 2010 Ten Thousand Waves, currently being shown in MoMA&apos;s atrium in New York. Julien&apos;s art, too, is implicated in the game of capital. It&apos;s the unseen director of all our lives. British actor Colin Salmon plays the musical hedge-fund manager, while the Filipina worker is Mercedes Cabral, a rising star in Philippine cinema. Cabral is magnificent, and utterly believable when she tells her story, except when she stands on a sand dune looking into emptiness. De Pury too is convincing, but he&apos;s playing himself. Being an auctioneer is already a kind of act and conviction is part of the deal. Art dealers and advisers are actors too. Someone&apos;s got to keep a straight face about the prices they charge. There is brilliance and disappointment in Playtime. A hybrid of fiction and documentary, the film makes it difficult to know what is real. I wander between the screens, lost in Julien&apos;s cinematic subterfuge, and that, I think, is the point. Unlike the montaged films of Adam Curtis, there&apos;s no narration, and the stories must tell themselves. The range of settings \u2013 sharp-edged offices in London and Dubai, a crumbling modern fantasy home between mountains and sea in Iceland \u2013 add to the sense of dislocation of the modern world. Playtime&apos;s visual pleasures sometimes overwhelm the material. Playtime is very long, and the longeurs feel even longer. There are great moments and moments when believability is lost. The Icelandic artist who wanders his former home, trudging up and down stairs like a figure in one of MC Escher&apos;s impossible optical and architectural conundrums and posing against the light, feels too stagey. Playtime, I think, wants to be too many things. But that is also the measure of Julien&apos;s ambition. &quot;I come from cinema; it&apos;s cinema I&apos;m quoting from and cinema I reappropriate,&quot; he says in a new book, Riot, which, like his film installations, is a kind of montage.     James Franco plays an art adviser in Playtime. Photograph: Courtesy the artist, Victoria Miro, London, and Metro Pictures, New York    A mix of essays and autobiography, filmography and friendships, the book charts his development over the past three decades, since he was a student at St Martin&apos;s School of Art in the early 80s, which is where we first met. &quot;As much as I work to disentangle myself from genre, cinema remains my home and my reference,&quot; he says, though it seems to me that his work is marked by its multiple entanglements in cinematic narrative and art installation, intellectual preoccupations and intuition, and the demands his subject matter make on the things he does. Although much of his early work was driven by a commitment to developing a queer, black, radical cinema, it has also been marked by a lush, poetic, visual and visceral sense of drama and political engagement. Playtime is like a big, baggy novel. It could do with being tighter, and I keep wanting to wrestle it into a more coherent shape. Downstairs at Victoria Miro, a pendant two-screen work, Kapital, provides a primer to Playtime. Its central focus is a conversation between the film-maker and the Marxist academic David Harvey before an invited audience at the Hayward&apos;s Wide Open School, held a couple of years ago. Harvey explains that capital is like gravity: you can&apos;t see it, but you know its there. A CEO at Goldman Sachs was once asked what it was he did, Harvey recalls. &quot;God&apos;s work,&quot; the CEO replied. Capital, says Harvey, is a social relation. And social relations are what Julien is trying to depict in Playtime, even when the relations he depicts are, on a human level, atomised and alienated by capital itself. Over at Victoria Miro&apos;s second gallery in Mayfair, a screen in the window projects Enigma, a short, looped film that can be watched from the street. In this time-lapse view of the city of Dubai, filmed over 24 hours, the city fizzes and flares with pulsing light and energy, the glow of capital seen from above. It is a God&apos;s-eye view of an enigma. Maybe the film-maker&apos;s job is to unravel it, though it seems an impossible task.

The hole, which typically measures 359 yards and dog-legs right, will be shortened to 325 yards. &quot;I think my caddie will leave me with the driver and run to the green because he is on 10%,&quot; said Stephen Gallacher, the defending champion. &quot;There is no way I will be laying up for that hole.

Those who survive for the closing 36 holes are seeking to win by far the biggest ace prize in the history of golf. To put the bounty into further context, it matches the prize fund on offer for the entire tournament.

If they move the tee up, it&apos;s a three-wood. So, yes, why not? I&apos;ll go for it. &quot;No matter what way the wind is, it shouldn&apos;t be a problem to get there. There are not many chances you have to win $2.5m with one shot, so I&apos;ll give it a go.&quot; Competitive albatrosses are exceptionally rare, which will be of solace to Golf in Dubai who have arranged insurance for the $2.5m, a means of marking the Desert Classic&apos;s 25th birthday. Before this weekend incentive comes into play, Tiger Woods will look to shrug off a poor performance at the Farmers Insurance Open, where he failed to make a 54-hole cut, by playing himself into contention at the Emirates Club. &quot;I practised Monday and I was better on Tuesday than I was on Monday,&quot; Woods said. &quot;Then I was better on Wednesday than I was on Tuesday. Hopefully on Thursday, that trend continues. &quot;I definitely feel fit, there&apos;s no doubt about that. My game was certainly nowhere near as sharp as I would have liked last week.

As the dust settled on the International Cricket Council&apos;s quarterly board meeting, after the first day of which delegates from four countries raised doubts over official claims that the proposals being championed by Clarke with support from Australia and India had been &quot;unanimously approved&quot;, it became increasingly clear that the bulk of the changes will almost certainly go through next month. Bangladesh, the most voluble of the four rebels on Tuesday, already appear to have fallen into line and the ICC president, Alan Isaac, again stressed after the meeting on Wednesday that &quot;agreement to the principles&quot; of the proposals was &quot;unanimous&quot;. There is still some uncertainty over how and even whether Test cricket will be opened up to associate members such as Ireland after opposition from some full members, including Bangladesh, to the introduction of a two-tier system with promotion to and relegation from an elite league of eight. But Clarke remains sufficiently hopeful to reveal that the ECB has already cleared a space for a possible Test against Ireland in a future tours programme (FTP) which will run for more than a decade and is ready to be announced within the next few weeks. &quot;If Ireland do qualify for Test cricket, England will guarantee that we play them,&quot; said the ECB chairman. &quot;We have already looked at that possibility when constructing our FTP.&quot; Ireland have a stated goal of securing Test status by 2020 irrespective of any new structure. The construction of a new FTP to run until 2023 was one of many issues that provoked confusion and some resentment when details of the new plans leaked out. England are ready to go well beyond that, with agreements thought to be in place for home series against India in 2026 and Australia the following year. But the release of a comprehensive programme of tours and series involving all nations for the eight years from 2015-23 could come as early as next month. Countries will be free to make bilateral arrangements between themselves, a flexibility that has already been welcomed by West Indies, whose board issued a statement predicting an increase of &quot;at least 100%&quot; in revenue compared with the last eight-year cycle from 2006-14. The decision to retain the lucrative Champions Trophy, which was to have been scrapped to make way for a new World Test Championship, will represent a further financial boost to struggling nations. Meanwhile Ian Bell will join Kevin Pietersen and Eoin Morgan in the Indian Premier League auction next month, another potential complication in the middle order as the England team director, Andy Flower, considers his response to the winter&apos;s Ashes disaster. Pietersen and Morgan have been IPL regulars but this is the first time that Bell has entered the auction, meaning that all three could be away until mid-May when England-contracted players are required home before five one-day internationals and two Tests against Sri Lanka. That would stymie any attempt by Flower to require them to play more county cricket this spring. Craig Kieswetter has also put himself up for the auction, which begins on 12 February, which could leave Somerset without a recognised wicketkeeper for at least the first month of the season after Jos Buttler&apos;s move to Lancashire.", "title": "England and Ireland could soon be playing Tests against each other", "sentences": ["Giles Clarke, chairman of the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB), hopes that a historic first Test between England and Ireland could be one of the many consequences of the radical changes to international cricket that have effectively been ratified in Dubai this week."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-29T21:52:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/lostinshowbiz/2014/jan/30/richard-desmond-jim-davidson-celebrity-big-brother", "tags": ["Celebrity", "Big Brother", "Culture", "Comedy", "Television & radio", "Life and style", "Jim Davidson"], "article": "Gold: Jim Davidson. Silver: Dappy. Bronze: that mahogany-effect cabinet out of Made in Chelsea. Have you ever seen a\u00a0winner&apos;s podium so historically inspiring? Yes, some might say \u2013 Mexico City, 1968, when the momentous civil rights salute given by US sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos was quietly yet\u00a0determinedly supported by the Australian silver medallist Peter Norman. But few records are unbreakable, and I\u00a0think we all saw something rather special happen at Elstree Studios on Wednesday night. Which is to say, those who actually saw it did. To the illustrious finale of this year&apos;s Celebrity Big Brother, then, in which Channel 5 helped a grateful nation to come to terms with the injustices it had visited on Jim Davidson. When the\u00a0television history books come to be\u00a0written \u2013 probably by Professor Dappington Contostavlos of the University of Sheffield \u2013 it will be clear\u00a0that Britain discarded Davidson with shameful haste, permitting the not-very-funny funnyman just two-and-a-half decades of primetime television before wondering whether it\u00a0might not be someone else&apos;s turn. One man may well be credited with his rescue \u2013 and that man, of course, is Channel 5 boss Richard Desmond. Yes, it is increasingly apparent that Richard saw his own humiliating exposure at the Leveson inquiry as a sort of personal Profumo scandal \u2013 in that, rather in the manner of that disgraced politician, he realised he must now devote himself to public service to atone for all the horrors and lies his newspaper titles visited so obsessively on the parents of Madeleine McCann and so on. His first quiet triumph in this redemptive quest has been the rehabilitation of the aforementioned fallen comic, and the air now buzzes with rumour that Davidson will be given his own Channel 5 chatshow. More on that tantalising possibility shortly. Alas, such is the way of the modern world that the air also buzzes with conspiracies as to how Jim&apos;s CBB win happened, despite the fact that, within the strict confines of the show, he was the most obvious victor. Davidson was edited suspiciously flatteringly, claim these conspiracists, who refer pointedly to a blogpost he wrote back in November last year. &quot;Contrary to reports I have not been approached to enter the Big Brother house,&quot; this ran. &quot;Not saying that I wouldn&apos;t go in, just saying I haven&apos;t been asked. My friend Richard Desmond owns Channel 5 and what he says goes, he is too scary to argue with. I&apos;ve tried that and lost. The phone line wasn&apos;t good but I think he called me a currant!&quot; It goes without saying that any Davidson chatshow would be more watchable \u2013 for whatever reason \u2013 than almost every monotonously smug panel show now littering the schedules. Alas,\u00a0with Desmond angling to sell Channel 5, you have to think it would be a one-series wonder, with its\u00a0demise broken to Davidson in a\u00a0meeting resembling that between Alan Partridge and incoming BBC controller Tony Hayers. &quot;You are someone who has a proven track record for making mostly bad television programmes \u2026&quot; But while Desmond is still having his bananas salvered to him in the Channel 5 boss&apos;s office, perhaps he could continue his revivalist mission by bringing back Play for Today, with the curtain raiser in the new series being an adapted-for-TV version of Davidson&apos;s own recent theatrical work, Stand Up and Be Counted. Remember this one? It was about a bigoted, out-of-favour comedian who has his prejudices challenged by the next generation and comes to realise his jokes have consequences. When it\u00a0was pulled after poor ticket sales, Davidson said he was &quot;already in talks with several West End producers and theatre owners&quot; \u2013 so perhaps those epic discussions might finally draw to a positive conclusion now he is flavour of the month. Before the play folded, though, this apparently Damascene conversion garnered Jim plenty of comparatively favourable attention. &quot;In the play, my character is made to realise that he can&apos;t just carry on as he was,&quot; Davidson told this newspaper, &quot;but\u00a0the\u00a0question is whether he is genuinely remorseful or just faking it to be famous.&quot; Indeed that IS the question, given that the latter possibility would contrive to be even more cynical than the straight-up bigotry of yesteryear. As for the answer to the inquiry, you must be the judge. On the one hand, Davidson was the Star Trek fan who cried when he discovered that Patrick Stewart was a Labour voter. On the other, he is far from an entirely stupid man, certainly not by the standards of most Big Brother contestants, compared with whom many amoeba take on the intellectual sheen of Mary Warnock. Either way, he has certainly learned what plays better with the audiences who now matter, and which parts of what he is thinking should actually be voiced. For instance, these days, when discussing the matter of his self-imposed exile to Dubai, New Jim emphasises his\u00a0eventual return with appealing wryness, claiming it was precipitated by Lord Ashcroft asking him: &quot;Don&apos;t you have to be rich to be a tax exile?&quot; Or as Old Jim put it just when he nicked off there just a few years previously: &quot;I may as well go to Dubai and be an ethnic minority there, than wait five years and be one here.&quot; You don&apos;t hear an awful lot about New Jim&apos;s talent for domestic violence either, though Old Jim was at pains to emphasise this comic turn. &quot;On the first occasion,&quot; he recalled in his autobiography of one of his marriages, &quot;I poked her in the eye by accident. I\u00a0actually went for the mouth. Thank heaven I missed, I&apos;d have fallen in. I\u00a0just took a playful punch. Unfortunately I caught her completely wrong. The second time I gave her a shiner. I\u00a0threw a bunch of keys which whacked her in the eye. Just for a giggle she kept blackening it up to make it look worse.&quot; Perhaps he could book Gloria Steinem for the chatshow \u2013 or indeed, Patrick Stewart, who is a patron of Refuge. After all, as New Jim put it on\u00a0victorious emergence from the Celebrity Big Brother house: &quot;Truth will conquer all.&quot; And if that sounds like the trailer line for an amusingly miscast superhero movie, then so be it.

Certify was one of the favourites for last year&apos;s fillies&apos; Classic at Newmarket after a 2012 juvenile campaign which included victory in the Group One Fillies&apos; Mile. She was one of 11 horses at Godolphin&apos;s Moulton Paddocks stable to test positive for a banned anabolic steroid when a testing team from the British Horseracing Authority took samples from 45 horses at the yard in early April 2013. Mahmood al-Zarooni, Certify&apos;s trainer at the time, was subsequently banned from racing for eight years for doping, while all horses at the yard which returned positive tests for anabolic steroids were banned from racing for six months. Certify missed her entire Classic season as a result, but had clearly retained her Group One class despite a 489-day absence when she returned to the racecourse. Certify was the 2-1 second-favourite for the one-mile Cape Verdi, in a market headed by Flotilla, last year&apos;s French 1,000 Guineas winner, at 6-4. Micka\u00ebl Barzalona was nearer last than first on Certify for the first six furlongs, but she made swift and very stylish progress around the home turn and then swept into the lead with her jockey all but motionless. She finished three-quarters of a length ahead of L&apos;Amour De Ma Vie but was value for much more, while Flotilla, who could not respond as Certify cruised past her in the straight, faded to finish fourth. Charlie Appleby, Zarooni&apos;s former assistant, is now in charge at Moulton Paddocks. On her latest form, he could well move Certify back up to Group One company before the Dubai Carnival concludes at the end of March. Sajjhaa, last year&apos;s winner of the Cape Verdi, went on to take the Group Two Balanchine in mid-February and then won the Dubai Duty Free, one of the world&apos;s richest turf events, on the Dubai World Cup card. &quot;The filly was training nicely but we&apos;ve asked no serious questions,&quot; Appleby said. &quot;She looks great in herself and she can only but improve from this. I&apos;m just delighted for Sheikh Mohammed and Godolphin giving this filly a chance to show what she was as a two-year-old. We had high hopes for her as a three-year-old and hopefully she&apos;s got a lovely career ahead of her as a four-year-old. &quot;The plan was always to go to the Balanchine and if she comes out of this race well that&apos;s what we&apos;ll do. After that it will be for Sheikh Mohammed and Simon Crisford [Godolphin&apos;s racing manager] to decide which route we go, whether she runs on World Cup night or put her away and take her back to Europe.&quot; Mujaarib, a 25-1 outsider trained by Mike De Kock and ridden by Christophe Soumillon, was successful in the Al Rashidiya, the second Group Two contest on the Meydan card. Dynaste, who was last of five finishers when joint-favourite for the King George VI Chase on Boxing Day, will head to the Cheltenham Festival without a prep run, David Pipe, the grey&apos;s trainer, said on Thursday. &quot;He had his first canter back [this morning],&quot; Pipe said. &quot;He&apos;s had a lot of treatment from [equine physiotherapist] Mary Bromiley on his quarters. It&apos;s unlikely he&apos;ll run before Cheltenham and he&apos;s in both the Gold Cup and the Ryanair Chase. We&apos;ll make that decision nearer the time.&quot; Rock On Ruby, the 2012 Champion Hurdle winner, could also go straight to the Festival if the ground remains unsuitably soft, Harry Fry, the gelding&apos;s trainer, said on Thursday. &quot;If we don&apos;t run [before the Arkle Trophy Novice Chase] so be it,&quot; Fry said in his blog on stanjames.com. &quot;We&apos;re not going to run him for the sake of it in testing conditions. There probably is a chance now we could go straight to the Festival with the way the weather is. We seem to get a couple of dry days and then the heavens open again so nowhere really gets a chance to dry out.&quot; The strength and depth of young jumping talent in the Willie Mullins stable was underlined on Thursday when entries were published for the novice hurdle events at the Cheltenham Festival in March. Mullins is responsible for 22 of the 102 possible runners in the Supreme Novice Hurdle, the opening contest of the meeting on 11 March.

So far 10 people have been killed and over 500 injured by grenade attacks and shootings since protests began in November calling for the ousting of the prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, in what rights groups say signals a &quot;spiralling&quot; toward violence. Three months of protests have seen demonstrators lay siege to government ministries, shut off power and water to officials&apos; private homes, threaten to take the prime minister hostage and &quot;shutdown&quot; parts of downtown Bangkok with rally stages and ad hoc campsites. Yingluck imposed a state of emergency last week and on Wednesday attempted to assuage voters&apos; fears to head to the polls to cast their votes. &quot;I ask everyone involved in the election, particularly security forces, to ensure that people can go out and vote,&quot; she told reporters. The labour minister Chalerm Yoobamrung, who oversees the emergency decree, warned that anyone attempting to obstruct the vote would be met with official resistance. &quot;Those who are thinking of going and shutting polling stations in the morning should think twice because the police will not allow them to,&quot; he said. Roughly 2 million people were unable to cast advance votes last Sunday after protesters blocked roads, locked up polling booths and, in some instances, attacked voters. With the opposition Democrat party boycotting Sunday&apos;s vote, anti-government demonstrators \u2013 under the umbrella People&apos;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) \u2013 have vowed to stop voters once again from heading to the polls. &quot;Thailand is spiralling into political violence as opposition and pro-government groups respond tit for tat against attacks and provocations,&quot; warned Human Rights Watch&apos;s Asia director Brad Adams. &quot;Preventing people from casting ballots shows serious contempt for basic rights of voters and democratic principles.&quot; Given the peculiarity of the situation, Sunday&apos;s election \u2013 estimated to cost 3.8bn baht, or \u00a370m \u2013 could be rendered invalid, said election commissioner Somchai Srisuthiyakorn, as the constitution requires polls to be held nationwide within a single day, local media reported. Up to 10,000 polling booths across Thailand are expected to be closed on Sunday, so byelections would need to take place in coming months to establish a parliamentary quorum. Some 28 constituencies in the south, where the Democrat party has a stronghold, have no candidates for Sunday&apos;s election after protesters prevented registration from taking place last month. Protesters are calling for the immediate ousting of Yingluck \u2013 who they see as a proxy of her brother Thaksin, the former premier who was himself ousted in a military coup in 2006 and now lives in Dubai to avoid jail on corruption charges \u2013 and are calling for her government to be replaced with an unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; instead. They point to a failed billion-dollar rice subsidy scheme, alleged corruption and an amnesty bill that would have allowed Thaksin to return without having to serve his corruption charge as reasons why they want &quot;reform before election&quot;. Yingluck&apos;s ruling Puea Thai party, or versions of it, have won every election for the past 10 years and are expected to win Sunday&apos;s poll too, putting the Democrat party in a losing position that critics claim is the reason they prefer to boycott Sunday&apos;s election. In a nation that has seen 18 coups or attempted coups since 1932, many observers believe that unrest on Sunday could once again prompt either the military or the judiciary to step in to prevent violence. Thai courts have in the past forced pro-Thaksin governments from power, and this week a criminal court rejected the government&apos;s proposed arrest warrant for PDRC leader and former deputy premier Suthep Thaugsuban \u2013 who is facing insurrection and murder charges for his role in the 2010 anti-government protests that saw 100 people killed and 2,000 injured \u2013 citing insufficient evidence. Suthep himself has also faced corruption charges, a confounding twist for a leader attempting to &quot;rid&quot; Thailand of the very same thing. &quot;It is so ironic that people like him [Suthep] can become leader of an anti-corruption group,&quot; agrees Somkiat Tangkitvanich of the thinktank Thailand Development Research Institute. &quot;But people have gathered to support the PDRC because they would like to express their dissatisfaction with the current government \u2013 so they&apos;re not for someone, but they&apos;re against someone.&quot; Late on Friday in Bangkok, high-profile supporters of the PDRC, including former yellowshirt leader Sondhi Limthongkul, took to rally stages to ask voters if there really was any value in a core staple of democracy. &quot;What good is your right [to vote] if they [this government] don&apos;t respect your rights anyway?&quot; Sondhi asked the crowd, prompting a loud show of whistle-blowing, clapping and cheering.", "title": "Thailand prepares for polls amid warning of 'spiralling toward violence'", "sentences": ["Protesters are calling for the immediate ousting of Yingluck \u2013 who they see as a proxy of her brother Thaksin, the former premier who was himself ousted in a military coup in 2006 and now lives in Dubai to avoid jail on corruption charges \u2013 and are calling for her government to be replaced with an unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot; instead."], "publicationDate": "2014-01-31T15:58:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jan/31/rory-mcilroy-leads-dubai-desert-classic-stomach-bug", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Golf", "Tiger Woods", "Sport"], "article": "It is to Rory McIlroy&apos;s credit that he did not point to the most extenuating circumstance for a failure to repeat his first-day heroics at the Dubai Desert\u00a0Classic.

He was lucky to escape further trouble two holes later, thanks to a fortunate bounce from another loose tee shot. Having steadied things round the turn, the Northern Irishman watched a par putt from no more than 3ft on the 13th horseshoe round and fail to drop into the hole. &quot;I regrouped after that,&quot; McIlroy added. &quot;I hit a couple of loose drives out there, which I haven&apos;t really done over the past couple of weeks.

Then, he was three in front starting the final round and swiftly lost that advantage before recovering to win by the same margin. &quot;I&apos;ll tell you tomorrow. I don&apos;t know what advantage, if any, I have,&quot; Gallacher said. &quot;The good thing is I have got good memories and good thoughts of what&apos;s happened the year before. That can lift your game. There are putts you&apos;ve holed and drives you&apos;ve hit and chips you&apos;ve holed before.&quot; Only three other players in European Tour history have played either course half in nine under. &quot;I probably went from 4/10 on the front nine to 10/10 on the back,&quot; Gallacher said. Gallacher has yet to play in the Masters, as is within reach for him now, and must also have at least a fighting chance of becoming a home player when the Ryder Cup takes place at Gleneagles this year. The 39-year-old&apos;s specialist touch here at the Emirates Club is endorsed by his joint-second place finish in the Desert Classic of 2012. McIlroy struggled in spells but still signed for a third consecutive under par round, this time of 69. The 24-year-old had been troubled by an upset stomach, reckoned to be brought on by something he ate during the second round. &quot;I&apos;m better,&quot; McIlroy said. &quot;Still not 100% but better than I was yesterday. I had a couple of stomach cramps out there but nothing too bad at all. I had a good dinner last night and was eating around the course today, so, no, everything&apos;s good. It&apos;s definitely not holding me back.&quot; One element of his appetite that McIlroy would certainly never lose is in relation to chasing a first tournament victory of 2014. &quot;I feel like I can catch Stephen up,&quot; he said. &quot;I don&apos;t really want to focus on what he&apos;s doing. I try to focus on my own thing. &quot;It doesn&apos;t change the strategy much. You have just got to go out there and try to shoot a good score, whether you&apos;re two behind or two ahead. If you&apos;re two ahead, you want to just go out and keep your foot on the gas and just keep going; and if you&apos;re two behind, you&apos;ve got to do the same thing. You&apos;ve got to make birdies and you&apos;ve got to get off to a fast start and that&apos;s what I&apos;ll try and do.&quot; Brooks Koepka and Thorbjorn Olesen are in a tie for third, four adrift of Gallacher, while Tiger Woods was well adrift after shooting 70 to occupy a share of 37th place.", "title": "Stephen Gallacher shoots brilliant nine under par to lead Desert Classic", "sentences": ["The Thursday afternoon notion that Rory McIlroy would enjoy a procession to a second Dubai Desert Classic win has already been shot to pieces."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-01T16:18:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/01/bangkok-bombs-protests-grow-eve-poll", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news", "Protest", "Thaksin Shinawatra"], "article": "Gunfire and explosions rocked Bangkok following clashes between pro-government &quot;red shirts&quot; and protesters, leading to fears of further violence as Thais head to the polls. Witnesses near the ballot distribution centre in Lak Si, in the north of the capital, described a chaotic scene in which explosions and sporadic gunfire lasting an hour echoed through the air, forcing people to seek shelter in a nearby shopping centre. The BBC reported that as many as six people, including one journalist, may have been injured in the clashes, although it was unclear whether the injured were pro- or anti-government demonstrators. The violence took place in a suburban stronghold of the ruling Puea Thai party, after anti-government demonstrators blocking the delivery of ballot boxes to the Lak Si district office clashed with hundreds of government supporters wielding batons and metal bars. Various photographs and video footage of the clashes showed unidentified gunmen in flak jackets firing rifles and handguns and bystanders and journalists huddled together in an army checkpoint. The Thai Election Commission has since decided to suspend voting in the area in order to avoid further violence, local media reported. The clashes are the latest round of violence in three months of anti-government protests that have seen at least 10 people killed and more than 570 injured, with demonstrators calling for the ousting of the prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, whose government they claim is corrupt and should be replaced by an unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot;. Yingluck&apos;s Puea Thai party is largely expected to win the snap polls, a major blow to the main opposition Democrat party, which supports the anti-government protests and is boycotting the election. Protesters have vowed to stop voters from heading to the booths and obstructed a number of ballot boxes from being delivered both in Bangkok and 12 provinces in the south, the election commission said. Protesters last week prevented some 2 million people across Thailand from casting advance votes last Sunday by chaining shut polling stations, blockading roads, and, in some circumstances, forcibly removing voters from the polling areas. Although some 130,000 police and 10,000 soldiers have been deployed across Thailand for election, tension and unease have begun to permeate the capital, where most of the recent violence \u2013 from drive-by shootings to grenade attacks \u2013 has taken place. In Thailand&apos;s often colour-coded world of political rivalry, pro-government &quot;red shirts&quot; generally clash with anti-government &quot;yellow shirts&quot;. But protest leaders encouraged their followers to wear red in celebration of the Chinese new year, and some present at the clashes \u2013 including unidentified men firing guns \u2013 could be seen wearing green armbands, the same colour as those issued by the Thai Journalists Association, potentially putting members of the media in danger through association. Led by the former MP Suthep Thaugsuban, protesters have set up ad hoc camping sites at rally stages across the capital, taken over government ministries and even threatened to take Yingluck hostage in their bid to rid Thailand of the &quot;Thaksin regime&quot;, a reference to Yingluck&apos;s billionaire brother and former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and now lives in Dubai to avoid corruption charges that he claims were politically motivated. Saturday&apos;s The violence is yet another chapter in an ongoing, years-long battle between those who support Thaksin, a former telecoms tycoon who won voting support from northern and northeastern provinces for his populist policies such as universal healthcare and rice-subsidy schemes, and those who believe him to be nothing more than a corrupt businessman who sullied Thailand&apos;s politics. Critics point to Thaksin&apos;s populist agenda, including the rice-subsidy scheme that has cost Thailand roughly $1bn and left a number of farmers without payment, and an amnesty bill that would have allowed Thaksin to return to the country without being imprisoned, as proof of the &quot;dirty politics&quot; that his party engages in. Much of the continuing battle has been painted as a simple north versus south, rich versus poor, divide, in which the mainly urban Bangkok elite and southern states are competing for power against the mainly rural north and north-east voters who support Thaksin. But a growing dissatisfaction with the government&apos;s handling of various policies, including the rice-subsidy plan, has seen protesters include many groups, with demonstrations taking place even in red shirt strongholds in northern provinces, where farmers&apos; networks have blockaded roads and vowed to boycott the vote in order to voice their dissatisfaction with Yingluck&apos;s government. &quot;The government took our rice and never paid us,&quot; said Kittisak Rattanawaraha, who leads the Northern Farmers Network in Pichit, where pro-Thaksin forces have long set politics. &quot;We&apos;ve been airing our grievances for months, but the government hasn&apos;t paid serious attention to our plight \u2013 so we will not be voting on Sunday.&quot; Various other groups \u2013 including academics, businessmen and politicians \u2013 also claim their frustration with the government, claiming that they have been embarrassed by Thaksin&apos;s &quot;greed&quot; for money \u2013 and, by default, his sister&apos;s stance as a so-called puppet in her brother&apos;s party, whose slogan reads &quot;Thaksin thinks; Puea Thai does&quot;. &quot;I really hoped he could bring a new way of governing to Thailand, but he is a human buyer \u2013 he buys everyone,&quot; says Kaewsan Athibodhi, leader of the Thai Spring group and an outspoken Thaksin opponent who investigated the former prime minister for corruption as part of a committee. &quot;Our culture, our way of thinking right now in Thai culture, is not &apos;democracy&apos;. Our culture is patron and client, and authoritarian. We accept power and we need patrons, but we need to go under democracy. We have no choice. It is the best choice for us to live together, whether we have a clever or foolish leader.&quot; Critics of the protest leader Suthep Thaugsuban, a former deputy prime minister who came to power after Thaksin was ousted in the 2006 military coup and has faced corruption charges of his own, allege that those attempting to &quot;reform&quot; Thailand are just as dirty as Thaksin, and may be suffering from an inability to win popular support. The opposition Democrat party has not won an election in 20 years and protesters insist that reform must occur before elections take place, although how they intend to initiate those reforms is still unclear. In a nation that has seen 18 attempted or real coups since 1932, the threat of yet another one in the coming days or weeks \u2013 whether by the military or the judiciary, both of which have forced Thai governments from power in the past \u2013 seems ever present, with one study projecting a 10.9% likelihood of a coup occurring this year. So far Thaksin, the man the protesters love to hate, has remained silent on the violence currently racking his country. But his lawyer and spokesman, Noppadon Pattama, said that the former prime minister was &quot;worried about the future of Thailand&quot;. &quot;He is worried about the destruction of the democratic system in Thailand,&quot; Noppadon explained. &quot;People here do not play by the rules, that&apos;s the problem.&quot; As for the ill-conceived midnight amnesty bill that would have allowed Thaksin to be reunited with his billions and avoid imprisonment \u2013 which sparked the protests and has caused death and injury \u2013 Noppadon sits back and clasps his hands together. &quot;Looking back, it wasn&apos;t a good idea. It was an unfortunate move and it provided our opponents with lots of ammunition against us,&quot; he concedes, sighing. &quot;It was a miscalculation.&quot;", "title": "Bangkok rocked by gunfire and bombs as protests grow on eve of poll", "sentences": ["Led by the former MP Suthep Thaugsuban, protesters have set up ad hoc camping sites at rally stages across the capital, taken over government ministries and even threatened to take Yingluck hostage in their bid to rid Thailand of the &quot;Thaksin regime&quot;, a reference to Yingluck&apos;s billionaire brother and former prime minister, Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and now lives in Dubai to avoid corruption charges that he claims were politically motivated."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-01T17:58:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/02/thai-voters-prevented-casting-ballot-anti-government-protesters", "tags": ["Thailand", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Tens of thousands of Thais were unable to cast their ballots on Sunday after anti-government protesters blockaded roads and commandeered polling booths in what has become an increasingly tense political standoff. Although the prime minister, Yingluck Shinawatra, is highly likely to be re-elected \u2013 as her party, or versions of it, has won every election since 2001 \u2013 thousands of Thais have boycotted the vote in protest and thousands more have been prevented by protesters from casting their ballots. About 130,000 police officers were deployed in an effort to boost security during voting after pro- and anti-government demonstrators clashed in northern Bangkok on Saturday, when at least seven people were injured after a gun attack near a ballot-storage office. At least 10 people have been killed and almost 600 more injured since protests began in November. &quot;Today is an important day,&quot; said Yingluck as she cast her vote early on Sunday. &quot;I would like to invite Thai people to come out and vote to uphold democracy.&quot; Anti-government demonstrators vowed to continue their fight against the so-called &quot;Thaksin regime&quot; until Yingluck stepped down voluntarily or by force. Protesters claim Yingluck Shinawatra&apos;s government is controlled by her brother, Thaksin, who was ousted as prime minister in a military coup in 2006 and now lives in Dubai to avoid corruption charges he claims are politically motivated. They also argue that democracy means more than just casting a ballot and have called for reforms before elections. &quot;If we vote today we will lose our nation, because we will legitimise Yingluck&apos;s government,&quot; said Kruawan Noonchuen, 51, a rubber plantation owner from the southern province of Surat Thani. She had been camping along with several hundred others in a park near a protest rally. &quot;If Yingluck doesn&apos;t resign, I will stay here until she does. I will only vote if the Shinawatra government is no longer controlling the country,&quot; she said. Sunday&apos;s snap election was intended to bring some sense of calm to Thailand. Demonstrators want to see Yingluck replaced by an unelected &quot;people&apos;s council&quot;, which they claim would reform the nation&apos;s current &quot;dirty politics&quot; system. It is unclear how many of Thailand&apos;s 49 million eligible voters headed to the polls, which were boycotted by the opposition Democrat party. Supporters of the protest umbrella group People&apos;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC) did likewise or prevent pro-government voters from voting. About 6 million registered voters across Thailand were affected by the closed polling stations, according to the country&apos;s electoral commission. Almost 500 of Bangkok&apos;s 6,671 polling booths were closed and people in nine provinces in the south were also unable to cast their votes. Anti-government demonstrators blocked the delivery of ballot boxes, blockaded roads and stood &quot;guard&quot; at polling station in pro-government districts to prevent voting, although in the rest of the country, voting was largely peaceful and without problems. At Din Daeng polling station in north Bangkok, anti-government demonstrators set up barricades to prevent &quot;red shirts&quot; (government supporters) from casting their votes. Officials decided to close the polling booth after an altercation between the two sides and a gunshot was heard. A thin line of police stood guard at the office doors but were swept aside by voters who rushed through the building looking for the ballot boxes. &quot;This situation is ridiculous,&quot; shouted Lek Saksaphrapha, 52, as she complained to the handful of bewildered-looking police that she had the right to vote. &quot;Why didn&apos;t anyone figure out how to deal with this before the day of the election? The Election Commission should let us vote to see who will win and who will lose. The country cannot go on like this.&quot; Although roughly 89% of Thailand&apos;s polling booths saw no disruption, Sunday&apos;s vote will be unlikely to lead to any clear resolution to the political quagmire. Official results will not be ready until all districts have been able to vote, and some reruns have already been rescheduled for late February after last week&apos;s advanced voting in which roughly two million people were prevent from casting their ballot. Because anti-government demonstrators blocked candidate registration in 28 southern provinces, parliament will not have enough representatives to form a quorum what ever the final outcome of the poll. This means Yingluck \u2013 should she be reinstated \u2013 will only have provisional, caretaker capabilities until those areas able to hold a vote. It also makes it likely that the political instability will continue for months to come, because the constituencies needing to fill those seats support the Democrat party and current anti-government movement. &quot;The Democrats have been losing elections for the last 20 years \u2013 that&apos;s why they didn&apos;t want the election to happen,&quot; said Somkhit Aramphibunkit, 59, as she looked at her locked-up polling booth in north Bangkok. &quot;If they were to join in these polls, they would just lose again.&quot;", "title": "Thai voters prevented from casting ballot by anti-government protesters", "sentences": ["Protesters claim Yingluck Shinawatra&apos;s government is controlled by her brother, Thaksin, who was ousted as prime minister in a military coup in 2006 and now lives in Dubai to avoid corruption charges he claims are politically motivated."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-02T15:41:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/02/stephen-gallacher-dubai-desert-classic", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Tiger Woods", "Golf", "Sport", "Ryder Cup", "US sports"], "article": "For Stephen Gallacher, a place in history. For Rory McIlroy, an unlikely implosion which offers an antidote to the suggestion he is back to the peak of his golfing powers. In this, the 25th anniversary of the event, Gallacher became the first player to successfully defend the Dubai Desert Classic after a final round that illustrated the value of patience. As Gallacher strode to a one-shot victory, at 16 under par, McIlroy&apos;s two-stroke lead from the start of play in round four had vanished because of a 74. McIlroy struggled to hit fairways, was loose with approach play and failed to hole putts when it mattered most. As McIlroy acknowledged, it was &quot;one of those days&quot;. What a difference in his body language and emotion from Thursday, when he carded an imperious 63. &quot;I actually played OK on the front nine but two bogeys on the par fives on the way back were obviously not what I was looking for,&quot; he said. &quot;The rare times that I did get the ball close out there, I didn&apos;t make any putts. Anything that kind of could go wrong, did. Stevie&apos;s performance was great. The way he played down the stretch was very impressive.&quot; McIlroy will remain in Dubai to work on his game before the WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship. Gallacher is perfectly entitled to two weeks&apos; worth of celebrations during his time back home in Linlithgow, before he makes his own way to Arizona. The 39-year-old, who perhaps felt at home in the rain which hit the Emirates Club, dropped two shots in his first two holes. He reached the turn in 39. The Scot&apos;s problem was simple: he kept hitting tee shots to the left. &quot;It was the plague of the front nine, again,&quot; Gallacher said. &quot;I was quite fortunate that nobody was running away with it.&quot; And after that? &quot;It took everything I have, to be honest.&quot; Yet the early toils of Gallacher and McIlroy had offered hope to others. Brooks Koepka held a one-shot lead at one stage, and missed a 6ft putt to double that on the 10th, while Romain Wattel and Emiliano Grillo were later to post clubhouse totals of 14 and 15 under par. Gallacher recovered to play the back nine in four under par and holed a putt for a one-shot lead at the last, with typical composure. Gallacher&apos;s success will catapult him into a career-high position in the world&apos;s top 40. He is all but certain of a Masters debut in April and can now legitimately dream of a home Ryder Cup appearance at Gleneagles in September. &quot;I have had the opportunity to play at Augusta but I said that I would never go unless I got into the tournament,&quot; Gallacher said. &quot;So I am delighted that I can go now. I&apos;m not going to get too far ahead of myself but my uncle [Bernard Gallacher] played in eight Ryder Cups, captained Europe three times and vice-captained twice. So it&apos;s pretty much all I grew up watching. &quot;It&apos;s 37 miles from my house. In my generation, it&apos;s never going to be in Scotland again so it has always been a long-term goal of mine to play in the Ryder Cup. It just so happens that during the best spell I am having, it&apos;s in Scotland, but there are seven months to go. There&apos;s a lot of golf to be played and a lot of good golf needed to get in it.&quot; As the drama at the summit of the leaderboard was unfolding, Tiger Woods had already departed the scene. The world No1 carded a final-round 71 for an aggregate of six under and thereby the also-ran status which will never sit well with Woods. Nor, perhaps, will a tweet from his Sunday playing partner Pablo Larraz\u00e1bal. Although clearly intending a compliment, the Spaniard offered a potential professional slight with the comment: &quot;I had a nice day out there. I really enjoyed playing with Tiger Woods.

If confirmed, the clandestine contacts could explain his hardening stance towards Washington in recent weeks, which has further soured an already difficult relationship. The outreach to the Taliban began last November, just as Washington believed a deal for a long-term US military presence in Afghanistan was about to be signed. After a national gathering convened to discuss the bilateral agreement endorsed it, Karzai surprised allies and much of his own cabinet by rolling out a new list of conditions. The strategic deal is still unsigned, and billions of dollars in military and civilian aid linked to it are also in limbo. Since then, relations between Kabul and Washington have deteriorated further with the revelation that Karzai suspects the US is behind many insurgent-style attacks, including a recent suicide assault on a restaurant in the Afghan capital that killed prominent members of the international community and two US citizens. He has also ordered the release of dozens of prisoners considered by the US to be dangerous Taliban fighters. His office insists they are innocent men locked up by the US under false pretences. Afghanistan will vote for a new president in April. But the two-stage system and delays getting ballot boxes from across the country could mean that Karzai will remain in post for several months after. The contacts with the Taliban do not appear to have yielded any concrete results, the New York Times reported, with neither actual talks nor firm plans for any on the table. A presidential spokesman confirmed the talks, which he described as among the most serious of the last decade. &quot;These parties were encouraged by the president&apos;s stance on the bilateral security agreement and his speeches afterwards,&quot; Aimal Faizi told the paper. &quot;The last two months have been very positive.&quot; He was not available for comment on Tuesday. There were meetings with influential leaders in Dubai and Riyadh, the report said, but contacts had &quot;fizzled out&quot; and the group had no plans of negotiating with the Afghan government, if they ever did. The Taliban have long said getting rid of foreign troops is one of their main objectives, and if their links with Karzai contributed to slow progress on the long-term partnership deal with the US, it could potentially be part of a military strategy. Although the Taliban maintained unofficial contacts with some senior Afghans over the decade since they were toppled, efforts to broker peace talks to end the conflict through negotiations have been tortuous and so far yielded little more than set-backs and dead ends.", "title": "Hamid Karzai 'has been talking to Taliban for months'", "sentences": ["There were meetings with influential leaders in Dubai and Riyadh, the report said, but contacts had &quot;fizzled out&quot; and the group had no plans of negotiating with the Afghan government, if they ever did."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-04T12:13:35Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/04/marwan-koukash-salford-rfl-sky", "tags": ["Rugby league", "Sport", "Salford Red Devils"], "article": "Dr Marwan Koukash, the Palestinian refugee turned successful racehorse owner who rescued Salford this time last year, has followed Wigan&apos;s chairman Ian\u00a0Lenagan by slamming Super League&apos;s new long-term television deal with Sky in a scattergun attack on the game&apos;s governing body. Speaking at Salford&apos;s pre-season launch at Media City, Koukash urged the collection of internationals he has allowed the former Great Britain coach Brian Noble to assemble to look across the Manchester Ship Canal, to Old Trafford, and target a first Grand Final appearance there in October. &quot;I know you believe we can do it, and we&apos;re going to bloody do it,&quot; he said, notwithstanding Salford&apos;s finishing position at the bottom of the table in 2013. But that was almost an afterthought, well over halfway through an entertaining monologue in which Koukash offered a collection of sponsors, supporters and media his thoughts on recent Super League developments. Of the new Sky deal, which is worth around \u00a3200m and runs until 2021, he said: &quot;I voted against it, because I didn&apos;t think it is the right one. You don&apos;t marry the first girl you meet. You go out with them, you sleep with them, you try them, but don&apos;t commit to the long-term relationship until you&apos;re sure there&apos;s no one else better.&quot; Like Lenagan, Koukash was especially annoyed at the lack of notice he and the other Super League chairmen were given, having been summoned to a meeting last Thursday at 24 hours notice. &quot;I have nothing against Sky, I will always work with Sky and I respect what they&apos;ve done for the sport,&quot; he added. &quot;But hang on, there&apos;s other players around. Have we talked to them, or gone to a tendering process? No. Why commit for so long? &quot;All right, we&apos;ve got more money \u2013 bloody \u00a3300,000 per year. Will it let us increase the salary cap? No. I tell you what it will do \u2013 it will allow us to stabilise some of the clubs. But imagine a salary cap of \u00a31.8m in a few years time. It will drive our best talent to bloody [rugby] union or the NRL [Australia&apos;s National Rugby League]. That&apos;s what it&apos;s going to do.&quot; Koukash was similarly scathing over the new three-year sponsorship deal with First Utility that was announced last week. &quot;Supposedly wonderful news, but we will be lucky if we get \u00a330-40,000. We are securing better deals than that ourselves as a club. &quot;The World Cup was a huge success, which shows there are people out there willing to get involved in rugby league provided we have the right product on the field, and we market the game properly.&quot; He had already dismissed the reintroduction of promotion and relegation in a new system which involves two divisions of 12 splitting to three of eight midway through the season from 2015, and then turned his attention to the RFL&apos;s reappointment of Steve McNamara as the England coach. &quot;We finished third, on the face of it maybe a good result, and maybe not. For me, with all due respect to the other teams, we finished third in a three-horse race. We have world-class talent in the team, and we should be planning for the next World Cup now in order to win it, not just finish second or third. That&apos;s why it shocked me a little bit when I heard that they have opted for reappointing the coach. &quot;And what really pissed me off is I learned the coach [McNamara] is going to be an assistant coach in the NRL [with Sydney Roosters]. What message are we sending out? That the England coach is only good enough to be an assistant coach in the NRL.

It was the day before the 2012 Open Championship that the Swede withdrew from the event, tweeting that: &quot;Have got into some bad habits in my game and routine that I need to address.&quot; It was an unorthodox explanation. The blunt reality was that Karlsson&apos;s mind was so troubled that he couldn&apos;t even start a backswing. His thought process was so muddled that something which had come naturally since childhood suddenly wouldn&apos;t happen at all. What a pleasure, then, to see Karlsson back competing for four days and with a smile on his face during the Dubai Desert Classic. &quot;I just couldn&apos;t swing the club back. It was total brain-freeze,&quot; he explained of a problem which took three months to cure. &quot;I wondered if I would play golf again. It was so weird because I knew how to hit shots, it just wasn&apos;t happening. &quot;I wasn&apos;t taking the decision on shots behind the ball. So I was trying to make that decision over the ball. It was just small things which turned into \u00e2\u20ac\u02dcwhy am I standing here?&apos; Now I wonder how that could happen but when I was in it, it was horrible. &quot;I just had to break that routine, so much is connected to the routine. You create habit which become stronger and stronger, to break them you have to create new ones.&quot; Karlsson has won 11 times on the European Tour and is a past Ryder Cup competitor. He was the Order of Merit winner in 2008, has finished in the top 10 of all four majors and was once ranked number six in the world. He finished 2013 at an astonishing 276th in that list and has now climbed to number 218. His present aim is solely to edge back inside the top 200. Should Karlsson need inspiration, his fellow Swede Henrik Stenson would provide it. Stenson has suffered two career slumps but came roaring back, most notably last year when he was Europe&apos;s best golfer and the winner of the FedEx Cup playoff series in the United States. &quot;Not just Henrik, I look at all the players who have bounced back,&quot; Karlsson added. &quot;Paul Casey is another one. Everyone&apos;s career is the same, if you play for over 20 years you are going to have peaks and troughs. It is more about how quickly you can get yourself out of those troughs and how deep they are in the first place. &quot;I have very high standards so I am maybe at six, seven out of 10 just now. I have days when it is really good but everything isn&apos;t really good at the one time. I still get wound up a little bit, that&apos;s part of the reason we are out there. It shows we are hungry. &quot;The goal is just to keep building on my game and getting better again because I know what my good game is like.&quot; Too many others have forgotten. It would be a wonderful tale if Karlsson uses 2014 to provide them with a strong reminder. Makeover for Match Play? With confirmation imminent that the London Club will host the World Match Play Championship later this year, the strong suggestion that Tiger Woods will skip the WGC-Accenture equivalent later this month provides a further blow to the organisers of the Tucson event. Already, it has been confirmed that Phil Mickelson and Adam Scott will not take part in the first WGC tournament of the year. Woods has hinted before at a lighter schedule, amid concerns about fatigue in the latter part of the year. Yet his absence from Dove Mountain, where he exited at the first-round stage last year, will be keenly felt. High-profile championships such as this should attract the best golfers in the world. Instead, the course itself is unpopular with many leading players. The 2013 version was disrupted by snow. There must now be a strong chance, if there wasn&apos;t before, that the Match Play is moved to an alternative venue in the not-too distant future in order to re-establish its prominence. Apart from anything else, it is wrong that three from four of these supposedly &quot;world&quot; challenges are hosted by the United States. In a flap over rules It seems not a week can go by without some form of rules controversy in professional golf. During the second round of the Dubai Desert Classic, Thomas Bjorn got himself needlessly uptight about a drop taken by his playing partner Henrik Stenson; which was both perfectly legal and taken after full consultation with a referee. Poor Stenson was virtually the last to know of Bjorn&apos;s unrest, which didn&apos;t reflect well on the Dane. David Drysdale, meanwhile, immediately called a penalty on himself upon realising he had touched a spike mark when brushing away loose grass on a green. The two-shot sanction imposed on Drysdale had clear significance given the Scot missed the cut by a stroke. Dyrsdale, who has been plagued by back problems at the start of this year, is due some luck when he returns to competitive action in South Africa this week.", "title": "Robert Karlsson back with a smile after dealing with his golfing demons | Ewan Murray", "sentences": ["What a pleasure, then, to see Karlsson back competing for four days and with a smile on his face during the Dubai Desert Classic.", "During the second round of the Dubai Desert Classic, Thomas Bjorn got himself needlessly uptight about a drop taken by his playing partner Henrik Stenson; which was both perfectly legal and taken after full consultation with a referee."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-05T11:01:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/feb/07/uae-law-mothers-breastfeed-first-two-years", "tags": ["United Arab Emirates", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Breastfeeding", "Women", "Gender", "Equality", "Law", "Society"], "article": "The United Arab Emirates has passed a law requiring mothers to breastfeed their children until they are two years old.

Amid growing concern at bulk-buying abroad of new London housing as &quot;buy-to-leave&quot; assets, the shadow housing minister, Emma Reynolds, said it was wrong that people living in the UK were being denied the chance to buy a home because they were &quot;being sold exclusively to overseas buyers&quot;. More than half of the 127 apartments in one recently built block in east London were sold to overseas buyers, with investors from Singapore, Malaysia and Hong Kong buying one in three for a total of \u00a325m, according to Land Registry records obtained by the Guardian. Ten homes in Bezier, a 14-storey apartment block in Islington, have been registered as empty with the town hall and only a third of the flats have anyone listed on the electoral roll. The pattern is being repeated across the capital. About 500 of the 866 flats proposed in the first phase of the Battersea Power Station redevelopment were sold in the far east, and this week campaigners against regeneration plans for Earls Court accused developers of acting to &quot;socially engineer middle- and low-income families out of central London&quot; because they say just 10% of the homes on the site will be genuinely affordable. The property industry attacked Labour&apos;s proposal. The British Property Federation said it could &quot;spook inward investment&quot; by imposing too many unnecessary restrictions on foreign capital. &quot;In the midst of a housing crisis, less housing development won&apos;t help anyone,&quot; said Ian Fletcher, the federation&apos;s director of policy.     Buyer nationalities for Bezier.    Jon Thompson, operations director of Tudor Vale, the developer of Bezier, said it would cut off essential upfront investment that UK buyers were reluctant to provide. &quot;Many schemes would not get off the ground, which would greatly reduce the amount of both private and affordable housing and put further upward pressure on prices,&quot; he said. He also disputed Islington&apos;s figures, which were gathered by electoral roll officials, and said he was aware of only four unoccupied apartments in the block. &quot;The vast majority are homes people come home to each night,&quot; he said. Bezier opened in 2010 in Old Street, beside a technology hub known as Silicon Roundabout. Hong Kong buyers bought six flats worth a combined \u00a33.4m, Malaysian owners bought 10 properties for \u00a35.7m and Singapore investors splashed out more than \u00a315m on 21 apartments. Other foreign owners are based in Dubai, Thailand, Australia, Italy and Brazil, as well as the British Virgin Islands tax haven. James Murray, Islington&apos;s executive member in charge of housing, said the situation was galling for people who were trying to continue living in London, and that it was wrong that flats were sold abroad and kept empty in a borough where 3,000 people are living in overcrowded conditions. Tim Griggs, 47, a private equity executive, who is among the 29% of Bezier owners who who gave their flat as their only address on Land Registry forms, said: &quot;There are a lot of Russian and Chinese people and some students are here for term time.&quot; Asked whether he felt the block was fully occupied, he said: &quot;I get the sense I can make a lot more noise that I would otherwise be allowed to. It works for me that it is not that busy.&quot; Griggs said the international makeup of such blocks was key to London&apos;s economy, a view supported by research published this week by Ramidus, a property research consultancy. &quot;Despite concern about foreign ownership of UK property, our research suggests foreign investors contribute considerably to the UK economy,&quot; said Sandra Jones, a consultant at the firm. &quot;Those with homes worth more between \u00a35m and \u00a315m spend \u00a32m-\u00a33m a year in the UK.&quot;", "title": "Give local buyers first refusal on new homes, urges Labour", "sentences": ["Other foreign owners are based in Dubai, Thailand, Australia, Italy and Brazil, as well as the British Virgin Islands tax haven."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-07T15:28:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/feb/07/film-fans-lance-armstrong-cycling", "tags": ["Lance Armstrong", "Tour de France", "Cycling", "US sports", "Sport"], "article": "Sheryl Crow&apos;s face tightened as she was asked on breakfast television this week about her feelings when she heard Lance Armstrong, her former boyfriend, confessing his sins to Oprah Winfrey. &quot;I&apos;m eight years past that,&quot; the singer said through a frozen smile. &quot;That&apos;s very distinctly his story. It&apos;s nothing do with me.&quot; She had watched only part of the Winfrey programme. &quot;I&apos;ve got kids now,&quot; she declared. &quot;I don&apos;t watch too much TV.&quot; That&apos;s the way Armstrong can still affect people: you think the pain has gone but it&apos;s still lurking just below the surface, waiting to be prodded. With Crow, the memory is purely personal. For the rest of us it exists on quite a different level. Armstrong is like a nasty smell that clings to the curtains, the carpet and the upholstery covers and that nothing will shift. It&apos;s there whenever a story breaks about the latest development in the battle to relieve him of some of the $125m (\u00a376.5m) he is said to have made during the years when he was a Tour-winning, cancer-conquering superhero, or whenever there&apos;s a new film based on his story, such as Alex Gibney&apos;s The Armstrong Lie, released in the UK last week, or Stephen Frears&apos; forthcoming feature film, starring Ben Foster as the\u00a0Texan. But it&apos;s also there in every cycling story that makes reference to doping. It was the subtext beneath Marcel Kittel&apos;s remark on the eve of this week&apos;s Tour of Dubai that young riders need to be more\u00a0vocal about the fight to clear the sport&apos;s name. &quot;The most important thing for us is to show that we&apos;re different,&quot; the 25-year-old German sprinter told Gulf News. &quot;We need to show that we do not want to be compared to those riders who have cheated or are cheating.&quot; Kittel, who put an end to Mark Cavendish&apos;s run of success on the Champs-Elysees in last year&apos;s Tour de France, has called for those caught doping to face criminal charges and life bans. It was there more explicitly when Bradley Wiggins spoke at Team Sky&apos;s training camp in Mallorca this week of how he had to move his children to another school when other pupils, who had seen Armstrong&apos;s confession, started taunting and eventually bullying one of them. &quot;They were asking if his dad had taken drugs, too,&quot; the 2012 Tour winner said. Wiggins once had a friendly relationship with Armstrong and perhaps the bad smell will not be dispersed until the peloton no longer contains riders who rode with or against the American, and who were once accustomed to the way the law of omert\u00e0 prevented the epidemic of doping from becoming general knowledge until it was painstakingly uncovered by a handful of dauntless journalists and dogged investigators. Most of that generation of riders still find it difficult to front up on the subject. And with them, sooner or later, must go the doctors and team bosses who spun the web in which so many became trapped. If the future is straightforward, the past is necessarily less so. On Valentine&apos;s Day it will be exactly 10 years since Marco Pantani was found dead of a cocaine overdose in a hotel room in Rimini. The man known as Il Pirata had never recovered from failing a haematocrit test while leading the 1999 Giro d&apos;Italia, a year after the season in which he had won both the Giro and the Tour. Although Pantani never actually tested positive for EPO, there is little doubt that he took it on a regular basis. But tens of thousands visit his grave every year and it is a rare fan of road cycling who does not react to being reminded of his epic deeds on the great mountain stages with affection, admiration and even respect. What does that say about cycling fans? It says that they are prepared to accept that, as with Jacques Anquetil or Tom Simpson, Pantani raced according to the customs of his time. No one demurred when Anquetil famously said it was impossible to win the Tour on mineral water. Simpson was a fully paid-up member of the amphetamine generation and Pantani was part of the EPO era. But none of them behaved in the way that characterised Armstrong, who made it his business to intimidate those \u2013 whether a rider, a soigneuse or a reporter \u2013 standing in his way, doing his best to ruin their lives and crush their careers. While watching The Armstrong Lie in a London cinema this week, it was interesting to hear the audience laugh every time the subject was shown attacking his accusers in the years before he was finally exposed. They were responding to his sheer effrontery in batting away every accusation. I couldn&apos;t join that laughter. At those moments, or during the sequence from the 18th stage of the 2004 Tour where he rides up to Filippo Simeoni \u2013 a hitherto anonymous domestique who had given evidence in a doping hearing against Dr Michele Ferrari, Armstrong&apos;s physician and coach \u2013 and orders him back into peloton in a grotesque (and probably the last) display of the influence exerted by an old-fashioned patron of the race, my flesh crawled. In another unforgettable sequence, he sits in a hotel room one morning during the preparation for his comeback in 2009, watched by his small daughters as he screws the corks into the urine and blood sample flasks while complaining vigorously about the frequency of the dope testing imposed on a man who had won the race seven times (the two testers, the proximate victims of his diatribe, are the film&apos;s unsung heroes). It is small comfort to see how ridiculous that notorious photograph he defiantly tweeted round the world in November 2012, showing him lying on a couch in his living room surrounded by his seven framed yellow jerseys and captioned &quot;Back in Austin and just layin&apos; around&quot;, now makes him appear. Attitudes may have changed but the debate, as Kittel so intelligently emphasised, is far from over. The film had been about to start when a man in the row behind me asked his companion: &quot;What about the present lot? Do you think they&apos;re clean?&quot; A perfectly natural enquiry, to which no sane observer would respond with a blanket affirmative. Only time \u2013 and extreme diligence on the part of the UCI&apos;s new president, Brian Cookson, whose Cycling Independent Reform Commission plans to investigate the doping culture of the past decade and a half \u2013 can provide an answer.

Potential members have to be mega-rich to join, but Matthew believes it&apos;s vulgar to enquire about someone&apos;s wealth. &quot;We don&apos;t ask them what&apos;s in their bank account. We don&apos;t do credit checks,&quot; she says. &quot;But by asking intelligent questions we get an idea of their net worth.&quot; Once membership is granted, clients are interviewed so that the company knows what members might like before they even ask for it. &quot;We profile them when they join to find out how they travel, how many homes they have around the world and how they wish to use us as a service.&quot; She says the key selling point of the service is the links her team build with the maitre d&apos;s at top restaurants, theatre managers, ticket agents (both official and black market) and even the admissions officers at top private schools. &quot;We&apos;ve got incredible relationships with the key people that are there.

I had been imprisoned for nine months, all but two weeks without a conviction. The reason? UAE authorities accused me of threatening the country&apos;s national security by creating a sketch-comedy video parodying teenagers in Dubai and posting it on YouTube.  I grew up in Dubai, having moved there a few months before my second birthday in 1986. My parents were Sri Lankan expatriates, of that generation of foreigners from all over the world who helped build Dubai. Dubai was a wonderful place to grow up, especially during the 1980s and 1990s when communities were more organic and the pace of life was less frenetic. My friends, neighbors and classmates were of almost every nationality, and we formed a bond that is still going strong in a tightly-knit Dubaian diaspora. Dubai was the only home I knew, but with no chance of naturalization or permanent residence there, my family emigrated to the United States when I was 16. We were warmly welcomed, and we proudly became US citizens. I decided to move back to Dubai after I graduated from university in 2006. Its economy was booming, and I wanted to go back to the place I thought of as my hometown, to continue my parents&apos; work and make my own contribution to the city I had seen grow around me. For six years, I worked for Emirates Airline \u2013 the city&apos;s flagship company \u2013 and then for a consulting firm, doing my part to build up Dubai as an aviation hub and tourist destination. I didn&apos;t have the kind of salary or the perks that Westerners have been known to receive there, but I worked hard to pay my bills and was able to enjoy life amongst old friends in a city I love very much, just like people my age in places like New York or London. There&apos;s a depth and complexity to Dubai&apos;s international culture that has been overlooked in news stories about the city&apos;s growth over the last decade. In producing my comedy video in late 2012, I wanted to create something that celebrated the charming cultural peculiarities that make the city an enchanting place to live, and to show that Dubai is a much more interesting place than descriptions of it as a soulless artificial desert town might suggest. Dubai&apos;s diverse culture is worth exploring, and I wanted to show that Dubaians have the creativity and the sense of humor to create home-grown entertainment that touches upon their own lives as an alternative to the current norm of imported film and television.  &quot;Satwa Gs&quot; were a &apos;90s stereotype in Dubai; teenagers from the decidedly un-gangsta district of Satwa \u2013 then popular for the little stores and sidewalk dining along its main drag \u2013 who did their best to act like Tupac-era rappers from Los Angeles despite being utterly unthreatening. The video was on YouTube for several months, and I received overwhelmingly positive feedback from Dubaians who were reminded of their own childhoods and thought it was hilarious.  The video made no references to politics or religion, and it didn&apos;t disparage the country&apos;s rulers \u2013 all of which are frowned upon. I had lived in Dubai for most of my life, and I was well aware of the local laws and customs. As a result, my arrest and imprisonment came as a complete shock. I was eventually charged under a vague new Cyber Crimes Law, accused of endangering national security by presenting a fictional image of Dubai.  Just a year earlier, Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol, which depicted the city as a playground for rogue nuclear-arms dealers, had been filmed in Dubai with government encouragement. Syriana, also filmed in Dubai, made the Gulf states look like a politically corrupt breeding ground for Islamic terrorism. Even Fast and Furious 7, part of a film franchise that glorifies illegal street racing and criminal gangs, is being shot in Abu Dhabi despite road fatalities being a major issue in the UAE. The authorities supported and feted those movies even though they portray the country as a paradise for international criminals, but I was imprisoned, deported, and banned from returning to the UAE for a novice comedy-sketch production about &apos;90s teenagers.  Dubaians aren&apos;t robots. They&apos;re a dynamic, international, multicultural group with as much talent and creativity as the people of any major international city, and they want to express themselves just like everyone else, sharing stories of their own lives or simply entertaining each other. Discouraging them from doing so with a prison sentence is out of sync with the image of modernity that the UAE tries to project and risks scaring away tourists, expats and international business. On the other hand, affirming the human desire for self-expression and the breadth of stories that Dubaians have to tell about themselves and their culture would show the world that the UAE has sincerely embraced a progressive outlook. It would reassure those who doubt the authenticity of the country&apos;s modern image. Being open to such self-expression would allow the UAE to boost its international reputation and establish an atmosphere that would be far more inviting for the tourism and commerce it seeks to attract. The ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, stated in a recent BBC interview that my treatment was unsatisfactory and that the UAE would work to &quot;change&quot; any mistakes. His sentiment is appropriate, and I look forward to seeing reform.

Last week, one of the city&apos;s nightclub-goers took a monkey to a club and \u2013 from the looks of one photograph \u2013 tried to get it drunk on vodka. The small animal, wrapped around a man&apos;s sizeable waist, made it past front-of-house staff at the five-month-old Vanity club long enough to be snapped in several photos, before being swiftly ejected and barred \u2013 along with its chaperone and his other, human, guests. Shortly after, images of the monkey&apos;s night out appeared on Facebook, apparently sporting the logo of the club night&apos;s independent promoter. The resulting furore ran on Facebook and Twitter for days. Dubai residents posted hundreds of comments, the vast majority expressing sympathy for the animal. Some called for the monkey&apos;s owner to be deported, others for clubbers to boycott the venue in protest. (The club, meanwhile, swiftly distanced itself from the event, severing ties with the promoter, sacking the doormen and donating around \u00a32,500 to local animal charities.)     A tiger hangs out of a car window in Dubai.    But the big question is why this incident has come as such a\u00a0shock to Dubai&apos;s system. Monkeys are regularly seen around town. I am a former United Arab Emirates resident myself, and I once witnessed a shivering monkey, clothed in a baby&apos;s nappy, being held out of a car window before a\u00a0papping crowd. I was also once invited to see some tigers that were kept in the office HQ of\u00a0a large well-known company. I\u00a0declined, although a friend who was working with the business saw the captive big cats first-hand. The sightings and stories are endless. In 2012, a shot of a tiger peering out of a car caused a minor Twitter storm. A cheetah on a lead was seen in 2011, and another was found dead in Al Ain in 2012 after escaping from a cage in a private villa, while a baboon made a break for it the same year.     A crocodile is easy to obtain on the black market. Photograph: Alamy    So exactly how difficult is it to adopt an exotic pet in the UAE? A quick search leads to multiple sites offering marmoset monkeys and, among others, cheetah, tiger, leopard, cougar and jaguar cubs. An hour later, I&apos;ve been emailed details of a 10-week-old cheetah cub I can welcome into my family from Cameroon for $1,700 (\u00a31,042) \u2013 no questions regarding my prior cat-handling experience asked. Gulf News, one of the UAE&apos;s most-read newspapers, achieved a similar feat last year, showing that it was possible to acquire a black-market baby crocodile for less than \u00a3200 (the trader warned them to &quot;take care&quot; if it &quot;grew big&quot;). In February 2013, it became illegal to import such animals into the UAE, but captive breeding is not so tightly regulated. The offending clubber has unwittingly increased support for Dubai&apos;s fight against exotic pet ownership, and brought better regulation one step closer.

The controversial reforms to the ICC were ratified at the weekend in Singapore, conferring greater power on England, Australia and especially India as the three major wealth-generators of world cricket, with N Srinivasan, the chairman of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, to become the ICC chairman in July. Within hours India were left to rue their consistent opposition to DRS, as they were left without recourse to technology to overturn a poor decision, which was crucial as they went down to defeat by New Zealand in the first Test in Auckland. But their willingness to listen afresh to the arguments in favour of DRS, and to play a key role in working on it rather than railing against it, had already been established. The chief executives committee of the ICC had a lengthy session on DRS in Dubai two weeks ago, in which David Collier, the chief executive of the England and Wales Cricket Board, played a leading role and the former India leg-spinner Anil Kumble was also involved. That is likely to see the amended implementation of DRS that was trialled by Nigel Llong in the Old Trafford car park during last summer&apos;s Ashes series, whereby a television official will be given greater access to a wide range of replays, which will be introduced for the first time at a major tournament at the World Twenty20 in Bangladesh next month. But in the longer term there are hopes that India will take the lead in refining technology \u2013 Australia previously led in the development of Hot Spot and Real Time Snicko \u2013 in an effort to reduce the number of errors and controversies and to ensure more robust testing procedures. Another significant development from the ICC&apos;s Singapore meeting was the confirmation of England&apos;s leading role in opening up a route into Test cricket for associate nations, including Ireland and Afghanistan. England have left a space in their Future Tours Programme, to be announced shortly, for the Ashes summer of 2019 to play a Test against the winners of the next Intercontinental Cup, if that team also win the play-off against the bottom-ranked full ICC member in 2018. That opens up the real possibility of Ireland playing their inaugural Test at Lord&apos;s in the spring of 2019 \u2013 and &quot;breaking the glass ceiling&quot;, as it was described in the ICC&apos;s post-meeting statement. The proposals were ratified 8\u20130 by the 10 full ICC members.

While modelling raptor pursuit strategies, Suzanne Amador Kane, associate professor of physics and astronomy at Haverford College, Pennsylvania, watched wildlife documentaries and became convinced that fitting the birds with miniature video cameras could overcome this difficulty. The Journal of Experimental Biology published the conclusions of her research last month. In partnership with professional falconers, Kane fitted gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus), peregrine falcons (Falco peregrinus \u2013 pictured) and hybrids with miniature videocameras \u2013 on their head or back, depending on size. She was thus able to film 48 pursuits targeting carrion crows, bustards and other species in various parts of rural Belgium, Great Britain and the US, and the desert in Dubai. &quot;We analysed the video images, one at a time using software, in order to determine the prey&apos;s apparent position in the bird&apos;s visual field, as well as other factors such as their relative speed and the distance between them,&quot; Kane says. The data was then interpreted using computer simulations based on predator-prey pursuits involving insects and mammals. The results differed from what was expected. &quot;The simplest way to pursue a prey is to fly straight at it. So you expect to find the prey in the middle of the video image,&quot; Kane explains. &quot;Another idea, proposed by the biologist Vance Tucker in 2000, was that falcons fly along a spiral trajectory so as to keep their prey at a roughly 45-degree angle in their visual field, the angle at which they have the highest visual acuity.&quot; Both these assumptions proved incorrect and the researchers turned to bats and dragonflies to gain an understanding of how falcons operate. &quot;Previous work shows that these animals use a pursuit strategy known as motion camouflage,&quot; Kane adds. &quot;The predator anticipates the point at which it will intercept the prey based on its speed and sets its course for that spot, keeping the prey at a constant angle in its field of vision. Which is exactly what we observed with the falcons.&quot; This is a highly effective strategy because it fools the prey. The predator&apos;s apparent position in its target&apos;s visual field does not change, giving the latter the impression that the threat is still at a distance, until it is too late. Sailors are familiar with this manoeuvre, steering a course at a constant angle to the vessel they aim to board. The collision course falcons deliberately adopt is exactly the same. However, despite its apparent sophistication this pursuit strategy fails three-quarters of the time. If, for instance, the prey turns and flies towards the predator, it upsets the pursuit. Kane now plans to study other raptors \u2013 goshawks and sparrowhawks \u2013 that have developed their own pursuit strategies.

The tone was set when the man from Sky offered a standard &quot;good afternoon&quot; and Moyes stared straight back. He then proceeded to say as little as possible before a bizarre sketch at the end when he was asked about the team&apos;s mid-season trip to Dubai \u2013 they leave on Thursday \u2013 while he was making his way to the door. Pretending he had not heard the question, he strode out. It was an expert blanking, missing only a talk-to-the-hand speech bubble. Moyes accepted later that he had heard every word. Too much can be read into these events sometimes but it certainly offers an insight into Moyes&apos; current mind-set when he is willing to give the television crews only three minutes of his time. What quickly became evident was that this was not going to be a time for forensic analysis. His players had been &quot;terrific,&quot; he said. &quot;The players are doing great. I think I&apos;ve got a great group of players. I&apos;m very fortunate I took over the champions and I think the players have been terrific.&quot; It was gently pointed out that his team were 21 points worse off than at this stage last season. &quot;Well, I was at Everton so I wasn&apos;t 21 points worse off,&quot; he replied. &quot;I was at Everton.&quot; OK, but United, how has it gone that way? &quot;The improvement in the teams in the Premier League has been big,&quot; he said. &quot;There have been a lot of improvements from sides in the Premier League and obviously we&apos;ve not done as well.&quot; That was about as expansive as it became. There were little clues, however. Moyes was clearly unhappy at the reaction to the 2-2 draw with Fulham the Premier League&apos;s bottom club, and the focus on his team knocking cross after cross into the penalty area. &quot;You need to have a football intelligence, a football brain, to understand first of all,&quot; he said of his tactics. Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen, Fulham&apos;s manager, had said United were predictable and their young defender, Dan Burn, had talked of Conference-style tactics. &quot;Yeah, well, I thought only one team came to win,&quot; Moyes said. &quot;But you [media] watched it, so it was probably a game for you to write how badly Manchester United had done, rather than what the opposition played like.&quot; Was he disappointed, after the signing of Juan Mata, that his players had not reacted better? &quot;Who&apos;s not reacted?&quot; Moyes shot back. The team? &quot;Yeah, but we played well against Fulham and should have won the game so, if you take that, I would have to disagree.&quot; Was it time to try something different? &quot;I disagree with that as well.&quot; Even though the results are not what they should be? &quot;I can only give you my answer. I disagree.&quot; More staring. A poll by the Red Issue fanzine has shown Moyes has lost some of the crowd&apos;s backing recently. In January 7% of supporters wanted him sacked, with 20% saying they would give him until the end of the season. It is now 17% wanting him out now and 32% preferring a summer change. It has also emerged that United have briefed their stewards about the possibility of a new wave of protests against the Glazer family. Stewards have also been warned about a possible pay cut if the club do not qualify for the Champions League. Another questioner pointed out that at a different club the supporters might have been hounding him out by now. That was maybe the only time Moyes agreed. &quot;That&apos;s why the right clubs pick the right managers and the right managers pick the right clubs. You pick clubs where you know it is the right place for you. &quot;I was given a six-year contract because it was a long-term deal. It was always going to take time. There is rebuilding going on year after year here and we will continue to try to do that.&quot; By the end, however, Moyes could scarcely go through the motions when he was asked whether the team had to reproduce the form they showed when beating Arsenal at Old Trafford earlier in the season. He just nodded and stared. So, to clarify, did he think they could reproduce that level? &quot;Yeah, I think we can.&quot; Could he explain? &quot;Because we have done it before.&quot; It has been a long time, though. &quot;You asked me a question about Arsenal and I am just answering your question. I think we can.&quot; And then he was off, without a single look back.", "title": "Manchester United's David Moyes gets prickly under pressure", "sentences": ["He then proceeded to say as little as possible before a bizarre sketch at the end when he was asked about the team&apos;s mid-season trip to Dubai \u2013 they leave on Thursday \u2013 while he was making his way to the door."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-12T00:04:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/11/west-ham-united-norwich-city-premier-league-match-report", "tags": ["Norwich City", "West Ham United", "Premier League", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "If West Ham are to remain a Premier League side this year, it may be in no small part down a man hailing from Seville. The Andalucian city produced the man of the match at Upton Park, with the goalkeeper Adri\u00e1n coming to the rescue of a side that was often outmanoeuvred and outwitted by Norwich City but eventually emerged victorious thanks to late goals from James Collins and Mohamed Diam\u00e9. It is the first time West Ham have secured three successive wins in the top flight since the days of Carlos T\u00e9vez in 2007 and the result marked their 13th clean sheet of the league campaign, elevating Sam Allardyce&apos;s side into the top half of the table following a winter of discontent. As Collins capitalised on some poor goalkeeping from John Ruddy to nod home Diam\u00e9&apos;s cross from the left with six minutes remaining, Adri\u00e1n held his arms aloft. He had denied the Canaries on several occasions during a match in which his side had been second best, demonstrating his shot-stopping abilities and an impressive command of the area. The celebrations inside the Boleyn Ground were heightened in injury time when Diam\u00e9&apos;s deflected shot crept past Ruddy to inflict severe misery on the Canaries who, bar some poor finishing, had certainly been the better team. On Adri\u00e1n Allardyce said: &quot;He was outstanding today. It was really important for him to produce those saves at that time. Your goalkeeper has to sometimes keep you in the game and I think he did that. &quot;I&apos;m absolutely delighted, it&apos;s a terrific run of form we&apos;re in, considering where we started off this run and where we were in the league before that. Even though we&apos;re 10th we&apos;re still not out of the bottom end in terms of the distance in points.&quot; The two sides began the game level on points and on the back of some much improved performances. West Ham, who only days ago were in dire straits and languishing in the relegation zone, named an unchanged team from the one that overcame Aston Villa at the weekend, with Andy Carroll serving the second instalment of his three-match suspension. Norwich&apos;s Robert Snodgrass came in for Anthony Pilkington as Chris Hughton&apos;s only alteration. The home side, who have the most clean sheets in the Premier League this season, were lucky not to go in behind at half-time. Adri\u00e1n, who has usurped Jussi Jaaskelainen as West Ham&apos;s No1 choice in goal, thrice kept the Canaries at bay in the opening 45 minutes, first denying Gary Hooper before two more impressive stops that thwarted Snodgrass and then Alex Tettey.After only nine minutes Nathan Redmond beat Guy Demel with ease and drifted a precise cross into the area for Hooper to head towards the bottom corner but Adri\u00e1n scrambled across his goal and tipped the ball wide of his left-hand post. Even better was the Spaniard&apos;s save after 18 minutes. Redmond again played an integral part in the move, picking the ball up in a central midfield position and clipping a deft ball over the top for Snodgrass. Adri\u00e1n at first seemed hesitant to come off his line but his decision paid off as he stood tall and stopped the Scot&apos;s goalbound attempt. West Ham increased the pressure on the opposition penalty area and looked to exploit a lack of assertiveness in the air between the central defensive pairing of Joseph Yobo and S\u00e9bastien Bassong but they were lacking creativity in the final third. Indeed, it was Adri\u00e1n, not Ruddy, who was called into action yet again in first-half injury time, flying spectacularly to his right to deny Alex Tettey from the edge of the area following a lay-off from Hooper. But it was to be West Ham who had the last laugh amid a frantic finish. Ruddy, just a few minutes after denying Diam\u00e9 with a fine save, was soon picking the ball out of his net on two occasions. Collins timed his header to perfection before Diam\u00e9 did eventually score in injury time, his shot deflected in off Russell Martin. Hughton said: &quot;I am very, very frustrated. When you come here, you know you&apos;ll be up against a direct and physical game and you have to match them. For nearly all the game we were able to do that but you rely on getting a little release by scoring goals. No one can say we didn&apos;t attempt to get into goal areas and create chances. &quot;It is a bit too familiar, creating chances and not putting them away. We put more pressure on ourselves.

The report concluded that the seizures of unlicensed veterinary goods by British authorities resulted from &quot;a sense of complacency&quot; within the Sheikh&apos;s management structure. Stevens interviewed several figures within Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s equine operations, including the disgraced former trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni who was banned by eight years by the British Horseracing Association in April 2013 for injecting thoroughbreds at the Godolphin stable with performance-enhancing anabolic steroids.

Years ago that would have meant more fire and more steel and more anger and more blood and more guts and more gore than you can shake a stick at. Not any more, though. If it is big, banging fireworks that you are expecting then don&apos;t come crying to the Fiver when all you get is sparkler. Mind, if Arsenal versus Manchester United is not up your street then you also can also have the pleasure of enjoying Stoke&apos;s scoreless stalemate with Swansea, or Everton&apos;s evisceration of Crystal Palace, or Newcastle&apos;s shoeing at the hands of Spurs, or Manchester City&apos;s slaughtering of Sunderland. That&apos;s without even mentioning Brendan Rodgers&apos; British-based bashing of Fulham. The problem with all of these games though is that they&apos;re as easy to predict as a 100m dash between your very own wheezing Fiver and a cheetah on steroids, thus rendering them about as interesting as a remake of Cast Away staring Jude Law as Chuck Noland and an old Mitre ball playing Wilson.

But no fingers are pointed and Lord Stevens agrees with the BHA view that Zarooni &quot;acted alone in the procurement and transport to the UK&quot; of anabolic steroids Major shake-up needed The drug seizures last spring at Stansted and a Newmarket farm owned by Sheikh Mohammed are said to have arisen from &quot;management failings, insufficient oversight and a sense of complacency within the organisation&quot;. Since the autumn, the Sheikh&apos;s staff have been told to register and authorise all horse medications at the intended destination Seized drugs &quot;not illegal&quot; Lord Stevens&apos;s report repeatedly insists that all medicines seized could be legally bought under different brand names in the UK.

The public version of Lord Stevens&apos; report excludes detail on &quot;internal personnel issues&quot;, suggesting that fault may, privately, have been found with one or more of the Sheikh&apos;s employees. No names are mentioned, however, beyond the established villain Zarooni, banned from racing for eight years What now for Simon Crisford? Godolphin&apos;s long-serving racing manager, who is described on the operation&apos;s website as being a kind of chief executive, must share in responsibility for the failings identified. The extent of his duties has never been made entirely clear in public but he has accepted responsibility for recommending Zarooni to the Sheikh Why fly drugs all round the world?  Lord Stevens reports that the drugs seized in Newmarket had been purchased in Spain and brought into Britain via Dubai, even though they were &quot;only for use outside the UK&quot;. This appears a baffling route to pursue in light of Lord Stevens&apos;s assertion that all the drugs were legally available in Britain What did Zarooni say?  The banned former trainer gave evidence to Lord Stevens, though he has refused to speak to the BHA since leaving the UK in April. The BHA has never been able to question him about the second round of positive tests returned by some of his horses for anabolic steroids, including the 2012 St Leger winner, Encke Have unidentified personnel been working for Godolphin in Newmarket?

Afsana Lachaux, 46, from London, was charged after failing to attend an access meeting between her ex-husband and their son Louis in March. She alleges that her French ex-husband threatened her \u2013 a claim he denies. On Tuesday she was due to present her side of the argument and produce witnesses to testify that she was a victim of domestic violence. However, the judge dismissed her witnesses, saying they did not have the correct form of identification \u2013 despite both carrying Dubai driving licences. Unable to make her case, Lachaux faces prison and then immediate deportation. She told the Guardian she feared being forced to leave without her son. &quot;I would be locked up for years and then never see my boy. Is there anything worse for a mother?&quot; she said. The judge allowed the ex-husband to make a series of claims in open court, and to raise the fact that the case had been featured in British newspaper articles that cast the United Arab Emirates in a poor light. A local news report quoted a court official as saying the British media were exaggerating the case and that &quot;the wife&apos;s beauty &apos;was attracting a lot of foreign interest&apos;&quot;. Lachaux said she was stunned by the court process. &quot;All I am asking is for me to be given a fair hearing. I want the authorities to review my case. I can produce evidence, witnesses to violence. But as a woman of Asian origin, a Muslim woman, I cannot seem to get a fair trial. I want the police to investigate my claims of domestic violence and for the courts to consider my arguments. So far that has not happened.&quot; Lachaux, a British citizen of Bangladeshi origin, said she was &quot;astonished by the news reports focusing on the way I looked. I am not a hapless tourist out here. It&apos;s been four years of living a nightmare. I have been denigrated. Emotionally and physically abused.&quot; The former civil servant, from Poplar, east London, moved to Dubai shortly after getting married to a French currency dealer in 2010. Lachaux claims her husband soon turned violent, subjecting her to emotional and physical abuse. In April 2011 she fled, taking Louis with her. Since then, she said, she has been &quot;homeless and living off people&apos;s floors \u2026 I have been on the run, frightened and alone&quot;. She said her ex-husband continued to pursue her, launching a series of legal cases and a campaign of intimidation. She said these actions led to her passport being confiscated by Dubai police and to her being assaulted in a police cell and ending up in a government-run shelter for illegally trafficked sex workers awaiting deportation. Before last October she and her son had been on the run from her husband, who had been the subject of a restraining order in America for stalking a former girlfriend, when he took the boy from her. It emerged that the husband, a non-Muslim, had obtained an order from a sharia court in her absence. The ruling cannot be appealed, in effect rescinding the mother&apos;s rights to see her son. Nicholas McGeehan, the Middle East researcher for Human Rights Watch, who has investigated the case, said it was &quot;staggering that witnesses who personally saw the husband assault the woman and threatened to kill her were prevented from giving evidence in court&quot;. McGeehan said countries such as Norway and Austria had made high-level and high-profile interventions in similar cases to challenge apparently outdated views on women&apos;s rights in the Gulf state&apos;s judicial process. Both led to women walking free. &quot;We have established in the [Lachaux] case that the judicial process is dysfunctional and that the police did not investigate her claims of abuse. It is a familiar pattern,&quot; he said. McGeehan said David Cameron had intervened in a separate case last year, expressing concern about allegations that three Britons were tortured while in custody in Dubai. Lachaux said she could not understand &quot;why ministers are not speaking out in my case. The embassy knows all about what has happened.&quot; A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said ministers were following developments in the case. &quot;We recognise that Mrs Lachaux is understandably distressed at being separated from her son. Consular staff have been providing assistance to Mrs Lachaux since 2011 including attending court hearings with her. Consular officials have approached the UAE authorities about this case and we will continue to work closely with them. &quot;However, we cannot interfere in the judicial process of another country. We must respect their judicial system just as we expect them to respect the UK&apos;s laws and legal processes. We will continue to provide consular assistance to Mrs Lachaux and her family.&quot;", "title": "Dubai judge rejects defence witnesses in British mother's kidnap trial", "sentences": ["A British mother charged with kidnapping her three-year-old son in Dubai is almost certain to face a prison sentence after the judge in the case declined to hear evidence from defence witnesses \u2013 a move described by human rights groups as &quot;staggeringly&quot; unfair.", "However, the judge dismissed her witnesses, saying they did not have the correct form of identification \u2013 despite both carrying Dubai driving licences.", "Emotionally and physically abused.&quot; The former civil servant, from Poplar, east London, moved to Dubai shortly after getting married to a French currency dealer in 2010.", "She said these actions led to her passport being confiscated by Dubai police and to her being assaulted in a police cell and ending up in a government-run shelter for illegally trafficked sex workers awaiting deportation.", "McGeehan said David Cameron had intervened in a separate case last year, expressing concern about allegations that three Britons were tortured while in custody in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-12T19:10:52Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/feb/12/godolphin-al-zarooni-scandal-stevens-report-slammed", "tags": ["Godolphin", "Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum", "Drugs in sport", "British Horseracing Authority", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "A leading international equestrian federation has heavily criticised a report exonerating Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, the UK&apos;s leading racehorse owner, of having any knowledge of three drug-related scandals involving his organisation last year, lamenting the inquiry&apos;s &quot;conflict of interests&quot; after being commissioned by the Sheikh himself. Lord Stevens, the former chief of the Metropolitan police, was employed by Sheikh Mohammed and his wife Princess Haya to investigate three separate incidents involving his equine operations, including the doping of Godolphin racehorses with anabolic steroids by the disgraced trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni and two seizures of &quot;potentially toxic and dangerous&quot; veterinary goods at Stansted airport and Moorley Farm, owned by the Sheikh&apos;s Darley Stud, in Newmarket. The inquiry, during which Stevens spoke with a number of key figures within Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s organisation including the Godolphin racing manager, Simon Crisford, and trainer Charlie Appleby, as well as Zarooni, found that Sheikh Mohammed did not have any knowledge of the events leading to the seizure of unlicensed medicines at Moorley Farm or from a Dubai Royal Air Wing flight at Stansted, as revealed by the Guardian in September. The report also stated that Zarooni &quot;acted alone&quot; during his doping of thoroughbreds. However, the Swiss Equestrian Federation has questioned the neutrality of Lord Stevens&apos; report, undertaken by the global advisory firm Quest, citing concerns because of the former Met commissioner&apos;s links to Princess Haya. Stevens is a consultant to the International Federation for Equestrian Sports (FEI), for whom Princess Haya is currently president. Dr Claude Nordmann, co-ordinator for international relations and a board member at the Swiss federation, said: &quot;I&apos;m not at all surprised with the results. We think there is a conflict of interest to have Quest investigating Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s operations and on the other end being involved in the integrity unit of the FEI. &quot;If you want to make a neutral inquiry you should not take a man who has a contract with the business of his wife. He is paid by Sheikh Mohammed. It&apos;s what we were waiting for. He recommends some small changes and the Sheikh agrees to do it, that&apos;s it. For us it&apos;s a conflict of interest and we don&apos;t understand why he [Stevens] accepted this mandate. The findings are nothing special \u2013 it&apos;s astonishing that you could find so many veterinary products in a farm, not in a surgery or clinic.&quot; Asked what has to be done to improve the tainted image of endurance racing, Nordmann added: &quot;Lots. It&apos;s dangerous for the whole of equestrian sport. The controlling and officiating should be much stronger. Why is it not possible to install the same system of control and reporting in endurance as it is in eventing? Lots of other federations and riders are of the same opinion.&quot; Stevens said: &quot;Throughout our investigation of the three entirely separate incidents, we have established that no evidence whatsoever exists to suggest that HH Sheikh Mohammed had any knowledge of the purchase, transportation or use of any unregulated medicines. Equally, neither did he have any knowledge of the illegal activities of Mahmood al-Zarooni. &quot;However, in our discussions with HH Sheikh Mohammed, he agreed to create a task force of experts to suggest ways to make it easier for all affected stakeholders in the equestrian industry to comply with the regulations.&quot; The report, made public at the behest of Sheikh Mohammed, stated that a number of &quot;management oversights&quot; and a &quot;sense of complacency&quot; had led to the seizures by the Veterinary Medicines Directorate and UK Border Force at Stansted on 3 May and at Moorley Farm last summer, as well as the Zarooni scandal. Crisford, the Godolphin racing manager, was unavailable for comment on Wednesday. One hundred bottles of Tildren, a substance that is used by vets for horses with bone problems, were seized from the Dubai jet at Stansted, with the sheer volume of the product causing concern for the British Equine Veterinary Association. However, the Stevens inquiry claimed &quot;the quantities of the medicines seized \u2026 are not in themselves unusual&quot;. Keith Chandler, senior vice-president at Beva, said: &quot;We welcome the detailed investigation performed by the representatives of HH Sheikh Mohammed. We do have concerns that these medicines may have been used and administered by non-veterinarians.&quot; The Stevens report stated that Dubai Royal Air Wing aircraft, owned and run by the Dubai government, has been banned from transporting veterinary medicines in the future, while the investigation has led to a number of recommendations for Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s equine management team. As well as the establishment of a task force, Lord Stevens suggested that an internal compliance unit should be set up, with the power to visit and examine any part of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s operation at any time. Adam Brickell, the director of integrity, legal and risk at the British Horseracing Authority, said: &quot;We welcome the release of the public report compiled by Lord Stevens. We have been in contact with Lord Stevens&apos; team and the findings of the investigation published today corroborate the conclusions of our own investigation. &quot;In the light of the positive samples last year the Godolphin horses based at Moulton Paddocks remain subject to enhanced monitoring for a period of time until BHA is satisfied that a reduced level of scrutiny would be appropriate.&quot; Princess Haya said: &quot;On behalf of Sheikh Mohammed, I have been asked to thank Lord Stevens and his team for their work and all they have done to improve the internal operations of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s equestrian operations.

It is often said, when the modern industry is engaged in a bout of infighting, that we could do with a fourth: someone with a genius for organisation, the vision to conceive grand schemes, and the intelligence and determination to carry them out. A do-er, not a delegator. Were it not for the unfortunate fact that Mahmood al-Zarooni is banned from every track and racing yard in the country until 2021, he might well be an ideal candidate. The Stevens report into Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s global equine operations, a brief summary of which was released on Wednesday, confirms the British Horseracing Authority&apos;s initial finding after Zarooni&apos;s steroid-doping spree at Moulton Paddocks in Newmarket last year that Godolphin&apos;s former trainer &quot;acted alone in both the procurement and transport to the UK of the drugs&quot; and then &quot;personally provided the same to one of his assistant vets along with directions as to administration&quot;. Lord Stevens and the BHA are in agreement: the biggest doping scandal the British turf has seen was, in effect, a one-man show. Sadly, however, when you consider the few facts about the Godolphin dopings which are in the public domain, and extrapolate just a little towards a few that are not, it sounds no more convincing from a peer of the realm than it did from the sport&apos;s regulator. Stevens did, at least, talk to Zarooni himself while compiling his report, which is more than the BHA has ever managed to do, having charged and banned him within a week of the positive test results from his string coming to light. But we are not allowed to know even what questions were asked, never mind what Zarooni said in response. Was he asked how many doses of steroids he purchased, given that there must have been dozens, and probably hundreds? Can he account for what happened to them all, including those that were, presumably, still unused when he was busted? Above all, was he asked about Encke, the Classic winner that somehow slipped his mind, and could he provide a convincing response? This is a key point, because while Stevens rubber-stamps the BHA&apos;s conclusion that Zarooni acted alone, when he was banned no one knew about Encke. Eleven horses tested positive for steroids when the BHA conducted initial tests on his string, and Zarooni himself then offered a hand-written list of doped horses to his disciplinary hearing which included four more names, all unraced. But he did not mention Encke, the horse who had given him his second British Classic just a few months beforehand, and beaten a potential Triple Crown winner in Camelot in the process. He forgot about Improvisation too, even though he had appeared, and won, at Newmarket less than a fortnight beforehand. The fact that these horses and five others had been given stanozolol only emerged three weeks later, when the BHA tested the entire string. It seems probable too that several more horses at Moulton Paddocks had been given ethylestranol, Zarooni&apos;s other favoured steroid, which clears a horse&apos;s system more quickly than stanozolol. They slipped through the net because the BHA did not test them in time. Did Zarooni fail to mention Encke deliberately, because he was in enough trouble already, his brain was addled and he did not want to make things worse, or was it because he did not know that the St Leger winner had been doped? The question clearly goes to the heart of the &quot;lone gun&quot; theory, because if he did not know, he was not acting alone. Since there is no evidence that Stevens even asked the question, we are no closer to an answer. Stevens \u2013 whose report was commissioned by Sheikh Mohammed \u2013 also concludes that &quot;no evidence whatsoever exists to suggest that HH Sheikh Mohammed \u2026 had any knowledge of the illegal activities of Mahmood al-Zarooni&quot;. He does concede, however, that &quot;the mere fact that these circumstances and actions could arise without management intervention gives serious cause for concern&quot;. It certainly does, given the sheer scale of what Zarooni managed to do before he was rumbled. He acquired large quantities of steroids. He then transported these across thousands of miles to Newmarket, stored the whole lot at Moulton Paddocks \u2013 again with no questions asked or suspicions raised \u2013 and arranged the administration of hundreds of doses of steroids to 22 horses that we know about and perhaps a dozen or more that we do not. Ethylestranol in particular is all but useless unless it is administered, usually orally via a paste, on a daily basis. Its effects, though, are swift and dramatic, as is the case for stanozolol, which muscles up horses as rapidly as it does humans. But still, there was no &quot;management intervention&quot; and, most remarkable of all, for the majority of the time that this was taking place Zarooni was in Dubai. What an exceptional turf administrator he might have made, had he not been tempted by the dark side.", "title": "Lord Stevens' doping scandal report lets Sheikh Mohammed off the hook | Greg Wood", "sentences": ["But still, there was no &quot;management intervention&quot; and, most remarkable of all, for the majority of the time that this was taking place Zarooni was in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-12T21:35:51Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/13/the-fiver-uruguay-chief-ambassador", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "ONCE BITTEN The Fiver just wants a quiet life.

By our calculations, a weekly salary of \u00a33.06 \u2013 with expenses and access to the staff vending machine at any time of the day \u2013 makes this an achievable goal by the year 2067, by which time the entire English countryside will be under water. But that&apos;s the dream, as long as The Fiver has developed gills by then. That&apos;s the dream. The Fiver doesn&apos;t want to be about controversy anymore.

So imagine our dismay after being told to look into Luis Su\u00e1rez&apos;s latest act of half-wittery. A brief bit of digging revealed that Uruguay&apos;s chief ambassador has been jabbering away to some radio station in his refreshingly inimitable style. &quot;Let me tell you,&quot; the Liverpool striker said, as The Fiver&apos;s shoulders slumped so low that they sunk to the earth&apos;s core. &quot;I&apos;ve made only two mistakes in my career.&quot; Well hang on. This could be interesting. Was he finally about to apologise for racially abusing Manchester United&apos;s Patrice Evra in October 2011? Let&apos;s see. &quot;My first was when I was playing for Ajax and I bit an opponent,&quot; he continued, before taking a large gulp of breath \u2013 for the moment had arrived. &quot;My second was when I bit [Branislav] Ivanovic [against Chelsea].&quot; Wait a minute.

Try not to cry. &quot;I have thought more about things before doing them,&quot; Su\u00e1rez whispered in hushed tones, his voice audibly cracking up. &quot;Now people in England can&apos;t talk about me because I&apos;m not doing anything wrong. They have to talk about me only as a footballer. I said I&apos;m sorry [after the Ivanovic bite] and that was all, end of story. I&apos;ve nothing else to regret.

Since the pair, Vadim Makhorov and Vitaly Raskalov, posted a video of their ascent to Youtube on Wednesday, hundreds of thousands of viewers have learned two things about the tower: one, that it&apos;s the world&apos;s second tallest building, after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai; and two, that this makes it frighteningly, vertiginously tall. The 632-metre Shanghai Tower (the pair climbed a further 18 metres up a crane on its roof) has been under construction in Shanghai&apos;s Lujiazui district, a gleaming financial centre directly across from the city&apos;s famous Bund, since 2008. It&apos;s set for completion later this year. In the 1980s, Lujiazui was little more than a swath of grassy fields. Now it&apos;s a forest of skyscrapers. It&apos;s difficult to glean from the video, in which the two men sneak into a poorly lit building site and climb up unadorned concrete stairs, but the tower is designed to be a sort of urban Elysium, packed with luxury hotels, offices and retail space. A slideshow on the website of Gensler, the American architecture firm behind the project, shows illustrations of the finished product, its glass-and-steel shell twisting up towards the sky like a giant cannolo. Gensler calls the tower a &quot;super-highrise precinct&quot; \u2013 a series of individual neighbourhoods strewn over 142 vertically stacked acres, equivalent to nearly 80 football pitches. Each will surround a &quot;light-filled garden atrium&quot; designed, apparently, to &quot;foster community and support daily life&quot;. The building twists through 120 degrees from its base to its top, helping it withstand the city&apos;s notoriously strong winds. Its elevators are designed to move at nearly 40mph. Altogether, the stunt took the two men about 20 hours to complete, although the actual ascent took just two. They entered the tower under cover of dark, scaled the rooftop crane at daybreak, exchanged a high five \u2013 and then waited around for the light to improve, so they could best record the views down over the tops of the building&apos;s closest neighbours: the Jin Mao Tower and Shanghai World Financial Centre, rising above a thin cloud cover. The Shanghai Tower will be an amazing building, if Gensler&apos;s plans hold true. But at that moment at the summit, one imagines, innovative architectural design felt as distant to the men as the ethereal cityscape below.", "title": "Russian daredevils scale the Shanghai Tower, China's new tallest building", "sentences": ["Since the pair, Vadim Makhorov and Vitaly Raskalov, posted a video of their ascent to Youtube on Wednesday, hundreds of thousands of viewers have learned two things about the tower: one, that it&apos;s the world&apos;s second tallest building, after the Burj Khalifa in Dubai; and two, that this makes it frighteningly, vertiginously tall."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-13T19:20:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/feb/14/the-fiver-fa-cup-preview", "tags": ["Football", "Sport"], "article": "SWEET (AND SOUR) FA With the fifth round of the world&apos;s oldest cup competition upon us, these are disappointing times for the players of middling Premier League teams such as Stoke City, West Ham, Norwich and Manchester United, for whom the trophy represents one of few realistic chances of success. Chilling by the pool and soaking up rays in the millionaires&apos; paradise of Dubai, these unfortunate young men have been left to reflect on what might have been if they&apos;d tried a little harder in previous rounds: the ordeal of a trip to Wigan, or a 1,022km-round trip to Sunderland for a 90-minute buffeting at the hands of the howling winds gusting in from the North Sea. It&apos;s the magic of the FA Cup \u2013 once we&apos;re down to the last 16, top-flight teams who have already been knocked out head to the nearest airport and disappear. Those players lucky enough to have missed out on warm-weather training camps in foreign climes will know that victory this weekend will leave them just one match away from a Wembley semi-final and all the grumbling about how it should be played somewhere else that such a fixture that entails. And while Arsenal v Liverpool, Manchester City v Chelsea and Sheffield Wednesday v Charlton Athletic are the stand-out glamour ties that will inevitably capture the public imagination, there are a couple of lower-profile needle matches that have caught the Fiver&apos;s eye: Sheffield United v Nottingham Forest and \u2026 um, that&apos;s about it. As FA Cup ties go, this has pretty much everything you could ask for. Lower-league opposition at home to a superior opponent? Tick. Supporters that hate each other because of a festering grudge over a violent miners&apos; strike? Tick. A chippy Scottish manager who can&apos;t stand his opposite number because of something that may or may not have occurred in a melee several years ago? Tick. The son of the most famous English manager never to win the FA Cup going toe-to-toe with the side for whom he remains record scorer? Tickety-tick. &quot;The majority of Forest fans have always been very good, it&apos;s just the minority,&quot; said Nigel Clough, for it is he, of the decidedly hostile reception with which he was greeted upon his returns to the City Ground in his previous life as Derby County manager. &quot;They&apos;re good people. It&apos;s amazing the people who come up to you and speak quietly and ask how you&apos;re doing. They&apos;re perfectly polite. It is the minority, unfortunately, who are loud.&quot; On the subject of small things that are loud, Clough conceded that his opposite number Billy Davies has long been a source of irritation. &quot;We have had a few run-ins down the years, which is probably inevitable because of the teams we were managing at the time,&quot; he said. Considering how little love is lost between fans of Sheffield United and Forest, expect more bad-tempered snarling on Sunday afternoon. QUOTE OF THE DAY &quot;Incredible.

But Adonis has that covered: he wants the move to take place only when the institution has been reformed, slimmed down, democratised. So far, so good. But where? This has long been a pet scheme of Adonis&apos;s, and when he mooted it in 2012 Guardian readers had some excellent ideas: Blackpool Tower (with the clowns); a disused industrial estate in Dewsbury; Scunthorpe; the Outer Hebrides; Mars. York also featured a great deal, but was deemed too posh by some \u2013 a white, affluent subset of London. It seems to me, though, that Adonis does not go far enough. He says selling off the Lords&apos; property portfolio \u2013 all that expensive office space along Millbank \u2013 would raise a huge amount of cash. But the real prize would be to sell off the Palace of Westminster itself: what a hotel that would make! That means the Commons has to move too. Going to a great city in the Midlands or the north \u2013 Birmingham, Manchester, Liverpool, Leeds, Newcastle \u2013 would just create another bubble. There would be tax advantages in doing what some sports governing bodies have done and moving to Dubai, or it could, banking-style, try offshoring the whole thing to Bangalore to cut costs. Another possibility is a monastic island community, perhaps Iona or Lindisfarne, which would certainly cut down on expenses. In truth, though, there are only two possible solutions. First, parliament could be migratory, like Question Time \u2013 Truro this week (if the railway ever gets fixed), Todmorden next. Its arrival\u00a0would cause tremendous excitement wherever it went, like the circus coming to town. Alternatively, put the reformed parliament \u2013 500 MPs, 250 elected &quot;senators&quot; \u2013 in the dead centre of the country. Coventry has long claimed to be the centre of England and, with its wonderful cathedral and second world war\u00a0associations, is a worthy candidate. Leamington Spa also claims to be England&apos;s central spot, and is certainly dead enough. But let&apos;s assume Scotland will not secede, and so seek out the centre of the UK for our new, truly national parliament. That is\u00a0Lancaster, at the junction of Fenham Carr Lane and Wyresdale Road to be precise.

Her crime? &quot;Kidnapping&quot; my baby brother at a time when she had custody of him. It is the latest episode in a three-year ordeal that has left her trapped in Dubai, after attempting to escape the domestic abuse she was allegedly suffering at the hands of her French ex-husband. Instead of helping her, the authorities imposed a travel ban on her and my little brother and confiscated her passport at the request of her ex-husband, leaving her in limbo and exposing the shocking inequities of the UAE legal system. Travel bans are commonplace in the UAE and can be easily imposed on women and children at the request of a man \u2013 regardless of his nationality. It is something the British Foreign Office is fully aware of, yet fails to mention in any of its UAE guidance. My mother discovered this to her cost when she decided to flee from her husband in April 2011 and found she was treated as a criminal. The UAE is a country where the penal code upholds a man&apos;s right to &quot;discipline&quot; his wife through physical violence. My mother&apos;s alleged abuser has made a stream of unsubstantiated claims against her \u2013 including that she was an unfit mother because my brother had eczema. On one occasion my mother was held with my baby brother in the notorious Bur Dubai police station without food or water, while the police investigated yet more accusations. I was with my mother the day she decided to leave and witnessed what was happening first hand; it was devastating for me to see the suffering, so we packed our bags and left. Life has been torture since then, as my mother was left in a hellish catch-22 \u2013 homeless, unable to work without her husband&apos;s permission, without access to healthcare for her baby, and dependent on charity from those who took pity. They lived for some time in the country&apos;s only women&apos;s refuge. Shockingly, though, as it is run by the government, the refuge was obliged to inform her husband that she was there, and she was further intimidated in what should have been a place of safety. In October 2013 my mother&apos;s ex-husband tracked her down and took my brother. We have since discovered that the false claims have led to her husband being given full custody of my little brother in my mother&apos;s absence, after he was granted a divorce. My mother never had the opportunity to put her case. On Thursday she was sentenced by a UAE court for &quot;kidnapping&quot; her own son, after she failed to turn up for a pre-arranged visit with the father. The truth is she was too scared to turn up. She says she feared for her own safety and her son&apos;s after her husband had assaulted her on previous visits. She informed the public prosecutor, Dubai police and the UK Foreign Office of her fears, but no one listened. Her trial lasted 15 minutes. The judge refused to hear evidence from her two witnesses. It has been reported in the Gulf press that the witnesses did not have identification. This is not true \u2013 they provided their driving licences and ID cards, but they were inexplicably rejected. It has also been reported that an Emirati court official said that the British media was exaggerating the case and that &quot;[the] wife&apos;s beauty was attracting a lot of foreign interest&quot;. She was handcuffed and kept in a cell for three hours. This nightmare has been a horrible eye-opener into UAE legal system, but has also revealed the disgraceful failure of the British authorities to protect the human rights of one of its citizens. Conveniently, they hide behind the mantra that they &quot;cannot intervene in a matter for the UAE domestic courts&quot;, and turn a blind eye \u2013 yet David Cameron is happy to personally intervene when it comes to trade deals and the sale of fighter jets to the country. As Dubai prepares to host the World Expo trade convention in 2020, sharia law is being exploited. All my mother did was try to protect herself, but now our whole family is being torn apart. If no one helps, my mother could be imprisoned for several years as further claims are to be prosecuted and she will lose her child for ever.

The land that gave the world the spinning jenny (a means of multispooling cotton that kickstarted the Industrial Revolution) was in the ascendancy for hundreds of years. When the decline came it was merciless. One by one the great manufacturers fled to Asia, where production and staff are cheap. The death throes saw the closure in 2000 of Courtaulds in Worksop (employing more than 1,000 people in its heyday) and Burberry&apos;s Rhondda Valley factory in 2007. Our biggest garment export became the machines that once dyed, spun and knitted. By 2007 the Chinese town of Dalang, with the self-appointed soubriquet of Famous Knitting Sweater Town, had accumulated an arsenal of knitting machines with the capacity to produce an enormous 1.2bn pieces of knitwear per year. Some 90% of the clothes we wear now come from abroad, with a net import value of \u00a312.5bn. Britain is still in the fashion game, obviously \u2013 we&apos;ve provided a\u00a0steady stream of world-class designers, quirky supermodels and fast-fashion retail barons \u2013 but the actual business of making clothes seemed dead. So it feels pretty weird to be standing in Leicester, hearing the unmistakable clatter and hum of dyeing and fabric production at full tilt. And then again a few miles away in Hinckley, where the whirr of sewing machines accompanies 45 women creating piles of T-shirts in a white jacquard fabric as if nothing had ever changed. British fashion is apparently back in business. Farago Fabrics is a textile-producing unit and dyehouse run by brothers Harvi and Suki Johal. This is one of 20 companies in the UK producing \u2013 actually physically producing \u2013 for Marks &amp; Spencer&apos;s Best of British range, which launches its third collection at London Fashion Week tomorrow. Their father, Balwant, who came to Leicester in 1953, set up the factory as a denim processor and was essentially the king of stonewash until the 1980s when he watched that business evaporate. The Johals adapted. Rather than denim processing, Balwant&apos;s sons are all about the warp and weft of fabric production and the very technical process of dyeing fabric. Harvi describes textiles as a &quot;passion&quot;. Suki, the money man, takes a more pragmatic view: &quot;I have to admit we&apos;ve toyed with the idea of leaving the UK altogether [the company has profitable facilities in Morocco and Dubai, also producing for high-street brands]. But Harvi, he&apos;s the one who really believed in it. Besides, people haven&apos;t stopped wearing clothes.&quot;     White mischief: she wears cardigan \u00a3109, shirt \u00a399, trousers \u00a3129 and brogues \u00a3165. He wears shirt \u00a399 and trousers \u00a399. Photograph: Kevin Foord for the Observer    Quite, but M&amp;S hopes that they will care that these are made on UK shores. So far so good. The first Best of British collection was a sell-out (admittedly it was only in five bricks-and-mortar stores, but it did very good online business) with several stand-out pieces, including a black pea coat and a beautiful swing coat in a pink and black check (we are still very good at coats in this country). The Customer Insight Unit (M&amp;S&apos;s version of focus groups) found that consumers apparently value both the design and the investment in the quality that Best of British brings. Can being made in Britain help the retailer dodge the doldrums? Certainly they&apos;re becoming bolder with the range. The summer collection will be in 50 stores (and online) and womenswear will produce four collections per year. The aesthetic of Best of British is interesting. As M&amp;S style director Belinda Earl puts it: &quot;The collections have been designed with an emphasis on traditional British craftsmanship, quality and attention to detail, but it&apos;s also been important to make sure there is a modernity to the collections&apos; aesthetic, ensuring longevity and relevance for our customers.&quot; So no costume-British Sherlock Holmes-style tweed capes. Summer (which launches in store in May) includes a very modern floral dress in modal jersey, made and dyed by Farago Fabrics, a\u00a0digitally printed in many (but not quite 50) arresting shades of grey. A criticism might be that as Best of British is a niche collection \u2013 albeit one that&apos;s growing (90 pieces of menswear and womenswear launch for spring 2014 at London Fashion Week) \u2013 M&amp;S is just paying lip service to UK manufacture. The retailer argues that it is committed, though it won&apos;t make any claims that British manufacture is coming home. It stresses that the UK is currently its seventh-biggest production location for clothing and home, worth \u00a3230m per year. Harvi stops to admire the digital fabric printer (no screens necessary), as excited as Charlie Bucket. &quot;This\u2026this is hi-tech. Look at the detail in the print!&quot; The grey floral design begins to appear. It will go back into the dyehouse 100m away to take in more colour. Of course this has all taken significant investment. &quot;We&apos;ve gone the green route with our dyeing machines, using a fraction of the water and energy of the old style,&quot; confirms Harvi. Surprisingly \u2013 as British manufacture is often discussed in terms of slow fashion \u2013 one of the big sells of this enterprise is speed. &quot;Speed plus quality. That&apos;s what it&apos;s all about,&quot; says Harvi. &quot;It&apos;s probably fine to source basics from the Far East as you can plan those ahead, but the fashion end, where you need to be creative and on-trend, doesn&apos;t work on longer lead times. We&apos;re so close to the source, we are the source!&quot; Gill Marjoram, of Leeann Fashions in Hinckley, Leicestershire, began sewing in a factory at the age of 15 (she informs me she&apos;s well past pension age now). When M&amp;S arrived to place a Best of British order she and her team of 45 &quot;girls&quot; were ready. Depending on the complexity of the garment they can produce 5,000-10,000 pieces a\u00a0week. She started Leeann Fashions in a council unit in 1982, setting up sewing machines when the rest of the industry was leaving. &quot;There have been tough times \u2013 we were down to about 10 in here at one point,&quot; she admits. &quot;But I always kept faith in this factory. It was a surprise to see trade coming back. I suppose I never thought I would. But for the past six to nine months we have really tried to get going. The Best of British collection has given me the strength to go out and get it.&quot; Can the UK really be a contender again? After a 20-year career in high street fashion, including stints as a senior fashion buyer for the likes of M&amp;S and Debenhams, Kate Hills has set up makeitbritish.co.uk, dedicated to bringing production back to the UK. In June she will launch the first trade show for buyers, brands, factories and makers \u2013 bringing them all together at the Old Truman Brewery in east London. It&apos;s a chance also to quantify what&apos;s out there. Hills says she has a database of around 1,000 factories and units, but nobody knows for sure what&apos;s left of the industry. The following manufacturers are missing in action or possibly extinct: component makers for lingerie, shirting producers for men&apos;s formal shirts, a maker of high-heeled women&apos;s boots and general lining makers. Doubtless these absences have been noted by M&amp;S buyers trying to put Best of British together. &quot;But I do feel the time is right to bring the rag trade back to the UK in a meaningful way,&quot; says Hills. &quot;I know at least half a dozen factories with the potential to produce at decent scale [tens of thousands of units a week]. I&apos;ve just visited another factory employing 50 to 60 women in the Midlands that was so hi-tech you could eat your dinner off the floor. Serious investment has gone into it because the owners see an opportunity. Providing the fabric is in stock this factory can get an order out within a\u00a0week. A week!&quot; That&apos;s the good news, but there are concerns. &quot;Things are coming back, but slower than they should be,&quot; concedes Hills. &quot;We still lack infrastructure. And the challenges manufacturers face are consistent orders and continuity of orders.&quot; Meanwhile, the loss of manufacturers continues. Most recently \u2013 and despite a ton of publicity and, apparently, a healthy order book \u2013 Headen &amp; Quarmby, manufacturers of, among other things, Mary Portas&apos;s Kinky Knickers range, went into administration, citing &quot;cash flow&quot; issues.     Metal work: she wears jumper \u00a399 and skirt \u00a379. He wears shirt \u00a399, trousers \u00a399. Photograph: Kevin Foord for the Observer    Despite M&amp;S&apos;s orders, industry insiders warn that it&apos;s still dangerous for manufacturers to become dependent on a retailer which could develop commercial wanderlust and leave once more. So today&apos;s manufacturers seem determined to do things differently. James Eden is a new-style rag trade entrepreneur. With a Cambridge degree and a city career under his belt, he bought the Manchester factory once owned by his family and now produces outerwear for many of the big brands. Crucially, he has also launched his own menswear label, Private White VC, named after his great grandfather, a Victoria Cross recipient. The label&apos;s designer is Nick Ashley (son of Laura), and local provenance is everything to it. Ultimately the health of British fashion manufacture may well rest on whether we can develop the skillbase we need fast enough. &quot;No more designers please!&quot; says Kate Hills, only slightly joking. &quot;If my kids want to go into fashion, I want them making something as an apprentice.&quot; There is hope. Asos has invested in a stitching school. M&amp;S, with the British Fashion Council, has set up apprenticeships through the non-profit social enterprise, Fashion Enter. &quot;This was a fantastic industry, employing so many ladies,&quot; says Gill Marjoram. &quot;You earn good money and you buy a car, a house. It&apos;s super that it could be like that again. In the next three months, every machine here will be full. There will be bums on seats. But we can&apos;t deny we&apos;re getting older. There&apos;s girls here I&apos;ve worked with for 40 years and we&apos;re training as many youngsters as we can. I&apos;ve got the time, and I will give them the attention. I&apos;ve taken in 12 [since the Best of British contract] and only one was no good.&quot; She points out a group of young trainee machinists who are about to join the main pool. &quot;They will sit next to one of my experienced ladies. You see, when they come here they&apos;re joining a community and learning a skill for ever. They&apos;ll make their own wedding dress, probably. They&apos;ll alter their clothes. We don&apos;t do disposable fashion. But they&apos;ll have a job they can be proud of.

But this was no ordinary hole. It&apos;s the site of the future Wilshire Grand, a 73-storey building filled with offices, retail and hotel rooms that will, when it opens in 2017, be the tallest building in the city, and the eighth tallest in the US. It&apos;s a building of such significance in the city that even the pouring of its foundation is a moment to celebrate. The project \u2013 a $1.1bn (\u00a3660m) investment \u2013 will be the first major skyscraper built in the city in more than 20 years. That&apos;s a time span that&apos;s seen the global footprint of cities expand dramatically. Hyperspeed development in places like China and the Middle East have turned practically empty land into instant city skylines boasting the tallest buildings in the world. Long an American pastime, building skyscrapers has become a global game \u2013 and LA has largely been out of it. So it is being welcomed with great pomp that LA is once again building tall. Walking down the middle of a closed road Saturday, the building&apos;s developer was joined by its architect and the city&apos;s mayor in leading a parade of dignitaries around the project&apos;s site. Accompanied by the University of Southern California&apos;s marching band and a pair of white and blue concrete trucks, the parade moved its way around the site as spectators and policemen took photos with their phones. The parade was the spectacle, but the real show was the pouring of the building&apos;s foundation, a banal yet in this case highly publicised procedure that will help ensure the 1,100ft tower can withstand the seismic and wind forces that will regularly test its structural integrity.     How the Wilshire Grand stacks up against some of the world's tallest buildings.    For reasons not purely promotional, the foundation&apos;s concrete was dumped into the hole in one continuous pour \u2013 21,200 cubic yards (16,200 cubic metres) of concrete dumped by 2,120 trucks over a 26-hour period, enough to earn the event a Guinness World Record. The continuous pour turned out to be the most economical way to fill the hole, according to Chris Martin, lead architect of the Wilshire Grand project, from LA-based firm AC Martin. But pouring this much concrete at once is no small task. From sourcing the concrete and materials, to closing the streets, to keeping the concrete cool enough to set, the procedure is indicative of the technical evolution of building massive buildings. &quot;You&apos;ve never seen anything like this,&quot; says Martin. &quot;I never have.&quot; The entire site covers three acres, but the tower&apos;s foundation takes up about a football field&apos;s worth of space. It was a 17ft 6in hole ringed by 50,000lb (22,700kg) steel starter columns, providing a sturdy base for the structural columns that will rise to the building&apos;s highest floors. After a series of speeches, a long line of trucks began pulling around the site, where the long, green arms of concrete pumping machines reached down from the street surface into the hole. At about a dozen stations, each truck took about 10 minutes to dump its 6,000lb load of concrete into the pumping machines before shuffling out and making way for another. Altogether they poured the equivalent of six and a half Olympic-size swimming pools full of concrete. It was a day-long relay that Martin called &quot;a ballet of concrete trucks&quot;. For about the next two weeks, more than 19 miles of plastic tubing will carry refrigerants through the mass, accelerating the cooling of the concrete&apos;s exothermic reactions enough for it to solidify. By then, the 17ft 6in thick foundation alone will weigh more than 90m lbs, the equivalent of four Eiffel Towers. Hyperbole and marching band theatrics aside, this project is more than just a fancy way to fill up a big hole. The foundation and its forthcoming tower are seen as an almost existentially important project for downtown Los Angeles, and the city as a whole. &quot;I think it has a potential to put LA on the map with respect to the world of tall buildings,&quot; says Daniel Safarik, of the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat, a group that tracks the development of skyscrapers. &quot;Previously, LA was best known for blowing up tall buildings in movies, so you only had a few seconds to appreciate whatever architectural merits the US Bank Tower or the SunTrust Building had before it was destroyed by aliens or Bruce Willis.&quot; Historically, downtown LA was a capital for banks and oil companies. But in the early 1990s, banks began to merge together, consolidate offices or ditch the city for another state or country. &quot;It created this huge vacuum in class A office space,&quot; says Martin. The pressures and realities of the global market were manifest in empty office towers throughout downtown LA. It&apos;s been a slow rebound, and many in the city are hopeful that the Wilshire Grand is part of a new wave of investment downtown that will help the city compete internationally. Not that LA has been sitting stagnant. Thanks to an adaptive reuse ordinance that has allowed the conversion of old and underused office buildings into housing since 1999, the downtown area has seen a return to prominence in this multicentric city. A population of more than 50,000 people is turning the central business district into a round-the-clock neighbourhood. But downtown LA requires more than the loft spaces and coffee shops of a gentrifying residential neighbourhood.     How the Wilshire Grand will fit into the Los Angeles cityscape - according to an artist's impression.  Photograph: AC Martin    &quot;Cities are globally competing with each other,&quot; Safarik says. &quot;Regardless of their use, skyscrapers are seen as communicating the economic prominence of a city, and depending how big the country is, even the whole country. They&apos;re seen as a symbol of that place on the global stage. That&apos;s why it&apos;s gotten increasingly important for cities to build them.&quot; The US was the birthplace of the skyscraper. Built in 1884, the 10-storey Home Insurance Building in Chicago is widely recognised as the world&apos;s first, owing to the innovative use of structural steel to frame the building. Despite a rich history of American skyscrapers \u2013 from New York&apos;s art deco-topped Chrysler Building to the former tallest building in the country, Chicago&apos;s Willis Tower, to the now-tallest 1,776ft One World Trade Centre, which recently topped out in lower Manhattan \u2013 the US has been overshadowed in recent decades by other countries, especially in Asia. Large economic and political differences mean that American cities are highly unlikely to go on a building binge of Chinese proportions, but they&apos;re also unlikely to stop building altogether. The Wilshire Grand is one example; downtown Manhattan offers many others. Even the long-sidelined, 150-storey Chicago Spire project has shown signs of waking from its slumber in the midwest. For Los Angeles, the Wilshire Grand is proof that the city still has the cachet to go big. Yet it is also true that the developer investing the $1.1bn to build this tower is not from LA, nor even the US. The company behind the project is the South Korean shipping and airline giant, the Hanjin Group. But this is not a slur on LA; rather, it is proof the city is still able to compete in the increasingly competitive global market, according to Qingyun Ma, an architect and dean of the USC School of Architecture, who has worked on some of the tallest buildings now standing in many Asian cities. &quot;LA has always been a platform for global interest and for global ambition,&quot; Ma says. &quot;My personal take is that this tower will cause a lot more ambition globally to come to LA, not only to downtown but to many places to build taller buildings.&quot; He is hopeful that a denser, more urbanistic city will result \u2013 but knows it will take time. Martin, too, suggests the city will have to be patient. Its skyline won&apos;t grow like Shanghai&apos;s or Dubai&apos;s, but it will continue to grow. &quot;I remember in &apos;92 when we said we&apos;re not going to build any tall buildings for a long time,&quot; he says. &quot;At the time I was thinking 20 years \u2013 and we&apos;re kind of on track for that.&quot; Nate Berg is a Los Angeles-based journalist who covers cities, design and technology.

Despite Sunday newspaper reports that Rooney has signed fresh terms, the striker has not yet done so. It would, though, be a major surprise if he was to fail to commit his long-term future to the club in a deal that could be worth at least \u00a3300,000-a-week. Manchester United&apos;s manager, David Moyes, has made tying Rooney to a new deal a priority, and Chelsea remain an admirer of the 28-year-old, who came close to moving to the west London club last summer. Rooney appeared to be leaving United after his stock fell last season under Sir Alex Ferguson. Yet since Moyes took over he has again made Rooney the side&apos;s pivotal player and has kept him informed of the club&apos;s general transfer policy in recognition of his restored status. With Nemanja Vidic, the captain, leaving United in the summer alongside the potential exit of Rio Ferdinand, Rooney&apos;s commitment to the club would give Moyes a major boost as he seeks to rebuild the squad in the close season. Juan Mata&apos;s arrival in the January transfer window for a club record \u00a337.1m was the first step in this. And despite United currently standing in seventh position, with Champions League qualification in the balance, Rooney is enthused about how the Spaniard can help transform the club&apos;s fortunes. &quot;It&apos;s exciting. Juan has come in and it&apos;s another world-class player to have in the squad. It&apos;ll take time \u2013 it can always take a little bit of time for every player to gel and to bond but we really hope we can all start scoring goals and help the team be successful,&quot; Rooney said, before insisting that with United can still have a successful season. &quot;We&apos;ve got a lot of massive games in the Champions League and the league. We&apos;re all looking forward to them,&quot; he said. United are currently in Dubai on a warm-weather break. On returning they visit Crystal Palace on Saturday, before travelling to Olympiakos for the Champions League last-16 opening leg. Rooney added: &quot;We have a bit of a break before our next game now and hopefully we can prepare well and kick on for the big matches coming up. &quot;It&apos;s nice to spend time together,&quot; added the striker. &quot;When you&apos;re at home you go to training then you go home and see your families, but with trips like this you&apos;re training then spending time with the lads.&quot;", "title": "Wayne Rooney's talks with Manchester United over new contract ongoing", "sentences": ["United are currently in Dubai on a warm-weather break."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-16T11:59:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/feb/17/andy-murray-slip-number-seven-tennis-wimbledon-champion", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Rafael Nadal", "Novak Djokovic", "Stan Wawrinka", "Roger Federer", "Sport"], "article": "The world order in tennis continues to shift, ever so subtly. Since Stanislas Wawrinka beat a dispirited Novak Djokovic and a wounded Rafael Nadal to win his first slam title in Melbourne, the game&apos;s sans-culottes have been revolting. Andy Murray&apos;s slip to No7 in the world rankings on Monday \u2013 triggered by his defeat to then world No37 Marin Cilic in Rotterdam last week and Tomas Berdych&apos;s win over the Croatian in Sunday&apos;s final \u2013 pitches the British player just above Roger Federer, who will not be comfortable staying at No8 for too long. What does it mean? Not a lot. Yet. There is a long way to go in a season that runs from January to November, culminating in the gathering of the leading eight players at the ATP World Tour Finals in London, and it is likely the field will feature most of the familiar faces. However, there is insurrection in the air, prompted by Wawrinka&apos;s heroics at the Australian Open as well as encouraging performances since by talented young players who have yet to make a similar impact in the majors: Grigor Dimitrov, who took a set off Nadal in Melbourne and might have won had he held his nerve, Ernests Gulbis, who put out Dimitrov and Juan Mart\u00edn Del Potro in Rotterdam before losing to Berdych, Jerzy Janowicz (who has moved inside the top 20) and the gifted Cilic (up eight places to 29). Nadal, whose back collapsed when he was warming up for the final in Melbourne, is back in action in Rio de Janiero this week, but sounded cautious. &quot;I don&apos;t know for how long I&apos;m going to keep playing tennis competitively,&quot; he said. &quot;If I stop today at least I would have more than 11 years on Tour. That&apos;s a very long career. I cannot predict the future. The only thing I can say is today I feel happy about what I&apos;m doing, I feel with motivation mentally to keep playing, to keep competing well.&quot; The Spaniard sits safely at the top of the table with 14,085 points ahead of Djokovic (10,580), but has 10 titles to defend this year. There is then a fair gap to Wawrinka (5,620), David Ferrer (5,440), Del Potro (4,960) and Berdych (4,950). The greater concern lies outside the top six. It would be a brave gambler to bet on Murray (4,795) or Federer (4,305) missing the cut for London. However, while Federer has few points to defend after his worst season in a decade, Murray, who won four titles in 2013, is more vulnerable. A look at the early calender-year points table that determines who reaches Greenwich is worth watching closely over the next couple of months. Wawrinka, who squeezed into the finals in eighth place last year, heads the 2014 list with 2,290 points, followed by Nadal (1,450), Berdych (1,375), Federer (910), Ferrer (720), Cilic (660), Fabio Fognini (660), Kei Nishikori (600) then Murray in ninth place on 550 points ahead of Djokovic on 510. That order will be shuffled dramatically as the season unfolds but no one can afford to be complacent. Federer has pared his schedule back in recent years but needs some wins as insulation against the heat coming from outside the top 10. Federer&apos;s only appearance since losing to Nadal in the semi-finals in Melbourne was in the Davis Cup for Switzerland two weeks ago, and he returns to the tour in Dubai on 24 February. He has added Miami to his US commitments but misses Monte Carlo and Barcelona when the tour resumes in Europe. Murray moves next to Acapulco on 24 February, followed by an exhibition in New York, then hits the American hard courts in March, in Indian Wells and Miami, his second home. He reached the quarters in California last year, and beat David Ferrer in the Florida final, so there is points pressure there. When he returns to Europe for the clay season, there is a little slack in his schedule, as Wawrinka bundled him out in the third round in Monte Carlo last year, after which he reached the quarters in Madrid and had to quit mid-match against Marcel Granollers in the second round in Rome. Murray skipped the clay of Roland Garros and returned on grass with a vengeance, winning Queen&apos;s and Wimbledon before his ailing back forced him to resort to surgery after the US Open, where he failed to hold his title, and more draining clay in Umag, where he helped Great Britain to a stirring Davis Cup victory. He has won nine of 12 matches since his operation \u2013 just behind Nadal (11-1) and Djokovic (4-1) for the year \u2013 and is moving with noticeably greater freedom. He is hitting his forehand hard, serving well, looks to be stretching without discomfort on both wings and, generally, can be pleased with his recovery. What he needs are titles. For the first time in years, there is uncertainty in tennis. And that is no bad thing, for the game and for fans.", "title": "Andy Murray's slip to No7 in rankings reflects subtle shift in tennis | Kevin Mitchell", "sentences": ["Federer&apos;s only appearance since losing to Nadal in the semi-finals in Melbourne was in the Davis Cup for Switzerland two weeks ago, and he returns to the tour in Dubai on 24 February."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-17T15:13:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/feb/19/stephen-gallacher-dubai-desert-classic-ryder-cup", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport", "Tiger Woods", "US sports", "Tom Watson", "Ryder Cup", "Ernie Els"], "article": "Stephen Gallacher&apos;s second successive win at the Dubai Desert Classic was less about a \u20ac300,000 (\u00a3247,000) winner&apos;s cheque than the doors opened because of it. This week&apos;s WGC-Accenture Match Play Championship has unquestionably been blunted by the absence of Tiger Woods, Phil Mickelson and Adam Scott but for Gallacher there is ample opportunity to place down his latest Ryder Cup marker. The Scot&apos;s win in Dubai still left him well outside the qualifying places in the European points list and while considerably closer, also adrift in the world section in respect of Paul McGinley&apos;s team for September at Gleneagles. Gallacher, though, has no reason to lack hope and not just because of a personal message of encouragement from McGinley after victory at the Emirates club. Albeit seven months out from the meeting of Europe and the USA, the face of the home team has changed more than many onlookers could have predicted. Martin Kaymer, Peter Hanson, Paul Lawrie and Francesco Molinari have done little to suggest they can retain their places. The same applies to a struggling Lee Westwood, while Luke Donald is currently supplying evidence as to why swing changes in a player&apos;s mid-30s are not an altogether smart idea. With these factors in mind, there is obvious encouragement for Gallacher \u2013 and Jamie Donaldson \u2013 quite apart from the potential value of a local player at Gleneagles. Gallacher&apos;s Dubai win confirmed a place in all four of this season&apos;s majors and World Golf Championship events such as this week in Tucson. Gallacher has earned an invitation to the Honda Classic between the two WGC events and will participate in the Players Championship for the first time so long as he retains a place in the world&apos;s top 50. Not only do such tournaments offer a loftier platform to show off talent but the riches available can make a serious difference to Ryder Cup qualification hopes. In the specific context of this week Gallacher has the ideal opportunity to demonstrate his match-play talents and the putting improvement which has been pivotal to turning promise into tangible reward. The Ryder Cup so often comes down to a putting test. In round one Gallacher faces Ernie Els \u2013 who has been inconsistent after an equipment change \u2013 with the potential to meet Justin Rose at the next stage. Rose has made a belated start to 2014 after suffering an injury. Last year, in his only previous appearance at Dove Mountain, Gallacher suffered a first-round defeat to Ian Poulter. It was hardly a favourable draw. This time Gallacher has cause to tee up in fine Arizona spirits; in the sprint between now and the US Open in June he has nothing to lose and rather a lot to gain. Woods gears up for &apos;Florida swing&apos; ESPN&apos;s man Bob Harig further endorsed his status as the correspondent with the inside track on Tiger Woods with a specially arranged phone interview which addressed the world No1&apos;s worst start to a season in his professional career. Woods has spoken before about concerns over fatigue late in the season. He has also insisted that, if he keeps putting himself into contention for majors \u2013 which has actually occurred less frequently of late than Woods would have one believe \u2013 then an elusive 15th win will arrive. Now Woods has conceded that his three appearances in Florida prior to the Masters are with that broader challenge in mind. &quot;Once the Florida swing starts, we&apos;re all just building toward that one week in April,&quot; Woods said. &quot;We&apos;re all about building toward that. Don&apos;t finish dead last. And if you win, great.&quot; From such a ferocious competitor this was quite an admission. It is also merely the latest indicator that Woods is subtly altering his approach in an attempt to end a major drought which stretches back to 2008. USA&apos;s age concern Should the USA fail in their attempt to reclaim the Ryder Cup in September, the criticism of Tom Watson and his assistants seems somewhat pre-scripted. Watson, 64, has picked the 63-year-old Andy North and Raymond Floyd, who is 71, as vice-captains for the Gleneagles meeting. By the time the Ryder Cup starts, the trio will have a combined age of 201. To be fair to the USA, they were well within their rights to do something different to try to stem recent European domination of the event. Yet the danger is already clear; that Watson and his colleagues are too out of touch with their team members to have a positive impact. &quot;I don&apos;t think there is any credence to that at all,&quot; Watson argues. &quot;We bring all the street cred that we have to the Ryder Cup. We know how to win it. We have done it before.&quot; The clock is already running for Watson to grow audibly tired of age being mentioned as a key drawback to his appointment.

The idea for the powerful thriller, about a young Palestinian man who is pressured to collaborate with Israeli authorities, had been nagging at him ever since he began to suspect that someone on the set of his second feature film, 2005\u2019s Paradise Now, must have been a spy.  That much-acclaimed film, also Oscar-nominated, had a highly charged topic; it followed two young men who had decided to martyr themselves and enlisted to become suicide bombers. During the shoot, Abu-Assad felt as if he was constantly being watched. \u201cI was so paranoid that I registered myself in one room and slept in another,\u201d he said. After it was completed and played worldwide, Paradise Now earned Abu-Assad his first shot at Hollywood, directing 2012\u2019s The Courier, starring Mickey Rourke and Lili Taylor. But the threat of an informant remained in the back of his mind. When he wrapped up The Courier and realized that it had turned out to be \u201ca failure\u201d and was headed straight to video, Abu-Assad opened his computer and banged out the outline for Omar. \u201cI wrote the structure in one night,\u201d he said, before a screening of his new film at the New York Film Festival in October. \u201cI needed a rescue project,\u201d he added, laughing. That \u201crescue project\u201d gained him his second Oscar nomination for a Palestinian film, which is a feat. Palestinian films have proven to be a challenge to the Academy Awards committee, which has been baffled at which country to list the films under. In 2002, it refused to accept Elia Suleiman\u2019s Divine Intervention because entries must be nominated by their country of origin, and Palestine, the committee said, is not a nation.  In 2006, when Paradise Now was nominated, it was first filed under \u201cPalestinian Authority\u201d, creating much controversy. Abu-Assad, who like Suleiman, is an Israeli citizen, protested, resulting in a change to \u201cPalestinian Territories\u201d. This time around, without the director\u2019s intervention, the committee took a bold step by naming Omar\u2019s country of origin simply as \u201cPalestine\u201d.  Yet, Abu-Assad, while grateful that Palestine is being recognized as an independent entity, doesn\u2019t think it actually has much significance. \u201cTo be honest, it\u2019s not a big deal because Palestinians are still under occupation. As long as that\u2019s happening, it doesn\u2019t matter what you call it,\u201d he said recently, when he was back in New York to promote the release of Omar in the US. (The movie opened in New York on Friday, and a nationwide release is forthcoming.)  Even before it nabbed the Oscar nomination, Omar was selected for various international film festivals, including Cannes, where it won a special jury prize. Given the film\u2019s international success, not to mention the Oscar consideration, its two leading men, Adam Bakri and Waleed Zuaiter, can\u2019t help but be a little happy now that Abu-Assad\u2019s first American film bombed.  \u201cI am grateful for The Courier because that\u2019s why Hany woke up and wrote the film,\u201d Bakri, who is the son of renowned Palestinian actor Mohammed Bakri and the younger brother of rising talent Saleh Bakri, said before the screening at the New York Film Festival. He plays the role of Omar, a young Palestinian who scales the dividing wall slicing through one city, and is arrested by the Israeli authorities for participating in an attack against Israeli soldiers that kills one of the soldiers. After being tortured and then coerced to confess, he is given a tough choice: deliver up your compatriots on the mission \u2013 ie his friends, including the brother of his girlfriend Nadia \u2013 or rot in jail. The \u201cphenomenon\u201d, as Abu-Assad calls it, of collaborators like the one in Omar is one aspect of Palestinian society that is not openly discussed among Palestinians and yet suspicions within the community run deep. \u201cIn general, the Palestinian environment is very paranoid,\u201d the filmmaker said. \u201cIt\u2019s logic, you know. My parents raised me to be careful; anyone might work with a secret agent.\u201d In the film, the Israeli agent who tries to turn Omar \u2013 an affable, Tic Tac-bearing man named Rami \u2013 is played by Zuaiter, an American-Arab actor of Palestinian parents who has appeared in such films as The Men Who Stare at Goats alongside George Clooney and Jeff Bridges. \u201cIt was the fastest script I ever read,\u201d Zuaiter said. \u201cI called Hany and I said I love the role of Rami but I love even more the script. It\u2019s amazing.\u201d Zuaiter believed in the project with such intensity that he decided to take it upon himself to find funding for it. He secured a sum and he and Bakri, freshly graduated from the Lee Strasberg school of acting, headed to Nazareth to start filming (for New York-based Bakri, who grew up near Nazareth, it was being home again; for Zuaiter, who spent the ages of five to 18 in Kuwait and has been living in California for the past two decades, it was his first time in the country). Soon, though, a funder who had invested 25% of the budget for the film suddenly pulled out. The crew decided to keep working. \u201cI basically had to raise the money to supplement the money that fell out and I was doing that on Hany\u2019s rooftop in Nazareth where there is the best cell phone reception, with firecrackers and fire alarms going on,\u201d Zuaiter said. \u201cIt was fun.\u201d Abu-Assad, Bakri and Zuaiter, seated in a row on a leather couch at New York\u2019s Walter Reade Theater, all burst into laughter at the collective memory of the ordeal they shared. \u201cIf you look back to it, the amount of stress and sleepless nights, it\u2019s crazy,\u201d said Abu-Assad, who has, since the making of Omar, been recruited to direct the American version of Park Chan-Wook\u2019s Sympathy for Mr Vengeance. \u201cAnd the amount of persistence and fighting\u201d, Zuaiter added. \u201cLiterally, the whole crew was working in Hany\u2019s basement\u201d \u2013 which the director had turned into a production space \u2013 \u201cfor free for weeks. That\u2019s what gave me the strength. Sometimes, I was ashamed to go show my face downstairs because I was the money guy.\u201d With the help of his two brothers who work in finance, Zuaiter eventually managed to secure the $2m budget for the film. And in doing so, he achieved a coup: aside from the 5% that Enjaaz, the post-production fund of the Dubai International Film Festival, contributed, Omar is the first film entirely funded by Palestinians. \u201cAll the heads of the departments were Palestinians. Not all of them had experience but we all worked so hard to make a quality movie, and I think we proved we can do a high quality movie without the money or talent of the West,\u201d said Abu-Assad, who studied filmmaking in Holland and now lives full-time in Nazareth. \u201cIf I\u2019m proud of anything it\u2019s that this film was made by Palestinians with Palestinian money. I\u2019m really proud of that. The non-Palestinians had no influence on the artistic quality or the quality of the movie.\u201d  \u201cWe have to take ownership of our own talent,\u201d Zuaiter added. \u201cThis hopefully creates a movement so we are not reliant on whether it\u2019s government funds from Europe or Hollywood or anyone else. We should create our own industry. And like Hany said, we have the talent there.\u201d Bakri and Abu-Assad nodded in unison. \u201cIt was a challenge,\u201d Zuaiter continued. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have trailers. Adam had a chair he was sitting on for 41 days. So it\u2019s going to take time. But this is proof that we can do it.\u201d", "title": "Omar: the Palestinian Oscar nominee made amid panic and paranoia", "sentences": ["And in doing so, he achieved a coup: aside from the 5% that Enjaaz, the post-production fund of the Dubai International Film Festival, contributed, Omar is the first film entirely funded by Palestinians."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-22T17:53:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/feb/23/world-not-ours-palestinian-refugee-camp-documentary", "tags": ["A World Not Ours", "Documentary", "Film", "Culture", "Lebanon", "Palestinian territories", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news"], "article": "This very personal documentary is an intimate portrait of Ain el-Helweh, a Palestinian refugee camp in south Lebanon.

More than 2,000 voters have disappeared from five wards in Westminster in the past 12 years, according to electoral registration data published this week. The biggest fall has been in Knightsbridge and Belgravia, where there are now 11% fewer voters than in 2002. In the West End ward, which covers Mayfair and Soho, there are 498 fewer registered voters, a drop of 7%. There have been 5% falls in Abbey Road and Bayswater and a 4% fall in the area around Marylebone High Street. As only UK, European Union or Commonwealth citizens can register to vote, the registration data is being seen as evidence that investors from east Asia \u2013 especially China \u2013 Russia and central Asia are increasingly using London property as what the London mayor, Boris Johnson, calls &quot;gold bullion in the sky&quot;. The slump in voters in the five prime areas comes despite a substantial increase in the number of homes: between 2001 and 2011, 4,209 new dwellings were made available, according to census data. Yet the number of voters registered between 2002 and 2014 fell by 2,118. &quot;Many homes in Westminster are not lived in by families who are part of the local community, but are being used as just investments,&quot; said David Boothroyd, a Labour party Westminster councillor, who has analysed the figures. &quot;Super-prime new property in Westminster is sold in Hong Kong and Dubai, not London, and then left empty \u2013 to be sold a few years later at a profit.&quot; He said his experience on the council planning committee showed that &quot;almost all the applications are for very large units that are not going to be anything any British family could afford&quot;. A spokesman for the council said: &quot;There has been an increase in residents of varying nationalities across London, some of whom may not wish to vote and therefore do not register.&quot; The data comes as political concern grows about the so-called buy-to-leave phenomenon, which is thought to be driving up prices and locking UK citizens out of the housing market. Across the capital, there are 72,457 empty homes, of which 24,226 are classified as long-term empty, according to latest government figures. Labour has pledged to block foreign investors from buying new homes in Britain until local people have been offered first refusal. The Liberal Democrat communities minister, Stephen Williams, has announced a new empty-homes premium, which allows councils to remove the special tax subsidies being given to empty homes. And the free-market thinktank Civitas has proposed a ban on non-EU citizens buying existing homes. Paul Palmer, director of Empty Homes UK, who used to work for Westminster council, has estimated that there are at least 740 empty properties in London worth \u00a35m or more, the combined value of which would be enough to fund building more than 10,000 affordable homes. &quot;If you go there after dark, it is soulless,&quot; he said of the Westminster enclaves. &quot;You have empty shells kept open by security guards and a couple of security lights.

But it would be an exaggeration to describe Crisford as a casualty of the scandal, since it appears he will continue to be employed by Sheikh Mohammed in a role with a slightly grander title. He will now be &quot;global racing adviser&quot; to the ruler of Dubai, according to quotes attributed to Crisford on the Racing Post&apos;s website. &quot;Having dealt with the events of last year and seen the Lord Stevens inquiry through to its conclusion, I thought that this was a good moment to bring my time at Godolphin to a close,&quot; Crisford is reported as having said. &quot;I had felt for a while that I would like a fresh challenge. I think the time is right for a new start for the stable and for me. I am very much looking forward to what will be an exciting new chapter for me.&quot; Lord Stevens was commissioned by the Sheikh to examine his thoroughbred empire in the wake of Al-Zarooni&apos;s doping and two government raids last year that found unlicensed equine medication on property owned by the Sheikh in Britain. The report, published a fortnight ago, blamed &quot;management failings, insufficient oversight and a sense of complacency within the organisation&quot;. But no individuals were named or blamed in the public version of the report. However, Crisford had already shouldered some of the responsibility for the disaster that Al-Zarooni brought on Godolphin, saying of his recruitment: &quot;It&apos;s deeply regrettable and shows a remarkable lack of judgment on my part to recommend him to Sheikh Mohammed, which I did do.&quot; Crisford added that he could not be aware of &quot;every single bit of medication that every Godolphin horse is getting&quot;. Later, a Godolphin statement said that three vets had also resigned. It offered no detail on the reasons for their departure. Crisford, 51, has been Godolphin&apos;s manager since it was created as Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s racing team 20 years ago. The Godolphin website said his duties were &quot;similar to those of any chief executive of a major company&quot; and described him as &quot;responsible for the management of each horse&apos;s career&quot;.

Crisford&apos;s previous job was Newmarket correspondent for the Racing Post, which followed stints at the stables of John Dunlop and Sir Mark Prescott.

The former News of the World editor also told the court she did not know phone hacking was illegal until 2006 and conceded that she might have sanctioned it had there been justification, such as an investigation into paedophiles. However, she said this was a &quot;hypothetical&quot; and she never did sanction any voicemail hacking. Brooks said she was not aware that phone hacking was illegal when she was editor of the News of the World from 2000 to 2003. She said that, while editor, she was not aware of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which outlawed hacking in 2000 after a security flaw was exposed in the press. The first she became aware of the act was in 2006, she said, the year Mulcaire and the News of the World&apos;s royal editor Clive Goodman were arrested. She said she did not sanction hacking while she was editor, but added she might have done so if confronted with a hypothetical scenario such as an investigation into paedophiles where she &quot;may&quot; have authorised it. Brooks cited a journalist on another newspaper, which she did not name, who had written at the time how he had hacked someone&apos;s phone to prove something about an arms dealer. She told the court that she first knew that it was possible to access other people&apos;s voicemail because of a factory default setting in the late 1990s or early 2000s. Her counsel, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, asked her if she &quot;had ever sanctioned someone to access a voicemail as a technique,&quot; and she replied &quot;No&quot;. Brooks said there may have been circumstances where hacking might have been justifiable, but she would never have thought that was the case. &quot;I did not think it would have been a particular useful thing to do,&quot; she added. She said she would have thought hacking would have been a &quot;serious&quot; breach of privacy and she would not have condoned it. Brooks told the court she did not know anyone on the NoW had tasked Glenn Mulcaire to hack the murdered schoolgirl&apos;s phone in April 2002, weeks after she had gone missing. Laidlaw asked her if she had anything to do with the tasking of Mulcaire. &quot;No, I didn&apos;t,&quot; she told the jury. She responded &quot;No&quot; when asked if she was told about it afterwards in 2002. Asked when she first heard that Dowler&apos;s phone had been hacked she said: &quot;The moment when I first learned the News of the World had been responsible for accessing her voicemail was 4 July 2011 in the afternoon.&quot; That was the day the Guardian broke the story online, triggering a wave of revulsion around the country. Brooks told the court that she felt &quot;shock, horror&quot; when she learned of the hacking. She said it was &quot;abhorrent&quot; to hear that someone had deleted her voicemails and given her parents Bob and Milly Dowler &quot;false hope&quot; that she was still alive. Brooks said &quot;we now know&quot; that the claim that Dowler&apos;s voicemails were deleted was not true, but added: &quot;The essential fact that somebody from the News of the World asked someone to do that \u2013 my reaction would have been the same.&quot; She told the court she had &quot;no recollection of having any discussion&quot; about the Milly Dowler story that appeared in the NoW on 12 April 2002 which mentioned her voicemails. Brooks was on holiday with her then husband Ross Kemp in Dubai at the time and said she would have remembered if a big story concerning Dowler was being prepared by her deputy Andy Coulson who was at the helm at the time. &quot;I think I would remember if I had a call, if Andy had said to me &apos;we&apos;ve found Milly Dowler&apos;,&quot; she told the jury. She said she had &quot;didn&apos;t have any knowledge&quot; that the News of the World had told Surrey police that they had accessed the schoolgirl&apos;s voicemail. The jury has heard that Brooks had an on-off affair with Coulson but she said at the time they were not having a relationship. Asked how her relationship was with Kemp at the time, she responded: &quot;We were in a good place.&quot; Of Coulson, she said: &quot;Andy was always always a close friend.&quot; Questioned if there was any physical intimacy, she shook her head and replied &quot;No&quot;. Earlier in the trial the prosecution had said it could be inferred that she would have discussed the Dowler story because of their relationship, which was exposed after the police found a draft love letter on her computer when her home was searched after her arrest. The jury had previously also heard testimony from a member of the public, William Hennessy, who said he met Brooks in Dubai and claimed to have heard her saying she had to take a call about the &quot;missing Surrey schoolgirl&quot;. Brooks said she did not recall that. &quot;I don&apos;t remember meeting him or saying that but it is possible I did,&quot; she said. The court heard that the Dowler story was listed as the second item on the NoW&apos;s newslist the week she went missing, but although there were concerns that she may have been victim of a predatory paedophile, she was confident it was not a &quot;Sarah&apos;s Law&quot; scenario by the time she went to Dubai. She told the jury she often had to curtail or cancel holidays when there was a big story and recalled doing so when the two schoolgirls were murdered in Soham. The jury was shown a list of calls she made from Dubai back to the editor&apos;s desk including one 40-minute call in which she said she would have discussed &quot;what to say when the boss called&quot;.

Brooks told the phone-hacking trial that she would expect reporters to do &quot;the correct thing&quot; and contact police before informing their then editor. She was on holiday in Dubai with her then partner Ross Kemp at a crucial point in the search for the missing Surrey schoolgirl, the court heard. The jury was shown a schedule of telephone calls that showed Brooks, the then News of the World editor, was in regular contact with the Sunday tabloid&apos;s editors in London. Asked by her counsel Jonathan Laidlaw QC what she would have done if someone told her that the newspaper had a lead on Milly&apos;s whereabouts, Brooks said: &quot;I&apos;d tell the police.&quot; She added: &quot;I would assume they would tell the police before me. If they hadn&apos;t I would&apos;ve told them to do so. If they had a lead she was alive of they found her that would be the correct thing to do. &quot;If the reporter or anyone had come across a lead that Milly Dowler was alive and well then the parents, you would want to tell them immediately, not directly but through the police. That would&apos;ve been the right thing to do.&quot; The News of the World had published several stories on Dowler&apos;s disappearance by 14 April when it mentioned voice messages in a story. The jury has previously heard that the paper took a close interest in her whereabouts after hacking into her phone and hearing a message mistakenly left by a recruitment company in Telford asking if she was available for work. The paper sent a team to Telford in the belief that they would find her at the Epson computer factory. At that point Dowler was already dead and the paper had had discussions with Surrey police about the voicemail message. They printed a story that Sunday, 14 April, claiming the investigation may have been left a message by a hoaxer. Later, Brooks said she played no part in changes between newspaper editions to a story about Milly&apos;s disappearance. The jury heard that a reference to a voicemail in the story, headed &quot;Milly hoax hiddle&quot;, was removed by the third edition but included in the first and second editions of the paper. The story was also moved back in the newspaper, from page 9 to page 30. Asked whether she had a role in the changes to the story, Brooks said: &quot;No&quot;. Then asked whether she had a part to play in moving the story back in the paper, she answered: &quot;No, Earlier in the trial the jury heard how Dowler&apos;s phone was hacked weeks after she went missing. NoW documents show the costs for the &quot;Missing Milly&quot; story listed as \u00a32,000 under a contingency fund. Brooks said she had never seen that document. In Tuesday morning&apos;s evidence, Brooks told the court that she did not know Dowler&apos;s phone had been hacked until July 2011. The former News of the World editor also told the court she did not know phone hacking was illegal until 2006 and conceded that she might have sanctioned it had there been justification, such as an investigation into paedophiles. However, she said this was a &quot;hypothetical&quot; and she never did sanction any voicemail hacking.

Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s racing operation issued the statement after news broke that Simon Crisford was to leave his long-standing role as the racing manager. Crisford&apos;s departure, for a newly created post in the Sheikh&apos;s employ, made headlines but much less has been made of the departure of the vets. Godolphin no longer have an appointed spokesperson and Crisford&apos;s post no longer exists. Hugh Anderson has been appointed managing director but was not available for comment on Tuesday. Those answering phones at Godolphin&apos;s Newmarket office said their instructions were that nothing more would be said on the subject of Monday&apos;s news. A press officer at the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons said it had no position on the matter and noted that Godolphin&apos;s statement did not address the question of whether the vets concerned worked in Britain, Dubai or elsewhere. If they worked in Britain, they would be required by law to register with the RCVS before being allowed to practise and one report last year expressed concern that not all of Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s vets may be complying with this requirement, but no vets were named. The vets&apos; departure follows a fortnight after publication of the Lord Stevens report on Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s various equine interests in Britain. Sheikh Mohammed hired Stevens to investigate his organisation in the wake of last year&apos;s steroids scandal, when the Godolphin trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni was banned from the sport for eight years for doping horses in his care. Separately, two government raids found unlicensed equine medication on the Sheikh&apos;s property. Stevens blamed &quot;management failings, insufficient oversight and a sense of complacency&quot; for the fact that the Sheikh&apos;s organisation was exposed to those embarrassments. Stevens added that &quot;the persons responsible failed to take steps to strictly adhere to UK regulations regarding the transport of veterinary medicinal products&quot;. In relation to Al-Zarooni, Stevens insisted he was a rogue trainer who had acted alone.

On her fourth day in the witness box, Brooks also said that during her editorship of the News of the World, she had not realised it was illegal to intercept voicemail. She had never sanctioned it, she said. &quot;I can&apos;t see that it would have been a particularly useful thing to do,&quot; she added. The jury in the phone-hacking trial has heard that Milly Dowler vanished on the afternoon of Thursday 21 March 2002 and that on Wednesday 10 April the then news editor of the News of the World, Neville Thurlbeck, commissioned the paper&apos;s specialist phone-hacker, Glenn Mulcaire, to access her phone messages. Brooks&apos;s barrister, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, asked her: &quot;Did you have anything to do with Neville Thurlbeck&apos;s tasking of Glenn Mulcaire and his accessing of Milly Dowler&apos;s voicemail?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; she replied. &quot;Did you at the time know anything about that, before it happened?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;After it happened?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; The jury has heard that Mulcaire intercepted a message that appeared to reveal that the missing Surrey schoolgirl had been offered a job interview at a factory in Telford, Shropshire and that, without informing the police who were searching for her, Thurlbeck had sent a team of reporters to Telford to try to find her. Brooks, who was on holiday in Dubai at the time, said she had stayed in contact with the paper which was edited in her absence by her deputy, Andy Coulson. But she told the court she could not recall having discussed the missing girl that week: &quot;I think I would remember if Andy or whoever on the paper had said: &apos;We&apos;ve found Milly Dowler&apos;\u00a0\u2026 I don&apos;t remember having any discussions about her disappearance while I was away.&quot; She said that if she had heard about the Telford story, she would have told her staff to contact police. &quot;It&apos;s the parents.

She said: &quot;I don&apos;t particularly remember saying that. I don&apos;t actually remember meeting Mr Hennessy that clearly\u00a0\u2026 Being forced to remember something so far ago, you do try and remember the details but I just don&apos;t particularly remember meeting him or saying that, but it&apos;s possible that I did.&quot; Brooks said she had not seen the early editions of the News of the World on Sunday 14 April, which quoted several voicemail messages from the missing girl&apos;s phone. She said she had seen only a later edition, in which the story had been cut down. During the following week, she said, she had not been aware that her managing editor, Stuart Kuttner, sent an email to Surrey police in which, the court has heard, he challenged them to confirm that Milly Dowler had been offered a job in Telford and quoted a voicemail from her phone.Earlier, Brooks told the jury that in the late 1990s she had heard that it was possible to access other people&apos;s voicemail. &quot;There was certainly some publicity about it, about the flaw in the system.&quot; Looking back, she could not see how it would have helped the News of the World on any of the big campaigns or stories they had run under her editorship, she said, although it might have helped other departments with &quot;celebrity tittle tattle.&quot; &quot;No one \u2013 no desk head, no journalist \u2013 ever came to me and said &apos;We are working on such and such story but we need to access voicemail; or asked for me to sanction it.&apos;&quot; She said she had not realised that it would have been a breach of the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act.

Keen to impress his guests, the manager picked one up. After a lifetime in the trade, Osama Kaloti suggested he could tell the provenance and purity of each bar simply by its look and weight. This one was silver. Or so it seemed. Kaloti insisted the metal in his hand was gold. To prove his point, he scraped away the outer coating, revealing the yellow treasure beneath. There were about six bars in the stack, which might have weighed about 75kg in total. If gold, at today&apos;s prices, they would be worth $3.2m. If silver, the same size bars would be valued at less than $30,000. The inspectors, from Ernst &amp; Young Dubai, had been hired to audit Osama&apos;s family business Kaloti Group, Dubai&apos;s largest gold refinery, a process designed to assure important international customers that the company was doing all in its power to avoid conflict gold. Processing some 300 tonnes a year, Kaloti claims to account for close to half of all refining in Dubai&apos;s gold market. Regulators claim gold trading in the emirate reached $70bn in 2012, up 25% on the previous year. &quot;Dubai is emerging as a gold bullion centre to rival London, Shanghai and others,&quot; Osama&apos;s father, Munir Kaloti, who founded the business, explained to the Middle East Economic Digest in April last year. &quot;Dubai now accounts for approximately 25% of the world&apos;s annual gold trade. The principal challenge [our] company faces is ensuring the responsible sourcing of gold \u2026 Our safeguard measures are beyond the minimum set out by trade associations and government bodies.&quot; But back in the souk office, only the previous month, E&amp;Y inspectors could hardly believe what Osama was telling them. According to their minutes: &quot;He took a scanner and showed that the gold content was more than 85% and these bars are \u2026 from a Moroccan supplier. He said that it&apos;s normal to receive silver coated gold bars especially from Morocco due to the gold export limits imposed by the Moroccan customs.&quot;     Gold trading in Dubai is said to have reached $70bn in 2012. Photograph: Karim Sahib/AFP/Getty Images    It also emerged the Moroccan suppliers had brought the shipment in by hand and were paid in cash at Kaloti&apos;s office in the souk. The shipment had left North Africa incorrectly labelled silver, and was properly accepted at Dubai airport customs as gold. It sounded like a smuggling scam. Further investigations found about four tonnes of gold, hidden beneath silver plating, may have come to Kaloti in a similar manner from several suppliers in Morocco. At today&apos;s prices, which are lower than those of 2012, four tonnes of gold is worth more than $170m. After being melted down, the bars would eventually emerge from the refinery as newly minted bullion, of 99.5% purity or greater, destined for the international gold market and stamped with a serial number and the words &quot;Kaloti, Dubai&quot;. Following the E&amp;Y inspection, Kaloti expected to be able to claim that its gold bars had been independently verified as conflict-free and responsibly sourced. But the inspectors were rapidly taking a very different view. They were shocked by refinery admissions that it accepted gold which had probably been smuggled. This was to be just one of the failings they stumbled over but it was enough, they thought, to mean the refinery had already effectively failed its inspection and would receive from E&amp;Y the worst available score for the review period, covering the last seven months of 2012: &quot;Breach of review protocol and zero tolerance&quot;.\u00a0 Serious  This score is reserved for the most serious lapses \u2013 such as refineries withholding information from reviewers, using unethical means to influence them, knowingly taking conflict gold, or taking gold from suppliers they know to have used falsified or misrepresented paperwork.\u00a0 Such a conclusion could even have resulted in the Dubai authorities stripping Kaloti of certification needed to trade easily with international customers. The damage to Dubai&apos;s reputation as a gold market would be huge. Of the gold seemingly smuggled from Morocco, E&amp;Y inspectors initially recorded in confidential reports that there had been &quot;misrepresentation and falsification of documentation by the ... supplier with the knowledge and acceptance of [Kaloti].&quot; There were other serious shortcomings. Kaloti records showed more than 1,000 transactions with customers walking into the group&apos;s office in the souk, off the street, without having to provide paperwork and being paid cash for gold. A total of 2.4 tonnes was accept this way, with company records showing simply &quot;call customer&quot;. The average amount received from these walk-in customers was 2.25kg, but once gold weighing 35kg \u2014 the average weight of a 10-year-old boy in the UK \u2014 was exchanged for cash from a walk-in customer whose identity was unrecorded. Today this amount of gold would be worth about \u00a3850,000. And these cash deals were just a small fraction of Kaloti transactions taking place outside the banking system. &quot;EY team observed large quantities of cash in the vault,&quot; minutes of the inspectors&apos; visit to the gold souk office recorded. &quot;Kaloti team explained that about 40% of the transaction value in Kaloti was carried out in cash in the Gold Souk office.&quot; E&amp;Y&apos;s eventual finding was that the refinery group&apos;s cash-for-gold deals in 2012 amounted to $5.2bn, compared to $6.6bn of transactions involving conventional bank transfers. If the office opened for business all year round that would still be equivalent to more than $14m a day being paid out to customers in cash.\u00a0 Kaloti told the inspectors clients sometimes preferred cash as payment via a bank transfer involved a charge of 1,000 dirhams (\u00a3163). It later added that cash deals had &quot;historically been the typical modus operandi in Dubai&apos;s cosmopolitan wholesale gold market&quot;. Again the E&amp;Y inspectors were troubled. Kaloti had declared itself signed up to international guidelines recommending all gold firms should &quot;avoid cash purchases where possible, and ensure that all unavoidable cash purchases are supported by verifiable documentation&quot;.\u00a0 Elsewhere, inspectors also found evidence of Kaloti transactions with suppliers from Sudan, a country linked to conflict gold in the past. Instead of showing heightened vigilance, Kaloti staff were happy to offer cash-in-hand in exchange for gold hand-delivered and originating from artisanal, small-scale mines (ASMs). Inspectors found Kaloti had no record of mining licences for the shipments, ensuring any audit trail to the source was lost. ASMs are low-tech, labour-intensive mining operations, highly vulnerable to extortion by armed groups. E&amp;Y inspectors diligently recorded each of the failures. Less than three months into their work, the list had become so concerning that they discreetly contacted the regulator, warning the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre (DMCC) of impending embarrassment. The response was a surprising one. One DMCC email inquired: &quot;We would like to understand that if we change the review period to Jan-March 2013 ... would there be a material difference that will impact the rating positively?&quot; This was the first indication that led some at E&amp;Y to believe the Dubai authorities were prepared to tinker with their own rules if the result spared the blushes of important players in the Dubai gold industry \u2013 an inference the DMCC says was unfounded. One internal E&amp;Y email revealed concern that Amjad Rihan, the partner in charge of the inspection team, was &quot;getting some heat from the regulator who is keen to promote the Dubai gold industry on the global stage&quot;. Unrealistic It added: &quot;They have unrealistic expectations of their industry&apos;s level of compliance, which have repeatedly been communicated to them, and there is an undercurrent of them looking to use EY&apos;s brand for their advantage, which of course is being managed.&quot; In a statement to the Guardian, the regulator said: &quot;The DMCC strongly refutes any allegation that it pressured EY, that it sought to influence or interfere with the review process or that it softened the review process to favour any member refinery.&quot; Establishing the DMCC 12 years ago, Dubai&apos;s ruler Sheikh Mohammed, said: &quot;The world&apos;s gold production is about 2,300-2,400 tonnes. Our main objective is to achieve half of the world production in the next few years. We have the will and the determination.&quot;\u00a0 While Dubai&apos;s wider economic fortunes faltered in 2009, the DMCC thrived, benefiting from a surging gold price and heavy demand from India and China, the emerging economic engines of global growth. In typical Dubai style, last year DMCC chairman Ahmed bin Sulayem celebrated this success by announcing the regulator had commissioned the Burj 2020, the world&apos;s tallest commercial tower, to be built for Dubai&apos;s hosting of the World Expo in six years&apos; time. Meanwhile, Dubai&apos;s largest refinery group Kaloti in December broke ground on what it says will be the world&apos;s largest gold refinery, a new $60m plant with capacity to refine as much as 1,400 tonnes of gold a year. &quot;The construction of our new refinery is part of the company&apos;s overall strategy to expand its capacity up to 2,000 tonnes,&quot; said Munir Kaloti. In the end, the DMCC did not elect to alter the inspection period for Kaloti. Instead, between May and June last year, the regulator came up with another, less conspicuous, tweak to the rulebook. It removed a recommendation that the overall verdict of inspectors be recorded in public documents, instead ordering that any such reference must henceforth be kept confidential. At the time DMCC maintained, as it does now, these rule changes were being introduced &quot;to be consistent with similar global accepted guidance manuals&quot; \u2013 a claim verified by London consultancy firm SGS in a detailed report. Other gold regulators around the world were also fine-tuning rules at this time as they too assimilated international standards drawn up by the OECD. Nevertheless the DMCC&apos;s alteration \u2013 which was not to be the last occasion the regulator tinkered with the rules \u2013 greatly concerned senior partners at E&amp;Y Dubai, particularly Rihan, who led the division involved out the Kaloti audit.\u00a0 Behind the scenes he and senior executives at E&amp;Y Dubai contacted the audit group&apos;s global office in London asking for urgent advice on how best to treat the damaging findings in refinery inspection reports. &quot;The issue of conflict minerals is both delicate and critical for our business in Dubai and, indeed, the region,&quot; said one email to E&amp;Y&apos;s global head of climate change and sustainability Juan Costa Climent, a former Spanish finance minister. &quot;We need to take a position urgently and we need the global firm to be fully aware of the facts and the issues \u2026 I am sorry to press you on the matter but it is both serious and critical.&quot; Within two weeks the issue had been further escalated to Mark Otty, E&amp;Y&apos;s London-based managing partner for Europe, Middle East, India and Africa, who assembled a team of senior figures to deal with the matter, also calling in law firm Linklaters to provide outside advice.\u00a0 &quot;We are taking this issue very seriously,&quot; Otty wrote in one of a number of emails on the subject. &quot;I have taken the lead in relation to our investigation of it.&quot; Meanwhile, in Dubai, it became increasingly clear that Kaloti did not see the problem. The refinery group began drafting an official summary of E&amp;Y&apos;s inspection \u2013 a document it believed would become the only publicly available report. Not only did it make no reference to the inspectors&apos; overall conclusion, in accordance with the DMCC&apos;s new rules, but it also contained scant mention of many serious failings found by the independent review team. This was too much for E&amp;Y, which responded by indicating it would not be able to sign off on such a whitewash report as accurate. After Kaloti received a quiet word from the DMCC, however, it began to work more collaboratively with E&amp;Y towards a formula of words acceptable to both. Kaloti hired Jeff Rhodes, one of the most experienced executives in the Dubai gold industry who served on DMCC committees, to deal with the matter. By now Rihan, a 39-year-old partner at E&amp;Y, had stepped back from the project, remaining deeply uncomfortable.\u00a0 The work progressed without him, with both sides exchanging and refining drafts of what both inspectors and refinery staff believed would eventually be published as the official summary of the troublesome inspection. Leaked draft filings, attached in these email exchanges, show the extent to which E&amp;Y actively advised Kaloti how best to describe its shortcomings publicly.\u00a0 At one stage the audit firm recommended edits which removed reference to &quot;bars coated with silver&quot;, replacing the words with a more generic reference to &quot;an incident in which there were certain documentary irregularities&quot;. It was a formula Kaloti was quick to adopt. At a stroke, any suggestion of smuggling was replaced with a more anodyne phrase hinting at what may just have been a clerical error. Contacted by the Guardian, E&amp;Y was unable to answer several detailed questions because it was under a duty of confidentiality to Kaloti, but said: &quot;EY Dubai refutes entirely the suggestion that we did anything but highly professional work in relation to our engagement with Kaloti.&quot; It added that any failings discovered were fully reported to the DMCC. Meanwhile, the Guardian understands it is commonplace for audit firms to use their technical expertise to advise clients on the appropriate wording to be used in official reports. On 8 September last year official filings were submitted to DMCC, their language carefully polished and signed off by EY and by three managing directors at Kaloti. The phrase &quot;breach of review protocol \u2013 zero tolerance&quot; did appear in paperwork expected to be made public, but there was no indication it was also the inspectors&apos; final conclusion. Colleagues at E&amp;Y told Rihan they regarded it a successful outcome. Otty urged him to look on the bright side. &quot;The situation has changed dramatically \u2026 In particular, we have a team in Dubai who have worked very hard to get us to the point that both client and regulator will report deficiencies,&quot; he emailed. &quot;On this basis I suggest that we \u2026 achieve all that you were focused on \u2013 and more.&quot; Joe Murphy, E&amp;Y Dubai managing partner, also suggested Rihan should no longer have cause for concern. &quot;Each of these clients has now issued a compliance report which satisfactorily takes into account the elements of non-compliance,&quot; he emailed. &quot;We can now expect that DMCC will publish the compliance report \u2026 There is now no tension or concern about reporting.&quot; Murphy may not have know it, but, in truth, tensions had not vanished. Kaloti was fuming. It felt it had been rushed into the regulatory submission. The company had understood that the controversial shipments from Morocco were going to be rated only as &quot;non-compliant, high risk&quot;, but were told the rating would be &quot;breach of protocol and zero tolerance&quot; just days before the submission deadline. Despite being convinced E&amp;Y was wrong, three top Kaloti executives, signed the compliance report \u2014 even though the refinery believed it to be incorrect \u2014 and cleared the audit firm to submit it to the DMCC. Kaloti say this was done reluctantly, and only to meet a regulatory deadline. According to the DMCC, queries over the findings in the submitted Kaloti report were first raised with it by E&amp;Y, at the request of the refinery group.\u00a0 If it was unusual for a firm like E&amp;Y to be querying its own regulatory filings after they had been submitted, the move seemed doubly odd given that Otty and other senior figures at E&amp;Y&apos;s global head office in London had earlier spent considerable time wrestling over how best to treat the Morocco finding with the help of Linklaters. EY Dubai had concluded Kaloti&apos;s actions merited a rating of &quot;breach of review protocol and zero tolerance&quot;. Now, however, they were no longer so sure. In response the DMCC contacted E&amp;Y giving its opinion of inspectors&apos; assessment. That led the audit firm re reconsider its own view and ultimately to recall its 8 September submission. A new set of filings were entered one month later, this time with controversial dealings with Moroccan suppliers downgraded to &quot;High risk, non-compliance&quot;.\u00a0\u00a0 The exact reason for the reclassification is unclear, but confidential paperwork shows that it remained uncontested that Kaloti had told inspectors &quot;gold plated with silver was exported as silver in Morocco however the same is declared as gold at Dubai customs&quot;. Again, the regulator rejected any allegation that it pressured E&amp;Y or in any other way acted improperly. E&amp;Y said it &quot;refutes entirely the suggestion that we did anything but highly professional work.&quot; The unusual circumstances in which the regulatory filings had been retracted was not the end of the matter. Less than three weeks later, the DMCC would change the inspection reporting rules once again, this time in a way that meant Kaloti&apos;s second compliance report, with the downgraded finding, would never be made public. It was a move that surprised some at E&amp;Y. As the weeks had passed, without the anticipated publication, members of the inspection team became increasingly puzzled why no reports had been made public. By this time they were completing a brief follow-up inspection to verify Kaloti had put in place remedial action, and that failings earlier identified by E&amp;Y had not reoccurred. As part of this process they noted that the failure to publish a compliance report once again put Kaloti on track for further public criticisms. DMCC guidance required refiners to &quot;publicly report ... to generate public confidence [in the inspection process]&quot;. In internal memos E&amp;Y inspectors wrote: &quot;The refiner has not publicly reported ... This disclosure needs to be made prior to issuance of the follow-up review report.&quot; Such an omission, E&amp;Y reviewers believed, was another &quot;Non-compliance: High Risk&quot; failing. What they had not counted on, however, was the DMCC&apos;s willingness once again to bend its own inspection rules. This time, without advertising the changes on its website, the regulator quietly changed the public reporting standards, introducing the new concept of a &quot;consolidated compliance report&quot;. This removed any requirement for a refiner to publish a compliance report with embarrassing findings \u2014 so long as it later carried out a short follow-up review. The review and initial audit period would then be summerised in a single published report. These discreet changes led E&amp;Y to advise Kaloti that the refiner was no longer required to publish a separate compliance report covering the earlier inspection. The DMCC consulted with EY before introducing this change, and it said the audit firm confirmed such a move would not compromise the integrity of the ongoing review and publication process. In confidential papers, E&amp;Y noted that the DMCC rules had been &quot;amended&quot; in November 2013. In documents to be made public, however, E&amp;Y was circumspect. It said it had tested Kaloti compliance against DMCC rules &quot;in issuance as at the date of this report&quot;. In one internal email, a sharp-eyed E&amp;Y inspector noted that a date and version number were missing on the regulator&apos;s new rules. When, last December \u2013 and six months later than planned \u2013 Kaloti for the first time made public its official summary of the troublesome E&amp;Y inspection, this eleventh-hour DMCC rule change was not mentioned. Also hard to discern in this, the only publicly available summary of E&amp;Y&apos;s inspection, were full details of the shortcomings at Kaloti, between June and December 2012. In the publicly released consolidated report Kaloti stressed that by the end of the period it was &quot;fully compliant&quot; with all DMCC responsible gold sourcing standards. There was no mention of &quot;breach of protocol and zero tolerance&quot; or even &quot;non-compliance, high risk&quot; in the report.\u00a0The report did refer briefly to some past imperfections, labelling them &quot;deviations&quot;. Referencing dealings with gold seemingly smuggled from Morocco, it said: &quot;There was lack of documentation in identifying risk in the supply chain for a small number of transactions although they were in accordance with Dubai Customs import regulations&quot;. That Kaloti routinely offered cash-for-gold is stated clearly, though there is no indication that the sums involved ran into billions of dollars. &quot;During the initial review period we had deviations ... in which [Kaloti] did not identify risks in cash settlement transactions which was the typical modus operandi in the Dubai wholesale market.&quot; There is no suggestion any descriptions in the Kaloti report, signed off as &quot;fair&quot; by E&amp;Y, were out of line with regulatory rules or industry practice. In any event, whatever these elliptically described historic lapses had been, Kaloti&apos;s consolidated report said they had been firmly rectified. Kaloti said: &quot;The final findings of the consolidated report were published in accordance with the requirements of the regulator, and were consistent with global best practices and industry norms of compliance reporting.&quot; Meanwhile, after months trying to persuade senior colleagues in Dubai, and at E&amp;Y&apos;s London office, that clear details of failures should appear in Kaloti&apos;s published report, Rihan decided to take the full findings, to the Guardian. He had become increasingly isolated at E&amp;Y and senior figures were growing impatient at his meddlesome interventions. &quot;It is the firm&apos;s view ... a satisfactory position was reached with regard to the client engagements and with the DMCC,&quot; wrote Murphy. &quot;We respect, but do not agree with, your views as to how issues with one specific client [Kaloti] require to be presented both to the DMCC and more broadly,&quot; wrote one of E&amp;Y&apos;s top lawyers in London, claiming Rihan&apos;s position was at odds with &quot;internal and external experts&quot;. When independent lawyers for Rihan wrote to E&amp;Y formally urging for the audit firm to ensure the complete picture of inspection findings be revealed, the response was a sharp one from lawyers at Linklaters. &quot;The position is that EY Dubai agreed to carry out certain assurance work for clients [including Kaloti]. Pursuant to the terms of those engagements, EY Dubai was required, both as a matter of contract ... and as a matter of compliance with the regulatory regime under which it operated, to apply the DMCC guidelines as in force from time to time. &quot;EY Dubai has done so and delivered the required reports to its clients and to the DMCC setting out the findings made in the course of the work that it undertook. &quot;EY Dubai has therefore discharged its obligations ...

Near the Rwandan border, Goma has been a bloody flashpoint in regional fighting stretching back to the 1990s, involving well-armed militia groups. The sole passenger was a Pakistani national called Tariq Malik. He had come to buy a large quantity of gold for a bargain price of $2m (\u00a31.2m). According to a report by United Nations experts on the DRC released in December 2011, Malik had arrived to do business with Bosco Ntaganda, a former army general turned rebel leader known to many as the Terminator. Ntaganda (below) had flip-flopped between pro- and anti-government forces for years, each time taking with him hundreds of loyal and well-armed soldiers. By 2010, he was installed in Goma and reputed to be living in some comfort, playing tennis and indulging a passion for fine French wines. Part of the DRC border with Rwanda was said to be under Ntaganda&apos;s control \u2013 and regularly used to smuggle out gold and other minerals. The rebel leader&apos;s routine seemed undisturbed by a war crimes indictment issued by the International Criminal Court in 2006 alleging he recruited child soldiers. Additional ICC charges accused Ntaganda of murder, rape and sexual slavery, ethnic persecution, pillaging and deliberate attacks against civilians in 2001 and 2002. That was not enough to deter Malik, however, who UN experts believe had come to do business on behalf of Dubai firm Black Pearl Capital. Flight records show he had travelled several times to Goma before, while gold smuggling informants said he was also well known to traders in nearby Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania. After gathering sufficient intelligence on Malik&apos;s movements, UN experts followed his trail back to Dubai. The trip, however, proved fruitless. They found only a locked door bearing Black Pearl&apos;s logo. Repeated telephone calls to the company went unanswered.     The Dubai gold market is one of busiest jewellery markets in the Middle East.  Photograph Jon Hicks/Corbis    Malik&apos;s big deal with Ntaganda had ultimately been aborted, amid concerns the gold may have been counterfeit. More recently, after a falling out with fellow rebel leaders, Ntaganda&apos;s power base \u2013 for years bankrolled by extorting mines in the region \u2013 began to weaken. Last March, he surrendered to international authorities and he is shortly to face trial in The Hague. But the Black Pearl episode points to what the UN experts are convinced is the most frequent destination for gold leaving the hands of armed groups in the DRC: Dubai. Most illegal shipments of gold are thought to travel not quite so directly to the Gulf, flowing instead through neighbouring states before arriving in the Persian Gulf. From Uganda alone, in 2012 three tonnes of fraudulently traded DRC gold was identified as being laundered into the legal supply chain in Dubai, according to UN analysis. In the United Arab Emirates, UN experts spoke to representatives from two leading refineries, including Kaloti in September 2012. They said they were told the refiners refused to source directly from the Great Lakes region of Africa and refused scrap gold with impurities associated with mined gold. Concern about gold arriving in Dubai has focused on unregulated gold souks rather then Dubai&apos;s accredited refinery groups, where gold is transformed into trade bullion, bound for central banks, jewellery houses and smart phone manufacturers around the world. Last year the M23 rebel movement, to which Ntaganda had been linked, suffered heavy military defeats. Many other armed groups \u2014 domestic and foreign \u2014 remain active. DRC and UN troops continue the battle against these destabilising forces as well as looking to weed out corrupt elements within Congolese authorities. &quot;All armed groups, whether Congolese or foreign, have engaged in the illegal exploitation of the vast mineral ... resources of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo, as well as other criminal activities,&quot; said a UN special report on peacekeeping efforts. &quot;For those groups, the benefits derived from the illegal exploitation of those resources not only finance their acquisition of illicit weapons, but have also become an end in themselves.&quot;Dubai and other refining hubs around the world have been rushing to adopt the standards on responsible sourcing set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ahead of US regulations which, from May this year, require all companies listed on US stock exchanges to show that gold and other precious minerals in their products have no links to conflict mines in the DRC. While the US rules \u2014 part of the wide-ranging Dodd-Frank Act \u2014 will apply to gold users such as banks, microprocessor manufacturers and jewellery retailers, many of the 4,500 American firms likely to be affected are expected to rely heavily on gold refinery inspection reports carried out under the auspices of the London Bullion Markets Association and the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre.", "title": "UN experts track Dubai gold trading activity in conflict-torn DRC", "sentences": ["     Just over three years ago, a Hawker 4000 jet travelling from Dubai touched down in Goma, in the Democratic Republic of Congo.", "That was not enough to deter Malik, however, who UN experts believe had come to do business on behalf of Dubai firm Black Pearl Capital.", "After gathering sufficient intelligence on Malik&apos;s movements, UN experts followed his trail back to Dubai.", "The Dubai gold market is one of busiest jewellery markets in the Middle East.", "But the Black Pearl episode points to what the UN experts are convinced is the most frequent destination for gold leaving the hands of armed groups in the DRC: Dubai.", "From Uganda alone, in 2012 three tonnes of fraudulently traded DRC gold was identified as being laundered into the legal supply chain in Dubai, according to UN analysis.", "Concern about gold arriving in Dubai has focused on unregulated gold souks rather then Dubai&apos;s accredited refinery groups, where gold is transformed into trade bullion, bound for central banks, jewellery houses and smart phone manufacturers around the world.", "&quot;For those groups, the benefits derived from the illegal exploitation of those resources not only finance their acquisition of illicit weapons, but have also become an end in themselves.&quot;Dubai and other refining hubs around the world have been rushing to adopt the standards on responsible sourcing set by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development ahead of US regulations which, from May this year, require all companies listed on US stock exchanges to show that gold and other precious minerals in their products have no links to conflict mines in the DRC.", "While the US rules \u2014 part of the wide-ranging Dodd-Frank Act \u2014 will apply to gold users such as banks, microprocessor manufacturers and jewellery retailers, many of the 4,500 American firms likely to be affected are expected to rely heavily on gold refinery inspection reports carried out under the auspices of the London Bullion Markets Association and the Dubai Multi Commodities Centre."], "publicationDate": "2014-02-25T21:54:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/feb/25/conflict-gold-global-market-trading-kaloti", "tags": ["Gold", "Commodities", "Business", "World news", "Dubai", "Africa", "EY"], "article": "     Hundreds of millions of dollars worth of suspect gold has poured into the global markets as major breaches occurred in new international rules designed to tackle an underground trade linked to African warlords and human rights abuses. Confidential papers shown to the Guardian by a whistleblower detail how, in 2012, one of the world&apos;s biggest gold refineries ignored guidelines designed to stop the trade in so-called conflict gold. It paid more than $5bn (\u00a33bn) in cash for the metal and accepted gold from more than 1,000 customers who walked in off the street with no paperwork. While there is no evidence that the refinery accepted conflict gold, major breaches in new guidelines were uncovered, raising concern about the history of huge volumes of shipments. Details of the damning findings have not been spelled out in full in public documents, but have been uncovered in a Guardian investigation. The leaked papers are also being reported by BBC2&apos;s Newsnight, al-Jazeera and the campaign group Global Witness. Allegations that the full scandal has not been laid bare are a huge setback to international efforts \u2013 championed by Barack Obama, the UN, the EU and campaign groups \u2013 to stamp out the illicit trade in conflict gold by requiring the world&apos;s largest refineries to be independently audited to check that they are sourcing gold responsibly and publishing the findings. Full details of the findings are set out in confidential inspection reports from Ernst &amp; Young, which was brought in to review the practices of the Kaloti Group, a $12bn refining and trading business based in Dubai. Kaloti owns the largest refinery in the Middle East and is at the centre of Dubai&apos;s booming gold industry, estimated to be worth $70bn in 2012. Documents show the group systematically flouted new rules on conflict gold. The UN has been pushing for tough international guidelines covering the trade in gold and other &quot;conflict minerals&quot; because of mounting evidence linking extortion at hundreds of mines in the Democratic Republic of Congo to armed groups involved in war crimes. The UN&apos;s largest peacekeeping force is deployed in the country, with more than 20,000 uniformed personnel. More than 5 million people are estimated to have died in the DRC or its neighbours in the last two decades, making it the most deadly conflict since the second world war. All refiners around the world must be able to show they meet the new international standards, and have been independently inspected, if they want to continue trading with US multinationals from May this year. Guidelines recommend companies &quot;make and receive payments for gold through official banking channels where they are reasonably available, avoid cash purchases where possible, and ensure that all unavoidable cash purchases are supported by verifiable documentation&quot;. The rules of the Dubai Multi-Commodities Centre, set up by Dubai&apos;s ruler Sheikh Mohammed in 2002 to promote and regulate the gold industry, require refiners to make extra checks on suspicious, cash-in-hand deals above 40,000 dirhams (\u00a36,540). Kaloti had no system in place to do this in 2012. In fact Kaloti paid out $5.2bn in cash-for-gold deals \u2013 equivalent to almost 45% of its business in 2012. E&amp;Y Dubai&apos;s inspectors also found the refinery group had: \u2022 Taken millions of dollars of gold knowing it was plated in another metal and seemed to have been smuggled out of Morocco. \u2022 Accepted 2.4 tonnes of gold in more than 1,000 transactions with customers who provided no paperwork. \u2022 Paid cash to Sudanese suppliers who had hand-carried gold to Dubai \u2013 sourced from small-scale, artisan mining operations \u2013 but did not check whether they had approved mining licences. These details from E&amp;Y inspections have never been disclosed before. In Kaloti&apos;s much-delayed compliance report, published last December, the failings are mentioned only briefly and in terms that do not leave the reader with a clear picture of the inspectors&apos; findings. Kaloti maintains all failures in its procedures were rectified by November last year, with all but one of its remedial measures having been independently verified by E&amp;Y. In a statement to the Guardian, it said: &quot;Kaloti had shortcomings in the initial stages of the long multi-staged audit process\u00a0\u2026 Our fully compliant final result was confirmed by Ernst &amp; Young.&quot; Both Kaloti and E&amp;Y stressed all shortcomings were properly reported and acknowledged in published reports. Other comparable reports from major refineries in Dubai and elsewhere also offer only very scant descriptions where inspectors have discovered failings, suggesting this may be emerging as common industry practice for these new reports. The Guardian has seen no evidence that published reporting of Kaloti failings was out of line with regulatory rules or industry practice. But leaked emails show their proper presentation in published filings was hotly contested. Both Dubai rules and international standards set by the OECD say that the purpose of publishing reports on the outcome of independent inspections is to demonstrate transparency in relation to refineries&apos; performance on responsible sourcing measures in order to &quot;generate public confidence&quot;. But before the inspectors&apos; work was finished and their reports filed, the Dubai authorities learned of E&amp;Y&apos;s findings and changed their own rule book in a way that meant that the overall verdict of inspectors would stay confidential. The Dubia Multi-Commodities Centre insists these changes were made simply to keep rules in line with similar international standards. &quot;DMCC strongly refutes any allegation that it sought to influence or interfere with the review process, or that it altered or softened the review process to favour any member refinery,&quot; it said, adding: &quot;All findings have been made public and the review and reporting processes are robust.&quot; Emails show how some at E&amp;Y felt pressure had been put on them by a regulator &quot;keen to promote the Dubai gold industry&quot;, pressure that led Amjad Rihan, the partner in charge of the inspection division, to break ranks and come forward as a whistleblower. Rihan said he was horrified that the Dubai authorities had altered the rules and that E&amp;Y had signed off as &quot;fair&quot; public reports obscuring full details of Kaloti&apos;s failings. So brief were eventual descriptions of the failings reports published last December that in press releases the DMCC and Kaloti made no mention of them, celebrating the inspection outcome and stressing Dubai&apos;s leading refinery had ended the audit fully compliant, certified as offering conflict-free, responsibly sourced gold. Rihan said: &quot;I am not a lawyer, but in my opinion, what is &apos;ethical&apos; and what is &apos;legal&apos; should not conflict. The DMCC, Ernst &amp; Young and Kaloti were all aware that the risk of conflict gold entering Dubai had been very high. In my opinion, the way they acted is appalling, amoral and extremely unethical.&quot; At one stage, so serious had E&amp;Y&apos;s concerns about how to treat the Kaloti findings become that the case was referred to some of the firm&apos;s top global executives and legal experts in London. At one stage, Mark Otty, E&amp;Y&apos;s managing partner for Europe, Middle East, India and Africa (EMEIA) based in London, said in an email: &quot;Rest assured that we are taking this issue very seriously \u2026 I have taken the lead in relation to our investigation of it.&quot; Otty said later that he was satisfied with the outcome because &quot;both client and regulator will report deficiencies&quot;. A spokesman for both E&amp;Y divisions declined to answer questions from the Guardian. &quot;This matter\u00a0\u2026 concerns work done by EY Dubai, in Dubai, for a Dubai-based client under guidelines promulgated by the DMCC, a Dubai regulatory body.&quot; Joe Murphy, managing partner at E&amp;Y Dubai, said: &quot;EY Dubai took the views of our former partner [Rihan] very seriously and prior to issuing our \u2026 report undertook a comprehensive review, including consulting with internal and external experts, who supported the actions we took. We firmly believe that by identifying elements of non-compliance we have played an important role in achieving improvements in the client&apos;s supply chain controls.&quot; E&amp;Y&apos;s global code of conduct says: We are robust and courageous in our challenge to clients and are not afraid to deliver unwelcome information to them ... We support people and will withdraw from working for any clients that put our people under undue pressure&quot;. Rihan does not feel that is what happened in Dubai &quot;I went to senior figures at EY asking them to back me up in my professional opinion but instead I think they went to great lengths to please the client and they pushed me out.&quot; EY deny this. &quot;EY Dubai took the views of our former partner very seriously and prior to issuing our \u2026 report undertook a comprehensive review; including consulting with internal and external experts, who supported the actions we took&quot;. New international guidelines have emerged to tackle conflict gold, after similar to curb the trade in blood diamonds. According to a UN report at the end of 2011: &quot;A significant proportion of gold financing armed groups and criminal networks [within the DRC military] continues to end up in the United Arab Emirates, making the due diligence of refiners, smelters and jewellers based in that country of particular importance.&quot;central Africa, unless from long-standing industrial suppliers or well-known global traders. Kaloti, the UN report said, insisted it &quot;had not purchased artisanal gold from the region for three years.&quot; Dubai is one of the world&apos;s global hubs and attracts business from all quarters. Last October the Responsible Jewellery Council, whose members include Cartier, Tiffany &amp; Co, H Samuel, Ernest Jones and Argos, signed a deal recognising Dubai&apos;s conflict gold refinery inspection programme and permitting RJC jewellers to market gold bought from the emirate as conflict free.

That provoked the inevitable range of responses, including &quot;showing your class again Kevin ... idiot&quot; and &quot;that will be why KP isn&apos;t in the England set-up any more&quot;.

It was Prior who made a telephone call to Pietersen trying to resolve the gulf that had opened in the England dressing room during the stormy summer of 2012, when Pietersen was accused of sending derogatory text messages about the then England captain Andrew Strauss to the touring South African party. But the wicketkeeper was dragged into the public row over Pietersen&apos;s future when Morgan accused him of stabbing Pietersen in the back during a team meeting in Australia \u2013 an allegation Prior angrily denied, again on Twitter. On this occasion the problems seem to be of Prior&apos;s own making.

With United constantly offered multi-million-pound deals to play around the world in exhibition and testimonial games, the club hierarchy is confident of filling the financial void left by a dismal season, and has already started planning for the potential absence from European competition next term. David Moyes&apos;s side are in sixth, 11 points from a Champions League place. With United having turned down a sizeable offer to play a friendly during their recent warm-weather break in Dubai, the prospective opposition could be against teams from the Middle East, China or America. For reaching the Champions League last-16 last season United received \u00a328.9m from Uefa, plus around \u00a32m per home game from ticket sales. With the club having played four matches in that campaign at Old Trafford \u2013 three group games and the second last-16 leg \u2013 that means United earned nearly \u00a335m from the competition. United are working on a loss of around \u00a320m for failure to play in either of Uefa&apos;s club competitions and believe playing friendlies overseas during the gap in their schedule will help recoup a sizeable proportion of this. United played a testimonial in Saudi Arabia, in January 2008, for the former Wolverhampton Wanderers reserve team player Sami Al-Jaber. The team jetted out to the Middle East directly after a Premier League game against Reading on a Saturday for the friendly two days later in what was a 6,000-mile round trip. While that exercise yielded the club around \u00a31m, during the six intervening years the increase in social media and new pay-per-view models means they could expect to earn considerable sums from other friendlies, beyond any appearance money offered by the hosts. United made last August&apos;s pre-season friendly with the Swedish side AIK available on pay-per-view for \u00a35.95. With the club&apos;s huge global fan base, the earnings from matches sold in this way next year are potentially lucrative. United will also have noted how Rio Ferdinand&apos;s testimonial against Sevilla later that month is thought to have been watched by a global audience of several million, who took in the game for free via BT Sport and the defender&apos;s own website.

Big-name design houses including Dolce &amp; Gabbana, Alexander McQueen, Prada, Louis Vuitton, Fendi and Tom Ford have been pushing fur on the catwalks, and the fur coat for the male market is a major new trend for next winter. This month the biggest auction of furs ever seen in the industry will take place in Helsinki, when dealers and designers will be vying for 11 million mink pelts, two million fox and one million assorted wild animal furs. Prices are expected to reach record levels. Mark Oaten, chief executive of the International Fur Trade Federation, says that demand for fur is so huge that the industry is suffering a desperate skills shortage. According to Oaten, a younger generation has discovered fur, while recent technological advances mean that the industry can do far more with fur in terms of mixing it with other fabrics, thinning it and dyeing it. &quot;The traditional fur was grandma&apos;s fur coat, which was a one-off luxury buy that you bought and treasured all your life,&quot; he said. &quot;But five or six years ago technology moved on and allowed designers to use fur in fashion, allowing it to be used in a million ways. It can be affordable and there is a whole new generation to fall in love with fur.&quot; The renaissance of fur poses a major challenge to anti-fur campaigners such as Meg Mathews, who is now leading the latest effort by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (Peta) to persuade people to stop wearing furs. Mathews was behind last week&apos;s decision by the nightclub Mahiki, frequented by London&apos;s young rich, to announce that it would no longer admit anyone wearing fur. She spent last Thursday evening at the Mayfair venue&apos;s front door, handing out &quot;no fur&quot; badges to customers. &quot;The idea of wearing an animal&apos;s fur has always made me feel sick,&quot; she said. &quot;You only have to see the videos of skinned animals lying in a heap, still breathing and lifting their heads, to understand that stealing an animal&apos;s skin for the sake of vanity is wrong. &quot;I remember when Peta released its first iconic &apos;I&apos;d rather go naked than wear fur&apos; campaign in the early 1990s \u2013 back when few people had ever seen a video or even a photograph of how horribly animals die for fur. The impact was huge. Almost overnight, wearing fur became unfashionable and designers couldn&apos;t wait to shout about how they were fur-free and fabulous. Retailers such as Selfridges and Liberty brought in strict no-fur policies. &quot;There are so many great designers working with cruelty-free fabrics, and that&apos;s what we should be celebrating during fashion season. &quot;My daughter Anais is at a time in her life when she&apos;s making choices about the kind of person she wants to be, and I want to show her that it&apos;s cool to be kind and that making compassionate choices shows character. We had a great turnout this week for the celebration of Mahiki&apos;s new fur-free policy, and we hope that other clubs follow Mahiki&apos;s positive example by going fur-free as well.&quot; But can anyone persuade the fashion-leaders to abandon fur? Vocal anti-fur campaigners Stella McCartney, Sadie Frost and now Mathews are all chums of model Kate Moss, who has a wardrobe packed with fur jerkins and sealskin boots and seems supremely unfazed by her controversial choices. Models and celebrities have been notoriously contrary around the issue. Naomi Campbell appeared naked in 1994 in an advert for Peta under the strapline &quot;I&apos;d rather go naked than wear fur&quot;; 15 years later she caused consternation by becoming the face of a furrier firm. Cindy Crawford was another high-profile defector from the Peta cause. Shortly after Tony Blair&apos;s government signed into law a bill banning fur farming in the UK \u2013 which came into effect in 2003 \u2013 his wife, Cherie, was unhelpfully photographed while wearing a rabbit-fur coat. Designer Vivienne Westwood has gone the other way. Persuaded to strip out fur from her collections, she became a convert after seeing a video of steel traps used to catch wild animals for their furs \u2013 some 10% to 15% of fur comes from wild as opposed to farmed animals. Many high-street shops in the UK have banned fur, including H&amp;M, Topshop, New Look, Selfridges and House of Fraser. Diesel, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren and Zara joined them last month. But there are plenty of specialised UK outlets selling fur, including a new one specialising in buying and selling vintage and remodelling existing items. One owner of a store in northern England asked not to be named by the Observer but said: &quot;We&apos;re very cautious about drawing attention to ourselves because of past events and the way some people are. There&apos;s definitely a resurgence and we are happy to see our sales growing; it&apos;s nice to see.&quot; Peta rejects the defence that a fur is fine to wear if it is vintage or second-hand. &quot;Whether the animal died 50 years ago or last week is hardly relevant. Wearing it is sending an unacceptable message that it is OK to wear fur,&quot; said Ben Williamson of the lobby group. He urged people to give any furs they have to Peta. &quot;We use them as bedding for animal rescue centres,&quot; he said. &quot;You will always get celebrities and designers using fur to provoke controversy, but it doesn&apos;t translate to what people are wearing on the streets. An RSPCA survey in 2011 showed that 95% of British people would not wear fur.&quot; The cold winter has seen record sales of fur in New York, while China and other Asian markets are clamouring for it. Even Dubai now has 400 shops selling fur. Peta is holding out for a hero to change the mood. Can Mathews be the one to get fur&apos;s most famous UK ambassador, Kate Moss, to stop wearing it? &quot;We&apos;re always hoping,&quot; said Williamson.", "title": "Animal rights campaigners protest as fur comes back into fashion", "sentences": ["Even Dubai now has 400 shops selling fur."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-01T16:55:43Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/01/pete-sampras-roger-federer", "tags": ["Tennis", "Roger Federer", "US sports", "Sport"], "article": "Pete Sampras and Roger Federer played each other just once. It was 13 years ago in the fourth round at Wimbledon and the Swiss teenager, his long hair tied back in a ponytail underneath a bandana and his attitude ramped up to the point of combustion like some sort of put-upon skateboard punk, was yet to make the sophisticated impression on his peers that would define his career. The young Federer was nonetheless regarded with the same degree of enthusiasm that attends the progress of the handsome Bulgarian shot-maker Grigor Dimitrov today. He was a prince waiting for a coronation and, on his debut at the tournament he would go on to dominate for a decade, he beat the still formidable American in five sets that enthralled Centre Court for three hours and 41\u00a0minutes, something of a marathon at the time.

However, the following year he would lose again, shockingly in the second round, to Federer&apos;s compatriot, George Bastl, who was ranked 118 in the world. Despite undeniable decline, Sampras was able to secure an already gilded legacy later in 2002 in his final match by winning the US Open against Andre Agassi, the sort of exit afforded few people in sport. In retrospect, Federer&apos;s arrival in 2001 was nearly as spectacular as Sampras&apos;s departure in 2002. The last shot of their only encounter was the young pretender&apos;s blistering return of the fabled Sampras serve, as distinct a signal of change as could be conjured. Nobody then, of course, imagined Federer would go on to surpass Sampras&apos;s record of 14 grand slam titles and equal his tally of championships at Wimbledon. And few today doubt that the intervening period has been blessed as the finest in the history of the game. The wheel has come near to full circle again, yet Federer \u2013 at 32, the same age at which Sampras retired \u2013 shows no sign of leaving, and is striving wholeheartedly for a sign-off as emphatic as that of Sampras. It would be a more remarkable achievement were he to add a farewell slam to his resum\u00e9, given their respective games and the intensity of Federer&apos;s era. Sampras and Federer never met again on court but they have enjoyed joint residency in the hearts of tennis fans ever since that match, their genius the glue that binds them. Sampras has greyed and thinned a little since his pomp, but his belly has remained reassuringly disciplined. On Monday he will display what he has left in an exhibition match in London against Agassi, two old gunslingers still shooting from the hip and lip. Federer, meanwhile, has enjoyed a more fruitful start to 2014 than he hinted at for most of 2013, carving his way pleasingly through a strong field in Dubai this past week and coming from a set down on Saturday to beat Tomas Berdych to the title. What does Sampras make, then, of the man who beat then bettered him in 2001, I wondered? &quot;He&apos;s done everything in the game,&quot; he said. &quot;He could walk away tomorrow feeling great about it. I don&apos;t know how he maintains the level. As long as he&apos;s healthy and enjoying it, I can see Roger playing for another two, three, four more years.&quot; Regardless of his standing in the game, this was a remarkable expression of faith. Federer still playing at 36? It seems hugely improbable. But there is an understanding between special players that they are capable of deeds beyond mortals. Still, after Stanislas Wawrinka&apos;s win over Novak Djokovic in Melbourne, did Sampras not think we were coming out of one era and into another, and that Federer would be trampled in the stampede? &quot;No, I don&apos;t think so. I think you&apos;re still going to see the same guys dominating the game: Novak, Rafa [Nadal] and Roger. It seems like Roger&apos;s playing better. And [Juan Mart\u00edn] Del Potro&apos;s going to be up there. Stan has been moving, been close a few times and he broke through in Australia, but I don&apos;t see it as a sign of any real change in the game. I just think the top four, five guys are still going to dominate. I don&apos;t see any major shift.&quot; Sampras was a powerful presence on court, with one of the best serves in the history of the game and a willingness to bully the match from close quarters, but even he is taken aback by the raw physicality of the modern game. &quot;Even sitting there watching these guys battle, it&apos;s awesome. The amount of effort Rafa puts into his game, the movement, the long points, the grind of the Tour \u2026 It&apos;s got a lot more physical the past 10 years. Everyone exchanges from the back court, the points are longer and it&apos;s taking a toll on their bodies. It seems like the top four guys are so much physically better, and mentally better. That&apos;s why they&apos;ve been dominating so much, just because they are so much better in that one area.&quot; Did he not hanker for some more, well, tennis in his tennis? &quot;Sure. I love contrast. I love the great match-up of serve-and-volley and staying back. It&apos;s fun to watch. The [modern] game is exciting, but it&apos;s a little one-dimensional. If you were shooting for the best combination, you&apos;d love a little serve-and-volley tennis, chip and charge, to mix things up. I don&apos;t see it happening any time soon. &quot;The game is what it is and the direction, I don&apos;t think, will change. Guys in some areas will be staying back. Wimbledon of all events, it&apos;s incredible how much guys stay back, and I don&apos;t buy the surface being slow. I think it is the style of play, and that everyone is just more comfortable staying back. It&apos;s kids, it&apos;s juniors and it&apos;s pros. In my day, I grew up watching McEnroe and Edberg and Becker, so I saw that serve-and-volley tennis. It was something I wanted to try and it&apos;s something I did.&quot; Which brings us neatly back to the man who beat him at Wimbledon 13 years ago. As he strives to reinvent himself, Federer has been noticeably keener to go to the net, spreading anxiety among his opponents as he glides forward for the kill. Sampras likes what he sees in the new-old Federer. &quot;The new racket [which he took up towards the end of last year, his worst on the Tour] will help. I think he&apos;s got confidence in it. I&apos;ve seen Roger play over his whole career and obviously he won a ton of majors playing a certain way. He&apos;s got to a point where he&apos;s had to get a little more aggressive, take some more chances. Getting into these long rallies against Rafa and Novak, it is tough.&quot;", "title": "Pete Sampras on Roger Federer: 'I don't know how he maintains the level'", "sentences": ["Federer, meanwhile, has enjoyed a more fruitful start to 2014 than he hinted at for most of 2013, carving his way pleasingly through a strong field in Dubai this past week and coming from a set down on Saturday to beat Tomas Berdych to the title."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-01T22:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/01/international-premier-tennis-league-andy-murray", "tags": ["Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport"], "article": "Andy Murray is among the &quot;icon&quot; players in Sunday&apos;s draft for the new International Premier Tennis League, to be played in Asia at the end of the year.

He would have been even more surprised at the notion of bolting all three together into a single, unbroken six-hour span. Yet he might conceivably have approved of the idea of inviting the audience to sit amid the action, tweet their responses @RomanTragedies and make use of the mobile charging points provided at the side of the stage. The Roman plays are quite disparate in everything bar geography; yet their one consistent feature is Shakespeare\u2019s continual awareness of the population as a silent majority whose approval, or otherwise, determines the course of the action. Coriolanus, Brutus, Julius Caesar and Mark Antony are all seemingly unimpeachable figures whose reputations suddenly become toxic following a series of PR catastrophes. While Shakespeare\u2019s actors undoubtedly played to the gallery, Toneelgroep Amsterdam\u2019s conceit of inviting the audience to mingle with the action is a 21st century means of bantering with the groundlings. Then again, it\u2019s curious how many people are eager to claim the onstage vantage points, given that Shakespeare\u2019s patrician characters treat the \u201chooting rabblement\u201d with ill-disguised contempt. The Toneelgroep\u2019s objective is to \u201ctransform the theatre into a political conference\u201d; though the lattice of grey, right-angled sofas packed with increasingly tired-looking people might be said to transform the theatre into the departure lounge of a particularly hellish airport. It takes some getting used to - particularly as non-Dutch speaking members of the audience need to keep an eye on the surtitles as well as scrolling displays of live-streamed news and an array of TV screens  randomly tuned to Pepsi commercials, MTV and, bizarrely, a round-up of the Sochi Winter Olympics. You\u2019re free to wander in and out at random when hunger, or boredom strikes. But for all the apparent innovation, there\u2019s nothing particularly new here. An announcement is made that \u201cfollowing this set change you will witness a conspiratorial scene in which Julius Caesar is murdered\u201d, which is precisely what Brecht might have done with a bigger sound system.  The real advances of Ivo Van Hove\u2019s production are dramaturgical. Even at just under six hours, the plays are subject to an internal compression which removes everything inessential to the main thrust of the drama. Caesar doesn\u2019t even appear until the scene in which he is slaughtered. Far from diminishing the impact of the part however, his status as a subject of speculation heightens the paranoia of of a jittery cabal of senators who seem to be plotting to do away with a chimera. Van Hove\u2019s readings are consistently provocative. The homoerotic attraction between Coriolanus and Aufidius has been emphasised before; that between Antony and Enobarbus less so. And the Roman plays present a remorselessly masculine world in which the main contribution of the women is a disastrous tendency to cause their men to take their eye off the ball. Van Hove attempts to redress the balance by casting Cassius and Octavius Caesar as women, which almost works, though such a radical stroke tends to highlight as much as solve the problem.  Yet it is the ability of Chris Neitvelt\u2019s capricious Cleopatra to breathe hot, hedonistic life into the joyless world of politics that provides the most memorable performance. It\u2019s entirely in keeping with the dogged literalness of the production that her suicide is accomplished with a real snake, which in any other context, could become a ludicrous distraction. Yet for all its perversities, the Toneelgroep\u2019s Roman marathon has a singularity of purpose that holds your attention from the opening blow to the very last asp.

Metcalfe, who is 26 and lives in Norwich, is in the process of finishing her first collection of short stories. She was selected by judges from among 650 entries for her story Number Three. Metcalfe&apos;s tale tells of a British teacher working at a Chinese school, with cultural differences resulting in &quot;devastating consequences&quot; for his young Chinese host. She was inspired to write the story, she said, after spending a year in China working for the British Council, &quot;which sparked off a lot of ideas about cultural exchange and the different degrees of success with which different people are able to translate themselves for others and for different kinds of cultural environments&quot;. Metcalfe&apos;s piece is competing with stories from Elizabeth Strout, who won the Pulitzer for her novel Olive Kitteridge, and Adam Johnson, who took the prestigious US fiction award for The Orphan Master&apos;s Son. Johnson&apos;s short story Nirvana is set in the near future, as a man&apos;s wife deteriorates from a wasting illness, and Strout&apos;s Snow Blind is a decade-spanning tale taking place in rural America. The shortlist for the prize, the world&apos;s richest for a single short story, also includes Anwar Gets Everything, the disturbing tale of a Bangladeshi construction worker in Dubai by the award-winning British/Bangladeshi writer Tahmima Anam, and British author Jonathan Tel&apos;s The Shoe King of Shanghai, in which a migrant to Beijing steals shoes from a funeral and tries to sell them on. Canadian-American author Marjorie Celona rounds out the shortlist with Othello, in which a man remembers his autistic step-brother. &quot;In the summer of 1987, I was seventeen and Wolf was six, and I was making him sort my records on account of his losing a bet that the Bee Gees were girls,&quot; Celona writes. &quot;What&apos;s remarkable about this year&apos;s shortlist is not just the power of the writing but the astonishing diversity of imaginative approaches.

However, Agassi&apos;s inclusion, as a past champion for the Singapore team, looks doubtful, as the competition starts in that city a day after Thanksgiving and the American had informed organisers he would not sacrifice that holiday time. Sampras, meanwhile, seemed unclear who he was playing for [Mumbai, along with Rafael Nadal], and said he would have had reservations about joining such a venture during his playing days, as it would have cut into his down time on the Tour. He had a lighthearted dig at modern players who complain about the weight of the ATP Tour schedule yet are willing to give up their cherished off-seasons to play in the tournament, which guarantees some of them $1m a night. &quot;It&apos;s a good thing to take tennis to places in the world where they want to see it. There&apos;s no downside in doing that,&quot; Agassi said. &quot;[But] my agreement to do it was based on a few very specific conditions. &quot;Certainly economics played a little part in it but also time away played another part. I can&apos;t be away for more than four or five days so I set some limitations and had some dates in December. Now I read in an email that the dates are over Thanksgiving. That would be a non-starter for me. Six or seven days away is too much of a price to pay.&quot; Owners from Singapore, Mumbai, Bangkok and Dubai gathered after the Dubai tournament final \u2013 in which Roger Federer (who is not playing in the IPTL) beat Tomas Berdych \u2013 to bid for players past and present, as well as key members of the WTA Tour. However, unlike the Indian Premier League that has set a light under cricket on the subcontinent and on which it is roughly modelled, no individual bids were released. No players were present and it seems some of them have been given the sketchiest details of their involvement. Sampras said: &quot;It&apos;s happened in the last 24 hours. I&apos;ve just been in talks with them and I&apos;m excited to be a part of it.

It must have seemed a funny line at the time, back when Nasser Hussain used it in July 2003. England had just thrashed South Africa by seven wickets in the ODI final, bowling them out for 107. And after the match Graeme Smith, a young shaver of a skipper, still sopping wet behind the ears, had accused England of &quot;arrogance&quot;. The kid needed knocking down a peg, so Hussain had a little dig in his press conference. &quot;Wotsisname,&quot; and his side, were, he said &quot;there for the taking.&quot; They were anything but. Just under a fortnight later Wotsisname batted for a minute more than nine hours, faced 377 balls, and scored 277 runs, the highest Test score yet made by a South African. He added 85 more in the second innings, for good measure. England escaped with a draw but Hussain quit immediately after the match was over, the first in a line of three England captains who would be broken on the wheel of Smith&apos;s will. At Lord&apos;s three days later, Smith started all over again. This time he made 259, becoming only the fourth batsman to score double hundreds in consecutive Tests. No one ever forgot his name again. If Smith seemed abrasive, arrogant, in those early years, it was because he needed to be. He had a warmer side, too, which became obvious to the English when he captained Somerset in 2005, but at the start he needed to be hard. He had been made captain when he was 22, after he had played eight Tests. The South Africa selectors felt that they needed to make a break from the recent past, after the team&apos;s risible performance in the 2003 World Cup, and the rancourous fallout from the King commission, when Hansie Cronje had confessed his crimes. So they picked Smith. He was in the under-19s side when many of the men he was now meant to lead had been playing in the infamous fixed Test, when South Africa and England each agreed to forfeit an innings. He had never played with, or against, Cronje. Smith imposed himself on his team by dropping Lance Klusener, who he felt was a &quot;divisive influence&quot;. Klusener threatened legal action, and the former coach Bob Woolmer spoke out against the decision. But Smith stood his ground. It should have been obvious then how tough he was, how much self-belief he had. This was a man who had pinned a list of short, medium, and long-term goals on the door of his family&apos;s fridge as a child, and had achieved the last of them \u2013 which was to lead South Africa \u2013 before he had even really become a man. Smith had five watchwords written up on that door as well: &quot;Brave. Strong. Calm. Confident. Enjoy.&quot; They would serve him well right through his career. Clarity of thought, strength of character, qualities he honed while working with the sports psychologist Michael Finnegan \u2013 and later the explorer Mike Horn \u2013 have been Smith&apos;s greatest assets. On paper Smith&apos;s prodigious returns made him seem a natural talent, but his cussed batting always seemed to be an act of will rather than skill. He succeeded despite his technique, not because of it. He knew his limitations and worked within them, which is a trick it takes most players many years to master. In 2003 England&apos;s slips stood watching, waiting, for catches that never came as Smith worked everything he could away to leg, until the bowlers drifted too wide, when he would unleash his ferocious cut. His method never changed much, even when he was batting at his best. At the start of 2008, Smith had threatened to quit the captaincy after an argument with Cricket South Africa&apos;s selectors about the transformation policy, and the make-up of the squad to tour Bangladesh. He won out but only after the president of the board, Norman Arendse, had said: &quot;I defer to the captain and the coach. They are the ones who will be held accountable for the team&apos;s results.&quot; The consequences of failure were clear. In the next 12 months, Smith&apos;s team won series victories away in England and Australia, and drew in India. Smith averaged 85 in the 11 matches they won. In England that summer he scored 154 in the fourth innings at Edgbaston, as South Africa chased 281 to win by five wickets, though Andrew Flintoff was all but unplayable at one end and Monty Panesar was ripping the ball out of the rough at the other. Later that year Smith did it again. He made 108 in the fourth innings against Australia in Perth, as South Africa scored 414 to win by six wickets. He followed that with a pair of fifties in the nine-wicket win at Melbourne that sealed the series, completing what he said was the &quot;most incredible season South African cricket has ever had&quot;. In the match after that, he came out to bat at No11 with a broken hand, and batted for 25 minutes to try to save the Test. From that year on, South Africa began to assert themselves, inexorably, as the best Test team of their era. They didn&apos;t reach No1 in the rankings till 2012, but they have only lost one series in five years, against Australia at home in early 2009. And that was their only series defeat since 2006. Remarkably, they have never lost a match in which Smith made a hundred. How they must hope he will able to sign off with one in his final innings. It seems unlikely that he will. It has been obvious for a while that his mind has been turning elsewhere. He took up dual Irish citizenship earlier this year, to make it easier to visit his in-laws, and has signed a long-term deal to lead Surrey. He has chronic ankle problems and has endured a run of poor returns. He made 234 against Pakistan in Dubai last October but, other than that, he has made two fifties in 24 international innings in the past 12 months, and only 42 runs in five innings against Australia. At the start of this series Smith was the one playing the wise old pro, just as Hussain had been all those years ago. &quot;When you&apos;ve played against Australia enough,&quot; Smith said, &quot;you learn to sift through a lot of the bull \u2013 dot, dot, dot.&quot; But Australia are the most unforgiving of opponents for aging cricketers. Smith is only 33, which is still shy of the description in the 2004 Wisden, when Richard Hobson said he was &quot;22 going on 35&quot;. Smith has always seemed older than his years.

One of his first projects in the region involved the engineering design for the rapid expansion of the highway network in Saudi Arabia during the oil boom. Richard was seconded in the early 1990s to work on transport planning in Dubai, now one of the world&apos;s leading tourist destinations. A personal highlight of his career was being involved in 2004 in the crowd management of pilgrims taking part in the annual Hajj to Mecca. The replacement of the jamarat pillars with walls in the city of Mina, where pilgrims take part in ritual stone-throwing, and the building of the Jamarat bridge have allowed pilgrims to throw stones from either ground or bridge level without causing or sustaining injury. He was born in Brentwood, Essex, the son of Bert, a former district manager of Midlands Electricity Board, and his wife Elwena (nee Causer). Educated at Ashville college, Harrogate, and University College London, where he studied engineering, Richard began his career as a transport planner with Warwickshire county council. He was responsible for the design of several major new roads, including the Sutton Coldfield bypass, which required the use of some unique design and construction techniques. In the early years, Richard worked as a bridge engineer and gained chartered engineer status with the design of a bridge for the M6/M42 motorway intersection. He next became a director of a newly formed private research and development body, Planning and Transport Research and Computation.

Speaking at the launch of a Lancashire development programme at Old Trafford, he was much more discreet than Matt Prior had been in Dubai last week about the implications of Pietersen&apos;s exit. &quot;There&apos;s a new coach, there will be different personnel so I should imagine it will be a different feel in the dressing room,&quot; he said. &quot;My job is just to make sure I&apos;m in that dressing room at the start of the year. &quot;I&apos;m sure everyone has been hurting as much as I was after that series defeat and really want to show people that&apos;s not the real us.

Things inevitably happen around the Northern Irishman. It is what makes him such a blue-chip attraction in golf, a sport which isn&apos;t short on bland characters in the modern day. When McIlroy is in the groove, he can and will destroy even the best fields in world golf. He has displayed an ability to do that at major championships. It is only logical to point out that such optimum performance will arrive infrequently. The thing that McIlroy seems less capable of doing, and what Woods has made a career of, is achieving success when playing at 75% of his potential. Or, more pertinently, realising he can do it. Even a McIlroy at three-quarter throttle is quite enough to win events such as the Honda Classic, in which he lost in a playoff on Sunday. The 24-year-old asserted afterwards that he was lucky to be in the playoff at all and that victory would have been an undeserved one. It was typically honest comment, if one which supplied a tacit admission of McIlroy&apos;s mindset. The three other players involved in the sudden-death format \u2013 Russell Henley, Russell Knox and Ryan Palmer \u2013 were performing at the very best of their ability just to get there. It is hardly being disrespectful to them to highlight how McIlroy is a class apart and should, in reality, have simply closed out victory over the final stretch of regulation play. Instead, McIlroy had a series of bad misses. McIlroy&apos;s technical brilliance sets him aside from the vast majority of those he routinely plays against. Woods hasn&apos;t made a professional lifetime out of success in golf tournaments because he played at his very best in every one of them. Instead, the 38-year-old learned at an early age that he could win from a slightly lower position. He had perfect confidence in himself to do that; a thought process McIlroy is yet to master. The analysis of McIlroy&apos;s 2013 has already become somewhat tiresome. It was, after all, one traumatic year for a young guy in the midst of a long career. Personal and professional events in 2014 have already supplied more than enough to trigger strong debate on this, McIlroy&apos;s next chapter. He should have won the HSBC Championship in Abu Dhabi, with a careless rules&apos; infraction playing the significant part in an alternative course of events. A fortnight later in Dubai, McIlroy&apos;s opening round of 63 left many onlookers believing a second Desert Classic title was a formality; instead, he stuttered. Taking the Honda scenario into account, it is an obvious frustration to McIlroy himself that he hasn&apos;t won at least once this year. That scenario will inevitably change sometime soon. Contrary to what increasingly seems like McIlroy&apos;s own belief, it needn&apos;t come courtesy of an eight-shot canter. Winning in itself is an art form, which needn&apos;t always be picture-perfect. Will Woods be agent of change?  Is Mark Steinberg preparing for life after Tiger? The high-profile agent, who has handled Woods&apos;s affairs since 1998, has been on something of a recruitment drive recently, with Justin Rose changing stable to Steinberg&apos;s last year. Earlier, it is hardly disrespectful to say Steinberg&apos;s attentions were perceived as being entirely focussed on Woods. A host of up-and-coming American players have been targeted more recently by Steinberg&apos;s Excel Sports Management, with the firm also taking an active interest in Europe and Asia. It has been confirmed the former Masters champion Charl Schwartzel has severed ties with Chubby Chandler&apos;s International Sports Management. Word on the golfing street is that Steinberg and the International Management Group are now vying to look after Schwartzel&apos;s affairs. As a South African, Schwartzel opens up potential new territory for management companies. Perhaps the Steinberg strategy makes perfect business sense. Or maybe there is a growing realisation that Woods&apos;s commercial appeal is no longer what it once was. Time will tell on that front. McGinley builds meticulous momentum If there is a single term to describe Paul McGinley&apos;s approach to the Ryder Cup captaincy, &quot;meticulous&quot; fits the bill entirely. Whatever failings Europe may display when taking on the United States at Gleneagles in September, there is no possibility of the home captain leaving stones unturned. This week, the most meaningful step of McGinley&apos;s captaincy to date will take place as he names the first of his assistants during a media conference in Dublin. Sam Torrance, McGinley&apos;s close friend and social golfing partner, will be one of them with Des Smyth also expected to get the nod. Further names may well be added at a later date; Padraig Harrington, Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal, Miguel \u00c1ngel Jim\u00e9nez and Paul Lawrie fall into that category. In recent times, there has been an element of unnecessary circus associated with batches of vice-captains, who have rather cluttered up the Ryder Cup and, in certain cases, sought only to push their own captaincy agenda. McGinley will surely ensure that doesn&apos;t transpire this time around.", "title": "Rory McIlroy must realise winning need not be picture-perfect | Ewan Murray", "sentences": ["A fortnight later in Dubai, McIlroy&apos;s opening round of 63 left many onlookers believing a second Desert Classic title was a formality; instead, he stuttered."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-05T11:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/mar/05/london-favourite-city-world-ultra-rich-new-york-asia", "tags": ["Real estate", "Rich lists", "Business", "London", "UK news", "New York", "US news", "World news", "Cities"], "article": "Booming stock markets and global economic recovery continued the seemingly inexorable rise in the numbers of the world&apos;s super-rich last year, according to a report that predicts their ranks will swell by nearly 30% to 215,000 over the next decade.  The world&apos;s so-called &quot;ultra high net worth individuals&quot; \u2013 those with $30m (\u00a321m) or more in assets apart from their main home \u2013 number 167,669, according to a report from estate agents Knight Frank \u2013 up 59% over the past decade.  Roughly equal to the population of the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea \u2013 and many of them do indeed have a place there \u2013 they control more than $20tn in assets \u2013 more than the national output of the US and Germany put together.  London was home to more UHNWIs (4,224) than any other city in 2013 and this will still be the case a decade later, with nearly 5,000 expected to be living there, according to the report.  Singapore and New York will leapfrog Tokyo and Hong Kong to take second and third places. The top six cities have more UHNWIs living in them than Latin America and the Middle East combined. Liam Bailey, global head of research at Knight Frank, said the cluster of businesses, international appeal, heritage and democratic institutions in London and New York are not easy to replicate. But, he said, &quot;London wins over New York: It&apos;s more diverse. There are more nationalities living here and it&apos;s a more global city.&quot; Britain is the number one destination for those seeking a new domicile, although the US is still more popular with the Asian wealth elite. Russia has seen an outflow of ultra-rich individuals to places like London, New York and Dubai.  Pippa Malmgren, ex-economic adviser to George Bush, said: &quot;I would argue that the UK has now emerged as the world&apos;s most attractive residence for non-domiciles. The crackdown on tax havens in Switzerland has removed these old options for new capital. As a result, there has been a huge influx of global capital into the UK \u2013 and this is reflected in many things, including property prices.&quot; In coming decades both London and New York could be eclipsed by Asian cities, where luxury property markets are booming.  The numbers of super-rich are forecast to double in Africa and India in the next decade. In China the ranks of the ultra-wealthy will soar by 80%. Bailey said: &quot;History, location and their long established wealth mean London and New York&apos;s positions look unassailable, at least for now. It is further down our leader board that the real city wars are being waged. The main battleground is Asia, where a handful of locations are slugging it out in the hope of establishing a clear lead as the region&apos;s alpha urban hub.&quot; Asian cities, led by Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, experienced the fastest growth in property prices last year, but some of the cities affected by the 2008 downturn \u2013 such as Dublin, where prime property soared 17.5% last year \u2013 are now on the road to recovery.  As well as swanky estate agents and yacht builders, all this is music to the ears of the big jewellers, auction houses and most prestigious wine estates. The ultra-rich like to spend their wealth on jewellery, especially in emerging markets, followed by art, watches, wine and cars, a survey for the report found.  Bailey said space travel and asteroid mining were hot investments, with 70 billionaires putting money into space or sub-orbital flights. Sir Richard Branson, whose Virgin Galactic plans its first space flight this year, holds out the prospect of travelling from London to Sydney in a couple of hours \u2013 allowing Chinese or Indian investors to pop over to their Tuscan farmhouse on a whim.  How they spend it Superyachts and private jetsSuperyachts \u2013 defined as those longer than 60 metres \u2013 and private jets are the preserve of the seriously rich and last April saw the launch of the world&apos;s biggest, the 180-metre Azzam. With a reputed price tag of \u00a3400m, it is widely understood to have been built for Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the Emir of Abu Dhabi. The market for smaller yachts is only just returning to normal. Private jet sales also bounced back in the second half of 2013.  Luxury brandsBoston Consulting Group calculated earlier this year that the world&apos;s wealthiest spent \u00a31.1tn on luxury goods and services. Very little of that money would have been spent in Africa but the continent is expected to see the greatest growth in spending, along with the Middle East. Growth in luxury brand outlets is slowing in Asia, as the Chinese government cracks down on conspicuous consumption and many rich residents shop abroad.  Rare stamps and coinsCoins are becoming more popular in China, India and Russia. Gold Roman coins are particularly sought after. A 1794 US &quot;Flowing Hair Silver Dollar&quot; fetched a record $10m at auction in New York a year ago. Rare stamp values are also rising: The Stanley Gibbons China 200 rare stamp index climbed 36% between 2011 and 2012. Classic carsClassic car values are up 28% over the past 12 months, according to the Historic Automobile Group&apos;s Top Index. Not only the most famous marques are doing well: one of the biggest movers last year was Japan&apos;s first supercar, a Toyota 2000 GT from the late 1960s. Jewellery and artGold prices are falling, but the best untreated stones \u2013 particularly &apos;fancy&apos; diamonds and other coloured stones \u2013 are fetching record sums. Natural saltwater pearls, amber, coral and jade are also in demand. Contemporary and postwar works set new records last year, according to Art Market research: Francis Bacon&apos;s Three Studies of Lucian Freud sold for $143m at Christies in New York in October \u2013 a record for any artwork. \u2022 This article was amended on Thursday 6 March 2014 to clarify that it is the Chinese government which has been cracking down on conspicuous consumption.", "title": "London retains crown as favourite city of world's ultra-rich", "sentences": ["Russia has seen an outflow of ultra-rich individuals to places like London, New York and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-05T19:40:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/06/rebekah-brooks-andy-coulson-milly-dowler-phone-hacking-trial", "tags": ["UK news", "Rebekah Brooks"], "article": "Rebekah Brooks has revealed that she was &quot;confiding&quot; emotionally in Andy Coulson when a story appeared in the News of the World mentioning Milly Dowler&apos;s voice messages in April 2002, jurors at the Old Bailey have heard. Brooks, the former editor of the paper, was holidaying with her then husband Ross Kemp in Dubai at the time but had kept in touch with the paper which was being edited by Coulson, who was her deputy at the time. In cross-examination at the phone hacking trial on Thursday, Brooks again denied that a love letter found by police on her computer meant she had had a six-year affair with Coulson. Jurors have already heard that said Brooks had first got together with Coulson in 1998 and had several periods of &quot;physical intimacy&quot; with him after that. Brooks had not been &quot;waiting around like Miss Havisham,&quot; she told the jury, for Coulson and had got on with her life over those years up to 2004 when she wrote the letter. On Thursday she was asked whether in April 2002 she was back talking to Coulson &quot;in that confidential way&quot;. Barely audible to the court, Brooks responded: &quot;Yes.&quot; Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC asked: &quot;Was the relationship in April 2002 such that Mr Coulson could completely trust you with any confidence at all?&quot; Brooks replied: &quot;Yes.&quot; Edis asked her to also think about her relationship with Coulson in August 2004. The jury has already heard that this was when the then home secretary David Blunkett&apos;s voicemails were hacked and Coulson, by then editor of the News of the World, travelled to Sheffield to confront him about the affair. At the time Brooks was editor of the Sun, which followed up the News of the World&apos;s exclusive about Blunkett by revealing that the identity of the woman with whom he was involved was Kimberly Quinn. Edis asked Brooks: &quot;By August 2004 \u2013 were you back talking to each other confidentially again? Brooks responded: &quot;We were certainly talking again.&quot; Edis continued: &quot;Were you talking to each other in that confidential way again by that stage?&quot; She replied: &quot;Certainly \u2013 would have been back to confiding on an emotional level by that stage, yes.&quot; Referring to the draft letter she wrote to Coulson in February 2004, she said it was wrong to conclude that they had been involved in a six-year affair. Jurors have already seen the entire letter but reporting restrictions have been placed on large sections for privacy purposes. For the first time, the public, press and Brooks&apos;s co-defendants in the dock including Coulson heard one new line from the letter, when Edis asked Brooks: &quot;Can I ask you to consider this sentence also: &apos;For six years I&apos;ve waited&apos;. There would be no reason would there for you to lie on this letter at all?&quot; Brooks replied: &quot;No.&quot; Edis continued his line of questioning, telling the court he would keep it brief but he needed to establish the facts around the relationship, because of the inference in his opening statement that she could have known about the hacking of Dowler&apos;s phone because she had said in the letter she confided in him, trusted him with everything and considered him her best friend. &quot;What I suggested to the jury was the letter meant that you had had an affair for six years,&quot; said Edis. Brooks said: &quot;That&apos;s not true.&quot; Edis responded: &quot;Is there anything you&apos;d like to say about why that [is the case]?&quot; She replied: &quot;We didn&apos;t have an affair for six years and if it was true I would say. Police found [the letter] on the computer and served it as evidence, there is no reason for me to say it&apos;s not true.&quot; She said the line in the letter saying she had been &quot;waiting for six years&quot; was just something she felt at that moment. &quot;It was the emotion of the moment. In that time I had got back together with Ross, had got married, bought a house together, tried to have a baby, and the relationship [with Ross] had gone wrong. Andy Coulson had got on with his life \u2026 . &quot;I am clearly saying that it&apos;s been six years since we first got together and in my heart, I felt that. &quot;I hadn&apos;t been sitting there like Miss Haversham \u2026 I just didn&apos;t have a relationship with Andy for six years \u2026 If we had an affair for six years I would have said so.&quot; Brooks and Coulson both deny the charge that they conspired to intercept phone messages. Edis put it to Brooks that although the News of the World and the Sun are owned by the same company, &quot;they were actually in competition with each other to a great extent&quot;. Brooks agreed, saying there was &quot;a long tradition of this&quot;. He asked whether during her periods of closeness with Coulson if that changed and if they had co-operated more, or shared work secrets. Brooks replied: &quot;There must have been times when we did co-operate maybe in the way you suggest other editors haven&apos;t, but it was the exception rather than the rule and intimacy made it very difficult, work wise.&quot; The trial continues.", "title": "Rebekah Brooks 'confiding' in Andy Coulson when Dowler story published", "sentences": ["Brooks, the former editor of the paper, was holidaying with her then husband Ross Kemp in Dubai at the time but had kept in touch with the paper which was being edited by Coulson, who was her deputy at the time."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-06T15:43:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/musicblog/2014/mar/06/why-does-nobody-reference-jamiroquai", "tags": ["Music", "Pop and rock", "Culture"], "article": "As I was trying to describe new group Juce today, a phrase sprung to mind that I\u2019ve previously denied myself mentioning in public for fear of ridicule, discrimination and possible egging.

The focus should have been on Black Gold, a $55m Qatari co-production \u2013 and arguably the most ambitious film shot in the Middle East since Lawrence of Arabia \u2013 which had had its world premiere just days earlier. To the irritation of the organisers, however, it was the right arm of the 1962 epic&apos;s octogenarian breakout star, incensed by a persistent fan, which stole the headlines. Landing less than a year after this diminutive, gas-rich Gulf state contentiously won the right to host the 2022 World Cup, Black Gold symbolises another of the country&apos;s bold attempts to put itself on the map. But while its plans for the football tournament continue to garner column inches (even if almost entirely disapproving), any interest in its cinematic ambitions has all but dried up. Last month, the Doha Film Institute \u2013 the cultural organisation behind the film and festival \u2013 laid off a third of its workforce, the second major round of redundancies in just over a year. Entire departments vanished overnight, as long-term staff members were escorted out of the building. Established in 2010 by Sheikha Mayassa, a member of the royal family, the institute appeared to be doing everything right at first, its reputation instantly enhanced by a partnership with Robert De Niro&apos;s Tribeca. Alongside the festival, which had flown in A-list film stars and journalists from around the world, it planned to foster Arab talent with an impressive education programme led by Oscar-nominated Palestinian director Scandar Copti, and was investing in regional productions through a grants programme. Located in the Katara Cultural Village, a breezy new $2bn complex by the coastline, the DFI had an immediate impact on the local film scene.     Mark Strong and Tahar Rahim in Black Gold (2011) Photograph: Warner Bros/Everett/REX    &quot;In the beginning it was beautiful because it was about getting the community involved and education,&quot; says Mohammed Al-Ibrahim, a former DFI employee who worked in the education department under Copti. But today many of the initiatives have ground to a halt. The seeds of its future could be spied in the fate of Black Gold, the DFI&apos;s pride and joy, which was co-produced by the institute and Tunisian TV and film mogul Tarak Ben Ammar. For all its professional sheen, the film offered a painfully cliched depiction of the Arab world, and failed to use any Middle Eastern names in lead roles, instead turning to Mark Strong (English), Tahar Rahim (French) and Antonio Banderas (Spanish) to don headdresses and kohl. It was given an international release, yet was almost universally panned and failed to recoup a tenth of its spend. &quot;It was a disaster, I was embarrassed,&quot; says Alaa Karkouti, a regional cinema expert and co-founder of Cairo-based film marketing and distribution company MAD Solutions. &quot;Why support this film? Why not an Arabic film? For $55m you can make 50 above-average commercial films in Egypt. Just imagine, 50 films.&quot; Then things fundamentally shifted. Abdulaziz Al Khater, a Qatari plucked from his position as head of operations at the local Al Khaliji Commercial Bank, arrived in October 2012 as DFI&apos;s new CEO; he replaced Amanda Palmer, the Australian former Al-Jazeera presenter who had helped establish the festival and institute. Palmer&apos;s resignation that July fell in line with the recent spate of largely handover-free &quot;localisation&quot; efforts around the Gulf. Among Al Khater&apos;s first task on arrival was to dismiss around 30 DFI employees, something he did via an emailed videolink. &quot;We&apos;re going to be more streamlined,&quot; Al Khater later explains to me. &quot;For a lot of the activities that were required to start up the organisation, the need is no longer there.&quot; But those now emerging from this &quot;re-evaluation&quot;, report a complete shift in focus from the institute&apos;s primary aims.     Abdulaziz Al Khater, CEO of the Doha Film Institute. Photograph: Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for DFI    For Maryam Al-Sahli, a video editor who left DFI in 2013, the vision began to change after just a couple of years. &quot;The management was drifting away from the goal it set itself, tempted by the chance to make the institute a worldwide household name.&quot; Despite the cuts, more people soon joined the institute&apos;s higher ranks, many of them, claim ex-DFI staff, being Al Khatar&apos;s friends and former banking colleagues. Among them was Rajesh Singh, a Singaporean who became director of corporate governance but, according to one insider, was the de facto CEO. Another was Russell Frame, a Scottish legal counsel and former director of defunct Dubai-based publishers The Media Factory, who now oversees co-financing. &quot;[The new employees] weren&apos;t familiar faces in the film industry,&quot; says Karkouti. Last April, Al Khater called time on DFI&apos;s partnership with Tribeca, cancelling the festival after four editions. The news was a shock, but there were murmurings of disquiet behind the scenes. &quot;I heard the split happened on a bad note,&quot; said Al-Ibrahim. &quot;There was a misunderstanding on the top level between the two institutions and it didn&apos;t work out.&quot; Two events were rolled out as replacements. Ajyal, a youth-oriented festival, had more than 400 children \u2013 30% of them Qatari \u2013 as jurors. It was a fraction of the size of the former festival. Many public screenings were reportedly 10% full. Qumra, for first- and second-time directors, was due to take place next month and promised to be a livelier affair. But, a day after the latest redundancies, it was postponed for a year, allowing the institute time for a &quot;realignment of its objectives for 2014&quot;, amid reports it had bitten off more than it could chew and had heavily overspent on Ajyal. &quot;It&apos;s like they&apos;re dealing with a real-estate project,&quot; says Karkouti, adding that for many film-makers, Qatar was becoming a &quot;black spot&quot; on their CVs. Another curious move was the $100m deal DFI made with Participant \u2013 the US production powerhouse behind films such as The Help and Lincoln \u2013 to fund between 12 and 16 feature films over five years. While it generated headlines, the move was a knock to the many Qataris who had struggled to get a fraction of the resources for their own projects. &quot;There was a girl who DFI gave a grant to make her film. It wasn&apos;t more than $5,000, but they gave her hell over it, then a couple of weeks later they&apos;re in the news spending $100m,&quot; says Al-Ibrahim. As yet no films with Participant have been announced, but Al Khater says: &quot;Our primary objective is to help local film-makers and we feel that the exposure to emerging filmmakers from around the world enriches that experience.&quot; Despite streamlining, DFI has expanded its grants to international films, with projects from Panama, Paraguay and Argentina all recent recipients. These were announced from the Berlin film festival, where a large DFI delegation was present, staying at the Ritz Carlton. Sources also revealed that, weeks after the recent layoffs, bonuses were awarded. The DFI&apos;s missed opportunities and departure from its foundations have been felt most by the young Qataris who were originally attracted by its bright lights. &quot;I&apos;m not surprised to see the DFI\u00a0ship sinking,&quot; says Al-Sahli. &quot;When you lose your aim you are destined to crash. Especially if the captain of this ship had no background in film, no sensitivity towards the message of the institute,\u00a0and no sense of responsibility to the task that was assigned to them.&quot;", "title": "Whatever happened to the Qatari film industry?", "sentences": ["Another was Russell Frame, a Scottish legal counsel and former director of defunct Dubai-based publishers The Media Factory, who now oversees co-financing."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-06T18:46:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/06/rebekah-brooks-phone-hacking-trial-secrets", "tags": ["UK news", "Rebekah Brooks"], "article": "Rebekah Brooks on Thursday acknowledged that she and Andy Coulson had been close enough to share secrets with each other during two periods when they are accused of conspiring to produce stories based on intercepted voicemails.

Edis suggested the letter showed that they had been having an affair and sharing secrets for the preceding six years, during which time they published stories about Milly Dowler and David Blunkett which, the crown claims, were generated by hacking phone messages. Brooks repeatedly insisted that although she and Coulson had begun an affair in 1998, it had not continued for six years. The affair had stopped and both of them had got on with their lives before it had resumed briefly in 2003. &quot;I hadn&apos;t been sitting there like Miss Havisham for six years,&quot; she said.

No?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;And that would include secrets relating to work?&quot; &quot;And emotional issues as well.&quot; Edis then referred to another passage in the letter in which Brooks wrote: &quot;For six years I have waited.&quot; &quot;It suggests doesn&apos;t it that the relationship had lasted six years?&quot; Brooks said that was not correct. &quot;You would be telling the truth when you were writing?&quot; &quot;I was in a very emotional state when I wrote this letter.&quot; &quot;That&apos;s all the more reason why you would be telling the truth. It&apos;s your heart-felt anguish.&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;Which is absolutely genuine.&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; He went on to repeat that the letter suggested they had had an affair for six years. Brooks replied: &quot;That&apos;s not true \u2026 Andy had got on with his life. I&apos;m clearly saying that it has been six years since we had got together\u2026 I had gone out, got married, tried to have a baby, got on with my life. &quot;The emotional feeling that I had towards Andy obviously came out in the letter. But we didn&apos;t have an affair for six years. We were close friends, good friends.&quot; Edis turned to the state of their relationship in April 2002, when the crown claims that Brooks and Coulson plotted to use voicemail intercepted from the phone of the missing Surrey schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Brooks was then editor of the News of the World but Coulson, her deputy, was editing the paper while she was on holiday in Dubai. &quot;At that time were you talking with him in that confidential way?&quot; &quot;We were close friends.&quot; &quot;So you would trust each other?&quot; &quot;I trusted him as a friend and as a deputy editor.&quot; &quot;If the deputy editor was committing a crime, he might not want the editor in normal circumstances to find out about it. But he might be able to tell the editor if he really trusted her.&quot; Edis paused. &quot;Was the relationship in April 2002 such that Mr Coulson could trust you with any confidence at all?&quot; &quot;Yes,&quot; she whispered. Edis then asked her about August 2004 when, the court has heard, Coulson, as editor of the News of the World, revealed an affair between David Blunkett and a woman whose name he withheld; and Brooks, as editor of the Sun, followed up the next day by naming the woman as Kimberly Quinn, publisher of the Spectator magazine. The crown claims that Coulson obtained the story from messages which Blunkett had left on Quinn&apos;s phone and that he then passed her identity to Brooks. Brooks has told the jury that she wrote her letter to Coulson in February 2004 after he had told her he wanted to end their second period of physical intimacy. In the letter, she wrote that this meant that: &quot;I can&apos;t discuss my worries, concerns, problems at work with you any more.&quot; Edis put it to her that by August 2004, they were &quot;back talking confidentially to each other by then?&quot; &quot;We were certainly talking.&quot; &quot;But in that confidential way?&quot; &quot;I think we were back to confiding, particularly on an emotional level by that stage.&quot; Edis then showed her the billing record for a mobile phone which Coulson was using in August 2004 which showed that he had phoned Brooks immediately before he met Blunkett in Sheffield to tell him he planned to publish a story about his affair. &quot;Do you remember what he was saying to you?&quot; Brooks said she could not remember, that Coulson had often called or texted her at the beginning of the day. Edis said: &quot;He is in Sheffield, going to see a cabinet minister. Surely he told you that.&quot; &quot;No. He didn&apos;t,&quot; she replied. She went to say that she thought she had come up with Quinn&apos;s name after checking stories which had previously been published which mentioned that Quinn knew Blunkett and that, based on that suspicion, she had &quot;taken a punt&quot; and called Blunkett&apos;s special adviser, Huw Evans, to persuade him to confirm that she was right. Edis said: &quot;You would have to take a punt if you knew it was a phone-hacking story.&quot; &quot;I didn&apos;t know it was a phone-hacking story,&quot; she said. &quot;Didn&apos;t you?&quot; Brooks and Coulson deny conspiring to intercept communications.

Since then, he has acted as global chairman for climate change and sustainability services at the consultancy KPMG, but he is now leaving to take up a new post as director-general of the Global Green Growth Institute. De Boer told the Guardian: &quot;It&apos;s about implementation now. We need to focus on helping countries to formulate programmes they can take to the bank, working with countries to tap into finance mechanisms that are out there [for their low-carbon projects].&quot; He said key sources of finance were still largely untapped, including pension funds, which he said had a clear interest in long-term investments that would help to head off the worst dangers of climate change. The UN-sponsored Green Climate Fund would also provide a strong source of finance, de Boer predicted, though the slow progress on setting up the fund and disbursing cash has frustrated many international green campaigners. But de Boer said that &quot;non-state actors&quot; from the private sector would also play a key role in the future, by cutting their own greenhouse gas emissions and helping others to do the same. &quot;Private sector organisations have a lot of knowledge in this area, and they are focused on delivery,&quot; he said. Based in Seoul and partly funded by the South Korean government, the Global Green Growth Institute has operations in 32 countries, conducting macro-economic assessments of how countries can move to a greener economy, and fianncing projects that forward these aims. De Boer will serve a four-year term starting on April 15. The UN negotiations, which de Boer led as executive secretary of the UNFCCC, are now approaching a critical phase. Next Monday, work will begin among all the world&apos;s governments on drafting a text for a potential new agreement on the climate, to take effect from 2020. The new treaty or legally binding pact \u2013 the exact form has yet to be decided \u2013 and which is being championed by de Boer&apos;s successor, Christiana Figueres, would be the first to bind both developed and developing countries to a long-term low-carbon future. But there is still little agreement on how the accord should take shape, and countries must come up with plans for drastic emissions cuts before a crunch meeting in Paris late next year. De Boer said that the talks were vital but that there should also be an emphasis on making a difference through practical projects to reduce emissions. &quot;At a time when so much of the international focus seems to be on the negotiations, I look forward to working with countries on delivering [a low-carbon future] that is not just in national interests but in the global interest.&quot; The GGGI has about 100 staff, with offices in Copenhagen, London and Dubai as well as Seoul. De Boer said: &quot;The GGGI&apos;s work can add value to creating prosperity at a time when humans are experiencing challenges such as climate change, energy, water, population growth, and an increase in urbanisation.

The Armory Show opened on Wednesday, on the piers of the Hudson River. A large crowd of collectors, curators, advisers and groupies charged through a notably strong edition of the city\u2019s largest art fair. Many, though, had already had a full helping of contemporary art across town, at the Whitney Museum of American Art.  The Whitney Biennial, the city\u2019s leading museum show of contemporary art, opened the day before \u2013 opening-night crowds for the perplexing, all-over-the-shop exhibition waited for half an hour or more to get inside. This is the first year since 2004 that New York\u2019s most prominent commercial and non-commercial platforms for contemporary art have fallen in the same week, However, while the Armory and the Whitney Biennial would pack an art-lover\u2019s schedule on their own, there is even more to choose from. The Armory Show is only the biggest of 10 fairs, including the blue-chip ADAA Art Show and the young, scruffy Independent. The Whitney Biennial has a spinoff in the form of the Brucennial, a rammed exhibition featuring around 600 female artists. (Women\u2019s representation had been getting better in recent Whitney Biennials, but they account for less than a third of the artists at the museum this year.)         Trailer for the Brucennial, which ends this year.    It keeps going. The week\u2019s openings have also included a Gauguin exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art; a vital show on art and civil rights in the 1960s at the Brooklyn Museum; three large solo presentations at PS1, MoMA\u2019s hipper kid sister in Queens; and untold numbers of openings at commercial galleries. Then there are auctions at Sotheby\u2019s, Christie\u2019s and Phillips, for collectors who still have money to burn. The 2014 Whitney Biennial, the museum\u2019s 77th edition, is a relatively large one. It includes work by 103 participants, splashed across three floors plus the lobby, basement, stairwell and elevators, and sites around town. Diverse to the point of incoherence, it does gel around a few themes.  There\u2019s a good amount of abstract painting, such as from the Brooklyn-based artist Amy Sillman, as well as sculptures made of ceramic or fabric, such as a tumbling multi-colored tower of yarn from the 80-year-old Sheila Hicks. Numerous works involve archival research or presentations of historical material, such as a project by Joseph Grigley showcasing ephemera from a murdered art critic. There\u2019s also lots \u2013 really, lots \u2013 of sex and nudity, much of it homoerotic, most impressively in a nightmarish installation from the workaholic Norwegian artist Bjarne Melgaard (subject of a recent uproar involving Dasha Zhukova and racial insensitivity). There are a few oddball inclusions, such as the late author David Foster Wallace, whose notebooks for his novel The Pale King are displayed like relics.     Mother, by Amy Sillman. John Beren/Whitney Museum of American Art    Early reviews have not been kind. Unlike in previous iterations, the biennial\u2019s three curators did not collaborate on a single presentation but worked on discrete sections individually. That independence may have contributed to the wildly divergent quality of work on display, according to Joshua Decter, a curator and the author of a new book, Art is a Problem. \u201cIt probably would have been more productive for the three curators to have actually collaborated closely on one show, rather than each doing their own quasi-autonomous shows,\u201d said Decter, who has attended every biennial since 1977. \u201cThe result may have actually been similar, but a more rigorous collaborative process might have led to a refining of each curator\u2019s selections, and demanded of each to make useful edits and compromises.\u201d The Armory Show, by contrast, beat expectations. Hunted these past two years by the new Frieze New York fair, Armory has made a substantial push under its young director, Noah Horowitz, to refresh itself with a more rigorous selection process and a more international scope. The result is a fair finding its footing again after years of its future being in doubt. Several dealers have booths with just a single artist, often showing not evidently commercial work. The booth of Marianne Boesky Gallery, for example, is overtaken by a riotous construction of interconnected black wood planks by Serge Alain Nitegeka, an artist born in Burundi and based in South Africa. Alison Jacques, a London dealer, has given her booth over to the Brazilian artist Fernanda Gomes, whose art consists of minimal, almost offhand interventions in the gallery: a twig, a glass of water, a ping-pong ball. This year\u2019s Armory also includes a section devoted to Chinese art that features 17 galleries, nine of which have never shown outside of Asia. There\u2019s a commissioned artwork from the Shanghai-born provocateur Xu Zhen, consisting of a white cube with performers locked inside, chucking sculptures into the air. It works as a parody of the typical art fair experience, with the art glimpsed only for a second before disappearing again.     Xu Zhen's Art of Change installation. Photograph: The Armory Show    The China programming has been organized by Philip Tinari, the director of the Ullens Center for Contemporary Art in Beijing. It also includes an educational symposium on Chinese contemporary art. As recently as a few years ago, a museum director organizing part of an art fair would have felt bizarre. Today, with the market in perpetual boom, it feels almost conventional. \u201cI think we all have to learn how to make peace with the art fairs,\u201d Tinari says. \u201cIt\u2019s not that you ally with them infinitely, but this felt to me like a productive insertion at this time. And what institutions are really going to show these artists in New York now?  \u201cThat\u2019s one of the great things about the fair in New York. It\u2019s unlike Dubai, or even Miami. It\u2019s not just the black-card holders. It\u2019s the rank and file of the profession, it\u2019s all these students. You have an audience that feels real.\u201d The overlapping of commercial and non-commercial, the market and the museum, has been the dominant theme of this art-saturated week. The Whitney Biennial\u2019s curators have positioned their show in opposition to the booming art market, with many works from artist collectives and almost nothing from the large galleries of Chelsea. Yet the simultaneous opening of Armory, and all the other shows and sales, has highlighted the ongoing convergence of the two sectors.     Basin Theology/Butterfly Wreck, by Sterling Ruby. Photograph: Robert Wedemeyer/Whitney Museum of American Art    The biennial, after all, is sponsored in part by Sotheby\u2019s, and many of the auction house\u2019s clients packed the Tuesday night opening while hundreds of others (including at least one former Whitney Biennial curator) queued in the cold outside. Works by several biennial artists, including Sterling Ruby and Channa Horwitz, could be bought at Armory or Independent; the biennial catalogue\u2019s acknowledgements section thanks dozens of galleries. Michelle Grabner, one of the three biennial curators, is herself a painter \u2013 her work is on sale at the Armory Show. The seemingly unstoppable proliferation of the art market, and the continued push of commercial enterprises into terrain that was once just for museums, has forced curators of biennials and other non-commercial shows to rethink their roles. But by the fifth day of New York\u2019s stuffed contemporary art week, it was unclear just what role the Whitney Biennial still played in defining American art in a global, money-soaked ecosystem.  \u201cThe Armory Show now deploys intellectual window-dressing to give it some cosmopolitan street cred,\u201d Decter observed. \u201cAnd the Whitney Biennial is still in search of itself.\u201d", "title": "Whitney Biennial and the Armory Show: New York's busiest art week", "sentences": ["It\u2019s unlike Dubai, or even Miami."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-07T17:01:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/07/oscar-pistorius-gun-car-sunroof-ex-girlfriend-court", "tags": ["Reeva Steenkamp shooting", "South Africa", "Oscar Pistorius", "World news", "Sport"], "article": "Oscar Pistorius fired a gun through the roof of a car in a fit of petulance after an argument with a police officer, his ex-girlfriend told a court on Friday. As the Paralympic sprinter stared coldly at her from the dock, Samantha Taylor testified that he carried a gun with him &quot;all the time&quot; when they were dating. It was the latest piece of evidence to call Pistorius&apos;s character into question at the end of a dramatic first week in a murder trial that could only be more tense if South Africa still imposed the death penalty. Millions of TV viewers watched the prosecution and defence trade blows over what happened on the night one of the world&apos;s most famous sportsmen shot dead his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp, a law graduate, model and reality TV star. The public also had unprecedented access to the grilling of star witnesses and the emotional reactions of Pistorius sitting in the dock, debating every twist and turn of proceedings in real time on Twitter. Some critics have found the televised trial salacious and obtrusive. After week one, there are strong opinions on both sides but few would dare to predict the judge&apos;s verdict on Pistorius, a double amputee known as the &quot;blade runner&quot; because of his prosthetic limbs. Along with the murder charge, Pistorius is being tried for three firearms offences, presumably so the prosecution can build a picture of him as hot-headed and reckless with guns. On one of these counts, Taylor, who was nervous and tearful on the witness stand, claimed that an angry Pistorius had fired his pistol out of a car&apos;s open sun-roof after a heated argument with a police officer in September 2012. Taylor said she, Pistorius and a friend, Darren Fresco, had been pulled over by a policeman for speeding. When he saw Pistorius&apos;s pistol lying on the car seat, the officer picked it up and emptied its magazine on to the floor of the car, prompting an outburst from Pistorius, she said. When they were allowed to go on their way, Pistorius and Fresco started to joke about shooting out a &quot;robot&quot; \u2013 a South African term for a traffic light. &quot;Oscar was very angry,&quot; said Taylor, who was sitting in the back seat at the time. &quot;Thereafter they were joking around and saying they wanted to shoot a robot. Two minutes after, I saw Oscar take his gun and shoot out of the car roof. A very loud sound. They both laughed.&quot; Taylor&apos;s testimony comes two days after the court heard that Pistorius accidentally fired a pistol under the table in a packed Johannesburg restaurant \u2013 close to a child \u2013 and then asked Fresco to take the blame. Taylor described two other incidents in which Pistorius drew his gun. The first was when he jumped out of his car at the gateway of his Pretoria housing complex and put his gun to the window of a black BMW that appeared to have been following him. The second was when he woke up in the middle of the night after hearing a bang in the bathroom. &quot;There was one occasion when something hit the bathroom window and Oscar woke me up and asked me if I heard it,&quot; Taylor said, noting that the noise had probably been generated by a passing storm. &quot;He got up with his gun and walked out of the room.&quot; Taylor said she was 17 when she started dating Pistorius and spent four nights a week at his home. Asked why they broke up on 4 November 2012, Taylor told the court: &quot;He cheated on me with Reeva Steenkamp.&quot; According to the defence lawyer Barry Roux, Taylor had sent an email to Pistorius apologising for cheating on him. She explained that there had been an &quot;altercation&quot; over a trip she took to Dubai with a man in 2012 when Pistorius was taking part in the London Paralympics, but she was not Pistorius&apos;s girlfriend at that time. the court revisited the events of 14 February 2013, when Steenkamp died. Pieter Baba, who was on guard duty at the gated community where Pistorius lived, said he called the athlete after hearing gunshots in the early hours. He said Pistorius told him: &quot;Security, everything is fine.&quot; Through an Afrikaans interpreter, Baba added: &quot;That&apos;s when I realised that Mr Pistorius was crying. That&apos;s when I said to Jacob [a colleague], not everything is in order as Mr Pistorius was telling me.&quot; A few minutes later Pistorius called him back, Baba said. &quot;Maybe he wasn&apos;t sure about calling me back. He just started crying over the phone. That&apos;s when the line went off.&quot; Roux pressed Baba on whether he could recall if Pistorius had said he was fine or everything was fine. Baba insisted: &quot;Mr Pistorius&apos;s exact words were: &apos;Security, everything is fine&apos;.&quot; Steenkamp died after being hit by three of four rounds fired by Pistorius from a 9mm pistol through the door of a toilet cubicle in an upstairs bathroom in his luxury home in a Pretoria gated community. The shooting stunned South Africa and millions of Pistorius fans around the world. The 27-year-old denies murder, saying it was a tragic accident and that he mistook her for an intruder. If found guilty, he is likely to spend at least 25 years behind bars. &quot;A man&apos;s life is at stake,&quot; Roux told one witness this week, urging him to consider every possible explanation for what he had heard. Based on the evidence of the first week, it appears there were two sets of noises heard by neighbours. The defence claims that the first noises were the four gunshots fired that night, while the second noises were the sound of a desperate Pistorius smashing down the bathroom door in an attempt to save Steenkamp. The prosecution holds that the second noises were in fact the shots, and is yet to explain what the first set was. Neighbours have testified to hearing &quot;bloodcurdling screams&quot; that suggested a woman knew she was in mortal danger. The defence is making the unexpected claim that Pistorius screams like a woman when he is anxious and therefore neighbours confused his cries for help with those of a female victim. It remains to be seen how this assertion will be put to the test. Roux has quizzed witnesses in minute detail about their testimonies, patiently probing for any contradictions and homing in on any minor discrepancy, sometimes with sarcasm that some observers have found patronising. The prosecutor Gerrie Nel is yet to reveal his full hand in seeking to prove that this is a case of premeditated murder following an argument. He has previously made a case that, irrespective of who he believed was behind the toilet door, Pistorius shot with the intent to kill and is therefore bound to be convicted of murder. The trial has also given South Africans an insight into the workings of the criminal justice system; more than 70% told a TV poll that they had found it educational. Some have been surprised by the tough grilling given to witnesses. There has also been the spectacle of an accused man sobbing and at one point retching on live television. The witnesses so far have included a university lecturer, a radiologist and a professional boxer, all but one of whom have been white. Together they have offered a glimpse of a slice of South African society, including its heavily guarded gated communities where it seems everyone goes to bed by 10pm. Not everything has gone smoothly: one broadcaster was reprimanded for showing a photo of a witness who did not wish to be identified, while Roux said sorry for reading out the phone number of a witness who subsequently received numerous calls and messages. There have also been awkward moments as the Pistorius and Steenkamp families, sitting directly in front of the media, can at times hear journalists&apos; indiscreet banter. The case continues with the main piece of theatre yet to come: Pistorius taking the witness stand under the world&apos;s gaze.", "title": "Oscar Pistorius fired gun through car sunroof in anger, says ex-girlfriend", "sentences": ["She explained that there had been an &quot;altercation&quot; over a trip she took to Dubai with a man in 2012 when Pistorius was taking part in the London Paralympics, but she was not Pistorius&apos;s girlfriend at that time."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-07T18:59:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/mar/07/dublin-property-bubble-house-price-boom", "tags": ["Property", "Ireland", "Europe", "Money", "World news", "Business"], "article": "The Irish capital is at the centre of a new house price boom, according to a survey this week that named Dublin as the world&apos;s fifth fastest rising property market, and raised concerns over a new asset bubble in the republic. The banks of the River Liffey are hosting a resurgent property market that is exceeded only by Jakarta, Auckland, Bali and Christchurch, said estate agency Knight Frank. Its report on global house prices found that Dublin property prices rose faster than Los Angeles, Tokyo and Dubai, with values increasing by 17.5% in 2013 compared with the previous year. However, a population scarred by the consequences of its last property boom \u2013 a \u20ac67.5bn (\u00a356bn) rescue loan from a trio of international lenders \u2013 is wary of signs of a house market recovery. A group representing thousands of Irish mortgage holders has raised concerns over the price increases, pointing to thousands of repossessed properties that are not on the market and whose absence from estate agents&apos; windows could be holding up the prices of houses that are being sold. David Hall, a co-founder of the Irish Mortgage Holders Association campaign group, said the latest figures on mortgage arrears this year showed that there were 1,600 empty properties held by the Irish banks that were not on the market. He also pointed out that Nama \u2013 the state agency which bought thousands of properties abandoned by banks and builders after the 2008 financial crash \u2013 has held back 14,000 properties from entering the market. As a consequence, house prices are higher, said Hall, who added that price increases for commercial and domestic properties in Dublin had been &quot;very patchy&quot; as some homeowners continued to suffer from the after effects of the credit crunch. Property prices in rich Dublin postcodes such as D14 may have increased by 22% last year, but tens of thousands of Irish mortgage holders are still in arrears and the hikes in the cost of a house are restricted to the richer suburbs of the Irish capital, especially south of the Liffey. House prices are surging in affluent areas of south Dublin such as Clonskeagh, with a three-bed bungalow in the area fetching \u20ac740,000 \u2013 an increase of two-thirds on a similar property nine months earlier. Outside the capital, property prices remain stagnant at best. A 10-bedroom house in Monaghan, near the border with Northern Ireland, is being sold for \u20ac90,000. Yet for a small country such as the Republic it is the scale of the mortgage arrears which will temper any talk about a new property boom. By the end of 2013 the total value of mortgage arrears in the Republic was \u20ac2.1bn, including \u20ac1.8bn owned by borrowers who had fallen behind in their payments for more than a year. Hall also referred to a report by the global ratings agency Fitch, which predicted further mortgage repossessions this year. Fitch said one in five houses where mortgages had been in arrears for more than three months could be repossessed. There are still 700 &quot;ghost estates&quot;, the name given to empty private housing estates built during the boom, many of them mini-new towns constructed around the edges of greater Dublin. Hailing Ireland&apos;s exit from its bailout in December, the country&apos;s finance minister, Michael Noonan, said the nation had emerged from its worst crisis since the potato famine. Warning that there must be no more debt-fuelled property sprees, he said: &quot;We can&apos;t go mad again.&quot; The Knight Frank report is raising concerns that the wrong kind of economic recovery is on the way, with thousands of homeowners still struggling on the sidelines.", "title": "Dublin house price boom sparks fears over asset bubble", "sentences": ["Its report on global house prices found that Dublin property prices rose faster than Los Angeles, Tokyo and Dubai, with values increasing by 17.5% in 2013 compared with the previous year."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-07T20:08:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/mar/08/tennis-jet-set-complain-burnout-novak-djokovic", "tags": ["Tennis", "Roger Federer", "Maria Sharapova", "Andy Murray", "Novak Djokovic", "Rafael Nadal", "Sport"], "article": "When four undoubtedly wise and indisputably rich men from the East, plus their lawyers, gathered in the luxurious Oberoi hotel in Dubai (having failed to find a manger, apparently) to lavish gifts on the world&apos;s best players, one man \u2013 probably richer than they were \u2013 proved a little wiser. Roger Federer&apos;s capacity for holiness remains undimmed. The previous day he had delighted his followers by reaching into his past to beat Tomas Berdych in the final of the Duty Free Open, which conjured images of the Swiss having to show his passport before accepting the trophy. It was his first success since Halle, the German grass hit-up just before Wimbledon. The owner of 17 slam titles appeared to be back. What a catch he would be for the International Premier Tennis League. However, Federer (who owns an apartment in Dubai) had left the building. The franchise owners then had their Sunday cattle market, with none of the beasts present. &quot;I want to see whether it takes off or not,&quot; Federer said, blessing the venture without investing his talent in it. Nor did Maria Sharapova, the money magnet of the women&apos;s game, she of the sugar, take the lure. Li Na, who holds the keys to China, where lie untold riches, was not convinced either. Max Eisenbud, who looks after the commercial welfare of Sharapova and Li Na, said: &quot;I just don&apos;t see how it could ever work, but I hope I am wrong.&quot; They all reckoned this was a tournament too far: three weeks in four cities across Asia and tacked on to the end of an 11-month schedule in the one window the players could call their own. It sent echoes of La Grande Bouffe, the\u00a070s cinematic monument to death by wilful excess. So, the rich, wise men \u2013 yet to be identified \u2013 returned to their banks with the signatures of Andy Murray, Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams and Victoria Azarenka to star on an impressive roster of current players, alongside a small swag of legends from the past, including Andre Agassi (they hoped) and Pete Sampras (likewise). Nobody is blaming the players for taking the money; it&apos;s what they do all year round. Nobody wishes the gamble ill; without these entrepreneurs, professional sport would die. But the exercise obliges us never again to heed the complaints of players about the physical and mental demands of their brutal sport. Burn-out, they scream, the catch-cry of the modern millionaire athlete. Boo-hoo, comes the retort from the shadows. Murray said we didn&apos;t understand the overload argument: it wasn&apos;t that they didn&apos;t want to play tennis, they just didn&apos;t want to play tennis every time the ATP wanted them to play tennis. In other words, the players wanted it on their own terms, even if they were knackered. A year ago in Indian Wells, Nadal, who had embarked on possibly the game&apos;s great comeback, said this: &quot;The ATP has to start thinking about ways to lengthen the players&apos; careers.&quot; He was citing the fact that the Tour featured 37 out of 58 tournaments on hard courts, the surface that has slowly wrecked his knees; 20 years earlier, there were 26 out of 85 events on the surface. The significant shift to playing on more of these unforgiving courts (which are easier to maintain than grass or clay) has brought uniformity to the Tour and encouraged the attritional tennis that purists deplore, as well as making a lot of TV executives and advertisers very happy. Nadal won Indian Wells, incidentally, beating Federer in the quarters and Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro in the final. The Spaniard won another nine tournaments in 2013, including two slams, bringing his tally of majors to 13, four behind Federer. His knees did not like the surface, he repeated, but he was still good enough on it to win. &quot;At the end,&quot; he said, &quot;it&apos;s an individual game. At the end, everybody thinks for himself.&quot; Federer, whose gift for untroubled longevity is peerless, suffered a rare back strain in Indian Wells, and took seven weeks off. Nadal, not long back from his seven-month rehab, headed home to his beloved European clay. They are back in the Californian sun this weekend. Federer, Nadal and Del Potro, who is managing an injured left wrist, doing their job along with Murray, Djokovic, the new slam champion Stanislas Wawrinka, and a good cast of contenders. There will be the odd twinge, maybe a retirement or three, and the caravan will move on. It gets no easier, but the rewards are there, in 1,000 ranking points and $1million for winning it. It is a hard gig \u2013 and not a bad life, which they happily concede. And still they whinge. After Djokovic beat Nadal in the final scheduled match of the 2013 season, at the ATP World Tour Finals in London, he said he was &quot;totally exhausted&quot;. He picked himself up to represent Serbia in the Davis Cup final a few days later \u2013 then got on a plane and flew 7,000 miles to South America for a lucrative exhibition tour with Nadal. We admire them for their outrageous talent and their commitment. But we ought to be left in no doubt: they do it for themselves, as Nadal said. While professional athletes exist in an imaginary bubble created by their fans as untouchable heroes, they are businessmen too. They maximise the return on their gifts \u2013 as we all try to do in our humble and varied ways \u2013 but the well of sympathy for them will surely run dry when they go on holidays wearing their work clothes.", "title": "Why it's rich for the tennis jet set to complain about burn-out | Kevin Mitchell", "sentences": ["When four undoubtedly wise and indisputably rich men from the East, plus their lawyers, gathered in the luxurious Oberoi hotel in Dubai (having failed to find a manger, apparently) to lavish gifts on the world&apos;s best players, one man \u2013 probably richer than they were \u2013 proved a little wiser.", "However, Federer (who owns an apartment in Dubai) had left the building."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-08T16:23:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/09/tiger-woods-back-problems-curtail-powers", "tags": ["Tiger Woods", "Adam Scott", "Golf", "Sport", "US sports"], "article": "There is a school of thought which suggests Tiger Woods is prone to embellishing his injury problems. It is not one which carries too much merit; complete knee reconstruction added to the back problems which will logically afflict someone who has swung a golf club with great ferocity from the childhood moment he was able to do so render it impossible for Woods to be in peak condition at 38. Woods may actually be in worse condition than he has been willing to let on, given his reduction in playing time \u2013 competitively and otherwise \u2013 in recent months. &quot;Sometimes I am able to self-adjust when I am on the course and I will just feel better,&quot; Woods explains. &quot;Other times, you have just got to deal with it. &quot;When I have had my injuries over the years, it has always been after impact. So it&apos;s fine, the ball has gone. It would hurt like hell but the ball is gone. With that, I can deliver the club, deliver the final moment to the ball and hit the shot I wanted to hit. &quot;It would hurt like hell afterwards. I played that way for years. With my back, it is a totally different deal. There are certain movements you just can&apos;t do. That&apos;s one of the things I have had to learn about this injury; it is very different.&quot; Woods is still box office. Love him or loathe him, it is impossible to take your eyes off Woods whenever he plays; galleries and television viewing figures prove that much. His erratic on-course touch, though, supplies the perfect evidence that he is beyond the peak of his powers. Injury is the most pertinent factor in that. This is the new reality: Woods is going to struggle to find consistency because his body will not allow it. Now, in public, Woods is basically acknowledging as much. From round to round, let alone tournament to tournament, it is impossible to know which Tiger will show up. He started the year with disappointing performances in Dubai and, more notably, the Torrey Pines venue where he has profited so much in the past. At the Honda Classic, a stunning 65 on Saturday was followed up by a front nine of 40 and withdrawal a day later. Those who claim Woods walked from the course after 13 holes solely to divert attention from a bad score fail to understand the strength of his competitive instinct. By making an early exit, Woods automatically gave up his chances of winning the Vardon Trophy for the year&apos;s best scoring average on the PGA Tour. Woods&apos;s prominence at the WGC-Cadillac Championship owed plenty to a superb putting performance. In days of old, the 14-times major winner could drive the ball further and putt better than any field. Neither is routinely the case any more; other than in flashes such as here in Florida. Before he even started round four, Woods had hit only 60% of greens in regulation. His driving accuracy sat at 54%. More telling was Woods&apos;s position as the most successful putter in the field. Even at this event, an opening 76 was in stark contrast to the brilliant 66 in round three which hauled him back into contention. Woods dismisses the suggestion that too much gym work has played a part in the reduction of his dominance. Hank Haney, his former coach, has consistently claimed that Woods has been overly harsh on his body. &quot;All the muscle stuff we do is preventative stuff,&quot; Woods says. &quot;I used to be bigger than I am now. I&apos;m actually much smaller than I used to be. So it&apos;s not what people might think it to be, put it that way.&quot; Amid Woods&apos;s fitness toils, a batch of his fellow players have more hope than before. Phil Mickelson is playing the finest golf of his career at 43. Adam Scott has spoken about his belief that this is the time for a new generation, also including Justin Rose, to dominate. Rory McIlroy is younger still and is certain to win more majors and Jordan Spieth displayed absolutely no sense of trepidation when playing with Woods at the Farmers Insurance Open and carding 71-63. Woods does not scare opponents anything like he once did. Not that he doesn&apos;t try; with an entire range to work on before round four, Woods parked himself right beside the overnight leader, Patrick Reed. On face value, it is a long shot that Woods will end a major drought, which sits at six years, at the Masters next month. Augusta National is a punishing enough venue for consistent players, let alone someone in Woods&apos;s erratic state. This is a golfer who specialises in defying the odds. The difference is that when he did it before, it was in a strong physical state. That is clearly diminished, which is far more important to Woods&apos;s dreams of matching the major haul of Jack Nicklaus than many onlookers have chosen to acknowledge. In truth, it is the one key factor.", "title": "Tiger Woods admits that latest back problems have curtailed his powers", "sentences": ["He started the year with disappointing performances in Dubai and, more notably, the Torrey Pines venue where he has profited so much in the past."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-09T19:27:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/mar/10/the-prisoner-x-case-highlights-why-australians-deserve-more-transparency", "tags": ["Israel", "Australia news", "Foreign policy", "Australian politics"], "article": "The suicide of Melbourne man Ben Zygier, also known as \u201cPrisoner X\u201d, in a high security Israeli jail cell in 2010, is not the only secret that raises questions at the highest level of Australia\u2019s government. We are poorer as a nation for the lack of transparency, and the mystery surrounding the Australian government\u2019s apparent indifference to his fate is a prime example of official obfuscation. Australia has many secrets which are kept hidden for good reasons, but our security and military agencies would be strengthened \u2013 not weakened \u2013 if we knew more. Another example is our secret soldiers. As Australia\u2019s war in Afghanistan headed toward its peak, successive governments talked again about creating a secret force, nominally controlled by the military, but directed by our spy agencies. One Canberra source told me they would be a covert offensive force \u2013 \u201cwhat we don\u2019t have, what we needed,\u201d he said. It had been part of a defence submission to cabinet, and it had gathered dust in a bottom draw. Such a force would be a dramatic development because current law does not allow our spies such an attacking military role, and as far as we know Australia does not have any spies trained and permitted to fight like soldiers. But we know nothing about this secret force, and we likely never will. I\u2019ve not reported before on these secret soldiers, and there are many other operations that are never revealed inside our impossible-to-navigate network of military and intelligence agencies. These proposals and operations are done in Australia\u2019s name, and could arguably further our national interests. But whether or not they do further our national interests, is not an argument we are permitted to have. The trail on this story ran cold for me, but I did subsequently uncover and report on a force of SAS soldiers whose existence had never before been revealed. The Special Air Service\u2019s 4 Squadron had been involved in work in Africa, on security and surveillance tasks that had irked some within our spy agencies. I have much sympathy for the argument that the bulk of such matters must remain secret. However, if examples like new ways for our spies to fight and the treatment of Zygier have been issues considered by successive Australian prime ministers, why are such matters never publicly addressed? Why have politicians and spy chiefs never answered any questions about these matters? Zygier had gone to live in Israel, fought in its army, and then joined its feared intelligence agency Mossad. While undercover for Israel, he worked inside a European company to try and penetrate Iran\u2019s military and its nuclear program. He did this using Australian passports, one of which he\u2019d used to get a visa at the Italian consulate in Melbourne. Later, on leave from his Mossad work, Zygier returned to Melbourne to study at Monash University in 2009. Concerned by Zygier\u2019s misuse of his passport, he was followed by Australian intelligence and his phone calls were monitored. Months later, he was arrested in Israel. The reason his arrest could have been high on the Australian governments agenda is that just two days later, the world was told of a spectacular Mossad assassination in Dubai. When the Hamas leader was killed in the Gulf state, the Israelis used three fake Australian passports among others. Curiously, this involved stealing the identity of three Melbourne Jews who had gone to live in Israel, just as Zygier had done. This misuse of Australian passports set up of a year of tension, with Australia\u2019s national security establishment furious with Israel. Mossad\u2019s man in Canberra was expelled, and the ALP government confirmed for the first time that Israel had misused Australia\u2019s passports before.  ASIO chief David Irvine was sent to Israel to try and get some answers. Despite ASIO\u2019s position at the centre of this stand-off, despite their concerns about Zygier\u2019s misuse of his passport, the agency does not appear to have pushed for Zygier\u2019s case to be discussed by our elected representatives. This is more than strange at a time when Israel\u2019s misuse of passports was \u201can abuse of our national sovereignty\u201d, according to then foreign minister Stephen Smith. As far as we know Zygier\u2019s illegal use of his Australian passports, and his surveillance by Australian agencies, was never passed on to any minister other than then attorney general Robert McClelland. Even more curiously, the attorney general never raised it with his cabinet colleagues. As I show in my book Prisoner X, it seems considerable Australian resources were used to track Zygier in Melbourne in 2009, but when he was arrested no one told then prime minister Kevin Rudd, nor his successor, Julia Gillard. To say this is odd is an understatement. Those who were told inside the Canberra bureaucracy at the time include our current ambassadors to China and Indonesia and Dennis Richardson, currently the top public servant in the defence department.  For various reasons, including not recollecting being told, relevant ministers weren\u2019t told.  I tried and failed, formally and informally, to interview various politicians and bureaucrats about this curious lack of joining-the-dots at the very apex of Australia\u2019s political and security establishment. I never received a reply anywhere close to an answer. In opposition, Julie Bishop believed these were important concerns. In March last year, she said during an interview: \u201cInterestingly, this was at the very time that the Australian government was in a lather about Australian passports being used by Israeli intelligence agencies. So somebody must have thought maybe there was a connection, maybe there are questions to ask.\u201d We only now about Canberra\u2019s curious lack of curiosity because of an internal DFAT inquiry, instigated by then foreign minister Bob Carr. He\u2019d unknowingly misled the ABC saying the government only learnt of Zygier\u2019s incarceration at the time of his death. Zygier\u2019s family never requested consular assistance, and any Australian discussion of his fate may not have changed the sad end to his life. But Australians deserve better than the retort from Carr when he was pressed about these strange facts: \u201cListen pal, I wasn\u2019t in the parliament at that time, I can\u2019t shed any more light on it!\u201d. Other politicians were there, with access to Australia\u2019s most closely held secrets, and we don\u2019t know if they asked the questions they should have. Perhaps on this matter, and others, there is too much that the public just don\u2019t know, and are simply not told.", "title": "The Prisoner X case highlights why Australians deserve more transparency  | Rafael Epstein", "sentences": ["The reason his arrest could have been high on the Australian governments agenda is that just two days later, the world was told of a spectacular Mossad assassination in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-10T01:13:11Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/10/thailand-trade-fake-passports-crime-gangs-world", "tags": ["Thailand", "Immigration and asylum", "UK news", "Crime", "Human trafficking", "Organised crime", "Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "World news"], "article": "On 30 November 2010, a 39-year-old Pakistani national named Muhammed Ather &quot;Tony&quot; Butt was detained with his Thai girlfriend, Sirikalya Kitbamrung, as they were crossing into Laos from the north-eastern Thai province of Nong Khai. Later that same day, officers from Thailand&apos;s Department of Special Investigations arrested a second Pakistani, Zezan Azzan Butt, 27, in the Rat Burana district of Bangkok. At about the same time, on the other side of the globe, Spanish police were swooping on a series of addresses in Barcelona, arresting six Pakistanis and one Nigerian. The raids were the culmination of a major joint operation, codenamed Alpha, between Thai and Spanish investigators, prompted by the discovery that a suspected member of the al-Qaida-inspired terror cell responsible for several attacks in Madrid \u2013 including the 2004 M-11 train bombings, which killed 191 people and left 1,800 injured \u2013 was travelling on a false passport. Information from that suspect would lead, several years later, to the arrest in September 2009 of an Iranian-born Briton, Ahboor Rambarak Fath, at Bangkok&apos;s Suvarnabhumi airport \u2013 and, eventually, to Tony Butt. Stopped as he got off a flight from Spain, Fath was carrying a bag of 103 stolen European, Canadian and Israeli passports destined, he confessed, for the veritable &quot;small forgery factory&quot; that police found at Butt&apos;s apartment in the hours after his arrest. In one room of the flat, an unnamed DSI agent told the Bangkok Post, officers discovered computers, a high-definition scanner and printer, and more than 1,000 stolen passports, photographs and counterfeit data pages for EU, Canadian, Chinese and Israeli passports, plus assorted sets of US and Schengen visa stickers and stamps. Butt was, in the words of DSI deputy director-general Narat Savetnant, &quot;the kingpin&quot; of a major international gang that stole and falsified passports and then sold them to international criminal groups involved in arms trafficking, human trafficking, illegal immigration \u2013 and terrorism. Beside the Madrid bombers, the gang also allegedly supplied passports to the Pakistan-based Lashkar-e-Taiba group, accused of plotting the 2008 Mumbai attacks that left 164 people dead and more than 300 injured, and to Tamil Tiger separatists in Sri Lanka. Theft of passports in\u00a0Thailand \u2013 and particularly in Phuket \u2013 is a &apos;regular\u00a0occurrence&apos; There is, of course, no evidence that Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370, which disappeared Friday 7 March just over an hour into its flight from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia to Beijing, was the victim of a terror attack. But news that two of the passengers on the flight were travelling on passports stolen in Thailand \u2013 one belonging to Italian Luigi Maraldi, who lost it last August when he left it as collateral for a motorbike rented in Phuket, and the other to Austrian Christian Kozel, who reported his lost in the same area some 18 months earlier \u2013 has focused attention on the country&apos;s booming trade in stolen and falsified passports. Some, certainly, have ended up in the hands of terrorists. In June 2012, the month that Butt was sentenced to 15 years in jail, the DSI smashed another major counterfeiting syndicate, this one accused of issuing some 3,000 falsified passports and visas over the five years of its existence, two of them to Iranians convicted of carrying out a series of botched bomb attacks in Bangkok in February 2012, supposedly aimed at Israeli diplomats. (The counterfeiting gang&apos;s alleged ringleader, Iranian-born Seyed Paknejad, 45, was arrested but jumped bail and fled, on a fake Turkish passport, to Malaysia \u2013 where he was re-arrested last year carrying a startling 17 stolen New Zealand passports. Thailand has subsequently asked for\u00a0his extradition.) The gangs have targeted Thailand mainly because of the very large numbers of European, US and Australian holidaymakers who travel there every year. But the Bangkok Post&apos;s interview with an unnamed DSI agent quoted him as saying the country was also attractive because it is relatively easy to enter and leave; &quot;you can negotiate with some law enforcement people&quot;; and \u2013 importantly \u2013 some local officials have not tended to see the forgery of foreign (as opposed to Thai) passports as a particularly serious offence. The business reportedly originated in the early 80s, when Thai criminal gangs employed hotel staff, tour guides and sex workers to steal not just tourists&apos; traveller&apos;s cheques but also their passports, without which cheques could not be cashed. Once credit cards started replacing traveller&apos;s cheques, the gangs used the expertise they had already gained in the sophisticated techniques of document falsification to become full-service fake document providers, importing passports, driving licences and ID cards from abroad, doctoring them, and selling to anyone prepared to pay. Two passengers on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 were travelling on passports stolen in Thailand One DSI agent, Tinawut Slilapat told Bangkok expat magazine The Big Chilli in 2012 that &quot;around 20&quot; groups, often headed by criminals from south Asia or the Middle East, are currently engaged in various forms of passport fraud in Thailand. They use passports stolen in Thailand but also in countries such as Spain, France and Belgium, add new photographs, data pages and signatures, and sell to customers who either travel to Thailand to buy the documents or send couriers. Almost all the passports are used to commit crimes outside Thailand, Tinawut told the magazine. He said an undoctored stolen passport \u2013 increasingly used by the gangs, who are now dealing in such high volumes that they can afford simply to wait until a potential client shows up of approximately the right age and appearance \u2013 typically sells for between $1,500 and $3,000, depending on its condition, nationality, and the number of years it has left to run. Italian, British, Spanish and other European passports fetch about $1,000, Tinawut said, while Israeli passports cost $1,500-$2,000 and Canadian can go for up to $3,000. &quot;There is still huge demand for passports, and identity fraud is a tool to support other criminal activities,&quot; Tinawut said. &quot;We are talking about a very lucrative revenue source for criminal organisations.&quot; A Hong Kong-based risk consultant, Steve Vickers, confirmed to the Wall Street Journal that &quot;counterfeiting of all sorts of identifications is very widespread, particularly out of Thailand. So it&apos;s pretty easy to pick up a stolen or a counterfeit passport.&quot; Visitors to the south-east Asian country would certainly be advised to watch out for their passports. According to the Foreign Office, some 600 British passports were stolen there in 2012-13, making it the seventh most likely country to lose a British passport (revealingly, in light of Butt&apos;s connections, the country that tops the list is Spain, where more than 5,600 British passports were reported missing last year). A former Australian consul, Larry Cunningham, told the South China Morning Post that the theft of passports in Thailand \u2013 and particularly in Phuket \u2013 is a &quot;regular occurrence&quot;. Some passports were certainly lost, Cunningham said, &quot;falling out of pockets or being genuinely misplaced. But there were also substantial incidents of passports being stolen.&quot; A quick scroll through travellers&apos; internet forums, such as Lonely Planet, shows countless anguished stories of passports lost and presumed stolen \u2013 often from car and motorbike rental agencies. When Maraldi, who called his family to tell them reports of his death on Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 had been greatly exaggerated, asked the bike shop where he had left it for his passport back, he was told it had already been handed over to an Italian man who &quot;said Mr Maraldi was his husband&quot;. But a stolen and doctored passport will only work as a travel document if nobody checks it. Both Kozel and Maraldi reported their passports as stolen and the thefts were duly recorded in Interpol&apos;s database of Lost and Stolen Travel Documents (LSTD). Created after the September 11, 2001 terror attack on New York and Washington, the LSTD database now has some 40m entries. The inter-governmental police cooperation organisation says this weekend it is searched more than 800m times a year, mainly by the US, which accessed it 250m times, the UK (120m) and the UAE (50m). &apos;Last year, passengers were able to board planes more than a billion times without having their passports screened against Interpol&apos;s databases&apos; Authorities in many other countries, however, appear to search the database far less often, or not at all. &quot;Last year,&quot; the agency said, &quot;passengers were able to board planes more than a billion times without having their passports screened against Interpol&apos;s databases ... Unfortunately, few member countries systematically search these databases to determine whether a passenger is using a stolen or lost travel document to board a plane.&quot; Interpol said that in the case of Flight MH370: &quot;No checks of the stolen Austrian and Italian passports were made by any country between the time they were entered into Interpol&apos;s database and the departure of the\u00a0flight.&quot; International border control authorities were last reminded to tighten up procedures in 2010, when an Air India Express flight crashed on landing in Mangalore and it transpired that 10 of the 158 passengers and crew on board \u2013 all of whom were killed \u2013 had been travelling on forged or stolen documents, leading to serious concerns about security checks in Dubai, where the flight originated. Ronald Noble, Interpol&apos;s secretary general, was scathing this weekend about the evident lack of any such checks when passengers boarded Flight MH370. &quot;Whilst it is too soon to speculate about any connection between these stolen passports and the missing plane, it is clearly of great concern that any passenger was able to board an international flight using a stolen passport listed in Interpol&apos;s databases,&quot; Noble said. &quot;For years, Interpol has asked why countries should wait for a tragedy to put prudent security measures in place at borders and boarding gates. Now we have a real case where the world is speculating whether the stolen passport holders were terrorists, while Interpol is asking why only a handful of countries are taking care to make sure that persons possessing stolen passports are not boarding international flights. &quot;If Malaysia Airlines and all airlines worldwide were able to check the passport details of prospective passengers against Interpol&apos;s database, we would not have to speculate.&quot;", "title": "How Thailand's trade in fake passports fuels crime gangs around the world", "sentences": ["Unfortunately, few member countries systematically search these databases to determine whether a passenger is using a stolen or lost travel document to board a plane.&quot; Interpol said that in the case of Flight MH370: &quot;No checks of the stolen Austrian and Italian passports were made by any country between the time they were entered into Interpol&apos;s database and the departure of the\u00a0flight.&quot; International border control authorities were last reminded to tighten up procedures in 2010, when an Air India Express flight crashed on landing in Mangalore and it transpired that 10 of the 158 passengers and crew on board \u2013 all of whom were killed \u2013 had been travelling on forged or stolen documents, leading to serious concerns about security checks in Dubai, where the flight originated."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-10T18:53:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/mar/11/typhoon-haiyan-philippines-uk-response-dfid-icai", "tags": ["Global development", "Aid", "Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai)", "Philippines", "Department for International Development (DfID)", "Typhoon Haiyan", "UK news", "Politics"], "article": "The UK was well prepared to act swiftly and decisively in response to typhoon Haiyan in the Philippines and its early response helped galvanise the international community, a UK aid watchdog said on Tuesday. The Independent Commission for Aid Impact (Icai), which was set up to scrutinise UK aid, praised the Department for International Development (DfID), giving the overall response to typhoon Haiyan a green assessment, its top ranking. Haiyan, also known as Yolanda, struck the Philippines with devastating force in November, killing more than 6,200 people, affecting a further 14 million people, and damaging 1.1m homes. Led by DfID, the UK provided \u00a377m of humanitarian aid, making it the largest single donor. In addition to the UK government&apos;s response, the British public donated a further \u00a385m through the Disasters Emergency Committee (DEC) appeal. Though DfID does not have a presence in the Philipppines, the UK was among the first countries to respond, enabling it to mobilise support from other donors, said Icai. The watchdog was also impressed by DfID&apos;s co-ordination with the Ministry of Defence and other departments, calling it a good example of inter-departmental co-operation. &quot;DfID&apos;s preparedness to respond, combined with the effective use of military assets and pace of decision-making, meant that the UK was able to make an early and vital contribution to this international response,&quot; said Mark Foster, lead commissioner. &quot;The Philippines is, alongside many other parts of the world, increasingly prone to natural disasters, and DfID has an opportunity to play an even more influential role in the global humanitarian system and increase the likelihood of future effectiveness.&quot; DfID provided basic supplies, especially emergency shelter, which were critical in the earliest stages after the typhoon hit. The department&apos;s procurement was so effective that it brought more non-food items in the first six weeks than the UN&apos;s humanitarian response depot network, noted Icai. The challenge for DfID now is to consider how to support the recovery, given that it does not intend to establish a permanent presence in the Philippines. Icai attributes DfID&apos;s effective response to substantial changes the department took following an independent humanitarian emergency response review (Herr) in 2011, chaired by Lord Ashdown, the former Liberal Democrat leader. Among the review&apos;s key suggestions were a more anticipatory approach and an improvement in the leadership of the international humanitarian system. After the Ashdown review, DfID set up a global risk register, which identified the Philippines as a very high-risk territory. It bolstered its conflict, humanitarian and security department to 17 people, many deployable at short notice. At any given time, there are six rapid response leaders available for deployment within six hours. Other measures included: pre-positioned stockpiles in the UK and Dubai, such as tents, blankets and water containers for 18,000 people; a rapid response facility with pre-selected NGO partners that allows quick submission and approval of proposals; memoranda of understanding with other departments, including the MoD, on cross-charging costs and lines of command; and a larger communications and press team. &quot;Co-ordination across departments was effective,&quot; said Icai. &quot;As a result DfID was able to deliver a joined-up response, combining military and civilian aspects in line with Herr recommendations. DfID had a clearly-defined leadership role for planning and co-ordination, including of military assets. This contrasted with some of the other military groups involved and helped to maintain central control and to ensure that the right resources were deployed.&quot; Unlike other militaries, the UK put its armed forces under the explicit direction of DfID, winning praise from other agencies on Britain&apos;s effective use of military assets. DfID sent a three-member team to the Philippines in the buildup to Haiyan so that the department had a presence at the start of the operation. Decision-making was prompt. Justine Greening, the international development secretary, approved DfID&apos;s proposal of support within one hour on the evening of Saturday 9 November, activating the rapid response facility.

Brooks told the phone-hacking trial that had she been told the schoolgirl been found looking for a job, it would have been &quot;a big story&quot; and she might have dumped a front-page exclusive she had lined up on axed EastEnders star Michael Greco. &quot;If Milly Dowler had been found, had run off with a girlfriend to Eastbourne after a row with her parents and all had been made well it would still have been a big story,&quot; Brooks said. The jury has already been told that Dowler&apos;s phone was hacked by private investigator Glenn Mulcaire in April 2002 and that he had discovered a voice message, left by mistake, by a recruitment agency in Telford. This lead the paper to dispatch a team to the Midlands to try and find Dowler, who had gone missing in Surrey weeks before. &quot;If it had been believed back in Wapping that they were sure beyond all reasonable doubt that they had found Milly Dowler working in a factory in the Midlands, then they would have told me that she was alive. The fact is that nobody told me,&quot; Brooks said. Phone records show that Brooks was in contact with the paper from Dubai during the week Mulcaire had hacked Dowler&apos;s phone. Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC asked Brooks: &quot;If they found her at the Epson factory in Telford, as the editor you would have had to decide what went on the front page?&quot; Brooks responded: &quot;I would have talked to my deputy, Andy Coulson, and if he had said to me &apos;we have found Milly Dowler and police have not been able to, and we are putting that on page 1, I would have been told that, yes.&quot; But Brooks said this conversation never took place. Asked by Edis if Andy Coulson told her they were working on information that she was alive, Brooks said: &quot;No.&quot; Asked &quot;did anyone tell you?&quot;, she replied: &quot;No.&quot; Brooks has previously testified that the first she knew of the hacking of Dowler&apos;s phone was nine years later on 4 July 2011, when the Guardian reported the unlawful interception. &quot;It surprised me that anyone thought that she was alive and a 13-year-old was working in a factory. I would remember, I would have been told she was alive, and I wasn&apos;t. &quot;Looking back at it now, it does seem a rather unlikely story,&quot; said Brooks. Edis put it to Brooks that dispatching five or six journalists to Telford would have meant the story was prominent in the minds of the editors that week. &quot;Quite a big story would have been required in order to justify that amount of effort,&quot; Edis said. Brooks replied: &quot;I think five or six is quite big.&quot; The jury heard that a journalist on the news desk, Vanessa Large, called the Telford factory at 5.30pm on Friday 12 April and that the paper did not tell the police that they had hacked the school girl&apos;s voicemail and found information suggesting she might be alive until Saturday afternoon. &quot;If someone had been told she was alive and they were sure she was alive, I would have expected them to tell the police with or without me being there,&quot; said Brooks. The paper planned, and did, lead with an exclusive interview the paper had secured with Greco as part of a \u00a315,000 joint deal with the Sun, the jury heard. Earlier Brooks had told the hacking trial that she did not take a special interest in Dowler&apos;s disappearance. She said she might have cancelled her holiday if she felt that Dowler had been murdered by a predatory paedophile and there were links to the Sarah Payne case. She said that initially there were concerns that this may have happened because the two girls had lived three streets away, but by the time she was due to go on holiday in April 2002, the police had been briefing that they were focusing on Dowler&apos;s father. The police later dropped this line of inquiry and Levi Bellfield was convicted of killing Milly Dowler. &quot;I suspect I mightn&apos;t have gone away,&quot; Brooks said, if the police had made the links. The jury were shown a 12-point letter from the News of the World&apos;s then managing editor Stuart Kuttner to the assistant chief constable at Surrey police. Referring to Milly as &quot;Amanda&quot;, Kuttner told Frank Clarke him the paper had &quot;identified eight convicted child sex offenders who appear to live within a two- to three-mile radius of Amanda&apos;s home&quot;. Brooks denied Kuttner told her about an email sent to Surrey police alerting then to the fact the paper had listened to one of Dowler&apos;s messages. &quot;Would there have been any reason for him not to tell you what he was doing?&quot; Edis asked. &quot;No, not at all,&quot; she replied. Edis put it to her: &quot;Mrs Brooks, you must have known what your paper was doing in relation to that phone at the time.&quot; Brooks replied: &quot;No&quot;. Edis pressed her again: &quot;They were telling police but not you?&quot; Brooks replied &quot;nobody told me&quot;, repeating her earlier evidence that the first she knew about the hacking of Dowler&apos;s phone was when the Guardian reported it nine years later. &quot;I did not know about phone hacking of Milly Dowler,&quot; she replied firmly. Later Brooks was quizzed about notes appearing to show that Mulcaire had been tasked to hack the phone of the sister of Maxine Carr, the girlfriend of Soham murderer Ian Huntley. She denied any knowledge of this. Brooks, Coulson and Kuttner deny one charge that they were involved in a conspiracy to hack phones.

In her twelfth day in the witness box, Rebekah Brooks agreed with prosecuting counsel Andrew Edis QC that, as an editor, her &quot;agenda&quot; had focused on paedophiles and sex offenders, but she repeatedly said that she had never heard Mulcaire&apos;s name until he was arrested in August 2006, three years after her editorship. Edis asked her about notes kept by Mulcaire which suggested that the paper&apos;s assistant editor, Greg Miskiw, and four other journalists had told him to locate convicted child sex offenders from the summer of 2000 when Brooks was publishing the names and addresses of convicted paedophiles. &quot;Did any of them tell you where they were getting their information from?&quot; he asked. &quot;No,&quot; she replied. The prosecutor went on to ask her about other notes suggesting that in September 2002, both Greg Miskiw and the news editor, Neville Thurlbeck, had commissioned Mulcaire to uncover stories about the murder in Soham of Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells. This was &quot;something which is directly part of your agenda,&quot; he suggested. Thurlbeck had asked Mulcaire to investigate two detectives from the Soham inquiry who had been accused of downloading child pornography. &quot;Did you know about that?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; she replied. &quot;I don&apos;t remember that.&quot; Miskiw had asked Mulcaire to target the sister of Maxine Carr, who had been arrested for perverting the course of justice. &quot;Did you know that Glenn Mulcaire had been tasked apparently to hack Maxine Carr&apos;s sister&apos;s phone?&quot; &quot;No,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn&apos;t.&quot; Edis also challenged her over the hacking in April 2002 of the voicemail of Milly Dowler. The court had heard that Brooks was on holiday in Dubai in the week when Mulcaire intercepted a message suggesting that the missing schoolgirl was alive and possibly working at a factory in Telford. Brooks agreed that she had been &quot;extremely interested&quot; in the missing girl and that the paper had run stories about her for the three weeks before Brooks went to Dubai. Edis suggested that she would have wanted to &quot;keep it under review&quot; while she was away. She replied: &quot;The problem is that it&apos;s impossible to be in control of the newspaper \u2013 certainly back then \u2013 when you go away. I don&apos;t remember saying to anybody &apos;Keep in touch over missing Milly.&apos;&quot; Edis asked her about an email written during that week by her managing editor, Stuart Kuttner, asking Surrey police for details of convicted sex offenders who lived near Milly Dowler&apos;s home. &quot;I don&apos;t remember saying to Stuart Kuttner &apos;Please investigate paedophiles in the community.&apos; I don&apos;t remember having that conversation, but it&apos;s possible.&quot; She agreed that if the paper had found the missing girl alive, it would have been a big story, which would have made the front page. She was told that the paper had sent five or six journalists to Telford to investigate and agreed that this was &quot;quite a lot&quot; of staff. She was shown phone records which showed she had called the editor&apos;s desk from Dubai twice on the Thursday of her holiday week and three times on the Friday, including one call which lasted 38 minutes. Edis asked her if the acting editor, Andy Coulson, had told her about the story. &quot;No. He didn&apos;t.&quot; &quot;Did anyone?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; She said she did not recall having any conversation about Milly Dowler while she was in Dubai. The following week she had returned to the office. &quot;Did nobody tell you at all what had happened while you were away?&quot; Edis asked. &quot;I don&apos;t remember any conversation,&quot; she replied. She added that she did not believe that Stuart Kuttner had mentioned that he had contacted Surrey police to ask them about the contents of the voicemail. &quot;Nobody told me we had accessed Milly Dowler&apos;s voicemail.&quot; Edis said: &quot;You say all this was hidden from you?&quot; &quot;I did not know that Glenn Mulcaire worked under my editorship until 2006.&quot; &quot;It was hidden from you by Greg Miskiw?&quot; &quot;He did not tell me that he had a private detective called Glenn Mulcaire working for me.&quot; &quot;You weren&apos;t told by Mr Thurlbeck?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;By Mr Kuttner?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; &quot;Nobody told you anything?&quot; &quot;People told me an awful lot.

FAWC&apos;s advice was first set out in 1985 and then reaffirmed in 2003: the &quot;council considers that slaughter without pre-stunning is unacceptable and that the government should repeal the current exemption&quot;. However, both the Thatcher and Blair governments rejected the advice. The reasoning of the Department for Environment, Food, and Rural Affairs in 2003 was that &quot;the government is committed to respect for the rights of religious groups and accepts that an insistence on a pre-cut or immediate post-cut stun would not be compatible with the requirements of religious slaughter by Jewish and Muslim groups&quot;. In other words, heightened religious sensitivities, combined with the fear of Jewish and Muslim religious lobbies, have led to successive governments ignoring the advice of their scientific advisers and the pleas of animal welfare organisations. By so doing, they have provided an exemption to the law on animal cruelty, which not even advocates for fox hunting are granted. It is important to note that a number of other European countries have already outlawed religious slaughter (including Denmark, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland, and Poland); those countries that take the prevention of cruelty to animals seriously ought to follow suit.Dr Rumy HasanSPRU \u2013 Science &amp; Technology Policy Research, University of Sussex \u2022\u2008As a vegan for more than 30 years I am fascinated by those outraged over halal/kosher slaughter. I sincerely hope they never eat animal flesh or dairy products abroad, as &quot;humane slaughter&quot; (an oxymoron) is not practised in so many parts of the world. Do all those in high dudgeon over this issue ever holiday in destinations like Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia, Indonesia, Dubai? Do they go vegan while there? My guess is most don&apos;t. Worldwide, 60bn animals a year are intensively bred, fattened and slaughtered, and the meat industry is growing. The livestock industry is a ruthless and brutal one. Animals are a &quot;product&quot;, a &quot;crop&quot; to be &quot;harvested&quot;. Of course, being squeamish Brits we kid ourselves that the 1bn animals killed in the UK each year had &quot;nice&quot; lives and went to the knife in a &quot;humane&quot; manner. It is a myth.Sara StarkeyTonbridge \u2022\u2008The article about Jewish and Muslim animal slaughter (Our slaughter is humane, 7 March) reminded me that, as a junior technician at Liverpool University, I used to have to go to Liverpool&apos;s main abattoir to collect newborn calf blood for research into viral diseases including smallpox, influenza and German measles (rubella). I was an animal lover and a member of the RSPCA when younger. I witnessed at very close quarters the two forms of slaughter, the captive bolt and the Jewish method described in the article. The calves I saw killed by the latter method appeared to die cleanly and almost instantly. If I had to watch animal slaughter again, I would choose to witness this method every time.Colin KennyLiverpool", "title": "Religious slaughter and myths about the 'humane' alternative | @guardianletters", "sentences": ["Do all those in high dudgeon over this issue ever holiday in destinations like Turkey, Egypt, Tunisia, Indonesia, Dubai?"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-11T21:00:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/12/ipl-uae-kevin-pietersen-delhi-daredevils", "tags": ["IPL", "Cricket", "Sport", "Kevin Pietersen", "United Arab Emirates cricket team"], "article": "Kevin Pietersen is set to make his first appearance of the year for the Delhi Daredevils in the United Arab Emirates rather than India.

And the look that\u2019s in vogue among female models is far from what many would consider natural Iranian beauty. What\u2019s in is a highly doctored, surgically altered appearance that the photographer \u2013 who asked to go by the initials \u201cB.K.\u201d \u2013 describes as the \u201cporn star\u201d look. In a society where physical beauty is highly prized, cosmetic surgery has become commonplace among the middle and upper classes. Iran reportedly has the world\u2019s highest nose surgery rate, and those who work in front of the camera often first go under the knife. Models with the sort of doctored appearances that are in demand can be seen on the Instagram pages of Tehran bridal salons and photo studios such as Aroose Tehran (Tehran Brides), with 115,000 followers; Aliss Studio; and Azadeh Fanaee. Design houses such as Dohe Couture and RK Design also maintain Instagram pages that feature scores of images of women not in hijab, publicly acceptable Islamic dress. While Facebook and Twitter both remain censored in Iran, the authorities evidently turn a blind eye to this sort of taboo-skirting social media usage. There are few modelling agencies in Iran, so most models must go through a photographer like B.K., who runs a fashion studio from his home. His living room overflows with photographs of couture-clad women; the wings are filled with professional lighting equipment and a selection of backdrops. After photographing a model, B.K. will usually present her portfolio to various salons, boutiques, and \u201cmaisons\u201d, retail operations often run of the proprietor\u2019s home that sell clothing by designers who specialize in everything from wedding outfits to modern interpretations of Islamic dress. Most of B.K.\u2019s clients are located in north Tehran\u2019s Fereshteh district \u2013 the capital\u2019s \u201cManhattan\u201d, as he calls it.  Sonia models for one of B.K.\u2019s beauty-salon cleints. Done up as a bride, her image will appear in a poster and book that show off the salon\u2019s hairstyling and makeup techniques. With her long, luscious jet-black hair and dark features, Sonia was recruited by B.K. at a party thrown by mutual friends. As a defender of natural beauty, he has managed to convince four of his models not to undergo nose surgery.     Sonia has retained her natural Iranian look. Photograph: B.K.    \u201cEveryone tells me I look so \u2018Iranian,\u2019\u201d Sonia says. \u201cThe majority of other models get surgery, and I think that with more natural looks I can be more special \u2013 different from other models.\u201d For female models like Sonia who seek work outside the strictures of hijab, beauty salons and other private businesses are the prime sources of employment. Female models not in hijab are legally barred from appearing in magazines or TV commercials or on catwalks. Even fashion shows that observe hijab must receive an official permit from the ministry of culture and Islamic guidance, which is difficult to attain. Female catwalks can be attended only by other women, while male shows are not gender segregated. Male models encounter fewer restrictions generally. For any female fashion beyond the bounds of hijab, \u201ceverything has to be underground\u201d, as B.K. puts it. Working under the authorities\u2019 radar is simply \u201cmodelling Iranian style\u201d, he says. The public limits on modelling extend to billboards, on which women rarely appear. Those promoting female clothing, like the ones for Hasti Fashion currently on display around northern Tehran, show only mannequins. \u201cIn the future, they may allow billboards to be more available to female models,\u201d Sonia suggests. \u201cThere may be more openness under Rouhani.\u201d Male models work with underground studios as well, but they can more freely seek work for public platforms like billboards and TV advertisements. Billboards with men in the latest designs of local brands like Hacoopian, Charme Mashad, and Novin Leather are common on the streets of Tehran. Even in hijab, a female model would not be permitted to appear in the same public advertisement. \u201cThe only problem with male modeling is a person cannot become really famous,\u201d B.K. says. Referring to the conservative religious-political establishment, he explains: \u201cThey say, \u2018You are making a superstar\u2019\u201d \u2013 something that\u2019s frowned upon. Nonetheless, a few male models have become celebrities. In Tehran, the name of Hamid Fadaei often comes up. He has appeared in ads for such western brands as Zara and Fila. A recent item on the Cairo-based website Scoop Empire described him as \u201cone of the sexiest men in the Middle East\u201d. The first Iranian male model to gain global attention was Cameron Alborzian, who starred in Madonna\u2019s \u201cExpress Yourself\u201d video and became the face of Guess Jeans in 1988. Among the new generation, hazel-eyed Dana Mashalahpoor has modelled for the last year and a half. He also works with designers to create original fashion concepts at photo shoots. He says he aims to represent an \u201cIranian gentleman\u201d not only in his modeling style, but in his everyday demeanour as well. Earlier this week, he emphasized the \u201cgentleman\u201d theme in the text accompanying a photo he published on Instagram in which he models a stylishly retro plaid jacket.  \u201cI am not just a face or a model for someone. It is more important to have a special character\u201d says Mashalahpoor. \u201cIn Tehran, the modelling community is small. I haven\u2019t seen anyone brand themselves as a gentleman.\u201d     Dana Mashalahpoor, a gentleman everywhere. Photograph: Arash Vakilzadeh    Mashalahpoor has worked at fashion shows mostly in Dubai, where he has made a catwalk appearance for the luxury accessory brand Davidoff. He says he has been offered a modelling contract through a New York agency, but has decided to stay in Tehran. \u201cEven though modelling in Iran involves a lot of difficulties, I do it because I can build the high-quality standard myself,\u201d he says. \u201cModelling at a high level allows you to be in a position where many people admire your character and lifestyle. In Iran, there is a lot of potential for investment in the fashion industry and that is why I will continue my career in Iran.\u201d There\u2019s clear evidence of that potential in north Tehran, where western brands such as Bulgari, Zara, Mango and United Colors of Benetton have opened stores. As a child, Mashalahpoor was influenced by a fashion-conscious mother who loved to design clothes. He is represented exclusively by an agent, unlike most models \u2013 male and female \u2013 who are affiliated with photography studios. As a part-time model, Sonia, who is pursuing a master\u2019s degree in hotel management, has worked with B.K. for three years. \u201cHe made it so that women could make money from their beauty. Before this, if anyone wanted a model, they would not pay them,\u201d she says. With competition running high between models, it is not uncommon for those starting out to work for free. Models who represent themselves struggle to gain the same traffic as those connected to a studio. Established models can make up to one million tomans \u2013 about \u00a3220 \u2013 for a TV advertisement, or 400,000 tomans per day for a fashion shoot. But flirting with \u201csuperstar\u201d status is even riskier for women than it is for men. Many thus prefer to work exclusively underground, finding acclaim within the elite north Tehran fashion community. This is the case for Sonia, who finds it \u201cfun\u201d to be dolled up for photo shoots. She is friends with the makeup artists, and she enjoys the attention when her photos are admired by patrons of salons or others in the underground fashion scene. Others choose the hijab-only route, which allows them more public exposure. Mahya models Islamic dress styles for a designer affiliated with Qatar Airways and the brand La Neige, which produces manteaus \u2013 long, form-concealing coats \u2013 that are brightly coloured rather than the traditional black. She is also a part-time student, pursuing a master\u2019s in environmental science. Though her father disapproves of her modelling, Mahya loves it so much she will work for free at times. With her tall figure, Mahya once strutted the runway of on underground catwalk, where she wore less modest Islamic clothing and most of her curly black hair spilled out from beneath her headscarf. \u201cIf it had been public, the government would have closed it,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were going to do a government-approved catwalk once, but they did not let us. That year it was worse because there was an election.\u201d Since there are few catwalks in Iran and the fashion scene is much more about photo shoots, Mahya explains that models do not necessarily have to be tall. \u201cIt may be that the woman is short, but the brand may like the way she looks and they will choose her,\u201d she says. \u201cThey choose the women more often who have had cosmetic surgery \u2013 women with lip and cheekbone enhancements or nose surgery.\u201d Both Mahya and Sonia value their natural looks and say they have not had them surgically altered, but they agree that female models with less traditionally Iranian features are more popular.", "title": "'Modelling Iranian style\u2019: surgical alterations and the 'porn star' look", "sentences": ["Photograph: Arash Vakilzadeh    Mashalahpoor has worked at fashion shows mostly in Dubai, where he has made a catwalk appearance for the luxury accessory brand Davidoff."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-12T11:00:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/mar/13/astronauts-living-in-space-tv-review", "tags": ["International Space Station", "Television", "Television & radio", "Nasa", "Space", "Culture", "Science"], "article": "Wow, Astronauts: Living in Space (Channel 4) is like Gravity, only real.

It&apos;s the greatest incinerator (not) on Earth. We witness some of the work they do. The &quot;ants in space&quot; experiment is my favourite, though Peta might not approve. An ant loses pretty much all of its dignity in microgravity. We see our astronauts phone home, with video linkup, putting some serious sky into Skype. There&apos;s a delivery from Earth, mostly groceries \u2013 Ocado basically, but better and (even) more expensive. There&apos;s even a space walk: Rick and Mike leave the ISS to make repairs. It really is just like Gravity, and with all the gear on you can&apos;t tell they&apos;re not Bullock and Clooney. So where&apos;s the frustration, then? It&apos;s just that I had so many more questions. Like what about going to the loo? Is it a poo-in-a-bag system? A bit crude maybe, but that&apos;s what you want to know, isn&apos;t it? Isn&apos;t that what you&apos;re asking at home? (It is, after all, one of the main issues with camping.) I can do cruder still. Do they have Skype sex with their wives back in Houston maybe? Six months is a long time. What about masturbation? And if so, presumably they have to be extra careful about spillages \u2013 you don&apos;t want any of that floating about the ISS, do you, or maybe getting out with the rubbish, floating frozen in space until it&apos;s discovered by something, or someone, then used, to start something, or someone, else \u2026 I&apos;ll save it for my sci-fi movie. Where were we? Oh, yes, frustrations. Astronauts are obviously selected for their level-headedness, their problem-solving abilities and so on, not for their vivid imaginations, their excellent sense of humour, or their skill with (behind or in front of) a camera. I would have liked it to be less prosaic. I&apos;m not talking just about bodily excretions: I also wanted to know more about how they felt being away from their planet, whether anything changed \u2013 perspectives, dreams, language even. I mean, do you still get up in the morning when there&apos;s no such thing as up? Is there even such a thing as morning? Hell, it doesn&apos;t really matter. All that&apos;s what the movies are for. Sandra can have the interesting back story, and George can do the jokes. Mike, Rick and Koichi, meanwhile, can get on with doing a great job, not giving any secrets away, apart from that they miss their wives&apos; cooking. It&apos;s still extraordinary \u2013 just look at the view. There&apos;s Dubai down there. And another time Patagonia \u2013 no, correction, it&apos;s the Alps. Generally it&apos;s the Pacific Ocean. 3D would have been nice. There&apos;s more of it tonight, about all the support work. And then on Sunday we go live to the ISS, with Dermot O&apos;Leary. Why is Dermot doing this, I wonder. Gravitas? Microgravitas? Unless, like that other time Channel 4 did space (Space Cadets, remember?), the whole thing turns out to be a hoax. And Dermot&apos;s going to burst through the hatch at the end.

Overnight damage from Indian Wells, which experienced an actual earthquake last year, included the meek exits of Andy Murray and Stanislas Wawrinka and, consequently \u2013 following the earlier departure of the defending champion and world No1, Rafael Nadal \u2013 there is no incumbent slam champion in the quarter-finals of the first ATP 1000 tournament of the season. Does it represent a shifting of the sport&apos;s tectonic plate, which has been rumbling for at least 18 months? Are the young guns about to take over? Will Murray rediscover his Wimbledon mojo before he slips down the top-10 table? Not so fast, Moriarty: Roger Federer and Novak Djokovic, the only top eight players left in the tournament, are still punching \u2013 although there is cause to wonder. The 17-slam Swiss, who won his first tournament since Halle in 2013 (his German grass Wimbledon warm-up) when he beat world No6 Tomas Berdych in Dubai, has carried his form to California. Still the crowd favourite, he looked good again when dismissing his friend Tommy Haas (three years older than him, at 35, and the oldest player in the top 100) in straight sets to book a quarter-final with Kevin Anderson. The tall South African, with the booming serve and coming off two clay finals, broke the 13-match winning run of Federer&apos;s compatriot, Wawrinka \u2013 convincingly. Stan, who was so upbeat after beating Djokovic and Nadal on the way to his first slam title in Melbourne in January, giving outsiders everywhere reason to cheer, was hard on himself in defeat. &quot;I was negative the whole match,&quot; he said. &quot;I was tired mentally.&quot; That is not good; Wawrinka should have been as fresh as the nearby mountain air in his return to the Tour after a decent break. Strangely, it echoed Murray&apos;s pessimism after playing his worst set of tennis in a long time when losing for the third time in four outings to the young Canadian Milos Raonic. Murray put it down to, &quot;a lack of confidence&quot;, which invites worries about his ability to get into shape for the rest of the summer. His last tournament win was on that sunlit Sunday at Wimbledon but, even through the filter of early morning television (with the help of much coffee), the picture remains confused. Murray needs a win, not just a string of encouraging performances mixed with minor disappointments. He has to get on the board at the business end of a tournament and might do so next week in Miami, his second home, where he invariably does well and where he reduced David Ferrer to a molten mess in last year&apos;s final. The question was put to Murray after he lost to Raonic if the absence of his coach, Ivan Lendl, had made any difference to his performance and he was adamant it had not. Nor should it. The arrival of Boris Becker, Stefan Edberg and Michael Chang on the coaching scene this year was portrayed as copying Lendl&apos;s hooking up with Murray and encouraged the view that even the best players suffer from insecurity. Perhaps they do but maybe they should be more self-sufficient. Maybe it is good for them to fly solo occasionally. Becker has yet to make a perceptible difference to Djokovic&apos;s game. The Serb has been strangely out of sorts since winning the ATP World Tour Finals last November and he went to sleep (along with some of us propping up eyelids on this side of the Atlantic) in the first set before beating the in-form Marin Cilic, a player whose pedigree is undoubted in the locker room but which only now is starting to give him some consistent results. Ernests Gulbis, who has stormed through the BNP Paribas Open in style and gave Grigor Dimitrov a reminder that he is not the only unfulfilled prodigy at large, with some quite stunning tennis. He is the antithesis of the cossetted player; volatile, tough to read and as dangerous as a drunken gunslinger. He plays John Isner on Friday. But back to Murray: before imploding against Raonic in the third set, he had found the grit to win four of five matches after dropping the first set, so he does not lack resolve. What he needs, maybe, is a little of Gulbis&apos;s swagger. Few players suffer so publicly as Murray and he plainly has some work to do to get his A game back. We have seen precious little of it since the Australian Open. His serve is not in the best shape but he is moving, sideways and in and out from the net, with no apparent discomfort, so, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it is safe to assume his back is fine. He was not happy with his groundstrokes in the concluding set but this might be down to the slow courts. It is a beautiful setting, Indian Wells, but a bit of a minefield. If the tournament \u2013 still being pushed as a &quot;fifth major&quot; \u2013 has told us anything in the first few days, it is that the game is in for some surprises this summer. If you want a list of names to watch in 2014, try these: Alexandr Dolgopolov, who accounted for Nadal in Indian Wells and who plays Raonic on Thursday; Alejandro Gonz\u00e1lez, who looked good taking a set off Djokovic: Jiri Vesely, the youngest player in the top 100 and who gave Murray nightmares, and Dominic Thiem (ditto). Not all of them will continue to provide seismic shocks but they are on the radar of nearly every leading player on the Tour.", "title": "Tremors from exits of Andy Murray and Rafael Nadal may mean shift in balance | Kevin Mitchell", "sentences": ["The 17-slam Swiss, who won his first tournament since Halle in 2013 (his German grass Wimbledon warm-up) when he beat world No6 Tomas Berdych in Dubai, has carried his form to California."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-13T15:07:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/mar/14/chris-jordan-t20-ben-stokes-england-west-indies", "tags": ["England cricket team", "Ben Stokes", "West Indies cricket team", "England in the West Indies 2014", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "Consolation or otherwise, a win is a win, and England will make their way to Bangladesh, via a four-hour transfer at Gatwick and an overnight stop in Dubai, in better spirits than had West Indies completed a clean sweep of the Twenty20 internationals. As a pointer to the way the World T20 may go, however, it served little purpose beyond the confidence shot in the arm. A better indicator will come when the two sides meet yet again in the second of England&apos;s warm-up matches in Chittagong, on a surface that promises to be not dissimilar to that at the Kensington Oval bar lower bounce, where West Indies will be back to full strength. The resting of key players on Thursday, Samuel Badree more than Chris Gayle, was more than a little help to the England cause, as was Eoin Morgan winning the toss and being able to bat first on a pitch that had been used once before, on Sunday, and which had been spruced up if not altered in character. The omission of Badree, one of the best T20 bowlers in the business, meant that for the first time Michael Lumb and Alex Hales were able to get stuck into some seam, which is their forte, while the pitch played at its best and before even Sunil Narine was able to get any response from it. It may be the last opportunity they have to fill their boots in that manner, for no side, surely, will come at them on the slow, grabby pitch in Chittagong with anything other than spin or wickedly decelerated pace. Once the ball began to grab, the batting struggle recommenced and only the joyous intervention of Chris Jordan in the final over of the innings put England in a position for which they would have settled at the start, and from which they would be able to go on and win. Jordan was a revelation in this match, with bat, ball and in the field, but England will be mindful of heaping too much on him too quickly. It is barely a fortnight since he produced a dismal spell of bowling in the first one-day international in Antigua and was subsequently omitted from the side until the final match of the tour. But what England have is a young cricketer with a massive work ethic and thirst for cricketing knowledge. His bowling has genuine pace and, if he can develop a more athletic runup (at present the effort he puts in belies the lack of speed, as if he is pounding through sand), there is a level yet to be reached; a running coach would help in this regard. With the bat he has the potential to be better than, say, Stuart Broad and there was real authenticity about the sixes that he struck over extra-cover: no mindless bludgeons these. Finally he has wonderful hands, his catching almost faultless whether in the deep, the infield or at slip, where, should he make the Test team this summer (and he is a strong contender), he should take Graeme Swann&apos;s place at second slip. Worryingly, though, Jordan&apos;s success has been in direct contrast to the fortunes of Ben Stokes, whose performances during the Ashes, with both bat and ball, exhibited such promise and competitive instinct, and yet who has floundered on this tour in both disciplines, and now finds himself out of the World T20 after breaking his hand punching a locker. The manner in which he was dismissed first ball by Krishmar Santokie was instructive not so much because it was a beautifully disguised slower ball that befuddled and gated him, but because overall it appears that he is not really watching the ball as intently as he should. He has made nine runs in three ODI innings in Antigua and took nought for 34 in six overs only, while in the T20s it is four runs in two innings and 30 runs conceded off the only two overs. At times, frustratingly, he has been found wandering out of position in the field. Since his Test debut in Adelaide, Stokes has played all but a couple of England fixtures in all formats, which, even for an enthusiastic young lad, is an intensive workload. Why he left the field midway through the West Indies innings has not been explained but there is genuine reason to believe his mind is not totally on the job and he is in need of a break \u2013 something Stokes will now get following his self-inflicted injury. Meanwhile, there must also be some further concern about the form of Morgan, who appeared in only one ODI because of injury and whose T20 performances have been well below the standard expected from someone regarded as one of the best exponents in the game. The volume of runs scored is less of an indicator of their value than the impact they make: Morgan is indeed an impact player. But in his past nine innings, he has exceeded 20 once only and that innings, of 34, in Sydney, was in a futile thrash. How much he is still being restricted by his bruised knee, sustained during the warm-up match in Antigua, is hard to quantify; he insists it is not a problem for him. It is just one additional headache to round off a winter when industrial quantities of aspirin would not have done the trick.-", "title": "Chris Jordan's T20 success contrasts with Ben Stokes' England slide | Mike Selvey", "sentences": ["Consolation or otherwise, a win is a win, and England will make their way to Bangladesh, via a four-hour transfer at Gatwick and an overnight stop in Dubai, in better spirits than had West Indies completed a clean sweep of the Twenty20 internationals."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-14T16:54:12Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/mar/16/co-op-banking-storm-bosses-pay-regulation", "tags": ["Banking", "Business", "Banking reform", "Financial sector", "Co-operative Group", "Retail industry", "UK news"], "article": "When CEO Bob Diamond was paid \u00a317m just before leaving Barclays, we considered this to be an obscene amount and stopped banking there after 40 years.

Once again, the usual paltry rationales and justifications for excessive and ludicrous remuneration packages have been trotted out: consistent with salaries in comparable organisations, extraordinary challenges to be faced, past experience and track records of the managers, the going rate for global talent etc. How very disappointing. Where next for our bank account? Mick and Viv Beeby Westbury-on-Trym Bristol Outrageous pay seems always justified by reference to remuneration committees as though they are somehow independent, authoritative and knowledgeable. In fact, they consist of a cabal of directors sitting on each other&apos;s committees recommending ridiculously high salaries for each other. They are neither transparent nor accountable and need to be strictly regulated. Trade unions, which support and protect the rights of working people, are rigidly regulated, while those people running big businesses are allowed to drive companies into the ground for their own aggrandisement. The real threats to the economy are left to regulate themselves and, of course, don&apos;t.

Pat McKenna Cardiff The reason that the Co-op Group is rewarding its board of directors so handsomely is the same reason that Barclays, Lloyds et al are paying their directors large bonuses with seemingly no heed to the profitability of their companies. It is just because they can. Apart from some vague remonstration, about fairness, which they have decided to ignore, there is no reason why they should curb their excesses and they are not going to do so. Charles Cronin London SW11 Anyone who believes they need the kind of grossly enlarged pay given to senior executives is either completely incompetent in managing their own affairs or just greedy. Either way, they are clearly not people who should be entrusted with responsibility. Co-op members should show the way by bringing pay for their executives down to reasonable levels.

A surprising choice, perhaps. He doesn&apos;t have hundreds of thousands of followers on social media, or a blockbuster YouTube channel and million-dollar sponsorship deal. He doesn&apos;t even have a good internet connection. But the work of journalist, youth activist and anti-drone campaigner Farea al-Muslimi has taken him on quite a journey. This farmer&apos;s son from the poor Yemeni village of Wessab was invited to appear before a US senate judiciary committee in April last year. Six days before he was due to speak, his village was hit by a US drone. He subsequently gave a moving first-hand account of the suffering, arguing that the drone strikes were counter-productive in turning people away from the US and towards the insurgents. &quot;What our violent militants had failed to achieve, one drone strike accomplished in an instant,&quot; he told the senators. Video of his testimony was shared widely on social media. With the help of a US State Department scholarship, he spent a year at a US high school improving his English, before studying public policy at the American University of Beirut. &quot;I don&apos;t know if I got into journalism, or if journalism got into me,&quot; he says. Farea started his media life as a local journalist on Yemeni papers, before working as a &quot;fixer&quot; \u2013 an assistant and translator for foreign journalists. He was frustrated with the lack of Yemeni voices talking about the country to an international audience. &quot;What is written about Yemen isn&apos;t accurate,&quot; he says. &quot;I decided to channel my frustration and I started to write.&quot; He wants to improve the representation of Yemen&apos;s rural population. &quot;If you talk to people in the capital city about the problems faced by those in remote towns, it&apos;s like you&apos;re talking about people in another country,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s ironic that it was more possible for me to deliver my voice to the parliament of another country than to the parliament of my own.&quot; Perhaps surprisingly, he is somewhat sceptical about the power of social media, stressing that the platforms sites such as Twitter are largely meaningful only if you speak English and, more importantly, if you have access to the internet. In his home village of Wessab, there isn&apos;t even electricity. He says he owes his precocious success to so many people \u2013 including those who taught him English and awarded his scholarship money. Nonetheless, Al-Muslimi is the ultimate example of what it&apos;s possible to do if you have an internet connection and a story to tell. \u2022 Who have we missed?

The 31-year-old, known for his top-class sprint successes on Borderlescott, Markab and Society Rock, offended the stewards with his ride on Anaerobio in the Jebel Hatta, a Group One, at Meydan on 8 March. Anaerobio was a 20-1 shot who set the pace in a race eventually won by his stablemate Vercingetorix, the 2-1 favourite. At the turn for home Anaerobio rolled off the inside rail, leaving a gap through which Vercingetorix sailed. The ERA has now ruled that Cosgrave&apos;s manoeuvre was a deliberate attempt to favour his mount&apos;s stablemate and noted in its published ruling that Cosgrave had looked behind him &quot;on at least three occasions&quot; before leaving the rail. This, in the ERA&apos;s view, constituted a &quot;blatant&quot; breach of the rules against &quot;improper riding&quot;, which risked damaging the sport&apos;s image. Cosgrave was allowed no period of grace in which to consider his options, the ban being backdated to the day before the ruling, so that he is immediately banned worldwide until 17 September. However, the ERA found no evidence to implicate either Mike de Kock, trainer of both Vercingetorix and Anaerobio, or Christophe Soumillon, who rode Vercingetorix. Paul Struthers, chief executive of the Professional Jockeys Association, said he had been in contact with Cosgrave and that an appeal was likely. Asked how Cosgrave, who remains in Dubai, had taken the news, Struthers said drily: &quot;As you would expect.&quot; An appeal is not without risk, as the ERA&apos;s rules allow it to make an order of costs up to 200,000 Emirati Dirhams, about \u00a333,000, against an unsuccessful appellant. Cosgrave&apos;s best hope may be to ask the British Horseracing Authority to refuse to reciprocate the ban on the grounds that it is disproportionate. But the BHA would entertain such a request only if the ERA&apos;s appeals procedure has been exhausted. The equivalent British rules, created to prevent team tactics, suggest a ban of five to 10 days for a rider who makes a manoeuvre to assist another horse, provided he does not cause interference to others. The BHA is to investigate after the latest seller at Southwell in which a significant late non-runner created a favourable situation for anyone who had backed the eventual winner. Stand Guard, the odds-on favourite, was withdrawn after connections reported he had not eaten up, leaving an easy task for Mr Burbidge, who won at 1-10. Connections of Stand Guard were unavailable for comment. A statement from the ruling body said it had had unspecified concerns about the race in advance and had alerted both the Gambling Commission and several bookmakers.

A spokesman for his owners said the horse suffered ligament damage at Down Royal on Monday and would be on the sidelines for at least six months.

The culmination of the Six Nations, a north-London derby, Manchester United&apos;s latest capitulation and a grand prix all commanded headlines as Hull was carding 62 in the wind to earn a play-off place at the Lalla Meryem Cup in Morocco. It was a shootout she won with a birdie at the first extra hole. Hull had trailed the leader by five shots going into the final round. And the important part of winning her first European Tour title? She is only 17. Even those who had not recognised it before \u2013 amid Hull&apos;s nerveless performance at the Solheim Cup, for example \u2013 must now acknowledge that Britain has a new golfing star. Hull is on a steep upward curve which, were she male, would have been granted far more significant exposure. The vital age statistic will change on Thursday, when Hull will celebrate a milestone birthday with friends and family at home in Northampton. Sunday&apos;s early presents included a cheque for \u20ac67,500 (\u00a356,700) and a diamond-encrusted purse worth even more than that. &quot;I wanted to win when I was still 17. I&apos;m still 17 and I won,&quot; Hull said. &quot;Definitely before I was 18, I wanted to get a win in and it&apos;s fantastic, the best birthday present I could have.&quot; Hull leads the women&apos;s European Tour Order of Merit and has risen to within the top 70 players in the world. It is legitimate to ask, &quot;What next?&quot; In the bigger picture what a boost it would be if women&apos;s golf in Europe could meaningfully feed off the success of Hull and, recently, Cheyenne Woods. The gap in resources between the sport in Europe and in the United States is even more stated than in the men&apos;s version, leading to inevitable suggestions that Hull will be coaxed towards more lucrative things across the Atlantic before too long. As in the men&apos;s game that talent drain is a harsh reality of European success given the contrasting sums involved. In a fortnight&apos;s time the first women&apos;s major of the year will take place for Hull and her fellow players; the Kraft Nabisco Championship in Palm Springs. Quite rightly, given her confidence level, Hull has her eyes fixed on victory. When another major \u2013 the Open \u2013 was played at Muirfield last summer, the standard row about the Royal &amp; Ancient&apos;s willingness to host the competition at a club which retains a male-only membership policy took place. Within the next week there may well be an update from the R&amp;A on that front. The unfortunate aspect of that loud Muirfield discussion is that too many of those who were delighted to create a fuss around it are unwilling to divert proportionate, positive energies towards the women&apos;s game. A number of leading figures in women&apos;s golf made that very point, rightly, at the time. Tokenistic, occasionally-political debate appeared and disappeared with equal rapidity. Hull has once again promoted all that is positive about her sport. It must be hoped she encourages others, not only within it, to do likewise. Green shoots in the desert  The array of terrific courses in the United Arab Emirates is already widely known, with the continued popularity of the country as a golf tourist destination supplying the proof. It has been a source of disappointment that no homegrown player has emerged to give inspiration to others. Other sports have enjoyed a head start over golf in seeking young Emirati involvement. Step forward the 23-year-old Ahmed Al Musharrekh, who has been confirmed as the first Emirate native player to begin his full training with the Professional Golfers&apos; Association. Amid what is a three-year training scheme, he will be employed as an assistant professional at the superb Dubai Creek golf club. Musharrekh has already played in professional events and will do so again on the Mena Tour this week. That particular tour has offered a separate prize pot this year for Arab players, as an incentive for them to join the leading amateur or professional ranks. Musharrekh&apos;s prominence should carry more weight than money. He could well be a figurehead for golf in his region; which would be a more valuable legacy than any tangible reward he could glean from tournament play. Na the serial go-slow merchant  The slow-play penalty issued to Guan Tianlang at last year&apos;s Masters was not entirely worthy of the widespread criticism it received. If, that is, there was calculated logic applied to the sending of a message to young golfers over the pace at which they move around the course. That said, it was impossible not to see the contradiction in the treatment of Guan when watching Kevin Na&apos;s antics once again on the PGA Tour. Na stopped only marginally short of undertaking laboratory soil analysis before each shot. The most interesting chat over this unedifying business arrived from Brandt Snedeker, who could never be accused of holding anyone back. The man from Nashville explained that, when placed on the clock, he deliberately slows down his game so as to highlight properly the player or players in his group who are causing the problem.

That run is now in serious doubt, after the world No1 withdrew from the Arnold Palmer Invitational because of back trouble. Woods has played at Augusta National every year since 1995 and has won it four times. Yet the severity of his latest injury condition has become clear; Woods walked off the course 13 holes into his final round at the Honda Classic and was in obvious pain at the WGC-Cadillac Championship in Doral this month. Having chosen to miss Bay Hill, his last scheduled tournament before the Masters, Woods is in a race against time to feature at Augusta at all. &quot;It&apos;s too early to know about the Masters,&quot; Woods said. &quot;I will continue to be evaluated and work closely with my doctors. Back spasms and the pain haven&apos;t subsided.&quot; Palmer was among those to send best wishes to Woods, despite the obviously negative impact on interest levels in his tournament this week. &quot;I am certainly sorry that Tiger is not able to play,&quot; Palmer said. &quot;Quite obviously, we will miss having him here this week. He called me to tell me that his back was still giving him a lot of trouble and he didn&apos;t feel he should play. I told him I understood and wished him well.&quot; Earlier, Woods had admitted he had to think about his long-term health and that his back issue &quot;just flares up&quot;. He added: &quot;It would be nice if I could just have a week off, where I could shut down and get some treatment.&quot; The fortnight gap between Doral and Bay Hill, though, appears to have done Woods little or no good at all. The potential impact on Woods&apos; bid to match Jack Nicklaus&apos; record of 18 majors \u2013 he is four adrift \u2013 has not been lost on anybody in golfing circles. Woods&apos; fitness looks to be the most significant barrier with regards to the Nicklaus haul. At 38, Woods may simply be wilting under year upon year of intensive golf. He had knee surgery earlier in his career with elbow and wrist problems also prevalent then. Last August was the first time he cited a back issue, which even a light playing schedule since has not removed. Woods has had his worst start to a year as a professional. He failed to survive for all four rounds at the Farmers Insurance Classic, tied 41st in the Dubai Desert Classic, withdrew from Honda and was 25th at Doral. Should Adam Scott win at Bay Hill this weekend, the Australian will overtake Woods as the top-ranked player in the world. Woods has, though, previously played at the Masters after a low-key buildup. In 2010, it marked his first event of the year after the scandal which engulfed his private life; he finished in a tie for fourth. A year earlier, Woods had played only three times before Augusta. The key difference in 2009 and 2010 is that the lack of playing time was Woods&apos; own choice. Meanwhile, September&apos;s Ryder Cup will be the furthest thing from Woods&apos; mind but the organisers have announced the sale of an extra 5,000 tickets per day. The Gleneagles meeting of Europe and the United States will therefore be attended by more spectators than any of its predecessors. Richard Hills, Europe&apos;s Ryder Cup director, said: &quot;We&apos;re delighted to be able to release further tickets to the general public. Those who were unsuccessful in last year&apos;s sales process now have a final opportunity to snap up a Ryder Cup match-day ticket. &quot;These are not corporate hospitality tickets or sponsor allocations.

No doubt Andy Murray will miss Ivan Lendl&apos;s inspirational presence in his player&apos;s box, chin planted motionlessly for hours on upturned palm, dark glasses under a baseball cap hiding his smart, still eyes, brain clocking every hit and miss. But he&apos;ll get over it. When Lendl confirmed on Wednesday that he was walking away from the sport&apos;s most successful partnership of recent times \u2013 two grand slam titles and an Olympic gold medal in the two-and-a-bit years they were together \u2013 Murray was not devastated. They have been talking about breaking up &quot;for a little while&quot;, I understand. An insider described it as &quot;like a relationship that had run its course, but the divorce was amicable&quot;. However, they have not seen each other since Murray lost to Roger Federer in the quarter-finals of the Australian Open, and Lendl might have been mildly concerned that Murray was embarking on a too-busy schedule, playing Acapulco for the first time as well as an exhibition in New York before the American hard-court swing. There was also his curious commitment to the end-of-season International Premier Tennis League in Asia, slap bang in the middle of his cherished winter training block in Miami. Murray&apos;s next move will be to do his best this week in the Miami Open \u2013 where he defends the title and 1,000 ranking points \u2013 then return to Europe for a seriously slimmed-down clay programme. He will play Madrid, Rome and Roland Garros but misses Monte Carlo and has changed his mind about Estoril. There is, I am told, no urgency about replacing Lendl \u2013 nor any obvious favourite for one of the most prized jobs in tennis. Darren Cahill, the astute Australian who travels extensively with ESPN and Adidas, might step in again temporarily, as he did in 2012 in the weird period between the sacking of Miles Maclagan and Alex Corretja, and Lendl&apos;s appointment before the 2012 Australian Open. Murray also admires the philosophy of former world No 1 Mats Wilander, but the expatriate Swede spends most of the American summer doing small-town coaching clinics from the back of his Winnebago. In the short (and long) term, the ever-present Dani Vallverdu, who has been with Murray as confidant and hitting partner since they were teenagers, will be there again. Murray&apos;s priority after leaving America will be Great Britain&apos;s Davis Cup tie against Italy in Naples next month, then an extended training block on clay, possibly in Barcelona, where he used to work with Corretja. If his universe seems out of kilter, the split with Lendl left no bomb craters. The Czech was never hands-on. He often barked from afar. Murray happily took late-night, long-distance phone calls from him when he needed encouragement before a big match, and the respect and trust were mutual. Lendl, not the most emotional of men, never disguised his admiration for Murray, even if he was not always there to witness his deeds first hand. Asked about Murray&apos;s struggle to rediscover his form since his back operation in September, Lendl said \u2013 while playing in an exhibition tournament in London \u2013 that he heard from Vallverdu that his friend had just played the best tennis of his comeback in Acapulco. When Murray was struggling to keep the ball in court in a hapless exit from Indian Wells last week, Lendl was on the same continent, but not the same page, swapping pleasantries with drunken fans during an exhibition match in Nashville. Murray said Lendl&apos;s absence made no difference. He was just searching for his best tennis, still. The back was fine \u2013 but maybe the head was not in such a wonderful place. Through the muted interpretation of a TV screen, Murray looked distracted and resigned, rather than bruised in defeat. Paradoxically, Lendl&apos;s departure coincides with the recent arrival on the coaching scene of two of his contemporaries to guide Murray&apos;s rivals: Stefan Edberg, who has helped Federer win in Dubai and reach the final in Indian Wells; and Boris Becker, markedly less successful with Novak Djokovic, who lost to Stanislas Wawrinka in the Australian Open semi-finals and beat Federer in Indian Wells without the German&apos;s assistance. The role of a coach in tennis is ill-defined. There was a time when they were hardly noticed, a time before back-up teams and hi-tech training. Some players, such as Rafael Nadal, rarely contemplate change, and his uncle Toni will almost certainly be there until he retires. They are a comfortable fit and a new voice probably would confuse Nadal. Murray for years was unsettled. His first mentor as a teenage prodigy was Leon Smith, his Davis Cup captain and mentioned on Wednesdayamong leading candidates in betting speculation about a successor. Mark Petchey took over when Murray joined the Tour, and the door kept revolving until Lendl arrived. The coach said shortly after joining him he could see no reason they would not be together for the rest of the player&apos;s career. Murray agreed. Apparently they found a reason. Lendl will be there in the stands for Murray in Miami. No doubt the player will look up, instinctively, at the man who helped him make history. Lendl might even manage a smile. Or maybe not. Sentiment has never figured in his dealings, although Old Stone Face was not a total lump of rock. &quot;He believed in me when other people didn&apos;t,&quot; is how Murray put it after he won Wimbledon last summer.

It clearly has not been lost on those smart characters who compile odds that the Swede has endured a low-key start to 2014 having completed last year in stunning touch. &quot;I hope you didn&apos;t go all in,&quot; Stenson says, with typical dry humour when reminded of his earlier betting prominence. His character remains arguably the most engaging and likable in golf. The serious point is this: can Stenson recover lost form in the three weeks before the first major of the year? Appearances in Abu Dhabi, Qatar, Dubai, plus the WGC events in Tucson and Doral, have failed to yield strong results. Stenson&apos;s latest attempt at a kickstart comes this week at Bay Hill. &quot;There is still time,&quot; he insists. &quot;I am not where I want to be with any aspect of my game, mentally or physically. But there is time and I hope I can turn it up. &quot;There is no way I am going to have a good Masters if I have the same mindset that I had at Doral: going around being annoyed with the golf course all week is not going to make you play good golf. I obviously need to change that.&quot; He adds: &quot;Playing Augusta should help, even though it is a tough test. The course should suit me, but it is the major where I have had the worst results. I wouldn&apos;t rank myself as a favourite but it is a golf course where I really believe I can do well, if I go there with a good game and a good head.&quot; It would be ludicrous to write off Stenson&apos;s Masters chances. Punters should beware the golfer who plays down his own prospects. When Stenson is properly focused, he can win anywhere and is capable of raising his game for major championships, as befitting the world No3. Stenson can smile, again, when recalling his fortunes \u2013 or lack or them \u2013 a year ago. &quot;I&apos;m pretty much perfectly the same,&quot; he says. &quot;I was playing very average, low on patience and not the happiest person when I was at Puerto Rico last year \u2013 which was exactly the same week as Doral. &quot;So everything is [going] according to plan. I have played very average the first couple of months of the season again this year. So up until now, I am bang on track. I need to turn it on at some point, like I did last year.&quot; There are also extenuating circumstances behind Stenson&apos;s recent problems. He played through 2013 with a wrist injury and, upon winning both the FedEx Cup and Race to Dubai, had to learn pretty quickly about the pressures such success brings. &quot;Expectation is always going to be a little bit of a factor, but for me it has been more about now having enough of a break in between the seasons,&quot; Stenson says. &quot;You are trying to push hard and trying to get going when you are physically and mentally not right there. So that is making it hard at the moment. &quot;I always knew it would be hard; even in the last couple of tournaments for the Race to Dubai, I was running on fumes. I just managed to ride the wave. It was a great six months for me but after that, you need a bit of time to recover and I haven&apos;t really been able to do that. &quot;You are trying to rest at the same time as you are trying to kick off a new season. You are trying to go even more when you are more tired than you should be. &quot;So it is a catch-22. What do you do? I can&apos;t take any tournaments off because of my memberships both in the States and in Europe. I am playing a good 25-30 tournaments and I can&apos;t afford to take anything out even though I wouldn&apos;t mind having a month off for some rest and practice, to try and get back into the groove. I don&apos;t have that luxury, unfortunately.&quot; Tiger Woods does play a lighter schedule, deliberately so amid increasing concerns over his physical wellbeing. Yet Stenson&apos;s in-focus position has afforded him glimpses of what life is like for the 14-time major winner. &quot;I played 50% more tournaments than Tiger did last year, which of course is going to put more strain on you,&quot; Stenson says. &quot;But on the other hand, he is right in the middle of the spotlight absolutely all of the time, which is quite a draining experience. It is draining even playing with him, which I have done quite a bit over the past six months. So I have come to imagine how draining it must be being him. &quot;It is definitely impressive that he can keep on doing it. In my book he is the best golfer ever to play the game given that he has kept on playing and winning for such a long time.&quot; Stenson will himself return to golf&apos;s fast lane.

She is employed part-time \u2013 27 hours a week over three days \u2013 as an administrative assistant by HMRC, but even with government help through tax credits her childcare costs are currently a huge dent in her outgoings, even more than her mortgage repayments. Most months she is lucky if she has \u00a320 left over to save for a holiday or a treat for the boys. She will be better off \u2013 but not until next year \u2013 as a result of the government&apos;s budget pledge to give more support to the lowest earners \u2013 on tax credits and later, universal credit \u2013 by increasing support for childcare from 70% to 85% of costs. Taslima earns just over \u00a313,000 a year, a net \u00a3952 a month, and as a basic rate taxpayer she will also benefit from the increase in the personal allowance to \u00a310,500 from next year. The boys attend a private nursery where Taslima gets a 10% reduction on two separate sets of fees (not all such childcare settings offer this help). On top of her net salary and child benefit of \u00a3134 she receives \u00a31,202 a month from tax credits which includes child tax credit, working tax credit and the childcare element (all being phased out and replaced with universal credit). She shells out \u00a3918 in childcare costs every month, while her other regular outgoings amount to \u00a3850, including mortgage payments, travel costs, household bills and clothing. &quot;There&apos;s hardly anything left at the end of the month&quot;, she reflects. &quot;I work hard and I enjoy my job. But each month I earn pretty much the same as my childcare costs and at times it doesn&apos;t seem fair as I have very little left over to try and save. Without help from tax credits there is no way I could have gone back to work.&quot; She keeps spending on anything other than essentials to a bare minimum, which is a challenge with two active toddlers: &quot;I have to buy two sets of everything and, of course, at this stage, the boys are growing quickly and needing new clothes all the time.&quot; She hunts down reduced food and other bargains in her local supermarket and \u2013 after two years of pushing around an increasingly heavy double buggy \u2013 has recently bought a second-hand car to help ferry her boys around. The scrapping of the fuel duty rise planned for September will ease her costs a little. Once on universal credit as a low earner she won&apos;t qualify for the new childcare voucher scheme announced in the budget and due to come into force next year. But she will get 85% of the costs of childcare funded by the government (provided her nursery is in an Ofsted-approved setting) and provided that she continues to work and earn more than the personal tax allowance. She was disappointed that the government did not announce moves towards more flexibility in the workplace for someone like her who enjoys working but questions her work/life balance. On the days when she is in the office \u2013 from 8am to 5.30pm \u2013 her boys are in the nursery from 7am to 6pm.     Budget 2014 case studies: Ben Brocklesby. Photograph: Frantzesco Kangaris/Frantzesco Kangaris for The Guardian    The exporter Juliette Garside: The chancellor wants to boost exports to \u00a31tn by 2020 and Origin Frames, a manufacturer of upmarket bi-folding doors based in High Wycombe, is one of an army of small enterprises whose contribution could help achieve that target. Founded by Victoria Brocklesby and her cousin in 2001, Origin is family-funded and has never borrowed from the banks. But the firm is expanding abroad, with an office already established in Dubai and another set to open in Florida, and may soon decide to seek outside investment. George Osborne&apos;s overhaul of the UK Export Finance scheme could help. Its budget will double to \u00a33bn and interest rates will be cut to the lowest permitted levels. The government says it will work with banks to ensure smaller companies can benefit alongside the mid-sized and large businesses that already use the scheme. To encourage exporters, the Treasury is also cutting air passenger duty for long-haul flights to countries more than 4,000 miles from Britain. &quot;The current government has realised the importance of getting the balance of imports and exports back in line,&quot; said Ben Brocklesby, who is married to the founder and heads sales and marketing at Origin. &quot;What this might encourage us to do is to speed up our expansion by tapping into this resource that they are making even more accessible than before.&quot; His company makes the kind of bespoke aluminium folding doors popular with homeowners wanting glass walls between the kitchen and the back garden, as well as aluminium blinds and windows. The payroll has grown from 25 staff in 2009 to 95 today, and revenue has reached \u00a313m. Since the Dubai office opened three years ago, exports have grown to 7.5% of revenue. America is expected to add \u00a31.5m in the first year, and up to \u00a315m by year five. To plan its move overseas, Origin has also benefitted to the tune of about \u00a315,000 from grants disbursed by UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) and other public bodies, using the money to conduct market research, train staff and attend international trade fairs. Brocklesby said: &quot;UKTI have been a real benefit to us and our export plans. To see them getting more clout and more financial subisidies is a real help to businesses like mine.&quot;     Budget 2014 case studies: Sarah, Simon and Jackson Hall. Photograph: Gary Calton    The ISA savers Juliet Stott and Patrick Collinson: The kitchen ceiling fell in last week, so Sarah and Simon Hall from York once again had to dip into their family savings to pay for repairs. Like 24 million other people in Britain, they have an Isa, but the new \u00a315,000 annual limit will be of little help to them, as they struggle to keep a lid on rising household bills which makes saving for anything other than a rainy-day fund virtually impossible. &quot;We have \u00a38,000 in an Isa which we try to top up, but finding \u00a3100 or \u00a3200 a month is really difficult when things like the ceiling falls or the car insurance is due,&quot; says Sarah, a housing strategy manager with one son, Jackson, aged 4. The pension reforms also leave her non-plussed. At 37 years old, Sarah is in the generation of women who won&apos;t be able to qualify for a state pension until they are 68. &quot;No doubt between now and the time I retire they will move the goalposts again and again,&quot; she says. She has a &apos;defined contribution&apos; style pension scheme where the amount she will receive in retirement will depend on the performance of the stock market. &quot;I&apos;m fairly cautious with money so I don&apos;t think I will go out and spend it all when I retire. But the thing with pensions is that they are very difficult to understand and I suppose we will go with the flow at the time.&quot; The Halls were hit hard by the economic downturn - having to cope with redundancy and compulsory pay cuts. Although they have a healthy joint annual household income of more than \u00a360,000, they are still \u00a310,000 worse off since the economic crisis took hold. In 2011 Sarah was made redundant from her well paid job shortly after returning from maternity leave. At the same time Simon, a principal landscape architect, was asked to take a 10% salary sacrifice. &quot;That was the biggest hit and financially we are still recovering from it. Although we are both now working full time again and on full pay we&apos;re still paying ourselves back from that time,&quot; says Sarah. Simon, who still has a daily commute to Leeds, switched from train travel which became &quot;prohibitively expensive&quot; to the buses saving him more than \u00a310 a day. They now regularly shop in Aldi or Lidl for their &apos;essentials&apos; and buy only luxury food and treats from Waitrose or Tesco \u2013 saving on average \u00a320 a week. Since their son Jackson is now at school full time they&apos;re no longer forking out for childcare costs, so the chancellor&apos;s proposed childcare subsidy comes too little, too late for this family. &quot;That said, there is still some cost as he goes to breakfast club one morning a week and after school club, which costs \u00a315 - \u00a320 a week.&quot; They are also concerned about becoming 40% taxpayers. &quot;I think everybody feels like they&apos;re in the &apos;squeezed middle&apos; if you&apos;re working. We&apos;re earning decent money and have got decent jobs but the 40% tax bracket is getting to people like us who are just recovering from the last few years of recession,&quot; says Sarah. She believes lots of people are in a similar position to them. &quot;We don&apos;t do without. We&apos;re not struggling for money. We ought to be very grateful for what we have. We can put food on the table and we&apos;re not using food banks. But you think we&apos;ve been working all these years, getting promotions and moving on but not getting any further financially. Our savings aren&apos;t really mounting up and we haven&apos;t be able to move or upsize the house. We&apos;re on the treadmill but not moving forward. We&apos;re standing still in financial terms.&quot;     Budget 2014 case studies: unemployed single mum Sarah Facey. Photograph: Dimitris Legakis/D Legakis/Athena Picture Agency    The unemployed jobseeker Patrick Butler: Sarah Facey did not expect the budget to help low income people like her who struggle each week with the cost of living: and so it turned out. Her first thought after the chancellor sat down after finished his speech? &quot;Not a lot is actually going to make a positive difference to me.&quot; It was a speech designed to appeal to the relatively affluent, reckoned Facey, 32, an unemployed single mother from Cwmcarn, a former mining village near Newport, South Wales. &quot;It was aimed at people earning decent money and who are financially secure. People who are struggling day to day didn&apos;t get a look in.&quot; Facey, a university graduate, receives jobseekers&apos; allowance, child benefit, and child tax credits. She currently gets by on \u00a3128 a week once she has contributed a portion of the \u00a3350 monthly rent on her two bedroom private rented property. After energy bills and water rates are paid she draws up a detailed monthly budget, working out to the last \u00a31 what she has left to spend on food and clothes for her and her 10 year old son Callum. With prices rising, her budget is getting tighter. &quot;You are limited to what you can buy. There&apos;s not a lot of fresh fruit. I&apos;m lucky because we qualify for free school meals so at least Callum gets one good meal a day.&quot; Facey has been unemployed for a few months after being made redundant in November from a job as a part-time administrative assistant at a local firm. She was bewildered by the chancellor&apos;s claim to have got Britain working: her last job lasted just three months; there are few job opportunities where she lives, and even fewer that suit a Mum wanting part-time work during school hours and needing to work at least at least 16 hours a week to qualify for tax credits. The chancellor&apos;s offer of free child care looked good, she said. But there were shortages of child minders, and the local nursery would not do after-school pick ups for children over eight. The prospect of marginally lower heating bills was &quot;not going to make a massive difference&quot;. The boost for savers was irrelevant: &quot;I have no money spare each month to put into savings.&quot; The increase in income tax personal allowance might help, but &quot;only if the jobs are out there.&quot; Even the so-called populist measures, such as a penny off the beer duty are meaningless, says Facey: &quot;I don&apos;t drink very often, it&apos;s very rare. It&apos;s the last thing on my mind that I could buy booze cheaper.&quot; Ultimately, it is all about jobs, says Facey, and there are so few out there that she says sometimes even her jobcentre advisor finds it hard to find positions for her to apply to. &quot;I don&apos;t think politicians have a grasp of the day-to-day for people claiming benefits. They say there is rising employment but I do not see it.&quot; The haulage boss Simon Bowers: For Peter Barber, managing director of Milton Keynes-based haulage firm W H Barley, said the chancellor&apos;s decision to scrap a scheduled rise in fuel duty this autumn and freeze the level was welcome, but not unexpected.  &quot;I would have been surprised if it hadn&apos;t happened,&quot; he reflected, though his dim hopes of a 3p cut were dashed. &quot;They [the government] have done as much as they want to with fuel, I think.&quot; Of more of a surprise, was Osborne&apos;s decision to temporarily double investment tax allowance from next month to \u00a3500,000. With new trailers already on order for April and August, this is a huge boon for Barber&apos;s \u00a36m turnover business. He had already been delighted at previously announced rise in the allowance from \u00a325,000 to \u00a3250,000. He was ecstatic to learn the period had been extended, and the allowance doubled. W H Barley has 39 trucks and employs 75 staff transporting palletted freight \u2014 everything from building materials and machinery to food and cosmetics \u2014 across the UK and Ireland, largely for customers based in and around Milton Keynes. Barber recalls how business fell away in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. &quot;Since then we have rebuilt and we are back beyond where we were. We have more turnover and more vehicles.&quot; Last year his staff received a 3% pay rise after freezes for a couple of years while dividends received by Barber and a relative doubled to \u00a345,683. The company, which had a 2013 wage bill of \u00a31.6m, has another pay review in October and Barber says he is now planning for another 3% increase.The haulage boss said he expected his workforce to welcome the increase in the personal allowance on income tax. &quot;I think everybody [here] is a bit of a winner.&quot;", "title": "Budget 2014 case studies: 'people who are struggling didn't get a look in'", "sentences": ["But the firm is expanding abroad, with an office already established in Dubai and another set to open in Florida, and may soon decide to seek outside investment.", "Since the Dubai office opened three years ago, exports have grown to 7.5% of revenue."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-19T18:02:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/19/martin-harley-hospitalised-after-red-art-fatal-fall", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Tony McCoy", "Paul Bittar", "British Horseracing Authority", "Kempton", "Sport"], "article": "A day of turmoil in the betting markets at the low-grade cards at Lingfield and Kempton on Wednesday was overshadowed by a serious fall for Martin Harley, who was fired into the ground in the closing stages of Lingfield&apos;s second race when his mount Red Art suffered a fatal injury. Harley was crowded well inside the final furlong on Red Art as he tried to deliver a late challenge, and his mount then appeared to clip heels with another runner, causing the jockey to suffer a crashing fall. Harley, who is due to ride Mount Athos in the Dubai Sheema Classic, one of the world&apos;s most valuable turf events, at Meydan in Dubai on Saturday week, was taken to East Surrey Hospital for examination, believed to be for possible rib injuries. Paul Struthers, the chief executive of the Professional Jockeys&apos; Association, said on Twitter on Wednesday evening that Harley would be transferred to St George&apos;s Hospital in Tooting for further examination. &quot;No further updates at this stage until tomorrow in all probability,&quot; Struthers said, &quot;but Martin is conscious and stable and is thankful for all your kind wishes.&quot; Red Art was one of a series of runners at the two all-weather meetings which were the subject of strong market support. During the course of the morning, two separate gambles appeared to be taking place, the first involving five horses linked to the owner Stephen Arnold, and the second centred around four runners, including Red Art from the Tony Newcombe stable. It also emerged during the morning that the British Horseracing Authority had &quot;alerted the Gambling Commission yesterday [Tuesday] to the possibility of a complex betting-related issue involving races at Lingfield and Kempton&quot;. A statement from the BHA said that the regulator had acted &quot;to protect both the integrity and image of the sport and the interests of the betting public&quot;, and that &quot;the full circumstances surrounding the case will be examined&quot;. The first three runners linked to Arnold produced a single winner with two more unplaced on the card at Lingfield, while Newcombe&apos;s second runner at the course, Dorback, was declared a non-runner after Harley&apos;s fall. Newcombe had another non-runner and a loser on Kempton&apos;s evening card. Pat Cosgrave, who was banned from riding for six months by the Emirates Racing Authority on Tuesday, is to appeal against the decision. Cosgrave, who was riding Anaerobio in the Jebel Hatta at Meydan on 8 March, was found guilty of improper riding after ERA stewards decided he had deliberately moved off the rail in the home straight to allow Vercingetorix, the eventual winner and a stablemate of Cosgrave&apos;s mount, a clear run to the line. &quot;In this country, if Pat was found in breach of any rules the penalty guidance in Britain is absolutely clear,&quot; Struthers said. &quot;It&apos;s five to 10 days with an entry point of seven. Pat, Christophe [Soumillon, the jockey on Vercingetorix] and Mike [de Kock, trainer of both horses] denied team tactics. The appeal is going in and I&apos;d be pretty certain if it is entirely unsuccessful then the application [for the ban not to be reciprocated] will go to the BHA because it is just a brutal penalty.&quot; Paul Bittar, the chief executive of the British Horseracing Authority, said on Wednesday that commitments by George Osborne, the chancellor, to reform and extend the reach of the Levy system represent a &quot;major milestone in our efforts to secure the future finances of our industry&quot;. In his budget statement, Osborne said the government will &quot;extend the horserace betting Levy to bookmakers who are based offshore. And we&apos;ll look at wider Levy reform and at introducing a &apos;racing right&apos; to support the sport.&quot; Bittar said in response: &quot;For too long we have sought a funding mechanism which reflects the nature of the modern racing and betting industries. Today&apos;s commitment brings us considerably closer to achieving this goal, and securing the future prosperity of one of the country&apos;s leading sports, and a major employer across the country.&quot; Tony McCoy, who will be crowned champion National Hunt jockey for the 19th time when the season ends in April, rode his 200th winner of the campaign when Palermo Don, the 8-11 favourite, took the final race at Haydock on Wednesday.

Two months since his early return from England&apos;s disastrous Ashes tour, on which he bowled only 15 overs in a single appearance in Alice Springs after the Test series had started, Finn was named in the Middlesex team for a two-day friendly against Surrey. It was a solid enough start, too, as he took one for 25 from 11 overs, including four maidens, on a pitch that offered surprisingly little to the seamers, according to the Middlesex director of cricket, Angus Fraser, considering it is only mid-March. &quot;I don&apos;t know how they&apos;ve done it, but it&apos;s really flat,&quot; said Fraser, who is now also an England selector, after Surrey&apos;s openers Rory Burns and Arun Harinath had batted through the morning session. &quot;It&apos;s good to see Steven out there bowling again.&quot; Fraser, Finn and England had stressed the importance of the 24-year-old taking a complete break from cricket after his Ashes nightmare, which ruled him out of contention for the World Twenty20 squad. The plan is for him to play a full part in Middlesex&apos;s pre-season programme, which continues with a four-day match in Somerset next week, before an intriguing first County Championship fixture against Sussex starting at Hove on 6 April when he is likely to come up against another of the England players desperate to put a miserable winter behind them, Matt Prior. Prior is currently in Dubai where Sussex are finalising their preparations and has been joined there by a Lancashire squad including Jimmy Anderson. Jonathan Trott, who is certain to be another focus of attention this spring, has not travelled to the Caribbean with Warwickshire for their pre-season tour and will instead make his first appearance since an even earlier departure from Australia in a two-day match against Gloucestershire starting at Edgbaston on Tuesday week. England&apos;s captain Alastair Cook has returned to practice with Essex but is not expected to play until their three-day game against Cambridge University which starts at Fenners on 7 April. Fraser also confirmed that Middlesex hope to sign Dan Christian, the Australian all-rounder who is currently in Bangladesh preparing for the World Twenty20, as their second overseas player for the rebranded NatWest Blast this summer. Chris Rogers is already contracted as Middlesex&apos;s overseas player for the County Championship and several counties have decided not to bother signing a big name for the T20 because the tournament has been extended this summer and will now spread through three months. However, Middlesex are set to buck that trend with the signing of Christian, a renowned T20 specialist who has been a big-money recruit in the Indian Premier League in previous years \u2013 but was surprisingly snubbed at the 2014 auction, meaning he will be available for the whole T20 competition unlike other high-profile recruits such as Surrey&apos;s Kevin Pietersen and Yorkshire&apos;s Aaron Finch who may be in India until early June.", "title": "Steven Finn goes back to school to take first steps towards England return", "sentences": ["Prior is currently in Dubai where Sussex are finalising their preparations and has been joined there by a Lancashire squad including Jimmy Anderson."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-20T18:03:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media-network/media-network-blog/2014/mar/21/government-open-data-day", "tags": ["Media & Tech Network", "Activate", "Global development professionals network", "Technology", "Big data", "Technology", "Government data", "Politics", "Data"], "article": "Last month, tech-savvy activists logged on around the world to take part in various hackathons for Open Data Day. The aim was to encourage the world&apos;s local, regional and national governments to share more of their data online. It&apos;s an great idea, but there&apos;s still a lack of meaningful analysis around how well governments are actually doing in opening up information to their citizens. Here&apos;s a snapshot of what we know and what it means. Open government data is growing and can be transformative First, the good news: there&apos;s a steady upward trend in governments opening up data to the public. Around a fifth of the world&apos;s national governments have launched data portals collating information on everything from public spending to land ownership. The US led the way, setting up their portal in 2009 with the UK following a year later. Far from lagging behind, developing countries are also joining the trend. India launched an open data portal in August last year and the Philippines followed suit only last month. There is also evidence that this opening up is having an effect. As part of its open data drive in Mauritius, the government published data, which mapped land ownership across the entire country. This has led to better scrutiny by civil society in the country and a decrease in land grabs. The project has been so successful that the World Bank is now looking to fund similar such mapping projects across much of Africa. Developed country doesn&apos;t always equal developed data  Hardly a day goes by without a story appearing in the media related to murky dealings in the developing world, but things aren&apos;t that simple. Having a government data portal means nothing if the information is selective or irrelevant. If you want to investigate corruption and company ownership, you&apos;ll have more open data to work with in the east-European state of Georgia than Georgia, USA. Want to check how the government is spending taxpayers money? You&apos;ll have more luck in Brazil than Belgium. Equally, while on paper some governments are performing well, quantity doesn&apos;t always mean quality. In Dubai, where the government makes noises about being among the most progressive on data sharing, much of what is actually opened up to the public is peripheral to say the least. How many political risk analysts or human rights campaigners are going to be heartened by the publication of data on the number of fishing boats in the country; or the number of greenhouses currently harnessing the Dubai desert sun? There&apos;s lots to do but the future is bright So the global map of government openness is patchy. While progress is being made, things are starting from a very low base. Many countries simply have no web platform, public or private, where data about government and public activity is consolidated. Some governments don&apos;t even have a functioning website at all. In sub-Saharan Africa, only 14% of countries have a searchable online company register. For a continent with growth rates consistently hitting between 5-8% annually, a lack of accessible data is undoubtedly holding back potential investors. Compare this to South America, from Colombia downwards, where over half the countries have accessible company registries. We can end on a positive note. While parts of sub-Saharan Africa may still be lagging behind on open data, other countries are forging ahead: Rwanda, Liberia and Tanzania are all stand out cases. In Liberia, the government&apos;s efforts to make the booming mining and oil industry transparent and compliant with the global Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) has helped push more government information into the open and online. On the other side of the world, the South Pacific island states are also making waves. Through a groundbreaking partnership with the New Zealand Aid Programme, AusAid and the Asian Development Bank, states in the region including Papua New Guinea, Samoa and East Timor have created what the World Bank has deemed as the most progressive corporate registries in the word. For a region rich in natural resources and with expanding economies, implementing such reforms will allow investors and transparency investigators alike to undertake much more informed research in the future. More data is not necessarily better data but the trajectory governments are moving in, especially in often more dynamic emerging economies, has to be seen as encouraging. Whether you&apos;re a risk specialist advising investors, an activist taking part in the recent Open Data Day, or simply a citizen keen to know what your government&apos;s up to, things are looking up.

But, he says, they would be missing the point. Behind the comic cultural confusion of Infidel: the Musical, a stage adaptation of his film about a man brought up as a Muslim who finds out he was born a Jew, is a message about how groups at loggerheads can have more in common than they have differences. &quot;I&apos;m not saying it&apos;s easy to get on [with each other], Shia and Sunni Muslims don&apos;t get on ... Jews and Jews don&apos;t get on,&quot; says Baddiel. &quot;I am not making any great claims for world peace coming out of this musical, but I genuinely think when you see people laughing, it&apos;s a levelling response. If you see people from different ethnic groups laughing at the same thing, it does indicate some bit of togetherness.&quot; Infidel, due to open at the Theatre Royal Stratford East, east London, in October, might seem at first glance like the latest in a series of musicals, such as Jerry Springer: the Musical and the Book of Mormon, targeting religion. Songs include lines like &quot;I&apos;m a Muslim \u2013 I&apos;m not a loon, I didn&apos;t even mind those Danish cartoons&quot; and, when the main character, Mahmoud, discovers he&apos;s a Jew, &quot;I know it&apos;s shit but get used to it.&quot; But, sitting with Erran Baron Cohen, who composed the music for the show \u2013 and whose brother Sacha has offended a few people over the years \u2013 Baddiel says the show is perhaps more Fiddler on the Roof than Book of Mormon. &quot;It&apos;s not a blasphemous piece, it&apos;s about people, a body-swap story about a Muslim sort of becoming a Jew,&quot; he says. &quot;I thought it was interesting to write a comedy about people caught up in this cultural crisis ... It&apos;s funny and human and it brings the religions into focus.&quot; Baddiel was warned at the time of the film&apos;s 2010 release that it might attract trouble but a Muslim-only screening was successful and, although denied a certificate by censors in Dubai, it has been heavily pirated in the Middle East. Nevertheless, Baron Cohen and Baddiel are aware that some people may find a reason to be offended by the musical. &quot;The headline [song] titles could be completely misconstrued if someone wants to,&quot; said Baron Cohen. &quot;But if people listen to what&apos;s being said and the words, they&apos;ll realise it&apos;s a very positive message.&quot; To prove their point, they treated the Guardian to a preview of some of the tracks that will feature in the show. Sexy Burka is sung to Mahmoud&apos;s wife by a burka-wearing friend who tells her that wearing sexy clothes is not the way to win back her husband&apos;s wavering attention. Rather than judging the burka, it emphasises the sexuality of the eyes, as she sings: &quot;All the white women they get it wrong, thinking being sexy is wearing a thong.&quot; Baddiel describes himself as &quot;pro-religious atheist&quot; and says that he finds people who deliberately set out to blaspheme stupid, as well as those who threaten to kill blasphemers. He believes that the song in the show most likely to raise hackles is a satirical one in which Jews sing that &quot;anti-Zionism is antisemitism&quot; but is comfortable as a Jew about raising such an issue. &quot;One of the great things about writing songs about these contentious subjects is that you can go into these issues and be funny about them,&quot; says Baron Cohen. The contentious subjects and the fact that the Theatre Royal Stratford East is a charity have led them to crowdfund for the show. They are seeking \u00a355,000 through Kickstarter, with rewards on offer for those who donate, including lunch with Baddiel. He says that the theatre, located in a heavily Muslim area, was very keen on the show and he is happy that it is being put on in a multicultural area. It might provide the basis for much of the humour but both Baron Cohen and Baddiel are saddened by the fact that there is friction between some Jews and Muslims in a way there was not when they were growing up in London. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of cultural similarities, it&apos;s probably just a bit of ignorance,&quot; says Baron Cohen, as he and Baddiel cite similarities in Hebrew and Arabic words, beliefs and methods of ritual slaughter. In Infidel, Mahmoud finds another source of common ground with his Jewish neighbour in the song Less is More, an ode to the &quot;turtleneck&quot; \u2013 or circumcised penis. &quot;Like the good body-swap movies, you discover at the end there are many more similarities than differences,&quot; says Baddiel. \u2022 See www.infidelthemusical.com for details on how to help fund the show", "title": "Don't put a fatwa on it: Baddiel hopes Infidel - the Musical can ease friction", "sentences": ["&quot;I thought it was interesting to write a comedy about people caught up in this cultural crisis ...

Ketan Somaia, whose interests once included hotels, banking, motoring and media, is being prosecuted for fraudulently taking $23m (\u00a314m) in a series of deals dating back to 1999. At a trial scheduled to begin this month, he faces 11 counts of obtaining money by deception, but the Guardian has learned he is playing a leading role in the acquisition of four broadcasting licences formerly owned by the Sunrise radio group. Somaia&apos;s involvement has been flagged to Ofcom, which has a duty to approve every change of ownership, though the media regulator is likely to delay any decision until the case has been heard. The stations were acquired by Lyca Mobile, a UK firm which specialises in cut price international phone calls. The company says it has hired Somaia as a consultant on the venture. Ofcom must now judge whether the company is a fit and proper holder of a broadcast licence. If he is convicted, Somaia&apos;s association with Lyca could prove embarrassing for London mayor Boris Johnson, whose re-election battle was lavishly funded by the company. The Lyca group donated more than \u00a3425,000 to the Conservative party in the year to October 2012, becoming one of its largest sponsors during the period. The support is understood to have gone largely to Johnson&apos;s campaign, which took cash and help in kind from Lyca, using its offices for telephone canvassing. The Sunrise Radio Group, founded by the entrepreneur Avtar Lit, launched the UK&apos;s first 24-hour Asian radio station in 1989 and eventually reached millions of listeners each week through a variety of digital, analogue and satellite channels broadcasting from Scotland to Slough. But it had been struggling financially in recent years and was put into administration in January after a \u00a3400,000 tax dispute with HMRC. Four of the group&apos;s broadcasting licences covering London, Romford and Slough, and its studios in Romford, were bought in February by the Lyca group, in a deal arranged by administrators Grant Thornton. While Somaia is not listed as a shareholder in Lyca Media II, the vehicle created to acquire the Sunrise assets, staff at the stations have described him as the public face of the new owners. They say Somaia and Lycatel international development director, Anil Shetty, were introduced by two representatives from Grant Thornton as representing the new owners to surprised staff at the main Sunrise offices in Southall, west London, on the morning of 4 February. In a dramatic day during which the stations changed hands, presenters were pulled off air and automated music broadcasts switched on, observers say they were left with the impression Somaia was in charge. Allegedly, he and Shetty informed all employees that they had been made redundant, and then approached presenters and broadcasters to sign them up with new contracts. One employee, who asked to remain anonymous, said: &quot;We were called up to the fourth floor by Mark who said there will be an announcement today. He said the new owners would be joining us for a meeting and we were introduced to Ketan Somaia and Anil Shetty. Ketan came across as the senior person.&quot; Somaia did not respond to requests for comment. Speaking on behalf of Lyca, Shetty confirmed he had attended the Sunrise offices with Somaia on the day of the takeover, but said Somaia had no financial involvement with the venture. &quot;Mr Somaia acts solely as a consultant to Lyca Media II, in relation to the recent acquisition by Lyca Media II of assets of the former radio business Sunrise, as purchased from administrators Grant Thornton.&quot; Of Indian origin but born in Kenya, Somaia made his fortune in Africa during the 1980s and 1990s from importing cars, owning hotels and securing government contracts. At its height his Dolphin business empire was chaired for eight years by Parkinson, a former Tory party chairman. Dolphin twice sponsored the Miss World beauty pageant, with Somaia presiding as a judge, and its assets included a chain of hotels, among them the Treetops Lodge in Kenya, where the young Queen Elizabeth spent her honeymoon. But by the early 2000s, Somaia had lost control of many of his commercial interests. His Delphis bank, acquired from the remnants of the corruption-wrecked Bank of Credit and Commerce International, was wound down in Mauritius, Kenya and Tanzania. The Old Bailey prosecution is being brought by Murli Mirchandani, an Indian born businessman who made his first fortune trading between Germany and west Africa, and who is now based in Dubai. Between June 1999 and May 2000, Mirchandani says he was persuaded by Somaia to hand over millions of dollars in a series of ten business transactions and loans. The indictment lists several alleged money transfers from Mirchandani to Somaia including $7.5m for a 10% stake in Delphis Bank of Mauritius, $2.5m for a share in another company called Driscoll, $2.8m for half the shares in Diamond Mining Corporation of Liberia, $3m to help purchase a bank in Tanzania, and $1.85m for a share in the Block Hotels group. Shetty said Lyca was unaware of the charges against Somaia. Mirchandani, who during the last 15 years brought previous cases against Somaia in the civil courts, has hired one of the country&apos;s leading business crime lawyers, Michael O&apos;Kane, of the firm Peters &amp; Peters, to take the case. Ofcom declined to comment on the progress of its scrutiny of the Sunrise takeover. A spokeswoman said: &quot;Ofcom is currently assessing a licence transfer application relating to four radio licences, part of the Sunrise Radio group. The proposed licence transfers are subject to Ofcom&apos;s consent. Our decision on the application will be published on our website as soon as it has been reached.&quot; Founded in the UK by Sri Lankan entrepreneurs Subaskaraan Allarajah and Milind Kangle, Lyca rents airspace from mobile networks and resells it for international calls. The brand was launched in 2005 and now has an estimated \u20ac1bn turnover, operating what it claims is the world&apos;s largest virtual mobile network.", "title": "Sunrise radio takeover being led by Tory donor facing \u00a314m fraud trial", "sentences": ["The Old Bailey prosecution is being brought by Murli Mirchandani, an Indian born businessman who made his first fortune trading between Germany and west Africa, and who is now based in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-23T19:58:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/24/thailand-redshirt-movement-isan-activists", "tags": ["Thailand", "Thaksin Shinawatra", "Asia Pacific", "World news"], "article": "Chaineuk Phokachang, 74, says: &quot;In Bangkok they think people from north-east Thailand are fools. But though we&apos;re poor and not as well off as the people in the capital and the central plains, we nevertheless represent a force. After all, the army no longer dares attempt a putsch because they know that we \u2013 the redshirts, who defend the government \u2013 are not afraid of tanks ...&quot; We had this conversation in the middle of February, in the yard outside a house in Na Ke, a village in the Isan region, which comprises about 20 provinces and has a separate identity from Bangkok and the rest of the country. Phokachang, and the villagers around him that evening, belong to the redshirt movement. They support former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, ousted by the military in 2006. These rural activists also back the present premier, Yingluck Shinawatra, Thaksin&apos;s sister. Elected in 2011, she has faced constant unrest since December. Her opponents aim to force her to resign, accusing her of running a corrupt regime and being manipulated by her brother, who has been in exile in Dubai since 2008 to avoid a two-year prison sentence. &quot;Thaksin is a genius,&quot; Phokachang adds. &quot;It&apos;s the first time a prime minister has ever honoured his promises to the poor.&quot; The response from the Isan farmers and their almost unquestioning support for both brother and sister are emblematic of the rift dividing the country. Thailand (population: 70 million) is split between the north and north-east on the one hand, and the south and the capital on the other; between upper and lower classes, between city and countryside. To find an explanation for the current political deadlock, we must look far from Bangkok and close to neighbouring Laos, where the benefits of the 1980s economic miracle have not reached. In Isan, with its acid earth and poor yields, modernity is often little more than a facade. Drive to remote villages and Thailand suddenly looks distinctly underdeveloped. Supot Kengam, 55, another Na Ke resident, is also effusive about Thaksin. &quot;He gave us access to medical treatment for no more than 30 bahts [less than $1] covering medical expenses or hospitalisation,&quot; she says. &quot;Before that poor people had to wait and borrow to go into hospital. Thaksin also allocated more than a million bahts [$31,000] in subsidies to each village to help development. We&apos;d never seen anything like it.&quot; The farmers do not care that Thaksin was a free-market capitalist, at the head of a government marked by corruption and nepotism. What they remember of his time in power (2001-06) are the policies which improved their standard of living. It is as if the former policeman, who made a fortune in telecommunications, gave a form of dignity to these deprived country people who had never previously dared to stand up to the traditional elites \u2013 the palace, the military and the big, well-connected corporations. Over two-thirds of government spending is allocated to Bangkok and its hinterland, whereas the north-east, home to a third of the population, receives only 6%. According to the World Bank, the income of households in Isan soared by 46% under Thaksin. A significant uplift, given that a survey by Thai researchers published in 2010 country&apos;s found a tenfold difference in wages between the top 5% and the bottom 5% in the country as a whole.     Thai redshirt supporters at a rally in Bangkok in November 2013. Photograph: Christophe Archambault/AFP    The demonstrators in Bangkok are hardline monarchists, often activists from the richest southern provinces. Backed by the middle and upper classes, they tend to look down on the farmers from the north-east, who are dismissed as &quot;water buffalo&quot;. This attitude is rooted in Isan&apos;s past. From the 13th century, much of this region was part of the kingdom of Laos. In the early 19th century, the rival kingdom of Siam \u2013 as Thailand was then known \u2013 sacked Vientiane and deported members of the Lao ethnic group to what is now north-east Thailand. They are regarded as yokels, despite being Buddhists and speaking a dialect similar to Thai. To make matters worse, the Thai authorities have tried to impose the idea of &quot;Thainess&quot;, on the grounds of national unity. Its effects may be counterproductive. &quot;Many people from this area have developed a complex sense of identity, having been rejected on ethnic grounds and sidelined socially,&quot; says American historian David Streckfuss, who lives in Isan. &quot;They now feel like second-class citizens, unable to express their culture. Meanwhile, across the border formed by the Mekong, their Lao cousins are free to behave as they wish. The redshirt movement has enabled the people of Isan to lay claim to their roots.&quot; It would a step too far to suggest that the crisis has sewn the seeds of secession, but it has widened the gap between Isan and the capital. In 2010, the redshirts occupied Bangkok to demand the return of Thaksin. The army crushed their movement, and more than 90 people died. There seems no sign of a solution. So far 22 people have been killed and 700 injured in the latest bout of unrest. Although, demonstrators have moved away from Bangkok&apos;s main crossroads and a precarious calm has been restored, everyone fears civil war as nothing has been resolved. With anti-government sentiment still running high, the redshirts in the north-eastern provinces remain on alert.

The references to the Caribbean in 2010 come thick and fast in the interlude between their group matches \u2013 they play Sri Lanka on Thursday. If it was George Santayana, the Spanish philosopher, who coined that phrase over a century ago, he was certainly not referring to the outcome of an international cricket tournament. For England, 2010, when they won the World Twenty20 in Barbados, is in danger of becoming a comfort blanket to cling to in times of trouble. It was inevitable with the arrival of Craig Kieswetter in Chittagong that England&apos;s victory should be revisited. As a novice, Kieswetter was tossed into the team almost on a whim and he ended up winning the man of the match award in the final against Australia in Bridgetown. For Kieswetter that baptism is all a bit of a blur. He scored runs against England for the Lions in Dubai and was whisked into the T20 squad at the last moment. His sudden elevation was not part of a carefully conceived, cunning plan. Kieswetter remembers that &quot;2010 was pretty surreal&quot;. He added: &quot;It was quite a similar start to what we&apos;ve had here. It got to the stage where we thought: &apos;Let&apos;s just go for it and see what happens.&apos; We got the momentum and built on it and won the World Cup.&quot; Which is, and probably should be, the latest plan this time, but that does not mean it will work. Kieswetter, 26 with 71 appearances for England, has matured a lot. He acknowledges that he struggled to cope with the highs and lows of being catapulted into the setup as a novice. Listen to him now and he is impressively analytical about his career and his future. The last 12 months since he was dropped by England has been &quot;an interesting experience&quot;, and he explained how he has focused more on his mental approach than his technique. He acknowledged that the recent situation at Somerset, with Jos Buttler also craving &quot;glove time&quot;, was not easy. &quot;It was pretty tricky: two good friends but when you get into the business or the professional side of life it makes friendship a bit tricky. It hasn&apos;t pushed us away; we still remain quite close and we&apos;re both pretty happy with the way it has turned out.&quot; Now all he wants to do is challenge for a place in the England team whatever the format, whatever his role. The simple fact that he has been summoned to Bangladesh will be a fillip; he is still on the selectors&apos; radar. The chances of history repeating itself, with Kieswetter being pitchforked into England&apos;s starting lineup, are slight, and on the wider scale his arrival has not created many waves since there have been so many enthralling matches with so many stunning passages of play. It seems the game has moved on since England&apos;s bowlers introduced the notion of slow bouncers in the Caribbean. What remains the same is the need to be flexible in the field. T20 is supposed to be a batsman&apos;s game \u2013 and we are seeing our quota of sixes \u2013 but some of the bowling has been brilliant. The modern mantra is that it is impossible to bowl &quot;length&quot; deliveries, especially at the end of the innings. South Africa&apos;s Dale Steyn had his own ideas and imposed his pace and his personality on New Zealand by bowling a length, usually very fast. Hence Monday&apos;s stunning victory in Group One by two runs. Then there was Bhuvneshwar Kumar, the India opening bowler, tormenting the West Indies&apos; Dwayne Smith in Dhaka. Kumar sensed swing and he had the nous to pitch the ball up and it swung, whereupon Smith groped and flailed like a novice; he could not touch the ball. At one point he faced 18 deliveries for two runs, a passage of play far more notable than the routine clubbing of sixes. Kumar bowled three overs in the powerplay for three runs and West Indies could never recover. Also in Dhaka, the Pakistan spinners eventually had Aaron Finch, the mighty Australia opener, doing his impressions of George Foreman in Kinshasa. For all Finch&apos;s massive biceps he was emasculated, close to exhaustion and swinging wildly at fresh air in the closing overs of another remarkable contest. Not that the bowlers have had it all their own way. The most gobsmacking innings in a losing cause came in the same game as Australia&apos;s Glenn Maxwell, looking and batting like a young Kevin Pietersen, cracked 74 from 33 balls. These are some of the players shaping a tournament that has so far enchanted and occasionally exasperated, especially in the evening games in Chittagong, where lightning and lights have been the issue. Kieswetter may be thrilled to be able witness it all at first hand but it would be more a fairytale rather than a recurrence of history if he were to become actively involved.", "title": "Craig Kieswetter revives England memories of World Twenty20 win | Vic Marks", "sentences": ["He scored runs against England for the Lions in Dubai and was whisked into the T20 squad at the last moment."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-25T17:25:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/mar/25/england-women-india-world-twenty20-danielle-hazell", "tags": ["England women's cricket team", "World Twenty20 2014", "World Twenty20", "Twenty20", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "Wednesday&apos;s game against India is a crucial match in England&apos;s World Twenty20 campaign out here in Bangladesh. We let ourselves down against West Indies in our first group game on Monday and lost by nine runs \u2013 now we need a win under our belts to kickstart the tournament. It was a very disappointing result for us. There were areas where we let ourselves down and did not play as we can. We knew that West Indies were a strong side and we had prepared well\u00a0for the match, but a couple of areas in our game came up short. We did not field well, we were guilty of a few dropped catches and lost wickets at key times. That got us behind the eight\u00a0ball and, even though we got a bit of a partnership going at the end, it was not quite enough to get us over the line. I was out in the middle at the end and it actually got quite close. When I went in we were chasing a fair few runs and it was just a matter of trying to stay in the game. We thought the closer it got to the end of the game the more of a chance we had. I finished on 11 not out but there were times when we could have clawed that nine runs back. It was unfortunate but we cannot dwell on it. It was exciting, you want to be involved in these situations and do the best you can for the team, but hopefully if I&apos;m there again at the end we can get over the line. We have got the rest of the competition to look forward to now and going into Wednesday&apos;s game against India it is very important to get a win under our belts. We are looking forward to the challenge. The wicket was pretty flat and it seems to slow down as the game goes on. The conditions are pretty conducive to spin and hopefully I can get a wicket on the board \u2013 being economical is more important, though. People here love their cricket and have really embraced the tournament. There have been a lot of people watching the games and driving to training there is lots of excitement over here, loads of posters and promotions. We have had to suss out what things are good to eat but there have not been any problems in that department so far. We flew out to Dubai from Heathrow on 12 March and from there went on to Dhaka. The first week in Bangladesh was great, training went well and things were looking good in our two warm-up games. We got two wins and they put us in a good position coming into the tournament. Now we are in Sylhet and the conditions are obviously a lot different to back home so it is all about getting used to the environment and the heat. Everybody was looking forward to it, Bangladesh is somewhere we have never played before so it is about getting used to the culture over here and seeing what the country is like. But we have got a massive game on Wednesday against India and we need to put some of those wrongs against West Indies right. We had a meeting on Tuesdayand reflected on areas we did well and other areas where we can improve. That is all we can do, this is tournament cricket and we have to get up and try to win the next game. All the matches are coming thick and fast so we have to pick ourselves up and get back in the game. We have made life a little bit harder by losing the first one but we have still got a very good chance in this tournament. We need to get some points on the board and have got to go out and try to win every game now \u2013 that is how we have looked at it from the start. The girls are all fully prepared and we are just looking forward to the game now, looking to make more runs and take more wickets. We have played India a few times and they have got a number of key players. Their captain, Mithali Raj, is a very important player and there are some fantastic spinners. We are going to have to be at our best to win. You do look at the opposition, you target areas that you can bowl at them and look at the strengths of their attack. But we have to focus on us and if we can control them. There is a bit of pressure now, but there is always pressure when you play international cricket.

His father remained to fight against Saddam Hussein. A thick south London accent gives away his upbringing in Clapham Junction. But last year, as his fellow students at Cass Business School applied for internships at Morgan Stanley or Goldman Sachs, Jamil booked a flight to Irbil, capital of Iraqi Kurdistan.     Rebuwar Baktyiar Jamil has returned from the UK to his homeland. Photograph: Orlando Crowcroft for the Guardian    Like so many in the Kurdish diaspora, he wanted to be a part of the closest thing Kurds have had to their own state in modern history. &quot;As Kurds, we all have things to be proud of about our fathers and grandfathers who \u2013 as peshmerga [Kurdish militia] \u2013 gave everything for this country. I felt like it was my turn to do something. If I had stayed in London and had that kind of life, I felt it would be an insult to them,&quot; said Jamil, outside a cafe in Ankawa, Irbil. Irbil&apos;s economic success since 2003 is well documented. Laudatory profiles of the city have pointed to the thousands of foreign and Kurdish-owned companies, a construction boom buoyed by the Kurdish Region of Iraq&apos;s (KRI) vast oil and natural gas reserves and, compared with the violence-ravaged south, relative stability. But the true picture is more complex. Irbil may be on a path towards becoming a slick, modern business hub but there is a long way to go. Its residents are hit with daily power cuts and struggle with a shambolic infrastructure. As of February 2014, most state employees had not been paid for more than two months and a serious cash shortage caused ATMs to run dry of Iraqi dinars. Meanwhile, Iraqi Kurdistan is hosting more than 300,000 refugees from Syria and southern Iraq, many of them in camps just outside the capital. And not everyone in Irbil is benefiting from the city&apos;s status as &quot;the next Dubai&quot;. In the expensive bars and restaurants of the Christian district of Ankawa, the smoky tearooms of the bazaar or humble homes on the outskirts of the sprawling city, conversation inevitably turns to corruption. Powerful clans dominate politics and business. Former peshmerga soldiers gather every day in the central square opposite the city&apos;s bazaar. Hussein, 62, sitting in the midday sunshine outside a teahouse in the shadow of Erbil&apos;s historic citadel,laughed when asked about the popular comparison between Irbil and Dubai. &quot;The ones in government, they are rich,&quot; he said, &quot;but everyone else is poor. They&apos;re too greedy.&quot; Originally from the eastern city of Sulaimaniya, Hussein spent seven years with the peshmerga fighting Saddam and is unhappy that, in his 60s, he still has to look for work. &quot;The peshmerga are not getting what they are due. They are being overlooked \u2013 even after we fought so hard,&quot; he said.     Nur Adin has lived in Erbil for 52 years. Photograph: Orlando Crowcroft for the Guardian    Nur Adin, another retired fighter, was pleased about the construction work going on in Irbil. When he was a child, the recently redeveloped central square was a donkey market. But he believes that his 52 years in the city should entitle him to greater benefits from the government. &quot;We have to be grateful to God that we are a rich country and that we can develop, [but] I was born in 1942 and I have no land from the government, while some others are given everything,&quot; he said. Falah Mustafa, the head of the Kurdistan regional government&apos;s (KRG) department of foreign relations, stiffened when asked about the preferential treatment accorded to Kurds with political or family connections. &quot;We are fighting against perception,&quot; he said, as a power cut plunged the room into darkness. &quot;I do not exclude that there have been mistakes. Problems are there; abuses are there. But it is limited and it is wrong to say that the whole [Kurdish] region is like that. We are making progress and improving day to day.&quot; And yet the divisions in Irbil are as much cultural as they are economic. Thousands of Kurds returned to the city with political and religious views forged in the west. But the war in Syria and daily bloodshed in the south have meant that extreme Islamism has also taken root in the Kurdish region. The authorities were quick to point out that the September 2013 bombings in Irbil targeting the headquarters of the Asayish \u2013the KRG security services \u2013 were the work of foreign Islamists rather than Kurds, but there have been cases of Iraqi Kurds heading to fight alongside extremist groups in Syria. Many in Irbil are concerned about what will happen when those radicalised young men come home. In the citadel that towers over the city&apos;s bazaar and city centre \u2013 said to be one of the oldest continually inhabited sites in the world \u2013, the 47-year-old imam of the Mullah Afandi mosque marched across the room holding the Qu&apos;ran. Imam Mohammed pointed at a passage forbidding the use of force in the conversion of non-believers to Islam. &quot;All the imams here in the cities of Iraqi Kurdistan \u2013 in Erbil, Sulaimaniya and Dohuk \u2013 tell their people that it is not jihad to go and fight in Syria,&quot; said Mohammed, whose family have been mullahs at the mosque for more than six generations. He is concerned about young men being radicalised outside the cities in Iraqi Kurdistan, particularly in areas that are not as developed, such as the western city of Halabja and the disputed border city of Kirkuk. &quot;In areas that have social and economic problems, in places that have security problems \u2026 Yes, I am worried about those areas,&quot; he said. He also said there were concerns that extremists were crossing the border from the south into Iraqi Kurdistan. Mustafa said the KRG was monitoring the problem, but stressed that only a small number of Kurds had been fighting alongside extremist groups in Syria. In more general terms, he cited the co-existence of Christians, Sunnis, Shias and secular Kurds in Irbil as an example of tolerance in Iraqi Kurdistan. &quot;These are certain individual cases: it is not a phenomenon,&quot; he said. &quot;We have an open and secular [society]. There are people who go to mosque and there are people who do not. There are people who drink alcohol and people who do not. [Kurdish] society at large rejects terrorism and has not allowed it to be established in the region.&quot; For returnees such as Jamil \u2013 who recently took on a job at the Irbil stock exchange, due to launch by the end of this year \u2013 it is that mix that presents one of the best opportunities for Kurds in their bloody history to build something lasting in Iraqi Kurdistan. &quot;As a people we have always been divided. We&apos;ve never been one. We can accommodate many different views and still work together \u2013 [because] nobody else cares about us.

It didn\u2019t happen, of course and that moment has become the Gallipoli of Australian football. Wasted effort. A generation unfulfilled. A glorious defeat. But it was the first-leg of that two-match qualifier that really set Australia up in the first place. The Socceroos had come away from an inhospitable environment in Teheran with an unexpected 1-1 draw that favoured them nicely at home under the away goals rule. Who scored that goal?

But he hasn\u2019t always shown the same love for Socceroos fans. Between 1998 and 2005 he played 13 games for the national team. The Socceroos had 67 matches in this time. His unavailability for internationals began in 1999 in what was nothing more than an exhibition match against a Brazilian \u2018B\u2019 side. On the evening he was due to fly out of Manchester for the trip home, his club Leeds sent a fax (nothing official was done by email back then) saying: \u201cHarry Kewell has succumbed to an injury and is unavailable to play for Australia\u201d. A pattern was set: time-after-time he was selected; time-after-time, he had an injury. In those days, the Socceroos were not a well-resourced machine with their own physiotherapy and fitness staff on-hand in London as was the case in 2006. The Socceroos coach at the time, Frank Farina, met with his counterpart at Leeds, David O\u2019Leary, and Australia\u2019s medical staff asked if they could assist with rehabilitation. Approaches were given short shrift. Kewell left most of the talking to O\u2019Leary, or his personal manager, Bernie Mandic, who was with him until two years ago. And, as much as we admired Kewell for his sheer talent and the entertainment and excitement he brought to the field, this was also the beginning of the love-hate relationship that has endured with many \u2018pre-2005\u2019 Australia fans to this day.  Not that Harry was alone. In a sign of the times and the status of Australia in world football, some other big name Socceroos players did the same. They were constantly torn between their high-paying clubs on the one hand, and national team duty that was either a friendly match or, if competitive, against a team from Oceania. Joining the Asian Football Confederation has changed those dynamics for the better.      Harry Kewell's time at Liverpool was troubled by injury and he was often at the sharp end of criticism from fans. Photograph: Jason Cairnduff/Action Images    In 2003, Harry joined one of the most famous football clubs on the planet, Liverpool \u2013 the second Australian to do so after Craig Johnston. After a solid first season, he endured a second from hell culminating in being booed off the ground by Liverpool fans in the Champions League final in 2005.  Kewell, as it happens, really was injured: he had a torn adductor and a then undiagnosed condition known as \u2018Gilmore\u2019s Groin\u2019. It was the start of an injury-plagued remainder of his career.  Only a few weeks after Kewell had limped off for Liverpool in the 2006 FA Cup final, we fell in love with him again \u2013 and certainly a new generation of Australian football fans did for the first time.  It was the 2006 World Cup. He was nursed through injury \u2013 and eventually could not continue after the group stages because of a bacterial infection \u2013 but he was immense in that tournament, culminating in a man of the match performance for a 2-2 draw against Croatia that put Australia into the second stage.             When the ball came near Kewell, you felt the hope, excitement and anticipation within the stadium, and crackling through the TV screen. Something was going to happen. Kewell had changed in other ways in his absent years. The reserved and wary teenager had matured into being a more outgoing, friendly and relaxed person. It was a combination of marriage, parenthood, an ambition realised and becoming his own man. He went on to play another 37 games for Australia including the 2007 and 2011 Asian Cups as well as the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. Some of those performances have shown us the \u2018Harry Kool\u2019 we first loved \u2013 none more so than when he captained the side in Dubai against Iraq in a World Cup qualifier in June 2008. Australia lost that game 1-0 in difficult conditions, but Kewell was immense.  An English colleague recently remarked that, for him and his friends, it was Harry Kewell who made them take notice of Australian football. They realised that \u201cAustralians could play\u201d.  Others thought so too. When Australia was planning its 2018/2022 World Cup bid, international research showed that Harry \u2013 who was then playing for Galatasary in Turkey \u2013 was the best-known and most recognisable Australian player at the time. By a long shot. It is why he became the centrepiece of this initial promotional film that launched the bid.  I worked with him on the bid and I can confirm he did not demand payment. There was no fuss, no hangers-on. He was patient and enthusiastic. This was something he did for Australia. Imagine what could have been had Kewell not been burdened by injury. Well played \u2018Harry Kool\u2019. Thanks for the memories.

She has a couple of hours in the middle of changing flights and is using part of them to make sure squash gets into the Guardian this week. On Sunday, she won the women&apos;s world squash championship in Penang and became the first Englishwoman to hold both world and British Open titles. Squash players \u2013 even those of Massaro&apos;s calibre \u2013 seldom get midflight requests for interviews but in a week where her win made it on to the bulletins on Radio 1, she is talking to everyone she can. The interest came as a surprise. In May last year she won the British Open, beating Nicol David, the most successful female squash player of all time, in the final. Few phones rang. More interest was shown in the venue \u2013 an outdoor court on the Hull FC pitch \u2013 than Massaro&apos;s success. &quot;I think the British Open is one of those events that rivals the world open in terms of prestige and history,&quot; she says, &quot;yet the coverage I got when I won the British Open wasn&apos;t as much as I thought it would be. And this has eclipsed everything.&quot; She thinks squash should be bigger in Britain. After all, we are spoilt for world champions: Yorkshire&apos;s Nick Matthew took the men&apos;s title in November last year. He and Massaro share a coach \u2013 David Pearson \u2013 and Massaro sees Matthew&apos;s progress (he returned to the No1 spot in December) as motivation. After her title win on Sunday, something touching happened: &quot;He texted me after I&apos;d won and said he was going to use me as inspiration to try and win Canary Wharf [Squash Classic, which began on Monday]. That was huge. To be able to inspire him for a change. That&apos;s something I&apos;m really proud of.&quot; The mutual cheerleading did not stop there: after his first-round match at Canary Wharf, Matthew spent much of his interview praising Britain&apos;s new world champion. Support like this is important to Massaro. Squash is a notoriously lonely game: the pace of play and the proximity of your opponent in a shared playing space widen psychological cracks. The last rounds of the world championships were a case in point. Massaro had expected to meet David, the Malaysian world No1, were she to make it to the final. David was going for her eighth world open title in Penang, her hometown, but she went down in the semi-finals in five sets to the 18-year-old Nour El Sherbini. Massaro is clear about what happened: &quot;[The world open] was huge for David: she&apos;s from Penang \u2013 the Penang state pretty much put the world open on for her to be able to win her eighth world open in her hometown. Four, five thousand people turned out for the opening ceremony. That stuff gets to you. &quot;She looked pretty good for the first couple of rounds. There was always going to be a point when that pressure got very high. It was just a question of whether she was going to be able to come through those moments.&quot; If the pressure of expectation undid the world No1, Massaro nearly went the same way. With David out of the tournament, she went into the final as favourite. &quot;I knew I&apos;d never lost to Nour [El Sherbini] before, so an opportunity was there to go on and take the title,&quot; she says. &quot;During the day I was a mess. Before the match, I actually thought I was going to be sick, which I&apos;ve never had in my whole career. It was by far the most nerve-racking match and entire day of my whole life.&quot; Massaro took the match in five, but lost the second and fourth games. Her mental state seesawed in tandem with her point scores. &quot;At times I was super focused, like I had been all week, and at other times I was off with the fairies somewhere worrying about what it would mean if I won. Then you&apos;d get these thoughts slipping in your mind of &apos;I&apos;d be world champion for ever and no one can take it away. And every time I&apos;d get introduced on court [they&apos;d say] ...&quot; David held the world No1 ranking for 92 consecutive months. She and Massaro were born within three months of each other but Massaro, mentally tough, never became disillusioned: &quot;You try and chip away at [David&apos;s dominance] under the radar a bit.&quot; And then she says, laughing: &quot;I suppose winning the world open is not really under the radar.&quot;", "title": "Laura Massaro: 'Winning squash world championship eclipsed everything'", "sentences": ["Laura Massaro is in Dubai, talking on a Skype call from the airport."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-26T10:58:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/mar/26/live-racing-march-26-2014", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Aidan O'Brien", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "11.30am Al Shaqab swoop for interest in Ruler Of The World  Tony Paley: Al Shaqab Racing has purchased a &quot;significant interest&quot; in the Coolmore-owned Ruler Of The World, last season&apos;s Epsom Derby winner and favourite for Saturday&apos;s Dubai World Cup. The colt will remain in training with Aidan O&apos;Brien and will continue to be ridden by the Ballydoyle handler&apos;s son, Joseph.

But he&apos;ll remain with Aidan O&apos;Brien and will be ridden by Joseph O&apos;Brien, Coolmore were keen for that to be the case. &quot;When he retires, Al Shaqab will also receive 50% of his stud value. He is a horse that Sheikh Joaan has always liked and pinpointed him as a horse he&apos;d like to be involved with, especially with this weekend in mind. It&apos;s great to be involved in races like this. &quot;He looks fantastic and has been vetted this morning, he travelled over especially well. Whatever happens on Saturday, it is a long season and he&apos;ll be a great addition. He&apos;s beautifully bred and it is not easy to get involved with a Derby winner. &quot;Sheikh Joaan spoke to John Magnier about acquiring a stake and it went from there. Hopefully it is the start of a great partnership as Al Shaqab also have a share in a Galileo two-year-old with Coolmore. If, for whatever reason, at some point in the season Joseph is unavailable to ride then Frankie [Dettori] will step in.&quot; Today&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook At some point later this week, I will have to take a deep breath and acknowledge the return of quality Flat racing. I don&apos;t object to it at all, you understand, but it does also mean the imminent end of quality jump racing for the next six months, which I experience as a significant loss. Anyway, we&apos;re not there yet and today&apos;s card at Exeter is absorbing and highly competitive. We should probably be suspicious of a racehorse called Sure Thing (3.10), but I think this might be the time when he makes good on the name. Of course, I thought that when he last ran on Saturday and for a long way it seemed that he would, but he got tired in the home straight at Stratford and got outstayed by a Dan Skelton favourite. That was a fine chasing debut and a great first run for nine months. From the same mark and over a slightly shorter trip, I think Sure Thing can put this field to the sword. You can get 11-2. Please, nobody use the word &apos;bounce&apos; on here today. The Twiston-Davies team is in good form, as so often at this time of year, and Fond Memory (2.40) can go one place better than when a strong-finishing second on his handicap debut at Newbury. It&apos;s possible that he will need more cut than he gets here today but odds of 7-1 seem too big and at least this big field should go a decent pace.

Ruler Of The World will remain in Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s stable for the rest of his career on the course and will be ridden by Joseph O&apos;Brien, the principal jockey at Ballydoyle, rather than Frankie Dettori, who is retained to ride for Al Shaqab. He will also retire to Coolmore to stand as a stallion. However, the deal which adds him into Sheikh Joaan&apos;s burgeoning bloodstock could prove to be a significant agreement between one of the sport&apos;s dominant forces for more than three decades and a man who could well assume similar prominence for many years to come. &quot;The Sheikh is a big fan of the horse,&quot; Harry Herbert, Al Shaqab&apos;s racing manager, said on Wednesday. &quot;He spoke to John Magnier directly and it was done fairly quickly between the two of them. I saw him a couple of days ago in London and he&apos;s very excited to be a partner with Coolmore. The horse will run in Al Shaqab&apos;s colours and Joseph will keep the ride. Should he not be able to ride for any reason, then Frankie obviously is retained rider for Al Shaqab and he will step in.&quot; Sheikh Joaan enjoyed an outstanding 2013 season which concluded with Group One wins for Treve, in the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe, and Olympic Glory in the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes on Champions Day at Ascot, which is sponsored by the Qatar-based investment company QIPCO. Both were big-money purchases from their previous owners, along with Toronado, the winner of the Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood. The Sheikh was also active at the autumn bloodstock sales, where he paid 5m guineas for a daughter of Galileo, a new world record for a yearling filly, and was the underbidder \u2013 behind Magnier \u2013 on a 3.6m guineas colt, a full-brother to the Oaks runner-up Secret Gesture. &quot;He [Ruler Of The World] is a Derby winner with a beautiful pedigree,&quot; Herbert said, &quot;and I think he also felt that the horse would improve from three to four, as that family do. He&apos;s very keen for Al Shaqab to be represented at the highest level if possible, so part of that strategy has to be buying into, or buying outright, proven horses.&quot; Despite his new alliance with Coolmore, however, Herbert expects Sheikh Joaan to invest significantly in his own breeding operation in the years ahead. &quot;I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll want to have his own [major stud],&quot; Herbert said. &quot;It will all be a building blocks scenario until you&apos;ve got enough mares and stallions to fill that stud farm. I&apos;m sure it will happen, because it&apos;s very much part of Al Shaqab&apos;s plans going forward. &quot;I only joined officially in December and one of the things that struck me is that there&apos;s no question, Sheikh Joaan wants Al Shaqab to be a major player for many years to come, and there&apos;s nothing he&apos;s said or implied since December that would make one feel any differently. In fact, probably quite the opposite.&quot; Ruler Of The World was placed in stall 12, a tricky stall towards the outside, at Wednesday&apos;s post-position draw at the track here. &quot;Ideally I&apos;d have liked to be a couple or three in from there,&quot; Herbert said, &quot;but Joseph&apos;s a master of getting horses in the right position. You&apos;re dealt what you&apos;re dealt, and I&apos;m sure it will be fine.&quot; Ruler Of The World will be just inside two British-trained horses, Ed Dunlop&apos;s Red Cadeaux and Mukhadram from the William Haggas stable, who drew 14 and 13 respectively. The Derby winner&apos;s tricky draw saw his odds for Saturday&apos;s race, the richest in the world, drift with several bookmakers, and he can now be backed in places at 4-1. Kieren Fallon will be in stall one on Godolphin&apos;s Prince Bishop, while Hong Kong-based challengers Military Attack and Akeed Mofeed, the only other runners bar Ruler Of The World at single-figure odds, drew stalls eight and four respectively. There was significant rain here on Wednesday until mid-afternoon, with more forecast for Wednesday night. Fine weather should take over from Thursday afternoon, however, and the track is expected to dry rapidly ahead of the most valuable card in world racing on Saturday.", "title": "Al-Thani buys buy half-stake in Dubai World Cup Al-Thani buys Ruler Of The World", "sentences": ["Ruler Of The World, the 2013 Derby winner, will race in new colours in the Dubai World Cup on Saturday after John Magnier&apos;s Coolmore Stud operation agreed to sell a 50% share in the colt to Sheikh Joaan al-Thani of Qatar, whose Al Shaqab bloodstock operation is a powerful new force in world racing."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-26T17:25:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/26/kurdish-iraq-recovery", "tags": ["Kurds", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Iraq"], "article": "Orlando Crowcroft (Diaspora returns to build Iraqi Kurdistan into the &apos;next Dubai&apos;, 26 March) misses two important points.

Sheikh Hamdan&apos;s colours will be aboard Mukhadram, who is trained in Newmarket by William Haggas, in the World Cup but the owner expressed doubts about the five-year-old&apos;s ability to act on the Tapeta in an interview with Gulf News. &quot;We have worked him on the all-weather track in England, particularly at Kempton, and he seemed all right but the Tapeta is very different to all the synthetic tracks,&quot; Sheikh Hamdan said. &quot;Honestly, if you ask me, I&apos;d be happier if the race [were] run on grass as Mukhadram hasn&apos;t run on the Tapeta. Some horses don&apos;t mind and can adapt, others don&apos;t. Not all horses give their best on the surface where the ground conditions change every few metres. New horses to the surface shorten their strides and don&apos;t stretch naturally. &quot;It is also inconsistent. It&apos;s slow in the morning and faster in the evening. I believe they add 20% of cushion each year but that makes it very shallow. It was a good track in the first year but has changed in recent years.&quot; The sheikh&apos;s comments should be seen in the context of an unusually small contingent of American-trained horses at this year&apos;s World Cup meeting, while there has also been a rumour at the track this week that the Tapeta surface could soon be replaced by a US-style dirt surface, similar to that used at Nad Al Sheba, the home of the World Cup until it moved to Meydan in 2010. American-trained horses, including the outstanding dirt performers Cigar and Curlin, won eight of the 14 runnings of the World Cup at Nad Al Sheba but the only US-based winner at Meydan is Animal Kingdom, a horse with previous form on a wide range of surfaces, last season. It could also be significant that a 20% increase in prize money for the two major turf races on the World Cup card was announced this week. The prize fund for the Dubai Duty Free, over nine furlongs, and the Dubai Sheema Classic, over a mile and a half, will rise from $5m to $6m in 2015, which would potentially offer an attractive alternative to the feature event for owners and trainers reluctant to run on dirt in the 10-furlong World Cup. Meydan did not respond to a request for comment on the issue on Thursday. Charlie Appleby, who succeeded the disgraced trainer Mahmood al-Zarooni at Godolphin&apos;s Moulton Paddocks stable in Newmarket, said on Thursday that the steroid doping scandal &quot;has been put to bed from our point of view&quot; as he prepares to saddle two of Godolphin&apos;s three runners in the Dubai World Cup. In the same interview room at Meydan racecourse where his former boss Zarooni discussed his hopes for the coming season 12 months ago, just weeks before his doping programme was uncovered, Appleby said that the scandal had cast &quot;a cloud&quot; over Godolphin but that performances on the track had helped its recovery. &quot;We all know there was a cloud,&quot; Appleby said, &quot;but it&apos;s a good, strong team within Godolphin and everybody got together and got on with the job in hand. &quot;I think the results proved that&apos;s what we were doing. You don&apos;t look behind you, if you look behind you, you&apos;ll be stagnant, so our vision is to go forward and look to the future. That&apos;s what we did, and the team were right behind me in my position, I had huge support from Saeed [bin Suroor, his fellow Godolphin trainer] and His Highness [Sheikh Mohammed, Godolphin&apos;s founder] and we got on with the job.The horses are in rude health. People ask me about pressure, but they took the pressure off me because they delivered the results. &quot;We go back to Europe with it all behind us and we finished the season off in great form, Farhh winning on Champions Day [at Ascot in October] and a personal high was Outstrip [winning] in the Breeders&apos; Cup [Juvenile Turf].

However, just three months and 20 tournaments into the 11-month season, there is a clear sense that 2014 is going to deliver even more shocks than 2013, when the first significant cracks began to show at the top of the game. Federer looks content again at No4, the very least ranking he would settle for in his pomp. He is happy with his new, bigger racket, his new, wise mentor, Stefan Edberg, and unconcerned that he turns 33 in August. While it&apos;s too early to say if he can carry his three-set form and confidence into the slams, he is back in the mix after a worryingly long absence. Recovered from back niggles that cut him down for seven weeks a year ago, Federer is moving with elegant freedom again, and he hit some shots from the archives before Kei Nishikori beat him in three quality sets to reach the semi-finals of the second Masters 1000 tournament of the season. Federer lost to Novak Djokovic, too, in the final in Indian Wells, but he beat him in the semis in Dubai and went on to get the better of Tomas Berdych in the final, breaking a title drought that stretched back to the grass of Halle just before Wimbledon last year. He will take this loss on the chin. Murray, similarly, engaged in some breathtaking exchanges with Djokovic before being bundled out of Miami three matches before he had the chance to defend the title. He will look at the rankings on Monday and be less than thrilled that he has drifted four places south of Federer, yet, like Federer, he knows his tennis is in a good place. And you are allowed to lose \u2013 especially if the other guy is playing out of his skin. Djokovic, unbeaten in 10 matches, has that priceless knack of finding a way. In two US Open semi-final five-setters, he Federer with chutzpah and daring, his hit-and-hope return to save match-point in 2011 reducing the loser to post-match apoplexy. Against Murray on Wednesday night, the determined Serb did it again. This time, though, there was cause for concern, and Djokovic should not be allowed a pass. His moment arrived in a twinkling when he put his racket on the ball on Murray&apos;s side of the net mid-rally at the end of the first set. It ignited a meltdown that cost the Scot the point and did his equilibrium no good at all. The Scot, who otherwise played brilliantly, lost the last eight points of the match. It is inconceivable that Djokovic \u2013 26 years old and the owner of six slam titles \u2013 does not know that it is illegal to hit the ball on the opponent&apos;s side of the net. The umpire, also, should go and sit in the dunce&apos;s corner for getting it wrong and failing to acknowledge his error when everyone else \u2013 back here watching on television and there in the stands \u2013 could see it. &quot;I&apos;m not sure; you tell me \u2026 Maybe he&apos;s right, I&apos;m not sure,&quot; Djokovic told Brad Gilbert courtside immediately afterwards. That&apos;s not good enough. I&apos;ve barely swung a racket anywhere but a council dirt track and I know you can&apos;t do that. Ivan Lendl, who lives three hours away at Vero beach, was a relaxed figure in Murray&apos;s box, just a week after their parting. There is still no word on a successor, and unlikely to be before the French Open. Murray also looked relaxed. He hit the ball early and hard and stretched Djokovic to near his limit. But for the first-set blip-and-splutter, his demeanour was pretty good. All that aside, the constantly shifting balance of power in the game makes for fascinating viewing nearly every week now. Nishikori&apos;s win over Federer followed his defeat of the world No4 David Ferrer in a real dogfight. Impressions that Nishikori, who has succumbed to injury and self-doubt in the past, is an easy touch at the business-end of tournaments might need to be recalibrated. And he got a blessing from on high afterwards. &quot;I think Kei does really well controlling the ball,&quot; Federer said. &quot;He has great technique, especially on the backhand, very simple, very short back swings, so he does a really nice job of having good timing. I predict he&apos;s going to be top-10 in a short while.&quot; Alexander Dolgopolov, also, has made a lot of noise in the past few weeks, slightly louder than Ernests Gulbis and Marin Cilic \u2013 and they are all spreading doubt among their peers and betters. Elsewhere in the upper reaches, Rafael Nadal has been in blinding form in Miami, but went out early in Indian Wells. Berdych took heart from beating Cilic in Rotterdam before losing to Federer in Dubai. Milos Raonic is on the rise again. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga, who lost meekly here to Murray, looks vulnerable. Juan Mart\u00edn Del Potro is out injured, probably for the season, his left wrist requiring an operation. Richard Gasquet has yet to impress. John Isner is stirring. And Stanislas Wawrinka has shown flashes of the form that won him the Australian Open.

Climate change is the biggest environmental threat facing our planet \u2013 it&apos;s real, it&apos;s happening right now, and we need to act fast.&quot; Among the world&apos;s famous landmarks that will dim their lights are the Empire State building in New York, the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Kremlin and Red Square in Moscow, the Bosphorus Bridge in Turkey and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai.

Photograph: Torsten Blackwood/AFP/Getty Images    Launched in Australia in 2007, WWF says Earth Hour has now grown to become the world&apos;s biggest environmental event, mobilising people around a range of issues from deforestation to energy efficiency. Last year saw more than 7,000 towns and cities in 154 countries take part. This year, WWF is launching Earth Hour Blue, a digital crowdfunding and crowdsourcing platform that enables participants to help raise funds and take action on a range of environmental issues. Projects that are open for donation range from teaching fisherman in the Philippines how to build boats without using wood from the local forests to a solar-lighting project to reduce human-wildlife conflict in India. Earth Hour&apos;s CEO and co-founder, Andy Ridley, said: &quot;For us the symbolism or turning your lights off will always be important. But the big thing for us has always been how to push it beyond the hour. The stage we&apos;re at now is to make it really easy for people from their handset, tablet or laptop to be able to do something pretty immediate to make a difference. That&apos;s the holy grail for us \u2013 building a global collective movement, far beyond the event, where the event becomes a kind of inspiration but the movement is really the essence of it.&quot;     In Uganda, half a million trees were planted in an 'Earth Hour forest' and helped to help offset deforestation. Photograph: WWF    WWF says the awareness and funding generated by Earth Hour has led to several significant conservation successes in the past few years. In 2013, Argentina used its Earth Hour campaign to help pass a senate bill to create a new 3.4 million-hectare marine reserve. In Uganda, half a million trees planted in an &quot;Earth Hour forest&quot; helped to help offset deforestation, while in Paraguay, public support led to an extension of an existing logging moratorium. Butfield said that the event is far more than 60 minutes of symbolism, citing a survey in 2013 which showed that 82.7% of those who signed up to take part in the UK felt inspired to take further action. Earth Hour critics have said that asking people to sit in the dark plays to &quot;a widely held prejudice that &apos;the greens&apos; want us all to go back to living in caves&quot;. Bjorn Lomborg, director of the Copenhagen Consensus Centre and who has questioned the cost of tackling climate change, said Earth Hour&apos;s &quot;vain symbolism&quot; does little for the climate and distracts people from real problems and solutions. Some energy experts have also said that Earth Hour could actually result in an increase in carbon emissions when lights are turned back on.     A WWF Earth Hour crowdfunded solar-lighting project to reduce human-wildlife conflict in India.

It was extraordinary that first night looking out over Sydney and seeing a city go dark. And it wasn&apos;t about going back to the dark ages \u2013 it was an excuse to lean over the garden fence and talk to your neighbour or a reason for people to talk to each other at a restaurant, so I never underestimate the power of that symbolism.&quot; Earlier this week, a survey commissioned by WWF-UK found that almost half (47%) of respondents said they would be willing to switch their political allegiance to a different party based on the strength of environmental policies, with 73% saying the leaders of the UK&apos;s main political parties are not currently giving enough emphasis to the environment.", "title": "Earth Hour: millions to switch off lights around the world", "sentences": ["Climate change is the biggest environmental threat facing our planet \u2013 it&apos;s real, it&apos;s happening right now, and we need to act fast.&quot; Among the world&apos;s famous landmarks that will dim their lights are the Empire State building in New York, the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin, the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the Kremlin and Red Square in Moscow, the Bosphorus Bridge in Turkey and the Burj Khalifa in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-28T09:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/28/ryan-moore-hillstar-dubai-world-cup", "tags": ["Dubai World Cup", "Ryan Moore", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "If you rate a jockey&apos;s year by the number of winners he rides, then 2013 was a pretty good one for Ryan Moore. He had 194 victories in total in Britain, the Derby and the Ascot Gold Cup, on the Queen&apos;s Estimate, among them, and about a dozen more overseas to take him past 200. If your measure is prize money, however, it was a year for the ages for the famously shy and private Moore. Richard Hughes was Britain&apos;s champion jockey, a title based on winners, with 203 yielding just over \u00a34m in prizes. Moore won nearly \u00a34.7m in November and December alone, when attention had already turned to the jumps season, with two victories at the Breeders&apos; Cup and three more in Japan, including the Japan Cup by a nose on Gentildonna. In all, Moore won nearly \u00a311m in prize money in 2013, an unprecedented total for a British, or British-based, jockey and one that may not be approached, even by Moore, for many years to come. He established himself as probably the finest and most dependable rider in world racing. And no one really seemed to notice. &quot;I don&apos;t mind,&quot; he said with a smile and a shrug here in Dubai this week. &quot;I&apos;m lucky, I ride for stables which have always had success with travelling horses, and I\u00a0ride the best-bred horses in the world [for Aidan O&apos;Brien] when Joseph [O&apos;Brien, the trainer&apos;s son and principal rider] can&apos;t do the weight or they need someone else. &quot;I think I got noticed in Japan because I&apos;d been riding horses like Conduit, Workforce and Harbinger which were bought to go out there [as stallions]. When they watched them winning, they had a look at the jockey too.&quot; Moore will go to post for all eight of the races on World Cup night in Dubai on Saturday, the richest card in the sport. He will be aboard Dank, last year&apos;s Breeders&apos; Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf winner, in the Dubai Duty Free, and Hillstar in the World Cup itself for his main retainer in Britain, Sir Michael Stoute. He will also be reunited with Gentildonna in the Sheema Classic, where he will face Joseph O&apos;Brien on Magician, who won last year&apos;s Breeders&apos; Cup Turf under a brilliant waiting ride by Moore. Amid a year-long sequence of outstanding performances, the win on Magician at Santa Anita was arguably Moore&apos;s masterpiece. He was almost last turning out of the back on a horse who was stepping up in trip and unraced for four months, but arrived to nail The Fugue in the final strides. &quot;That was a good day,&quot; he says, &quot;but it helps when you are riding machines like that. It looked like it could set up nicely for him and it worked out. I was thinking four [furlongs] out: he wins. &quot;With the better races, it&apos;s easier, you know the horses a lot more. If you&apos;re riding in a 0-60 at Kempton on a Monday it&apos;s a bit more difficult to work out what&apos;s going to go on. In these races, you have an idea about all the horses, but there&apos;s no quarter given either. &quot;Every race is different. Sometimes you think this is going really well, or it&apos;s going too well, this is going badly, and sometimes a horse will get you out of trouble and sometimes it won&apos;t. &quot;You have to keep thinking. If you&apos;re not thinking then it&apos;s not going to happen. You can&apos;t see every horse in the race, if you&apos;re in front you can&apos;t see what&apos;s finishing and if you&apos;re out the back you can&apos;t see how well the one in front is going, but you&apos;ve just got to have a feel for it.&quot; Moore feels comfortable in Dubai. &quot;I&apos;ve been coming here since I was 18,&quot; he says, &quot;and I&apos;ve ridden here a lot. I&apos;ve probably been here more than anywhere except Brighton [where he grew up next door to the racecourse that overlooks the city].&quot; But he knows too that the main track, with its synthetic Tapeta surface, can be a difficult one to get right, not least when, as on Saturday, there are 16 runners competing for the sport&apos;s richest prize. &quot;Since it&apos;s been moved to this track it&apos;s become a messy race,&quot; Moore says. &quot;It seems to fall apart at the four-pole. I think sometimes with the heat, the track can ride a bit deep and horses are having their first run of the year in a different climate. They just go from going well to beaten. &quot;Last year it fell apart at the top of the straight, all the good horses bar Animal Kingdom all just went. Then the likes of Red Cadeaux and Planteur [with Moore in the saddle] picked up the pieces. They shouldn&apos;t be placed in a World Cup, but they were. If they were going to be placed in a World Cup, he [Hillstar] would beat them. &quot;It&apos;s going to be one of those races where everyone fancies their chances and everyone knows where they want to be sat, and they all want to be sat in the same sort of place.&quot; Moore did not sit on a horse for nearly eight weeks between Christmas and mid-February and is fresh and ready for the new European Flat season, though the jockeys&apos; championship, in which Hughes beat him by 17 winners on turf in 2013, is low on his list of priorities. &quot;I can&apos;t be doing double-headers and going to Wolverhampton evening meetings,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s better to do what&apos;s right by the people I work for the whole time, not taking chances going around on bad horses for bad prize money. &quot;We&apos;ve all done it and started there and once you&apos;re there you do everything you can, but I&apos;ve had a few injuries off horses that I probably shouldn&apos;t have been riding. It can happen around a good horse as well, but when it&apos;s a low-grade race around Lingfield or Warwick, you just think it&apos;s not very clever. It&apos;s difficult because you&apos;ve always got to be busy and I still take a lot of rides, but you&apos;ve got to try to find some sort of balance and keep something in the tank.&quot; Ruler Of The World, Moore&apos;s Derby winner last year, is the probable favourite for the $10m Dubai World Cup, but has a wide draw and looks a poor price in a contest which, as Moore points out, could turn into a scrum. His mount Hillstar could be a fair each-way bet at around 14-1, but for win purposes, Military Attack (6.05) has form in Hong Kong to put him right in the mix. Stall eight gives his jockey Joao Moreira options, and 7-1 looks a very fair price in this contest. Denim And Ruby (5.17), the horse beaten a nose by Gentildonna in the Japan Cup, is three points bigger than Moore&apos;s mount in the Dubai Sheema Classic and worth backing to take revenge at odds of 7-1. Dank (4.39) should give Moore a winner in one of the feature events in the Duty Free, while Jamie Osborne&apos;s Toast Of New York (2.25) is an interesting outsider for the UAE Derby.

This time four years ago he was recently bereaved, out of work and unable to land an interview, never mind a job, with a club in League One. Liverpool&apos;s unimagined rise this season provides further evidence that a team really does reflect its manager. Rodgers has always been driven to succeed but it was seven months spent out of work following his dismissal by Reading in 2009 that steered the 41-year-old towards his present lofty perch. Failure, and specifically the response to failure, is what the man from Carnlough identifies as the root of his success, prompting as it did a rethink of methods that had delivered for Chelsea&apos;s reserve and youth teams plus his first managerial job at Watford. The Liverpool manager did not have a track record as a coach or player at the highest level to help him back into the game five years ago. There were supportive calls from the managerial fraternity. Steve McClaren invited him to FC Twente&apos;s closed training camp in the days before clinching the club&apos;s only Eredivisie title but there were many moments of exclusion. Being turned away from the club car park at Nottingham Forest before a youth cup tie involving his son, Anton, then of Chelsea, hammered home to Rodgers that he was outside football for the first time in his professional career. The Liverpool manager has not forgotten the misery and now makes a point of contacting every sacked manager to extend an invitation to Melwood, the club&apos;s training ground. Revisiting that defining period, one that has ultimately made Liverpool dream of a first league title in 24 years, Rodgers reveals: &quot;I got the sack on 16 December. It was 5pm on a Wednesday and my first thought was to ring the family to make sure they heard the news from me first. My objective then, because it was the first time in my life I was out of work and out of football, was to make sure it did not spoil Christmas for my family. After that I went to Dubai to reflect for 10 days and started to write in the sunshine about my experience, how it could have been different, what I could improve, what I should take into my next job? What areas would I be better when I was next a manager? &quot;I was getting ready to go home and my mother [Christina] died on February 3 [aged 53]. So there I was, out of work, and now had the two biggest voids in my life \u2013 the loss of my mother and football. I was recovering mentally and decided to go to the gym, get myself fit and then started writing to a few clubs to see if I could get a job, or even an interview for a job. I didn&apos;t get anything. &quot;There were three clubs. I received a reply from two. Two clubs were in the Championship and one in League One. I didn&apos;t get an interview and so I thought my managerial career was over before it had started. &quot;Then I got a call from Manchester City and I thought I&apos;d probably have to go in the coaching game again for a couple of years to get my name back. How it all worked out was I was sitting in McDonald&apos;s one day with my two children. I got a call saying Swansea were keen to speak to me. On the Friday of that week [16 July] I became the manager of Swansea. That, in short, was the seven months.&quot; Rodgers had six months in charge of Reading and knew he had to be more clinical upon his return to the game. Where players would have five or six games to implement Rodgers&apos; instructions or find form at Reading, they would get only two or three opportunities to impress at Swansea before being dropped. Darren Pratley, their player of the season before Rodgers&apos; arrival, was not exempt. &quot;People say what&apos;s your success? The word for me is failure,&quot; adds the Liverpool manager, who will be seeking an eighth successive Premier League win against Tottenham Hotspur. &quot;How you succeed is how you deal with failure. Whatever way you dress it up something hasn&apos;t worked. For the first time in my life I felt I had failed at Reading. I probably read the script wrong, thinking I had three years and instead I had 20 games. I could either disappear and become an academy director, where I&apos;d been for 14 years, or show character and perseverance and go again. &quot;Thankfully I was able to do that. I certainly have not had it presented to me. I found out the hard way. I respect former players who get the opportunity but I had to go down a different trail. I suppose that fear of failure is what drives me on.&quot;", "title": "Brendan Rodgers says fear of failure is key to his success with Liverpool", "sentences": ["After that I went to Dubai to reflect for 10 days and started to write in the sunshine about my experience, how it could have been different, what I could improve, what I should take into my next job?"], "publicationDate": "2014-03-28T22:30:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/29/toast-of-new-york-wins-uae-derby-at-meydan", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Dubai World Cup", "Jamie Spencer", "Aidan O'Brien", "Sport"], "article": "Jamie Osborne saddled the most valuable winner of his career with the promise of better yet to come when Toast Of New York, whose most recent outing had been at Wolverhampton in November, turned the Group Two UAE Derby at Meydan in Dubai into a procession . The black-and-white colours of Michael Buckley, Toast Of New York&apos;s owner, are more familiar on Britain&apos;s National Hunt circuit, while the most fancied runners in Saturday&apos;s race were from the Flat powerhouses of Godolphin and Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s Ballydoyle stable in Ireland. Toast Of New York had the race won on the turn for home, however. Jamie Spencer, perhaps wondering why he could hear nothing behind him and fearing that he had chased the pace too hard, took a glance over his shoulder and saw only beaten horses. Realising that he had the race by the throat, he strode on into an unassailable lead and hit the line an easy two-and-a-half lengths clear of Asmar with Emirates Flyer back in third. Osborne was one of National Hunt&apos;s top jockeys in the 1990s, riding nearly 1,000 winners, but this result is a huge testament to his ability as a trainer and also his confidence in his own judgment. Most of the horses at his stable are moderate at best, but Osborne had long been convinced that Toast Of New York was something special and so it proved. &quot;When I was riding, I was riding plenty of big winners, they were coming along regularly,&quot; Osborne said. &quot;Then I started training and had a couple of nice horses, and won a Group One [with Milk It Mick in the 2003 Dewhurst Stakes]. &quot;I probably didn&apos;t understand just how lucky I was to have that horse but having had four or five years when we really haven&apos;t had a decent horse, we seem to spend most of our time at Lingfield and Wolverhampton, this is important. It is luck to get your hands on a horse like this, and when you do, you just have to make sure you don&apos;t make a mess of it.&quot; Milk It Mick&apos;s Dewhurst was worth \u00a3142,000 to the winner. Saturday&apos;s race had a first prize of \u00a3723,000, barely \u00a350,000 less than Ruler Of The World secured when he won the Derby at Epsom last June. Victory also guarantees a run in the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs in early May, but it may be that Buckley and Osborne will decide that five weeks is not enough time to recover before such a tough assignment on the other side of the world. &quot;It was intimidating to be out in the [parade] ring at the back and you suddenly see the Godolphin team and the Ballydoyle team,&quot; Buckley said. &quot;You suddenly think, wow, I&apos;m paddling in a deep ocean here and maybe I&apos;m going to get washed up unconscious on a shore somewhere. &quot;I&apos;ve managed to win a Grade One at Cheltenham and I was pretty dazed after that. It&apos;s tough stuff, it&apos;s easy for people who do this every day, but for us it is a bit dazing. &quot;I&apos;ve been to Churchill Downs a few times and I can&apos;t imagine you&apos;d have many better days in your life or racing than if you were to win the Kentucky Derby. That said, the first thing to do is to get him home and see how he is. He will be tired, and so will I.&quot; Spencer was completing a double on the card after steering Certerach, an outsider trained by Michael Halford, to a narrow defeat of Godolphin&apos;s Cavalryman. Jo\u00e3o Moriera, from Hong Kong, also completed a double in the card&apos;s two sprint events, the Golden Shaheen and the Al Quoz Trophy, on Sterling City and Amber Sky. At Doncaster, the Lincoln Handicap was won by Ocean Tempest, who has only recently returned from Dubai, with Adam Kirby, who rode Toast Of New York to the win at Wolverhampton before Christmas, in the saddle. Ocean Tempest, a 20-1 chance, had failed to win in six starts at Meydan this year, but was fit and strong enough to hold the challenge of Tullius by one-and-three-quarter lengths. &quot;This was always his aim,&quot; John Ryan, the winner&apos;s trainer, said. &quot;He paid his way in Dubai, but we thought he was a bit high in the weights for this, but we knew this ground was his thing.

Paul Hanagan, riding Mukhadram for Newmarket trainer William Haggas, seized the initiative from the off despite a wide draw and was in front as the field turned away from the stands. Mukhadram still led turning for home, with many of his better-fancied rivals already struggling to raise a challenge, but De Sousa was poised on African Story, who had failed to win either of his two previous starts this year despite starting favourite for both. African Story finished eighth over course-and-distance earlier this month when strongly fancied for a Group One event, with no fewer than five of Saturday&apos;s rivals in front of him. He looked a different horse as he swept past Mukhadram however, while another Godolphin runner, Charlie Appleby&apos;s Cat O&apos;Mountain, stayed on for third place. &quot;He was very unlucky here last time, he banged his head in the stalls,&quot; De Sousa said. &quot;Now he&apos;s proved that he&apos;s the boy. I had a bit of bad luck in the earlier races and he has saved the night.&quot; Ruler Of The World, running in new colours after a half-share in the 2013 Derby winner was sold to Sheikh Joaan al-Thani of Qatar, did not threaten from a wide draw. Ryan Moore took his first major race of the new campaign on Gentildonna, showing brilliant composure and awareness in the closing stages to get home on the Japan Cup winner despite having to negotiate his way from the inside and around two opponents. With scarcely a furlong to run, Gentildonna was trapped in a pocket by Christophe Soumillon, riding Cirrus des Aigles, the eventual runner-up. Once Moore had found some running room, however, he unleashed the mare&apos;s exceptional finishing speed and unlikely though it had seemed just seconds earlier, managed to win with something in hand. It would be a huge coup for European racing if Longchamp could attract Gentildonna to the Prix de l&apos;Arc de Triomphe in October, but the early indication was that she will attempt instead to win the Japan Cup for the third year running. &quot;She&apos;s getting even better,&quot; Sei Ishizaka, Gentildonna&apos;s trainer, said. &quot;Her main target will be the Japan Cup. I thought she would make it when Ryan shifted her to the outside, it was a gutsy performance.&quot; Mars suffered a fatal heart attack in the early stages of the race and threw Richard Hughes, his jockey, over a running rail. Despite being moved to an ambulance on a stretcher, however, Hughes was reported to be only winded. Gentildonna&apos;s victory was the second of the night for a Japanese-trained horse as Just A Way, who beat Gentildonna by four lengths in a Grade One last October, produced one of the most impressive performances Meydan has seen to win the Dubai Duty Free over nine furlongs. Just A Way left her opponents standing in the straight, powering away from a high-class field including the Breeders&apos; Cup Filly &amp; Mare Turf winner Dank and Yorkshire Oaks winner The Fugue. Earlier on the card, Jamie Osborne saddled the most valuable winner of his career with the promise of better yet to come when Toast Of New York, whose most recent outing had been at Wolverhampton in November, turned the Group Two UAE Derby at Meydan in Dubai into a procession. He had the race won on the turn for home, however, and Jamie Spencer sent him into an unassailable lead in the straight before hitting the line two-and-a-half lengths clear of Asmar. &quot;When I was riding, I was riding plenty of big winners, they were coming along regularly,&quot; Osborne said. &quot;Then I started training and had a couple of nice horses, and won a Group One.

It is also a good idea if the city&apos;s government has a vision, or at least an overview, of what is happening. Neither of these applies to the wave of towers about to hit London. There are plans for more than 230, at the last count. They range in height from 20 storeys to more than 60, in central and suburban locations. Yet it has taken a privately funded organisation, New London Architecture, to discover this number. When Kit Malthouse, deputy mayor for business, was presented with this figure, he was not only ignorant of it, but denied it could be possible. On these pages we show the cumulative effect of these planned towers on key locations along the Thames, where several of the proposals are concentrated. The images are of those that are known: many more can be expected in the coming months and years. It is the first time that the future skyline has been shown to this extent, even though the technology is there to do so. Today we also publish a statement signed by scores of leading figures in culture, politics and business, and societies representing citizens. They include architects who have won the profession&apos;s highest awards, contemporary artists, property developers, MPs, authors and the heads of colleges and museums. These are not Luddites or fogeys, they are not enemies of business or of the new, but they share simple shock at the thoughtlessness with which change on this scale is happening. Here&apos;s another good idea: buildings in cities should not be designed in isolation, but in relation to the places in which they are set, whether these are views to and from world heritage sites, or the fabric of adjoining streets. Together with its present and future neighbours, new development should make accessible public spaces that are a pleasure to inhabit \u2013 the effects of tall buildings are as important at ground level as they are in the sky. And the larger and more prominently placed a building is, the greater the care that should be taken over its design. Nobody could go to the places already being shaped by towers \u2013 Elephant and Castle, Vauxhall or Stratford High Street, a discus-throw from the Olympic Park \u2013 and say that these are great places to linger, or that the tall buildings now rising there enhance the experience. Images of these places in the future, when further skyscrapers will jostle for attention, suggest more of the same. New urban zones are being created with no overall idea of how the parts contribute to the whole, of the places that are being made at their base. Rather, new London tower design tends to go out of its way to be as assertive and architecturally antisocial as possible. Strata SE1 in Elephant and Castle, with its slashed rooftop, randomised aluminium cladding patterns and bulbous form, seems to be setting out to be as hostile as possible to any future neighbour. In Stratford the fashion is for arbitrary clashing colours \u2013 another idea that kills the prospect of making coherent public places. Nor, when you get close to a building such as St George&apos;s Tower in Vauxhall, would you say that you are in the presence of quality. Its details clash and its cladding looks cheap and plasticky. There is no great reason to believe that these surfaces will age well. Images of proposed future projects, such as the Quill in Bermondsey and 1 Merchant Square in Paddington, suggest little improvement in the future. Combined with frantic attempts at individuality is a profound sameness. These projects tend to use the same type of cladding and floor layouts. It is sometimes said that London needs skyscrapers to make an &quot;iconic&quot; statement on the world stage, but these developments make it look less distinctive. And if the city tries to engage in the global race for height, it can only lose. It is outpaced by the likes of Shanghai and Dubai, the height of whose Burj Khalifa is 2.7 times that of the Shard. If towers can sometimes look dramatic and impressive, they also bring drawbacks. They are inflexible, expensive to run and maintain and consume money, space and resources on lifts, air conditioning and structure that lower buildings do not require. Above a certain height such simple pleasures as opening windows and outdoor space become difficult. Towers disconnect residents from their surroundings. Overcoming these issues requires effort in design, effort that is hard to see here. It was decided in the 1970s that councils should no longer build high-rise blocks for families, particularly where there were not enough open spaces and communal facilities. Those now being built are for the higher end of the market, but the lessons of the past have not been learned. The majority of the tall buildings now proposed are residential. There is, of course, an acute shortage of homes in London, but stacks of high-rise, high-price flats are not what the city needs. In a recent Ipsos Mori poll commissioned by New London Architecture, a majority of Londoners said they would not want to live in towers. The transformation of the skyline is not driven by serving their needs, but by a bubble of overseas investment in high-end residential property. Many of these flats are likely to be left empty. The best thing about these buildings is that, under existing planning policy, developers must make a contribution to affordable housing, which can be spent at another location. But it would be possible to build developments that are both lower and better-designed and still achieve this benefit. We have got to this point through several factors. Early in Tony Blair&apos;s government, a taskforce led by Lord Rogers of Riverside produced a report on the &quot;Urban Renaissance&quot;, arguing for using land more effectively and making cities more vibrant through higher densities, achieved with the help of good design and quality public spaces. As mayor of London, Ken Livingstone employed Rogers as an adviser and built these ideas into the London Plan, which guides development. The plan, and other policy statements, stress that towers are acceptable only if they &quot;are well-designed and in the right place&quot;. What we have now is a bastardisation of Rogers&apos;s ideas. &quot;Density&quot; has been translated into height, and the pieties about design and siting are almost meaningless. Significant decisions have blown holes in such policies as exist. John Prescott and Hazel Blears, when they were the ministers responsible, overturned the advice of planning inquiries into key projects. The City of London, which had a plan to confine tall buildings in a cluster around the Bank of England, permitted 20 Fenchurch Street, aka the Walkie Talkie, which stands outside it. Boris Johnson, when first running for London mayor, vowed he would reverse Livingstone&apos;s friendliness to building high and prevent a &quot;Dubai-on-Thames&quot;, but its creation has accelerated on his watch. The communities secretary, Eric Pickles, has told the Architects Journal: &quot;We attach great importance to good design of buildings and neighbourhoods and have empowered communities so they can shape developments to reflect local needs.&quot; What this means in practice is that south London boroughs such as Southwark, Lambeth and Wandsworth readily give permission for tall buildings south of the river. They do this so they can collect contributions to affordable housing and because they lack the resources to argue for long with well-financed developers. The wall of towers forming along the river is a direct expression of this. But buildings of this prominence are a matter not just for boroughs, but for the city, the country and, given London&apos;s international importance, the world. For this reason Johnson has the power to intervene, but doesn&apos;t, much. Pickles pleads his love of communities, but, wanting to favour developers, he stands back. So what should be done now? Peter Murray of New London Architecture has proposed a mayoral London Skyline Commission, in which experts would scrutinise the quality of new proposals and guide developers. He also wants a publicly accessible digital model of the city, which would enable everyone to see the effects of any planning application. Both would be welcome steps, but they don&apos;t go far enough. Murray&apos;s commission sounds like a (possibly improved) version of the Commission for Architecture and the Built Environment, which has existed for 15 years and is now part of the Design Council, during which London&apos;s planning has got into this state. The city needs a clearer, more precise framework, one that states where height is acceptable and where not. It can identify opportunities for vertical growth as well as restrictions. Something like this exists already, in the rules controlling strategic views of St Paul&apos;s and the Palace of Westminster. The problem is that, where these rules do not prevail, there is often havoc. Such a framework would be more efficient than the current system, where it has taken 10 years, three architectural practices, and untold millions of professional and legal fees, for the proposed rebuilding of Elizabeth House in Waterloo to be permitted. New York has applied strict rules to the building of skyscrapers for nearly a century, during which it became the world&apos;s most dynamic city \u2013 so rules are not bad for business. It is not easy to work out the right policies for London. In the coming weeks the Observer, our Cities website and the Architects&apos; Journal will develop the debate. But this effort is essential: the alternative is to accept that civic democracy is powerless to influence the effects of financial speculation.", "title": "London is being transformed with 230 towers.

Flipped learning turns the usual teaching model on its head. The idea is that students learn new content outside the classroom (usually online) and then tackle assignments in lessons, giving teachers more time to help students with aspects they don&apos;t understand. Chris, who&apos;s been experimenting with the method for a few weeks, talks about how he&apos;s been using it to teach division. Firstly, he emails students two videos on YouTube about the topic, asking them to watch the clips over the weekend and bring any questions to school on Monday. In the lesson, he sets challenges on short and long division. What&apos;s interesting is that instead of assigning students tasks based on their ability, students can choose the problems they&apos;d like work on depending on the level they believe they&apos;re at. Ten minutes into the class an Ofsted inspector walks in. Chris writes: &quot;Some of the pupils had chosen to stay with me to explore their misconceptions. &quot;This is where the children really excelled. They knew which part of the calculation strategy they were challenged by and could tell me about it in detail, because they had watched the video before the session. &quot;The approach enabled me to spend more time questioning childrens&apos; understanding and moving learning on.&quot; And, he writes, &quot;what better way to endorse the use of a flipped classroom than a direct quote from our Ofsted report: &apos;An innovative use of e-tablets when learning about mathematics enabled pupils to make outstanding progress.&apos;&quot; We&apos;ll be exploring the different ways you can use the flipped learning approach to teach students. We&apos;ll be sharing lesson ideas, looking at the benefits and challenges, discussing research behind the idea and talking about where you can find resources to support the technique.

Oh yes, and the title character can&apos;t appear on stage. But somehow it happened and on Sunday night a lavish production about the life and teachings of Muhammad, Islam&apos;s main prophet, intended as a rejoinder to more militant interpretations of the faith, premiered at a specially built \u00a320m mock-Roman amphitheatre in Sharjah, the small emirate adjoining Dubai. The show had to be assembled in months by an international team that includes Piers Shepperd, technical director of the 2012 Olympic opening and closing ceremonies, and the man who made Danny Boyle&apos;s creative ideas happen on stage. Now he has done the same for a show whose scope is roughly equivalent to Islam: the Opera. The 90-minute production, Clusters of Light, has the ambitious stated intent of rebranding the religion internationally. The story is told with a cast of about 200, including some of the Arab world&apos;s most celebrated singers, such as Mohammed Assaf, the Palestinian winner of Arab Idol, and the Tunisian tenor Lotfi Bouchnak, with spectacular animated scenes projected around them. An inaugural run in Sharjah will be followed by mooted tours to Malaysia, Turkey and even Paris. There are tentative plans to translate the libretto, by a Saudi poet, into other languages with a view to attracting non-Muslim audiences. From the beginning, the production faced one particular challenge: under Islamic convention Muhammad cannot be portrayed in human form. The first step for the team, according to Richard Lindsay, the creative director, was to watch The Message, a 1977 film about Muhammad&apos;s life that showed the story from his direct perspective, conveniently keeping him off-screen. &quot;As we weren&apos;t making a film, we didn&apos;t have that luxury,&quot; said Lindsay. &quot;There&apos;s only once in the show we refer to the prophet, and then we represent him as a source of light, which is accepted. For the rest of the time we didn&apos;t need him in the story, as it revolves around him. The show is about what he&apos;s doing, but it doesn&apos;t actually need to show him.&quot; The production is lavish to an almost Bollywood extent, with images projected to a huge screen behind the cast, forming the background scenes, sometimes animating to interact with the on-stage action or provide images such as a falcon seemingly soaring above the audience. Gavin Robins, the director, with a background in the somewhat different world of the Eurovision song contest and stage productions such as How to Tame Your Dragon, describes it as the most technically advanced show he has worked on, and one of the most dramatic. &quot;You could describe it as a romantic thriller,&quot; he said. &quot;When we first rehearsed the scene about the prophet&apos;s death, the entire company was genuinely weeping. It&apos;s a gift to be able to take that energy from a cast.&quot; Shepperd said his involvement changed his view about the religion&apos;s take on several subjects, for example the position of women. He said: &quot;If you look at the popular misconceptions about Islam, that isn&apos;t the case at all. It&apos;s great to be working on a show that explores those kinds of things.&quot; Whatever the intended message, the broader cultural context is arguably slightly more complex. Sharjah is sufficiently traditional to possess a set of &quot;public decency rules&quot; that prohibit, among other things, men and women being alone together in public unless they are married or related. The author of the libretto, Abdulrahman al-Ashmawy, has reportedly written a poem criticising attempts by women in his native Saudi Arabia to be permitted to drive. However, the man ultimately overseeing Clusters of Light, Philippe Skaff, said he welcomed Sharjah&apos;s ambitious scheme from the very personal perspective of a Lebanese Christian: &quot;As a Christian Arab, if anyone feels threatened by extremism, it&apos;s us. It&apos;s very comforting to see a work like this commissioned. &quot;At the start of all this the sheikh told me, &apos;If we don&apos;t do this, if we don&apos;t spread the real message of Islam, we&apos;re letting the extremists take over.

Bracelet is trained by Aidan O&apos;Brien, Joseph&apos;s father and Ireland&apos;s perennial champion, but was only the third choice in the betting for the Group Three contest in a market headed by Dermot Weld&apos;s Balansiya, who was odds-on at 9-10. Unraced since winning a maiden at the same course last June, Bracelet settled well at the back of the field and made ground rapidly in the home straight after Balansiya hit the front inside the final quarter-mile, catching her rival with half a furlong to run and going on to win by a length. &quot;She did it nicely and she&apos;s a filly we think will stay well in time,&quot; Aidan O&apos;Brien said. &quot;We&apos;re delighted with her and, all things being well, she might go to the [1,000] Guineas [at Newmarket on 4 May]. &quot;We always thought she would [stay a mile and a half] but Joseph said he wasn&apos;t sure there, as she showed a lot of speed. That&apos;s why we&apos;re thinking about the Guineas.&quot; Bracelet is top-priced at 10-1 for the Oaks with Ladbrokes and William Hill, and is a 16-1 chance with several firms for the 1,000 Guineas. O&apos;Brien had a disappointing evening at Meydan in Dubai on Saturday, where all six of his runners on the World Cup night card failed to reach the frame, including Ruler Of The World, last year&apos;s Derby winner, in the feature event. Running on a synthetic surface for the first time, Ruler Of The World faded to finish 13th of the 16 runners. &quot;We didn&apos;t know whether he would handle the surface and it looks like he probably didn&apos;t,&quot; O&apos;Brien said. &quot;Joseph said he was grand until he came off the bridle and then he was all at sea.&quot; Richard Hughes, who was injured in a fall on the same card when Mars suffered a heart attack in the Dubai Sheema Classic, will need to rest before returning to action after he was found to have fractured a vertebra in the incident. Hughes was originally thought to be only winded but his wife, Lizzie, said on Twitter: &quot;Richard has a stable fracture of one vertebra, no pain at all, just rest needed and no surgery needed #lucky&quot; and later added: &quot;He is very keen to get home but they are making a jacket/brace for him so I hope we can go home after that.&quot; Toast Of New York, the easy winner of the UAE Derby at Meydan for Jamie Osborne and Jamie Spencer, will be supplemented for the Derby at Epsom on 7 June. He is also guaranteed a start in the Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs on 3 May as a result of Saturday&apos;s success, on his first outing since a wide-margin success in a minor event on Polytrack at Wolverhampton in November. &quot;I&apos;m going to see Michael [Buckley, the colt&apos;s owner],&quot; Osborne said on Sunday, &quot;and obviously we will discuss the future. It&apos;s not impossible [that Toast Of New York will run in America], all options are open to us. I will be supplementing him for the English Derby as well and we&apos;ll keep all options open. &quot;Watching last night, it took Jamie until halfway down the back to pull him up. There&apos;s plenty in his pedigree to suggest he will get a mile and a half and I&apos;m a great believer that horses stay if they travel.&quot; The effects of the long trip to Dubai will need to be assessed before any decision is made about the colt&apos;s next start and, though he has plenty of American bloodlines in his pedigree, another long journey may be seen as too much to ask at this stage. &quot;I think what you have to bear in mind with this horse is that we&apos;ve had to do quite a lot of work at an early stage in his life to get him into a position so that he could win last night,&quot; Osborne said. &quot;It remains to be seen how tired he will be when he gets home.

The charcoal-grey Tapeta racing surface on the main track is said to be on borrowed time, with American-style dirt lined up to replace it to encourage US-trained horses to return to the meeting. It could be idle chatter. The only opinion in Dubai that matters belongs to Sheikh Mohammed and he does not hang around the backstretch of a morning sharing his thoughts and plans. But the rune-reading does suggest that something is afoot. Sheikh Hamdan al-Maktoum, Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s older brother, recorded his own misgivings about Tapeta in the Gulf News this week while it was also announced that the Sheema Classic and Dubai Duty Free, already the richest turf events in the world, will be worth an extra $1m next year. This would give owners reluctant to run on dirt two attractive alternatives. What is also hard to deny is that the meeting needs to do something, and probably something quite dramatic, to address the declining number of runners from the US. It is a key aim of both the Sheikh&apos;s Godolphin racing operation and the World Cup to advertise Dubai around the globe, and while there is a temptation to say that if the Americans do not want a share of $29m then that&apos;s their problem, the US remains the largest racing industry of all. There were horses from 13 countries racing in Dubai on Saturday, but if the best of the Americans are happy to swerve the big race, is it really a World Cup? American horses, including the outstanding champions Cigar and Curlin, won eight of the 14 World Cups on the dirt at Nad Al Sheba. This year there were only three US-trained runners on the entire card, only one in any of the three feature events and none at all in the World Cup itself. If even Sheikh Hamdan is prepared to break cover, there are clearly issues with the Tapeta as it stands. It would be ridiculous to criticise a racing surface simply because the &quot;wrong&quot; horses keep winning. If the &quot;right&quot; horses always won, there would be no uncertainty and therefore no racing. But the near total failure of the fancied horses \u2013 the ones at single-figure prices \u2013 even to make the frame in Meydan World Cups will be too pronounced to be a blip if it continues any longer. There are too many races in which the great majority of the runners are beaten before they have entered the home straight and too many in which every jockey wants to sit in the middle of the pack. As Ryan Moore said this week: &quot;On dirt it&apos;s fine as you go fast and get strung out but on [Tapeta] you can get [to the] front, put the handbrake on and it all gets messy.&quot; Whether the answer is to revert to dirt is another matter. A personal view is that it would be a backward step and, what is more, at the worst possible time. The fallout from an undercover video shot by the animal rights group PETA is currently convulsing American racing, and returning the issue of the harsh dirt surface used for both racing and training to the agenda. Tapeta was installed at Meydan when it seemed that US racing in general was moving towards synthetics. That trend was swiftly reversed in the face of strong resistance from trainers in particular, many of whom found it difficult \u2013 or claimed to find it difficult \u2013 to condition horses on an artificial surface. But the PETA video provides a timely reminder that many find it virtually impossible to train horses on dirt without constant reliance on legal, and possibly not so legal, medication. In Britain the big races offer a prize for the owner, trainer, jockey and groom. In the States they should possibly add the vet and pharmacist to that list, too. Dirt is hard-wearing and above all cheap but fundamentally it is a harsh, primitive racing surface. A bigger carrot would be a better way to try to attract the best US horses and there was an interesting aside from one leading Meydan official this week that &quot;20 is now a very important number for us in Dubai&quot;. This referred to Dubai&apos;s success in winning the right to stage Expo 2020 in six years&apos; time but also set loose the thought that a $20m World Cup would be a good way to celebrate and advertise Expo, too. Five years is too soon to start ripping up the Tapeta and starting again but this could be a decision which has already been made. Sheikh Mohammed may decide to hike the World Cup prize fund, or revert to running the race on dirt. Then again he might do neither \u2013 or both.", "title": "US absence from Dubai World Cup leads Sheikh Mohammed to think again | Greg Wood", "sentences": ["It was a good moment to pause and take in the view after the Dubai World Cup on Saturday evening because, if the persistent rumours in the run-up to race night are correct, Meydan will look quite different when the sport&apos;s richest card is staged this time next year.", "The only opinion in Dubai that matters belongs to Sheikh Mohammed and he does not hang around the backstretch of a morning sharing his thoughts and plans.", "Sheikh Hamdan al-Maktoum, Sheikh Mohammed&apos;s older brother, recorded his own misgivings about Tapeta in the Gulf News this week while it was also announced that the Sheema Classic and Dubai Duty Free, already the richest turf events in the world, will be worth an extra $1m next year.", "It is a key aim of both the Sheikh&apos;s Godolphin racing operation and the World Cup to advertise Dubai around the globe, and while there is a temptation to say that if the Americans do not want a share of $29m then that&apos;s their problem, the US remains the largest racing industry of all.", "There were horses from 13 countries racing in Dubai on Saturday, but if the best of the Americans are happy to swerve the big race, is it really a World Cup?", "A bigger carrot would be a better way to try to attract the best US horses and there was an interesting aside from one leading Meydan official this week that &quot;20 is now a very important number for us in Dubai&quot;.", "This referred to Dubai&apos;s success in winning the right to stage Expo 2020 in six years&apos; time but also set loose the thought that a $20m World Cup would be a good way to celebrate and advertise Expo, too."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-30T19:54:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/31/airplane-black-box-flight-recorders-investigators", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH370", "World news", "Air transport", "Asia Pacific", "Plane crashes", "Airline industry"], "article": "On the night of 1 June 2009, Air France flight 447 from Rio de Janeiro to Paris went missing with 216 passengers and 12 crew on board. The Airbus A330-200 disappeared mid-ocean in equatorial waters, beyond radar coverage. For five days, the plane&apos;s fate was a mystery. But even when the first debris was recovered, the reason the plane crashed was far from clear. Why would a state-of-the art aircraft, piloted by a seasoned crew, crash in mid-Atlantic? The aircraft had flown through a thunderstorm, but why had its crews sent out no distress signal? Only when the plane&apos;s black box was recovered, investigators believed, could those questions be answered. What happened to AF447, which parallels in some respects the current mystery of what has happened to Malaysia Airlines flight MH370 from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing, took nearly two years to determine. The search involved tracking 17,000 sq kms of often uncharted sea bed to depths of 4,700m \u2013 and was only successful because of a great deal of luck. For months, American, Brazilian and French ships, planes and submarines had searched for the wreckage, using software devised to simulate how far debris travelled from the scene of the crash, but failed, partly because equatorial currents at that time of the year proved too unpredictable. Worse, as time went on it was increasingly less likely that the black box would be emitting a signal that would help searchers to find it. Every commercial black box is fitted with a low-frequency underwater locator beacon that is activated as soon as it comes in contact with water and emits a continuous pinging noise from a depth of up to 4km. It usually has a battery life of about 30 days, though factors such as depth and temperature of the water and crash-impact damage can reduce the battery. This last fact is proving worrying to investigators of flight MH370, which has not been heard of since 8 March: the battery life of its black box is nearly over \u2013 thus reducing the likelihood of finding it.

Photograph: Mehdi Fedouach/AFP/Getty Images    That proved a problem, too, for those hunting for the wreckage and black box of flight AF447 in 2009. Nearly two years after the plane went down, the French aviation accident investigation authority, BEA, called in a firm of US statisticians expert in finding objects lost at sea. Analysts from the US-based Metron Inc used Bayesian probability techniques to work out the most likely location of the wreckage. &quot;It still was a minor miracle that we found it,&quot; Metron&apos;s senior analyst Colleen Keller told the BBC. &quot;It was lucky that the wreckage was on the bottom of the ocean floor, on a very sandy area. There were some areas down there that looked like the Himalayas in terms of mountains, crags, and valleys.&quot; Once recovered, AF447&apos;s cockpit voice recorder (CVR) gave a shattering sense of the panic and confusion among the crew in the minutes before the crash. Here are the crew&apos;s final words: 02:13:40 (co-pilot David Robert): &quot;Climb \u2026 climb \u2026 climb \u2026 climb \u2026&quot; 02:13:40 (co-pilot Pierre-C\u00e9dric Bonin): &quot;But I&apos;ve had the stick back the whole time!&quot; 02:13:42 (Captain Marc Dubois): &quot;No, no, no \u2026 Don&apos;t climb \u2026 no, no.&quot; 02:13:43 (Robert): &quot;Descend \u2026 Give me the controls \u2026 Give me the controls!&quot; Robert takes control and lowers the aircraft&apos;s nose. A hazard warning sounds, telling them the surface of the sea is fast approaching. 02:14:23 (Robert): &quot;Damn it, we&apos;re going to crash \u2026 This can&apos;t be happening!&quot; 02:14:27 (Dubois): &quot;Ten degrees of pitch \u2026&quot; The recording ends.     The flight data recorder found at the scene in Pennsylvania, where United Airlines flight 93 crashed after being hijacked on September 11, 2001. Photograph: Getty Images    But what had gone wrong with flight AF447? After studying the black box data, investigators concluded that the autopilot disconnected abruptly following a thunderstorm, after which the crew responded incorrectly to speed readings, and ultimately led the aircraft to an aerodynamic stall from which they did not recover, resulting in the deaths of all 228 people on board. The mystery, nearly two years after the aircraft&apos;s disappearance, had finally been solved. One thing you ought to know about black box recorders is that they are not black. They are a shade called international orange (not dissimilar, apparently, to the colour of San Francisco&apos;s Golden Gate bridge), which, apart from anything else, makes them easier to spot. The recorders, now nearly 60 years old, were originally invented by Australian aeronautical scientist  Dr David Warren. These days, black boxes use solid-state memory boards that can track more than 700 parameters. They consist of two pieces of equipment: the flight data recorder (FDR), which records airspeed, altitude, vertical acceleration and fuel flow; and the cockpit voice recorder (CVR). Investigators have become so skilled at listening to CVRs that they can infer the speed the plane was travelling and engine rpm and can sometimes pinpoint the cause of a crash from the very sounds the plane was making before it crashed. For instance, after Pan Am flight 103 crashed into Lockerbie on Wednesday, 21 December 1988, killing all 243 passengers and 16 crew on board, investigators studied the CVR and heard, at 19.02:50, a loud sound. When this noise was compared with radar returns it showed that eight seconds after the explosion, the wreckage had a one nautical mile (1.9km) spread. Black box recorders, which are now compulsory on any commercial flight, are usually kept in the tail of an aircraft because that is where they are more likely to survive a crash. I know what you&apos;re thinking. Should I book a seat as near the black box as possible to maximise my survival chances in the event of a crash? Perhaps, but think of it this way: unlike you, black boxes are built to operate between -55C and +70C; unlike you, some black box recorders have survived exposure to 1,110C fire for an hour and 260C heat for 10 hours. Some have been tested by being dunked in pressurised saltwater tanks and soaked in jet fuel. Black boxes are usually double-wrapped in titanium or stainless steel. The part that contains memory boards is fired from an air cannon to create an impact of 3,400 Gs and then smashed against a target. Unlike you, that is to say, black box recorders are virtually indestructible. But it is the final words of the crew \u2013 and sometimes passengers \u2013 yielded by black box recorders retrieved from fatal air crashes that have claimed most attention, for all that reading transcripts or listening to what turn out to be final words can feel like a ghoulish intrusion \u2013 at least for those not investigating the cause of a crash. Such transcripts of the CVR recovered after Concorde flight AF4590, which crashed outside Paris in July 2000, satisfy a morbid curiosity. The cockpit recordings recovered from United Airlines flight 93, one of four airlines hijacked on 11 September 2001 and the only one not to reach its intended target, were used by the US 9/11 Commission to reach its conclusions that the hijackers crashed the plane to keep the crew and passengers from gaining control. They also formed the basis of Paul Greengrass&apos;s 2006 film Flight 93, which the Guardian&apos;s Peter Bradshaw, making it his film of the year, described as &quot;a gutwrenching example of ordeal cinema&quot;. CVRs then can give us brushes with mortality from the safety of our laptops or multiplexes. That said, conspiracy theorists maintain that flight 93 was shot down by a missile and disintegrated in mid air and that the recovered CVR was a fake. Sometimes, CVR data reveals crew are heard joking in the minutes before disaster strikes. For instance, on 31 October 1994, an American Eagle turboprop was waiting for clearance to land in Chicago. The CVR included the captain calling the first officer in the cockpit. Captain: Hey, bro&apos;. First Officer: Yeah. Captain: Gettin&apos; busy with the ladies back here. FO: Oh.     Crew members of a Chinese icebreaker search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370. Time is running out to locate the black boxes. Photograph: Zhang Jiansong/REX    Flight attendant: (sound of snicker) Captain: Yeah, so if, so if I don&apos;t make it up there within the next say, 15 or 20 minutes, you know why. FO: OK. Minutes later, the plane plunged into a field, killing all 68 aboard. Strikingly, in this context, French investigators decide to omit one part of their published transcript of the last minutes of AF445. They didn&apos;t consider it material to their findings, but rather one that might unfairly inculpate the captain. Instead, it fell to French news magazine Le Point to publish the remark, just before crash, made by Captain Dubois before he went to sleep and handed over the control to the two co-pilots: &quot;I didn&apos;t sleep enough last night. One hour \u2013 it&apos;s not enough.&quot; The question of whether to publish the last words of an aircraft crew is a vexed one, not least because it is understandably an unpopular move among pilots, not to mention the families and friends of those involved in air crashes. When the New York Times published a tranche of CVR recordings from aircraft disasters, it came with this disclaimer: &quot;Releasing the transcripts is a practice that irks many pilots. It is disrespectful to the pilots and their families, they say, and casual readers may not understand when pilots are relaxed as opposed to lax. Pilots are a team, and a bit of joking can improve the way they communicate.&quot; Some black boxes have so far not been recovered from aircraft wreckage, but that doesn&apos;t mean they never will be. For example, on New Year&apos;s Day 1985, an Eastern Air Lines Boeing 727 from Asunci\u00f3n, Paraguay, to La Paz, Bolivia, struck Bolivia&apos;s second-highest mountain, Mount Illimani, at an altitude of 19,600ft (6,000m). All 19 passengers and 10 crew were killed. Nearly 20 years later, in 2006, a climber, Roberto G\u00f3mez, discovered part of the aircraft&apos;s fuselage, along with photographs, children&apos;s clothing and what seemed to be crocodile hides from the cargo hold at the crash site. He was able to do so, he said, only because the Andean mountain&apos;s glacier was melting. In time, he said, the Andes would reveal more. &quot;The bodies and the black box are still somewhere in the ice,&quot; he said. Can better black box recorders be made than ones currently in operation? Why, for instance, is there no cockpit video recording facility? Some have argued that this hasn&apos;t happened, even though the technology exists, because of industry inertia. And what about black boxes that eject upon impact, so they are easier to find? Earlier this month, in the wake of the search for flight MH370, US Congressman David Price reintroduced a bill to make ejectable black boxes compulsory. &quot;Nearly every major commercial air accident that has occurred over water or in remote areas has resulted in a costly and time-consuming recovery,&quot; Price said. Unlike the heavy black boxes that sink to the ocean floor along with the rest of the plane, ejectable recorders would float on the water&apos;s surface. The technology has been used by the US Navy for years, added Price. Another influential idea has been dreamed up by Texan computer scientist Professor Krishna Kavi. He was inspired by the thought that EgyptAir flight 990, which crashed off New England in 1999, killing 217 people, might have been avoided if flight data had been transmitted to monitors on the ground rather than being archived for later study on the airliner&apos;s black box. &quot;Rather than store data in an onboard box that might be unrecoverable if the aircraft goes down in the sea,&quot; Kavi wrote, &quot;it would be far better to transmit the data continuously and in real time to a ground-based system that would record the output of the plane&apos;s sensors and electronics.&quot; But why don&apos;t all forms of transportation carry black box recorders? Perhaps, ultimately, they will. In the US, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration required car manufacturers to install event data recorders \u2013 a rudimentary equivalent to aviation \u2013 in all new cars and light trucks from this September. If a car is involved in a crash or, at least, when its airbags activate, inputs from the vehicle&apos;s sensors during the previous five to 10 seconds are automatically preserved \u2013 how fast the car was travelling, whether the driver applied the brake, was steering erratically or had a seat belt on. The idea, say its advocates, is that investigators can thereby gather information to make vehicles safer. Critics, though, have expressed privacy concerns \u2013 perhaps such data could be used for nefarious purposes, if not to hike insurance premiums. It&apos;s salutary to recall that not all black box recorders are recovered from downed aircraft. Strikingly, two such cases involve deliberate attempts to bomb passenger aircraft. In 1986, for example, Korean Air flight 858 between Seoul and Baghdad exploded over the Andaman Sea, killing all 115 people aboard, after a bomb placed was in an overhead locker by North Korean agents, one of whom admitted later responsibility. In 1988, Iran Air flight 655 from Tehran to Dubai was shot down by the US Navy cruiser missile cruiser USS Vincennes, killing all 290 on board. Another case where the flight data recorder was never found may be more relevant to those now trying to find the wreckage and black box of flight MH370 in the Indian Ocean. In 1987, following an in-flight fire in the cargo area when South African Airways flight 295 crashed into the Indian Ocean off Mauritius, killing all 159 people on board leading to one of the most extensive and deepest salvage operations ever undertaken. Ultimately, the CVR was discovered at 4,900m (16,100ft), but the FDR was not. In the case of flight 295, several conspiracy theories were advanced to explain why the plane crashed \u2013 that the plane was transporting weapons used to beat South Africa&apos;s then current arms embargo, or material for the apartheid regime&apos;s atomic project. Today there are lots of theories \u2013 some wild, some plausible \u2013 on what happened to flight MH370 over the Indian Ocean last month. Only when its black box recorder is found will we know which, if any of them, is true. Perhaps the mystery will never be resolved.", "title": "Secrets of the black box: how does MH370's flight recorder work?", "sentences": ["In 1988, Iran Air flight 655 from Tehran to Dubai was shot down by the US Navy cruiser missile cruiser USS Vincennes, killing all 290 on board."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-31T18:07:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/mar/31/alastair-cook-jonathan-trott-england-ecb", "tags": ["England cricket team", "Alastair Cook", "Jonathan Trott", "ECB", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "With timing no better than that displayed by the England batsmen in Chittagong, Alastair Cook is due to face the media, and Jonathan Trott to return to the middle, for the first time since their respective Ashes setbacks on Tuesday morning \u2013 April Fools&apos; Day, unfunnily enough. It also happens to be the first day of the 2014 first-class season, with Surrey starting a three-day game against Cambridge University at Fenners, and Nottinghamshire facing Oxford University in The Parks. Cook will &quot;not be answering questions on any matters regarding to England&quot; in his group interview at Chelmsford during Essex&apos;s pre-season media day, and Trott has been declared off-limits during Warwickshire&apos;s two-day friendly against Gloucestershire at Edgbaston. Two other players who suffered in Australia during the winter, albeit not in the same manner as Trott \u2013 Matt Prior and Steven Finn \u2013 were also unavailable for interview when Sussex and Middlesex held their pre-season media days on Monday. The England and Wales Cricket Board insists this is a coincidence rather than a collective vow of silence, and that the decisions have been made by either the players or their counties. But following their sudden decline from national treasures to laughing stock, there does not seem much chance of Team England deciding that greater transparency will be part of the solution. Since the Ashes whitewash was completed in early January, public appearances by England players have been rare, and usually controlled, whether through a sponsor&apos;s engagement such as Joe Root&apos;s promotion of a new deal with Hardys Wines last week, or Trott&apos;s consent to a Sky documentary about the problems that forced him home early from Australia. The ECB has been stung by a series of public relations disasters, most obviously the decision to end Kevin Pietersen&apos;s international career in February which provoked a predictable backlash that has rumbled on as the team have struggled without him. Of the members of the Ashes squad who have been at home since January rather than travelling with England&apos;s one-day squad, the majority \u2013 most notably Cook \u2013 have said nothing. Prior found himself savaged for agreeing that the England dressing room would be a better place without Pietersen in what he thought was a private question-and-answer session on behalf of the Professional Cricketers&apos; Association in Dubai in late February, while Anderson was much more discreet when launching The Lancashire Way at Old Trafford at around the same time. Chris Tremlett, who has been named in a 12-man Surrey squad for Fenners, was happy to discuss Pietersen&apos;s departure at the county&apos;s pre-season media session last week, stating that his county team-mate had &quot;done nothing wrong but be honest&quot;. It is an example of the line of questioning that is inevitable for a while yet for anyone who was involved with England&apos;s winter. It is easy to see why Prior and Finn may be reluctant to discuss anything to do with England for the moment as they concentrate on rebuilding their careers \u2013 starting in the first round of County Championship fixtures on Sunday, when Sussex play Middlesex at Hove, although Finn has already bowled in a couple of friendlies and is due to do so again in a four-day match against Hampshire this week. Prior will not keep wicket for Sussex in their game against Loughborough University to &quot;manage&quot; the achilles problem he suffered in Australia, playing as a batsman only, but is expected to retake the gloves for the Middlesex match to begin his quest to reclaim his Test place. Trott&apos;s is clearly a special case, and presumably Cook prefers to talk England at an ECB-organised press conference, possibly after the appointment of a new head coach to succeed Andy Flower has been confirmed in April. The captain is due to make his first batting appearance in Essex&apos;s three-day game against Cambridge University which starts at Fenners next Monday, when Trott should also make his first-class return in Oxford \u2013 provided he comes through the Gloucestershire friendly, which will be his first time at the crease since the double failure against Mitchell Johnson in Brisbane that triggered his abrupt departure from Australia. For the moment the public relaunch of a brave new era for Team England is on ice, perhaps just as well after the latest shambles in Bangladesh. The ECB will give it a couple of weeks for the dust to settle before presenting a few of the less tainted new breed \u2013 including Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes, James Taylor and Eoin Morgan \u2013 at the launch of the rebranded domestic Twenty20 Blast competition on 17 April 17 (Maundy Thursday).", "title": "Alastair Cook bears silent witness to England pain before county season", "sentences": ["Prior found himself savaged for agreeing that the England dressing room would be a better place without Pietersen in what he thought was a private question-and-answer session on behalf of the Professional Cricketers&apos; Association in Dubai in late February, while Anderson was much more discreet when launching The Lancashire Way at Old Trafford at around the same time."], "publicationDate": "2014-03-31T18:08:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/she-said/2014/apr/01/laugh-not-at-my-hijab-please", "tags": ["Islamic veil", "Women"], "article": "I&apos;m a British Pakistani Muslim woman in my 30s, a freelance journalist, a stand up comedian and a (mostly) reformed aid worker.

The city shared bottom place with Hong Kong in 2013 in the annual table of rent rises across the globe, which is topped by Nairobi. The Kenyan capital saw rents in its central area rise by 25.9%. Dubai, the desert city state that saw its property market go into meltdown during the financial crisis, also saw rents revive, jumping 13.6% in the year.     Knight Frank table    In contrast to London, New York saw rents on luxury apartments rise by 3.5%, which Knight Frank attributed to its more robust financial sector. &quot;The contrasting fortunes of London and New York&apos;s financial sectors explains their differing results,&quot; said Kate Everett-Allen of Knight Frank. &quot;Manhattan saw luxury rents increase by 3.5% in 2013 at a time when Wall Street bonuses rose by 15% year-on-year. By comparison, the number employed in London&apos;s financial services is estimated to have contracted slightly in 2013 (-0.2%) and prime rents declined by 2.3%.&quot; London is also witnessing a surge in high-rise luxury apartment building, with the majority of the 230 planned new towers with 20 floors or more expected to be for residential use. Many of the new build properties are &quot;buy-to-leave&quot; investments by overseas buyers, but others are coming on to the rental market \u2013 or possibly face fines for under-occupation. Islington council in London said it is investigating charges of up to \u00a360,000 to owners of &quot;buy-to-leave&quot; properties. Prime rental property is defined as the top 5% of the mainstream market in each city. Despite London&apos;s downturn in 2013, it remains top of the table for increases since the start of the financial crisis. Knight Frank said the average prime central London apartment is letting for 20.9% above the price achieved at the time of Lehman&apos;s collapse in 2008. That puts the city slightly ahead of New York (up 19.6%) and sharply ahead of Hong Kong and Singapore, where rents in luxury properties are yet to regain their 2008 peak. &quot;Slowing prime rental growth in Hong Kong is attributable to the reduction in housing allowances and fewer expat arrivals. Tenants are finding that landlords are more willing to negotiate on rents than they have been for several years,&quot; Everett-Allen said.

The comments are made in the latest edition of Timeform&apos;s Racehorses annual covering the 2013 Flat racing season and will make for uncomfortable reading for the British Horseracing Authority (BHA). Timeform argue that the damage caused by the Mahmood al-Zarooni case will take &quot;years to repair&quot; and call on the BHA to widen the scope of its drug testing and seek greater control over vets involved with racing stables. &quot;Any sport that fails to police its doping problems with the utmost rigour pays a heavy price,&quot; they conclude. Some of the questions posed by Timeform over the case, which resulted in the self-confessed doper Zarooni being banned for eight years, are by now familiar but definitely bear repeating. The speed with which the BHA dispatched the former Godolphin trainer in particular left some awkward, unanswered questions state Timeform. They include the question of how long Zarooni (who had been in charge at Moulton Paddocks since 2010) had been using anabolic steroids on the horses in his care and how was that doping programme funded. Timeform also ask whether Zarooni was responsible for the doping of the seven horses \u2013 one of them the St Leger winner Encke \u2013 who tested positive after the case was closed and highlight that no charges have ever been brought in respect of that septet. Most intriguingly of all perhaps they ponder the question of how Zarooni managed to spend much of the period in question involved in this case in Dubai while at the same time being &quot;solely responsible&quot; for the doping at his Moulton Paddocks Stables in Newmarket. These issues could perhaps have been dealt with but, as Timeform point out, &quot;the BHA was strongly critical of &apos;management failings&apos; at Godolphin but not being able to track down and interview Zarooni after the seven new cases came to light \u2026 did not reflect at all well on the BHA&apos;s own management&quot;. The use of anti-bleeding drugs, such as lasix, which are permitted at the Breeders&apos; Cup, also comes in for critical scrutiny in the Racehorses of 2013 tome. Timeform state: &quot;Horsemen&apos;s groups in North America do not grasp the importance for racing&apos;s global image that international events such as the Breeders&apos; Cup should conform to a worldwide system which bans performance-enhancing drugs.&quot; &quot;Perhaps,&quot; they add, &quot;the Breeders&apos; Cup organisers would have had more chance of realising their ambition for a drug-free showpiece if more of those responsible for European-trained runners over the past 30 years had adopted [trainer] Andr\u00e9 Fabre&apos;s approach, instead of habitually injecting drugs that are banned in their own countries, in the belief that their horses will be at a disadvantage with the home-trained runners if they don&apos;t.&quot; Champions&apos; Day at Ascot \u2013 Britain&apos;s own equivalent of the Breeders&apos; Cup \u2013 and the various movements in the racing calendar to accommodate the Flat season&apos;s new finale continue to exercise the minds of the Timeform organisation. From this year, Future Champions&apos; Day, the meeting focusing on championship races for two-year-olds, will be held 24 hours before Champions&apos; Day itself to create a two-day climax to the campaign. &quot;Only time will tell if the latest tinkering will strengthen Britain&apos;s end-of-season domestic programme,&quot; contend Timeform, who hasten to add that &quot;it does not reflect well on the architects of the revamped autumn programme that a race like the Cornwallis Stakes will have had three different positions in the calendar and been run on two different courses in the space of five years.&quot; As for the future champions on show in 2013, the annual, whose A-to-Z list extends to over 11,000 horses, is predictably enthusiastic about the much-lauded Australia (&quot;one of the most exciting prospects for 2014&quot;), Kingman (&quot;whose [debut] performance was exceptional for a newcomer&quot;) and Royal Ascot winner War Command (&quot;the Joe Frazier of two-year-olds&quot;) and all three are dealt with in the book&apos;s trademark extensive essays.

Inside the paper, we analyse the fallout from Russia&apos;s annexation of Crimea as troops build up on Ukraine&apos;s eastern borders, and have the latest developments from what is shaping up to be a two-horse race in Kiev&apos;s presidential election next month. In France, local elections produced stunning gains for the far-right Front National, leading to wholesale changes in beleaguered president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande&apos;s government. In Turkey, meanwhile, local election results were perceived as a vote of confidence for prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan. In the Middle East, an outbreak of polio is causing concern in Syria, while the release of two Spanish journalists last week has highlighted the plight of westerners being held hostage in the war-torn country.

However, it is not just on pomp and glamour that Britain&apos;s flagship transport hub is being outdone. Figures for the first two months of 2014 show that Dubai has overtaken Heathrow as the airport with the largest number of international passengers in the world. It dealt with almost 2 million more in the period, and with a growth rate of 13.5%, it is likely to continue to outpace Heathrow, which remains Europe&apos;s busiest airport. But while UK politicians will be dismayed at Heathrow&apos;s fading significance it would be nigh-on impossible for Heathrow to keep up with the aggressive expansion of the Arab state. Dubai International plans to increase its passenger numbers from 60 to 90 million over the next four years, constructing an additional terminal space and concourse twice the size of Heathrow&apos;s terminal five. Bearing in mind that Dubai&apos;s palatial terminal 3, exclusively for the state&apos;s own Emirates airline, is already the largest around \u2013 at 1,713,000 square metres, it has the second largest floor area of any building on the planet \u2013 Heathrow does start to feel a little, well, regional. &quot;Dubai really is in a sweet spot as far as global travel goes,&quot; says Jim Krane, Gulf specialist at Rice University&apos;s Baker Institute and author of Dubai: The story of the world&apos;s fastest city. &quot;While Heathrow is a break between North America and Europe, Dubai sits in between the far bigger population centres of Asia; anyone flying West from Asia will fly over the Persian gulf.

It is not democracy Tandon objects to, but the fact that India&apos;s massive election, staggered over six weeks in April and May, has forced the first 20 games of his beloved Indian Premier League (IPL) \u2013 the most watched Twenty20 tournament in the world \u2013 to be played abroad, in the United Arab Emirates. &quot;We always go to Eden Gardens to watch the Kolkata Knight Riders. I love the atmosphere. &quot;I love everyone screaming and shouting and I love how everyone paints each other like the Indian flag,&quot; said Tandon. &quot;I look forward to it all year and this year I&apos;m really sad.&quot; India&apos;s general election begins on Monday and ends on 12 May, with counting taking place four days later. More than 800 million people are eligible to vote at 930,000 polling booths over nine days to elect a 543-seat lower house of parliament, the Lok Sabha. Close to four million staff will be deployed during the election to ensure fair and safe voting in a country where the terrain makes it impossible to conduct the polls on a single day. The number of new voters alone, an estimated 120 million, is more than the total electorates of almost all other democracies. Security is also a major issue, with separatist violence affecting Kashmir, India&apos;s north-east and Maoist-hit areas in the centre of the country. As a result, the Indian home ministry and the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI) decided to hold the first 20 of the 60 IPL matches in the UAE, with games spread between stadiums in Sharjah, Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Security is also an issue for IPL matches, which are normally packed and rely not on private security firms but on local police to screen fans. The tournament is rapidly growing into one of cricket&apos;s major annual fixtures, a multibillion-dollar event with eight teams and a domestic television audience estimated at 100 million viewers. &quot;Basically, it&apos;s a comment on how underdeveloped the Indian sports industry is,&quot; said Debayan Sen, a sports commentator and broadcast consultant. &quot;It&apos;s still dependent on a lot of government clearances and support.&quot; Some commentators believe the UAE was a poor choice and that the Indian authorities should have chosen Sri Lanka or Bangladesh instead. &quot;The UAE is known to be an area where bookies are quite strong and there are a lot of illegal Indian bookmakers based there. Last year there were all these allegations of spot fixing,&quot; said Gaurav Kalra, senior editor with the cricket website espncricinfo. &quot;I think they should have considered the public perception a little more before staging games in Sharjah.&quot; But for Kalra and Sen, there are positive aspects to the matches being played abroad, namely that the UAE has a large south Asian population, so games will be reasonably well attended. Also, the time difference with India is small, so it will not affect televising matches. &quot;In the UAE, the pitches are also a bit different, so matches will be more interesting,&quot; said Vineet Kathuria, 44, a Delhi fan. Meanwhile, back at the Tollygunge Club, Tandon says it is little consolation that he will attend only four matches at Eden Gardens once the tournament returns to India on 2 May. &quot;Virat Kohli is my favourite player because he&apos;s really good,&quot; he manages before passing the phone to his father and shouting, &quot;India got a wicket!&quot; Rishi Tandon would no doubt agree with some Indian supporters on social media who have suggested that their leaders get their priorities straight and hold part of the Indian general election abroad instead.", "title": "It's just not cricket: Indian Premier League bowled out by election", "sentences": ["As a result, the Indian home ministry and the Board of Cricket Control in India (BCCI) decided to hold the first 20 of the 60 IPL matches in the UAE, with games spread between stadiums in Sharjah, Dubai and Abu Dhabi."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-04T16:28:45Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/law/2014/apr/04/ketan-somaia-fraud-trial-opens-old-bailey", "tags": ["Law", "Business", "Investing", "Financial sector"], "article": "London businessman Ketan Somaia, whose interests once included banks and luxury hotels, was described as a &quot;confidence trickster on a grand scale&quot; in a $23m fraud trial. Opening the trial, the prosecution claimed Somaia had seduced three victims into making huge unsecured loans by persuading them that he was a successful financier with a personal fortune of $100m and control of assets worth $500m. He claimed to be close to the billionaire Hinduja brothers, and flaunted his wealth with private jets, offices in Mayfair, all expenses paid trips to Dubai, Kenya and South Africa, and a palatial home in the exclusive north London suburb of Hadley Wood. Somaia, who denies all charges, is accused of 11 counts of obtaining money by deception in a criminal prosecution at the Old Bailey. &quot;Mr Ketan Somaia was what is sometimes called a confidence trickster,but on a grand scale,&quot; said William Boyce QC, opening the prosecution. His lavish lifestyle was being paid for by people whose money was &quot;taken and not given back&quot;, in a &quot;systematic series of frauds&quot;. In less than a year, Somaia allegedly took $23m \u2013 about \u00a314m at historic exchange rates \u2013 from a single victim, another businessman called Murli Mirchandani, whom he promised to make his investment partner. With ventures manufacturing and exporting to Africa, Mirchandani had built up a considerable personal fortune of his own and was not a gullible target, but described an experienced entrepreneur who came to trust Somaia. The two men had met in November 1998, and Boyce said Somaia &quot;wooed&quot; Mirchandani over the coming months, meeting him at a wedding in Dubai, inviting him to a series of dinners at Annabel&apos;s nightclub in London and eventually on a trip to visit his offices in the Middle East and Africa. The two men had nicknames for each other, with Mirchandani referring to Somaia as &quot;Ketanbhai&quot;, using a suffix which indicates trust and brotherhood. Somaia was said to have used his ownership of five subsidiaries of Delphis bank, which he had bought from the remnants of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, to give the impression of financial credibility. Shortly after his transactions with Mirchandani, in May 2001, Somaia was replaced as chairman of one of the subsidiaries, Delphis Bank Mauritius, and the company&apos;s banking licence was revoked in 2002. In a series of loans, as part of a relationship said to have been based on verbal promises rather than written contracts, Mirchandani claims to have handed over millions of dollars to take stakes in the bank and other operations of Somaia&apos;s. He handed over $7.5m in June 1999, on the promise of a 10% stake in Delphis Bank Mauritius. The following month, seduced by the prospect of sky high returns, Mirchandani claims to have transferred a further $2.5m for a stake in another subsidiary of Somaia&apos;s Dolphin Group, called Driscoll. In August, he invested $2.8m on the promise of a 50% stake in the Diamond Mining Corporation of Liberia, whose value he thought would treble in nine months. In September, he handed over $3m to purchase a bank in Tanzania. Somaia claimed not to need to the money, but said he preferred personal loans because bank lending rates in Africa were very high. In the transactions, he offered interest rates of as much as 18%. Mirchandani was &quot;completely hooked&quot; by Somaia, the prosecution claimed, and wrote to him offering to be his junior partner, asking permission to refer to him as &quot;the general or the commander in chief&quot;. &quot;Meanwhile his partner was stabbing him in the back,&quot; said Boyce. The transactions continued until May 2000, when Mirchandani agreed to a final payment of $1m. Aside from several payments for interest, Boyce claimed &quot;not a penny of the 23m capital advanced to Mr Somaia has ever been repaid&quot;. The second victim was London-based Dilip Shah, who had been enticed into lending \u00a3200,000 after attending a group presentation of Somaia&apos;s businesses at his Hadley Wood mansion. Shah&apos;s transfer was made in August 2000, by which time Mirchandani had realised he was not going to get his money back. Shah says he was not repaid but his wife, it was claimed, did succeed in reclaiming several thousand pounds from Somaia after confronting him publicly at a party, at which point a chauffeur was dispatched to withdraw cash for her. The prosecution also outlined claims made by Dubai businessman Surajit Sen that he was owed several million by Somaia following transactions dating back to 1997. The prosecution claimed in total a sum of $25m had been obtained from the three men. &quot;He is a very clever conman&quot; claimed Boyce. &quot;In the community and background from which they come one sets great store by something that is evaporating elsewhere: my word is my bond. For these men a concept which meant a great deal to them. He knew that and he played upon it.&quot; Somaia denies all charges.

The Foreign Office diplomats also observe that Ali displayed an apparent fear of the Dubai police officers, noting that while they were in the cell he did not make complaints against them but &quot;looked at the officers when saying this, and had tears in his eyes&quot;. The UAE is known for its hardline approach to narcotics and alcohol. A 33-year-old British man appeared in court in Dubai last week accused of getting drunk and running naked through a building on the Palm Jumeirah. Clare Algar of legal charity Reprieve, which is representing the two men, said: &quot;Police torture is out of control in the UAE. Dubai and its fellow emirates have persistently refused to carry out independent investigations into these abuses, and seem content to let their police continue beating and threatening people into signing bogus &apos;confessions&apos;.&quot; Three British men were jailed last year for drug offences in Dubai. They were subsequently pardoned after also claiming that they had been tortured by police following their arrest while on holiday in the Gulf state in July 2012. The men said they were given electric shocks and had guns held to their heads during a seven-month period in which they were held without trial. Their lawyers also claimed they were forced at gunpoint to sign documents written in Arabic, which none of them understood. The men&apos;s allegations of torture \u2013denied by the Emirati police \u2013 were raised by David Cameron. Among the recently released documents is a report from a British torture expert that chronicles the failings of the internal medical &quot;investigation&quot; carried out by the Dubai authorities into the health impacts of Ali&apos;s alleged mistreatment. Analysis of the UAE&apos;s investigation by a clinical psychologist, Dr Brock Chisholm, concludes that the report, which was designed to establish whether Ali had been tortured, &quot;does not meet the minimum expected standards&quot; according to the Istanbul Protocol, the international guidelines for the documentation of torture or ill treatment. Algar added: &quot;Despite an outcry last year over the torture of three British citizens, which saw David Cameron raising their case with the country&apos;s ruler, the same brutal practices have continued \u2013 Ali and Zeidan are just the latest in a long line of victims. The British government must make crystal clear that the situation is unacceptable, and ensure that both men are released without delay.&quot; Zeidan was studying at the Emirates Aviation College in Dubai when he was arrested on drugs charges four months ago in Sharjah, just over the border in UAE. The charges carry a potential death penalty and are broadly the equivalent of possession with intent to supply, despite the prosecution itself alleging that the Briton was in possession of less than one gram of cocaine. Zeidan alleges that he was beaten after his arrest and subsequently held incommunicado. He also says he was denied access to his family as well as legal or consular assistance for eight days. During his detention, his lawyers claim, Zeidan was forced to strip naked and was threatened with rape by officers. Ali, who was arrested in Dubai in May 2013, again for allegedly possessing cocaine, believes he was being framed. Figures released by the Foreign Office showed that many Britons have fallen foul of the UAE&apos;s tough drugs laws. The British embassy in Dubai helped 257 Britons who were arrested or detained on drugs charges in the last year. This represented almost half the embassy&apos;s case load. A study by Reprieve last year, based on interviews with prisoners in Dubai Central Jail, found that more than three-quarters claimed they had suffered physical abuse after their arrest. In addition, 85% said they had been forced to sign documents in a language they did not understand.

The two main contenders in the increasingly bitter battle to lead the world&apos;s biggest democracy intensified their campaigning \u2013 and their personal duel \u2013 before the first of 815\u2009million eligible voters head to the polls on Monday. One poll suggested that Narendra Modi, the controversial 63-year-old prime ministerial candidate of the Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), might come close to an outright majority. A second said the BJP would miss a majority by about 30 seats in the powerful 545-seat lower house. India has been ruled by coalition governments for decades and debate among analysts in Delhi now largely centres on the margin of the BJP victory, not on its likelihood. The polls showed support for Modi&apos;s rival, 43-year-old Rahul Gandhi, slipping. The ruling centre-left Congress party, which has ruled India for all but 13 years since it won independence from Britain in 1947, now appears to be facing its worst ever defeat.      Gandhi is the scion of the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty \u2013 one of the world&apos;s most famous political families. The former management consultant, who is widely criticised as distant and inexperienced, has seemed unable to counter his opponent&apos;s confident campaign. One Congress minister admitted last week that the party&apos;s aim was now &quot;stopping The Man&quot;, a reference to Modi. Vinod Mehta, a Delhi analyst and journalist, said that dynasties must deliver to thrive. &quot;These are bad days for the dynasty \u2026 The question now is what sort of prime minister will Modi be?&quot; he said. One of the most polarising politicians in India for years, Modi came from humble origins to win power in the western state of Gujarat before being projected onto the national stage. Critics see him as an extremist who, when chief minister in 2002, allegedly allowed or encouraged mobs to attack Muslims in towns across Gujarat after a lethal fire supposedly started by Muslims on a train full of Hindu pilgrims. Modi denied the allegations and investigators cleared him of any direct involvement in violence, but his reputation still concerns many. The former senior organiser of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, a nationalist and religious revivalist organisation, Modi is also accused of an authoritarian style of government at odds with India&apos;s tradition of political compromise and consensus-building. Others, including some of the most powerful industrialists in India, say Modi is an honest and decisive administrator who has introduced policies that have encouraged development in his state and could be reproduced elsewhere if he were prime minister. &quot;My gut feeling is that Modi is not a fool and realises the difference between governing Gujarat and governing India, and that if he tries to impose one man&apos;s rule on the whole country he won&apos;t last very long,&quot; said Mehta. Congress complained on Saturday to India&apos;s election commission about comments by Amit Shah, an associate of Modi, in the key battleground state of Uttar Pradesh (UP) which suffered sectarian violence last year. &quot;In Uttar Pradesh, especially western UP, it is an election for honour. It is an election to take revenge for the insult. It an election to teach a lesson to those who have committed injustice,&quot; Shah reportedly told community leaders. Congress accused him of &quot;creating animosity between communities&quot;. Election commission officials called for calm and moderation as the election moved into what one called its most &quot;active and aggressive&quot; phase. &quot;We are saying, please do not get too emotional, or do outbursts or conduct or behaviour that would not be appreciated by others,&quot; said Harishankar Brahma, one of three commissioners charged with overseeing the biggest democratic exercise in the world. Over the coming six weeks, the commission will arrange voting at 930,000 polling stations. The election takes place in nine separate phases to allow the redeployment of more than five million police officers. A big cricket tournament has been shifted to Dubai because it would have stretched policing resources, Brahma said. On Monday constituencies in the restive north-east of the country will vote. Later in the week, tens of millions more will go to the polls in tense areas hit by leftwing violence. The voting is due to be completed by 12 May with the result announced four days later. Congress, in power since 2004, has been hit by faltering growth, a failure to control inflation \u2013 particularly of basic foodstuffs \u2013 and corruption scandals. Massive subsidies and a Right to Food Act do not appear to have convinced voters. Ministers say that they have failed to communicate &quot;substantial achievements&quot;. The BJP manifesto will be released on Monday after a delay that some analysts believe has been caused by internal dissent over the nature and pace of economic reforms to be implemented if the party wins power. Senior officials have indicated that job creation would be a priority. But Gandhi on Saturday said the BJP&apos;s vision of &quot;India shining&quot; implied economic growth benefiting only a tiny elite. &quot;An India where five, 10, 15 business people have everything, an India where prosperity is limited to a few people. Only Congress brings prosperity and industry together,&quot; he told a rally in Kerala state. Modi is fighting in two seats, including the holy city of Varanasi. There he will confront Arvind Kejriwal, of the new Aam Admi (Common Man or AAP) party. The AAP manifesto, released last week, promised tough action against graft, a citizen&apos;s charter to punish slow or incompetent officials, radical devolution of power to village level and wide-ranging reform of the police. Some analysts have said the AAP fills a space previously filled by the Communists, now reduced to a minor role in Indian politics and likely to emerge with about 20 seats. Surjit Bhalla, an economist, wrote of &quot;the impending demise of the left&quot; in the Indian Express. One key question is whether the BJP has made inroads among India&apos;s 150 million Muslims. On Friday a senior cleric in Delhi came out in support of Congress, saying the party would strengthen the country&apos;s tradition of secularism and describing communalism as a &quot;bigger threat&quot; to the country than corruption. &quot;We have complaints against Congress, but that doesn&apos;t mean we will vote for people who want to divide the country,&quot; said Syed Ahmed Bukhari, the imam of the vast Jama Masjid in Delhi&apos;s old city. Support from Muslims elsewhere, particularly in Uttar Pradesh, which sends 80 representatives elected by 130m eligible voters, or West Bengal, is critical for Congress and regional parties. For the first time, a &quot;none of the above&quot; option has been included on ballot papers.", "title": "Rahul Gandhi faces poll disaster as India is set for historic vote", "sentences": ["A big cricket tournament has been shifted to Dubai because it would have stretched policing resources, Brahma said."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-05T20:14:15Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/teacher-network/teacher-blog/2014/apr/06/buildings-construction-skyline-teaching-lesson-resources", "tags": ["Teacher Network", "Education", "Teaching tips", "Teaching", "Science", "Geography and environment studies"], "article": "In 1931 the Empire State Building in New York became the world&apos;s tallest building.

Children climb trees in its dusty main square to shake down the hard green Indian plums. There is little to distinguish it from the other 600,000 or so villages in India apart from the fact that it lies in Amethi, a district in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh that has been the bastion of India&apos;s foremost political dynasty for generations. The fortunes of Ikror&apos;s 400 families \u2013 and most of their 1.2 billion compatriots \u2013 are deeply entwined with those of the descendants of Jawaharlal Nehru, the country&apos;s first prime minister and architect of modern India. As voting begins on Monday in India&apos;s general election \u2013 the world&apos;s biggest exercise in democracy \u2013 this is truer than ever. Since 2004, the member of parliament representing Ikror has been Rahul Gandhi \u2013 Nehru&apos;s great-grandson and the sole face of the venerable Congress party&apos;s campaign. &quot;The Gandhis, Congress \u2013 the same thing, two sides of the same coin,&quot; says Maqsud Ahmed, who at 75 is the oldest man in the village. Since India gained its independence from Britain in 1947, when Ahmed was eight, the Congress party \u2013 and thus the Nehru-Gandhi dynasty \u2013 has dominated the country&apos;s politics. (There is no direct blood relation to Mahatma Gandhi, the independence leader.) But pollsters predict that in this election, the Congress party, which has been in power since 2004, will record its heaviest defeat. No one foresees the immediate extinction of the Gandhis as a political force. But great changes are sweeping this country and one of the world&apos;s most successful political dynasties may well be a long-term victim. From Delhi, the easiest way to reach Ikror is to fly to Lucknow, the state capital, on one of the private airlines that have thrived in India since a wave of economic reforms in the early 1990s dismantled a quasi-socialist, centrally planned state Though still cheap, India&apos;s famous trains have been hit by decades of poor management and underinvestment, and even the fastest express between the two cities takes more than six hours to cover just 500km.     Supporters show their support for Rahul Gandhi in Delhi. Photograph: Chandan Khanna/AFP/Getty Images    Uttar Pradesh (UP) has a population of 180 million and its socio-economic indicators are on a par with sub-Saharan Africa. Lucknow bears the scars of successive local rulers. There is the battered residency of the British and the hugely expensive monuments built by the former chief minister Mayawati Kumari. Its fabled old city, once the pride of the nawabs of Awadh, is slowly crumbling. But there is a gleaming new airport terminal and, as in every Indian metropolis, skeletal frames of apartment blocks destined for the new middle class rise in haphazard ranks on its ragged outskirts. Such properties, particularly in lawless UP, are often bought for cash, no questions asked. &quot;There is the law, and then there is UP. This is the wild west of India,&quot; says a local hotelier. From Lucknow, the road to Amethi leads through a belt of new, private further education institutions, where the quality of the cement matches that of the teaching, and on into the countryside. This is the heartland of the northern plains, baking hot in summer, watered by the now-polluted Ganges and Yamuna rivers. It was the cradle of India&apos;s independence struggle. Amethi and neighbouring constituency Rae Bareli have been represented almost without break by the Gandhi dynasty since Feroze Gandhi \u2013 husband of Indira, Nehru&apos;s daughter, who served four terms as prime minister \u2013 won a seat in Rae Bareli in 1951 during India&apos;s first democratic parliamentary election. At Jagdishpur, a small industrial town just inside Amethi, a branch in the narrow road, choked until now with trucks, buses and tractors, takes you into the fields. There is no more traffic. The road forks repeatedly until, now a half-gravel country lane, it reaches Ikror. This rural scene \u2013 with its fishermen, glossy black oxen and schoolchildren on bicycles \u2013 appears both unchanging and bucolic. In fact, it is neither. Life here, as across India, is tough and closely tied to global dynamics. Half the villagers are Muslim, and many families have at least one son working in the Gulf. Cash sent home by the millions of workers overseas earned India $71bn last year and Ikror&apos;s relative prosperity is in part founded on these repatriated petro-dollars. The large and recently renovated mosque, almost as austere as its Gulf counterparts, silently testifies to how, as India&apos;s economy has faltered in recent years, the rupee has weakened significantly, boosting the value of remittances. With so few jobs created even in India&apos;s boom years, despite the 12 million or so new seekers each year, such employment is hugely important. &quot;God has been kind to us,&quot; says Faradullah Khan, a farmer. &quot;But why should our boys have to go to Dubai to find work?&quot; Making up 12%-14% of the total Indian population and long among the most marginalised, India&apos;s Muslims have been one of the most loyal constituencies of the Congress party. No more, says Ahmadullah Khan. &quot;We have been supporters of the [Gandhi] family for decades. But now we have to think twice.&quot; Of the 200 non-Muslim families in Ikror, 150 are Hindu and from what are called &quot;other backward castes&quot;, low down on the social hierarchy that still defines status in much of rural India, but higher than some. Many have land, if only small plots after generations of division among sons. They also have aspirations. Vijay Maurya wants to set up a business, though he says he will have to find a job first to raise some capital. Many of his peers hope to move to India&apos;s cities: to Lucknow, which already has a population of 2.2 million, or Delhi, with 15 million inhabitants. But Maurya, 23, wants to stay at home. &quot;I want to bring something the village doesn&apos;t have, to do some good,&quot; he says. In recent years, there has been some improvement, albeit from a low base. Ikror has new paving and cement drains, courtesy of its representative in the state assembly. Electricity supply is marginally better, though now, in election season, when authorities direct power supplies to court voters in important constituencies, the village&apos;s televisions, pumps and fans stay on for the whole day. Only half the villagers now lack toilets at home, using the fields instead. Lakshmi, a local social worker who rehabilitates juvenile offenders under a national scheme, says crime is too high, particularly among teenagers. There is a primary school in the village but the teacher, who she says is poorly trained and often absent, &quot;doesn&apos;t teach anything&quot;. These are perennial problems, and grievances, of rural India. Yet the response to them is no longer quite as fatalistic as it once was. At least half the villagers of Ikror are under 30 and have grown up bombarded by consumerist advertising and the slogans of a new, booming, shining India. In 1981, when Rajiv Gandhi, Rahul&apos;s father, first won this seat, only 33% of people in Uttar Pradesh were literate. Now 68% are. In the evening, the villagers watch the immensely popular soaps on entertainment and lifestyle channels such as Colors or the febrile news channels in which politicians \u2013 though not the Gandhis \u2013 are hectored and harassed by angry anchors. The result is a wave of discontent directed at those who have represented them over the decades. Sharat Pradhan, a veteran Lucknow-based reporter who has been covering politics in the region since Rajiv Gandhi&apos;s earliest campaigns in Amethi, said: &quot;Nobody openly criticised &apos;the Family&apos; like this before. There was some sign of this at the [2009] elections but not on this scale. This is completely new. There is this sense of empowerment. It&apos;s astonishing.&quot; Such feelings are widespread. Across India, there is an accelerating breakdown in traditional deference towards those who have long assumed unthinking allegiance. &quot;There is no question that, as an India-wide phenomenon, there is a growing questioning of the vertical hierarchies of social relations that have resisted for decades,&quot; said Milan Vaishnav, a specialist on India&apos;s political economy at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. Causing some consternation locally is the new Aam Aadmi (common man) party, which is challenging many of the fundamental principles of Indian politics. Its candidate, Kumar Vishwas, has spent weeks standing in dusty village squares, including Ikror&apos;s, giving speeches to a few dozen farmers. &quot;This is my personal battle against dynasty in politics. It should be about talent, not your father&apos;s name. Rahul Gandhi&apos;s ambition to be prime minister is an insult to the 64% of the population who are under 35 and who don&apos;t have a famous father,&quot; said Vishwas, a literary professor and poet. Yet in surveys, nearly half of voters still express a preference for candidates who come from a political family or dynasty, and the most acute grievance of the people of Ikror is not Rahul Gandhi&apos;s assumption that he should be their representative, or the lack of local development, but that he is inaccessible \u2013 a complaint that would have been familiar to the Mughal emperors.     Indian farm workers in front of a billboard showing Bharatiya Janata party prime ministerial candidate Narendra Modi. Photograph: Rajesh Kumar Singh/AP    Nor do many in Amethi think the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), led by the controversial Narendra Modi, will do more than dent Rahul Gandhi&apos;s massive majority. The BJP started campaigning late in Amethi, finally appointing a former TV star turned politician as its candidate. But even in the scruffy, scattered small towns around the district where support for the party appears strongest, most people will, despite their disappointment, vote for the Gandhis. In India, few see the point of casting a vote for losers. The goal for most communities in any electoral exercise is to be on the winning side and thus better placed to benefit from the winner&apos;s largesse. Modi&apos;s actions worry Muslims and the AAP is seen as untested. &quot;There is no campaign here as such,&quot; says Ashok Tiwari, who heads the Congress office in the small town of Gauriganj, a party stronghold not far from Ikror. &quot;We simply need to ensure the voters reach the polling booths on election day. That&apos;s it.&quot; Down a narrow path from the main village of Ikror is the basti (district) occupied by people from the Dalit caste. While the caste system is eroding in India&apos;s cities, it is alive and well in its villages. In these lanes, where there are no new drains, live those at the very bottom of the social pile. Thin children play with household utensils amid the flies. None attend the village school. Like Muslims, the Dalits, who face daily systematic discrimination, have historically been the most steadfast supporters of Congress, even if in Uttar Pradesh many have switched their allegiance to a local party. The outgoing Congress-led coalition government launched huge subsidised work and food distribution programmes to help them achieve the escape velocity, as Rahul Gandhi called it, needed to break out of a cycle of poverty. But even here, few have much that is good to say about the man who represents them. &quot;If Rahul Gandhi says he is a friend of Dalits, tell him to come and see how we live. Politicians just make promises at election time and then vanish,&quot; said Kailash, who ekes a living for his family by selling fish caught in local streams. His neighbour Kaushilya says her children eat two thin meals of vegetables, rice and lentils a day \u2013 when things are good. In most elections, she said, people &quot;just vote the way everyone else does&quot;, though this time they &quot;perhaps won&apos;t vote at all&quot;. Her comments upset Vijay Maurya, the young aspiring businessman who lives 100 metres away in the main village. &quot;It is important to vote, because that is how you have power,&quot; he says, earnestly. &quot;We have faith in democracy.&quot;", "title": "India elections: domination of Nehru-Gandhi dynasty under threat", "sentences": ["&quot;But why should our boys have to go to Dubai to find work?&quot; Making up 12%-14% of the total Indian population and long among the most marginalised, India&apos;s Muslims have been one of the most loyal constituencies of the Congress party."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-07T02:00:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/apr/07/tahrir-square-emaar-square-cairo-private-road-city", "tags": ["Cities", "Egypt", "World news"], "article": "In mid-February, the developer behind the world\u2019s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, signed a deal with the Egyptian defence ministry.

The defence ministry, which owns the massive tract of land where Uptown Cairo will be built, is Egypt\u2019s largest landowner and manager. In 1997, a presidential decree gave the military the right to manage all undeveloped non-agricultural land \u2013 87% of the country, by one estimate. In the city of Cairo, this translates to massive, walled plots of land in lucrative locations, monitored from watchtowers. Signs forbid photography and identify them as military zones, but no military activity takes place here. They are vacant, awaiting their turn to be transformed into hotels, housing for military officers or upmarket malls. Emaar Square is the latest and biggest of these military-secured developments. A private road will link it to Cairo\u2019s road network, likely requiring the \u201ccleansing\u201d of the poor homeowners in the Jabal al-Ahmar area.

So how did we get from Tahrir Square to Emaar Square?     The Tahrir Square protests showed how an everyday space can become a site of revolution and transformation. Photograph: Gianluigi Guercia/AFP/Getty Images    The Egyptian revolt is not usually discussed as an urban struggle, one that not only takes place in cities but also seeks to undo the very mechanisms that have produced Egypt\u2019s uneven urban environment. The events of Tahrir Square were a protest against the extreme unevenness of development in Egypt, in which the state neglects the urban majority while providing concessions to Gulf investors and local entities linked directly to the military state apparatus. In the Mubarak years, the state and its business cronies began a development plan called Cairo 2050. This would have led to the mass eviction of thousands of families, in order to transform the city into pockets of high-end residential development, golf courses and shopping centres. Much of the investment was to come from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Egypt&apos;s former regime was intent on the \u201cDubai-sation\u201d of Cairo.  The revolution caused an unwanted turn: the Muslim Brotherhood was backed by Qatar rather than Saudi, Kuwait and UAE. But since the military re-took control in July last year, the battle over Egypt\u2019s economy has tilted in favour of the old regime and its supporters, and the old Cairo 2050 projects are back on track, including the Maspero Triangle and Uptown Cairo. Those who celebrate Dubai&apos;s urban model and wish for its expansion across the region make the unethical choice of ignoring the fact that the Gulf cities emerge out of a very specific relation between political power and capital: namely, that they are usually one and the same. The expansion of this model into cities such as Cairo, where the military has unchallenged access both to politics and capital (land, resources, construction), would have a disastrous impact on the urban majority \u2013 who will be marginalised, moved out of the way when necessary and put to work under unacceptable conditions, with no power to mobilise and with little pay. So why is this interesting? First, when the military, the biggest land owner and free from civilian oversight, makes a direct deal with a developer to build an exclusive and gated community in the heart of the capital, this is not a free market. It may be framed by the government as part of \u201cbuilding Egypt\u201d and attracting investment, but it merely creates more opportunity for buyers to be locked into gated developments with no access to democratic municipal management: the residents of Emaar Square won\u2019t pressure the government for services, they will deal with the company instead. (Such deals also give the growing \u201crepublic of retired generals\u201d cushy jobs.) Second, this is not a democracy, and certainly not revolutionary. The Emaar Square deal included the ministries of housing, local development, investment and the Cairo authorities. This co-operation is what will allow Emaar to build its private road. And yet these state institutions are failing to solve Egypt\u2019s mounting urban problems, many of which are directly caused by the lack of accountability and the incompetence of these very institutions. Since the 1970s, the state has fallen short of providing services, of creating effective systems of urban management, and of producing expansion plans that allow local private capital to grow while protecting the sanctity of the common \u2013 the public sphere, and its manifestation in shared public spaces. Instead, the institutions of the state came together to sign a deal for a private highway to a private city.     Emaar Square will be an exclusive housing-golf-mall complex, funded with Gulf money. Three years after Tahrir Square, it is business as usual    The protests that began in 2011 showed how cities are stages for a struggle not only to shape urban space but also to create new forms of democratic representation. They shed light on how everyday spaces can become sites of resistance, revolution and transformation. This struggle is directly linked to the way power and capital have produced socially and economically unjust urban experiences. In Egypt, the military bear weapons in civilian spaces and have direct access to capital and assets (such as land and building materials) that directly shape cities and their development. This means that if people stand in the way of military bulldozers coming to remove their \u201cillegal\u201d homes or huts, those residents risk being tried in military court for obstruction. For the majority of Egyptians, cities have lost their vital role as places of economic possibility. Land is just one of many commodities monopolised by the military. There are also contracts worth billions of dollars of state money going directly to military contractors without a proper bidding process \u2013 from highway construction to slum clearance to redevelopment.  The recent $40bn partnership with the UAE\u2019s Arabtec Construction to build one million low-income housing units on land controlled by the military is just the latest example of how a small cabal shapes the urban environment. Companies associated with former or current military generals are part of a network that produces the essential building materials (chiefly cement and brick) used for everything from luxury condos in gated communities to new residential buildings that expand unilaterally into agricultural land. The spatial confrontations, often violent, in Egyptian squares between protesters and conscripts are in many ways vivid illustrations of Egypt\u2019s struggle over its politics, economy and space \u2013 in other words, a struggle towards a more even urban development. After the Egyptian government suddenly resigned last month, the former housing minister Ibrahim Mehlib was named premier; he appointed Mostafa Madbouly, a leading figure in the Cairo 2050 vision, to replace him. Will these experts in housing and urban development serve the interests of the majority of Egyptians living in cities? Or will they continue to serve the interests of a particular network of political and financial power? Emaar Square is all the indication you need. \u2022 Mohamed Elshahed is a Cairo-based scholar completing his PhD with the Middle East department of NYU.

On Tuesday 1 April, news circulated in Italy that a Dubai sheikh had a job opening \u2013 in fact, he had 60 of them. The candidate requirements? Applicants must be female, attractive, stylish, aged (or at least look) between 18 and 28, from the province of Venice, able to speak English (French and\u00a0Arabic a bonus) and, most importantly, possess supremely sharp shopping skills. In return they would be offered \u20ac100 (\u00a383) a day and the opportunity to join the sheikh on a visit to Europe, where they would attend various high-end dinners and events, stay\u00a0in luxury accommodation and fly &quot;by private jet only&quot; between Madrid, Paris, London, Stockholm, Ibiza, Milan and Venice. The role itself? To assist his numerous wives and daughters with their shopping. Mauro Belcaro, owner of Italian fashion company Rosy Garbo and casting agency Padua DOC, is in charge of recruitment. He quickly confirms the ad&apos;s legitimacy. &quot;I\u00a0got a call from an agency in Dubai because we regularly cast fashion models and other roles in the industry,&quot; he says. They wanted Italian women because of &quot;their strong taste in fashion&quot;. Now 100 women have thrown their (oh-so-on-trend) hats into the ring. Sixty went under the casting directors&apos; scrutiny last week: only &quot;one or two&quot; made the grade. The\u00a0selection process is stringent. The hopefuls must face a panel consisting of an image consultant, a personal shopper and a lawyer (&quot;to keep the process transparent and ensure the contracts they sign with the sheikh are 100% accurate&quot;). &quot;Beauty is the least important criteria here,&quot; says Belcaro. &quot;Image consultancy experience and intelligence are more crucial.&quot; On Friday, one applicant apparently answered &quot;bread&quot; when asked what the word &quot;baguette&quot; conjured in her mind. The answer should have been the\u00a0famed Fendi bag of the same name. Other questions the women have so far been faced with include: &quot;What are the big makeup trends of 2014?&quot; and &quot;Which designer labels best suit a woman in her 50s?&quot; When I ask Belcaro if the women&apos;s marital status is relevant, he laughs. &quot;This is not a harem we are building! It is more like a family vacation; many of the sheikh&apos;s children will be there. The ladies&apos; responsibility is to ensure they are dressed correctly for the social events they attend.&quot; And what if the Italian employees also lack suitable attire? &quot;They may buy clothes too.&quot; Like all good things, the role is rather short-lived: the &quot;shopping shifts&quot; last 15 days, after which 10 new women are installed. On the plus side, Belcaro is in desperate need of English speakers, as this is the language the Emirati women use. &quot;If there are any interested English women living in Italy, or who have lived here before for a year or so, please tell them to apply,&quot; he says. \u2022 This article was amended on 8 April 2014 and the footnote updated on 10 April 2014.

Charlie Appleby, the trainer who took over from Mahmood al-Zarooni at Godolphin&apos;s Moulton Paddocks stable in Newmarket following his predecessor&apos;s banning from the sport for eight years, was speaking on Tuesday at the launch of the 2014 Qipco British Champions Series. There was some disquiet within the sport after Godolphin announced that a number of horses, including the high-class filly Certify and St Leger winner Encke, would return to the track after they were prevented from racing for six months in the wake of the steroids disclosure. The pair are sure to command plenty of attention on their first outings in Britain, at the most important Flat meeting in the racing calendar. Appleby said Certify, who returns to his yard from a winter campaign in Dubai this week, will definitely race next in the Duke of Cambridge Stakes at the royal meeting while Encke will have his first run of the year in the Hardwicke Stakes at the same fixture provided there is sufficient cut in the ground at the June summer highlight. Certify was a leading 1,000 Guineas candidate last year before she was one of 11 horses who tested positive at Moulton Paddocks for a banned anabolic steroid when a testing team from the British Horseracing Authority took samples from 45 horses at the stable last April. She won her comeback race at the Dubai Carnival with ease before disappointing in the Group Two Blanchine at Meydan in February but Appleby believes she has a valid excuse for her flop as she showed signs of being in season after finishing a tame fourth when odds-on favourite. &quot;She showed an unwillingness behind the stalls that night,&quot; said Appelby on Tuesday, &quot;and she had not shown us anything like that before. She seemed fine in all other respects afterwards and there was no explanation other than showing signs of being in season. &quot;The plan was always to come back to Europe win, lose or draw. She arrives back in the UK this week and the Duke of Cambridge at Royal Ascot is the target. She showed all the signs of retaining her ability until she ran in the Balanchine.&quot; Appleby confirmed that Encke, who also tested positive when the British Horseracing Authority took samples from the rest of the yard, would have a late-season campaign and had been working well in Dubai, where he spent the winter. &quot;The Hardwicke at Royal Ascot looks a suitable starting point provided there is enough cut in the ground.&quot; The Newmarket trainer is also planning to run a pair of 1,000 Guineas contenders in next Wednesday&apos;s Lanwades Stud Nell Gwyn Stakes at Newmarket. &quot;A couple could head to the Nell Gwyn,&quot; he added. &quot;Majeyda is a two-time Listed winner who ran behind Ihtimal in the May Hill.

The event, worth \u00a3250,000, will have a maximum field of 30 and will be open to horses that have finished in the first six in 18 nominated qualifier races that take place throughout the season, including the Bunbury Cup at Newmarket&apos;s July meeting, three races at Royal Ascot and the Betfair International at Ascot. The race is a welcome addition to the meeting and will be of much more interest to punters than the apprentice handicap it replaces.

While the Ethiopian legend Haile Gebrselassie will take six elite athletes to the 13.1 mile mark at close to world record pace, Farah has chosen to go with a slower, as yet unnamed, pacemaker who will take him and six others through halfway at 62min 15sec \u2013 30 seconds behind. The decision is understood to have been taken by Farah&apos;s coach, Alberto Salazar, who believes that a steadier start will give the Londoner the best chance of victory. Assuming he maintains that pace, Farah would finish in around 2hr 04min 30sec \u2013 a time that would smash Steve Jones&apos; British record of 2:07.13 by nearly three minutes. Farah&apos;s plan was confirmed by Dave Bedford, London Marathon&apos;s head of international relations, who told the Guardian: &quot;We ask the athletes what they want. We then come up with bands where we can put pacemakers. Mo is running 62.15min.&quot; But Bedford denied suggestions that Farah had requested his own pacemaker. &quot;None of the pacemakers have been asked for by Mo or put there by Mo,&quot; he said. &quot;We have never done that. And in reality, the small gap between the two groups means they may come together. But nonetheless, that is what we have been asked to do.&quot; The decision may prove very smart. Last year the leading men came through halfway in 61min 34sec \u2013 and while Farah bailed out at that stage, the field went from world record pace at 20 miles to blowing up. The Ethiopian Tsegaye Kebede picked off his rivals to win in 2:06.04, but even his time for the second half of the race was almost three minutes slower than the first. However, Bedford believes it would be &quot;daft&quot; for Farah to base his plans solely on last year&apos;s race. &quot;They were on world record pace with six miles to go, then the wind turned,&quot; he said. &quot;If that wind hadn&apos;t come up I don&apos;t believe Kebede would have won it.&quot; Gebrselassie was sanguine when asked about Farah&apos;s decision to ignore his pacemaking. &quot;Ah, as he likes,&quot; he said. &quot;For me it doesn&apos;t matter. I&apos;m telling you, I just keep what&apos;s important for the athlete. I don&apos;t want to bring them very fast, not too slow. I just want to keep them at a steady pace.&quot; Steady is not the way most people would describe it. Gebrselassie says he will run 58 minutes for the first 20km (12.4 miles). That is seriously quick \u2013 20 seconds faster, in fact, than at the same stage during Wilson Kipsang&apos;s world marathon record of 2:03.23 in Berlin last year. But as Gebrselassie is prepared to concede, Farah&apos;s strategy to play the waiting game could prove to be a prudent one.&quot;At the beginning Farah has to be patient and just wait,&quot; he said. &quot;When I ran my first marathon, at the beginning, at 10 or 15 kilometres, my body was saying to me: &apos;Why is this so slow? I have to go faster&apos;. But the price is paid after 35 kilometres. After 35km the body starts to react. That&apos;s the hard part. Any marathon race always starts after 30km.&quot; Yet while Farah is making his first attempt at 26.2 miles, Gebrselassie believes that he is a major contender in Sunday&apos;s race, which he believes is &quot;the best marathon ever&quot;. &quot;I&apos;ve never seen such big names in one race, both men and women,&quot; he said. &quot;According to what I&apos;ve heard about his preparations, the east Africans are facing a big challenge from Mo. Look at what happened last week with Kenenisa Bekele winning in Paris. Athletes like Mo and Kenenisa, who come from the track, are used to speed. Two minutes, 55 seconds for each kilometre is not difficult. Athletes like Mo and Kenenisa are used to running 2.20 or 2.30 per kilometre, so for them to run 2.55 is just jogging. If they allow Farah to be with them for the last five kilometres, he can win easily. His kick is so amazing.&quot; However, Farah&apos;s rivals are not overly concerned, despite Gebrselassie&apos;s warning. Most say they don&apos;t fear him. The 18-year-old Ethiopian Tsegaye Mekonnen, who ran 2:04.32 in Dubai in January, went further by saying he did not expect Farah to win. Asked to explain his view, Mekonnen said: &quot;Farah&apos;s best time for the half-marathon is just over 60 minutes. Others in the field have run around 59 minutes. He can make it in the marathon if he has prepared properly, but he is mainly a middle-distance runner.&quot; Meanwhile Kebede, who has won this race twice, displayed the easy confidence of a champion. &quot;I am in shape,&quot; he claimed. &quot;There is no way I am not winning again.&quot;", "title": "Mo Farah won't go with early pace at London marathon", "sentences": ["The 18-year-old Ethiopian Tsegaye Mekonnen, who ran 2:04.32 in Dubai in January, went further by saying he did not expect Farah to win."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-09T21:24:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/apr/10/best-independent-travel-magazines", "tags": ["Travel websites", "Travel", "Magazines", "Media", "Travel writing", "Books"], "article": "Renegade What&apos;s the concept?Renegade sets out to give an honest impression of the world, to inspire people to travel, of course, but also to go back to the reason we travel in the first place \u2013 to attempt to understand a place by seeing it first hand.

John Summerton The American Guide     Southern Extreme Bullriding in Abingdon, Virginia, as featured in The American Guide    What&apos;s the concept?Before The American Guide, there was The American Guide Series \u2013 an Encyclopedia Americana of tour books and pamphlets published on every state during the Great Depression era of the 1930s and early 1940s. It was a public works project paid for by the US government in which out-of-work artists, writers, photographers and editors across the country were put to work in their hometowns and states to create America&apos;s first great self-portrait. Today, The American Guide is a revival of this unique spirit of service to document the country. The goal is to make a state-by-state record of America, documenting people and places, both pretty and hard. What motivated you to make it?Six years ago we came across a copy of one of the original American Guide series books still in print and used it to explore modern-day New York City. We read about feuding gangs in Chinatown, the Coney Island boardwalk, and an old sailors&apos; home on Staten Island. We loved that it was written, not by travel pros parachuting in to find the best hotel, but by New Yorkers who crawled the sidewalks talking to line cooks and kids playing stickball. It seemed like a missed opportunity that nothing similar existed in the present day. And with the astonishingly talented community of regional photographers and writers on Tumblr, we realized there was an opportunity to create a sort of crowdsourced, 21st-century version of the original series. Six years later, we almost have a complete set of the original American Guide series. Who works on it and what are their backgrounds?Tom McNamara and I are the creators and co-editors. We grew up in Minnesota and Florida respectively and both spent several years as producers and journalists at the Public Broadcasting Service. These days, we work at two different natural history museums. But as we said, the local guides are really what make The American Guide so special. There&apos;s an architect, a librarian, a skateboarder, a teacher, and a hotel maintenance man among their number. Tell us about the feature you&apos;re most proud ofFor the past two Novembers we&apos;ve hosted American Guide Week on Tumblr \u2014 a throwback to the original American Guide Week that took place in 1941. It&apos;s when we turn The American Guide over to our 165,000-strong Tumblr community and ask everybody to tag images and words about where they live. We then feature their dispatches on the site.  Can you recommend any other travel publications (print or online) that we should read?Drawn the Road Again is absolutely one of our favourites and features amazing illustrations, while Atlas Obscura is indispensable on our road trips. We also like This Belongs In a Museum, which features some cool spots we&apos;d probably never find on our own.Erin Chapman Boat       Photograph: Boat     What&apos;s the concept?Boat Magazine is a nomadic travel and culture magazine that focuses on a different city for each issue. We physically move our studio to the new city, bringing a few writers and photographers with us, and work with locals to find and tell the stories that don&apos;t normally make the news. Because we spend a few weeks in each city we work really hard to get under the skin of the place and talk more about the root of some of these issues, or at least another side to them. What motivated you to make it?Being American, and someone who&apos;s lived abroad and travelled all over the globe, I get frustrated with traditional coverage of the rest of the world. A lot of the time it seems to be recycled and usually focuses on stories where a catchy or shocking headline can be gleaned. You can&apos;t get to the bottom of another culture in 48 hours, so the coverage doesn&apos;t seem authentic to me. I know these places have incredible, inspiring stories and people that really deserve to make the news and so that&apos;s what Boat tries to do. Who works on it and what are their backgrounds?We keep the core team tiny and nimble so that our overheads stay low \u2013 it&apos;s the only way we can keep going. I edit the magazine and go to each city and our design team is based in London. Otherwise, the small team of contributors for each city is picked based on their work and specialty. We&apos;ve had Pulitzer Prize-winning writers, world-renowned photographers, illustrators, translators, poets, painters, filmmakers, even a musician came to Sarajevo with us to learn about the music and instruments in Bosnia. Tell us about the feature you&apos;re most proud of The feature I&apos;m always the most excited to get back is the introduction to each issue. We always ask a local, well-known writer to introduce their city. I can&apos;t pick a favourite as they&apos;ve all been amazing but some come quickly to mind. Nick Hornby&apos;s introduction to our London issue, without having read any of the other articles, perfectly summed up what all the other stories seemed positioned around: a city of incredible diversity and rapid, constant change and yet, still very much Charles Dickens&apos; city. Our next issue (Issue 7 \u2013 Lima, Peru) is introduced by Rafo Leon, a fantastic writer who is astoundingly knowledgeable about his city and country and very poetic in writing about it. Can you recommend any other travel publications (print or online) that we should read?The Travel Almanac and Zoetrop: All-Story which isn&apos;t strictly a travel magazine, but always has great stories and writing from around the world. VNA is a magazine about street art around the world and so naturally touches on the culture of the cities these artists work in.Erin Spens Jungles in Paris     An image from a photo-essay on the moto-taxi drivers of Yemen featured on Jungles in Paris    What&apos;s the concept?We&apos;re a travel website that goes for quality over quantity \u2013 we only release one new story every week, prioritising film-making and photography. We try to provide a genuine, albeit brief, immersion into a foreign place. We never spotlight a destination. Travel trends don&apos;t interest us. Instead, we take on &quot;micro-subjects&quot; in the categories of craft, culture, geography, and wildlife. When choosing subjects we gravitate towards things that are timeless. Or at least they seem so at first glance, for the reality is that many of these amazing places are in danger of disappearing as the world gets more crowded and connected. In celebrating them we hope to increase the chances they might somehow be safeguarded. Who works on it and what are their backgrounds?The founders are my brother Oliver Hartman and me. We both live in New York and collaborate on almost everything: but to break it down, I do more of the writing/editing/trip organising, while Oliver&apos;s focus is more on the technical and filmmaking side. What motivated you to make it?As a travel writer, I wanted to spend more time on subjects that had nothing to do with new five-star hotels, celebrity chefs, new cruise destinations, spa treatments, and the like. These topics seem to dominate travel writing nowadays. I enjoy them, but only up to a point. My brother has a film production company here in New York, which does commercial work. Both of us really enjoy what we do. But we also wanted to take the knowledge and expertise we&apos;d built up and apply it to something more exploratory and meaningful. Tell us about the feature you&apos;re most proud ofThe short film we shot with a boat-maker named Boniface in Zambia. These dugout canoes, called makoros, are a big part of life in parts of southern Africa, but you don&apos;t see them made out of wood that much anymore. It was the perfect Jungles subject \u2013 tradition, craft, local knowledge, these beautiful and mighty rivers \u2013 and Boniface was the perfect storyteller to help us capture it. Can you recommend any other travel publications (print or online) that we should read?Roads &amp; Kingdoms and Nowhere magazine (tablet-only) are two of our favorites.Darrell Hartman Yonder Journal     Black powder rifle shooting, Fort Bridger Rendezvous, Fort Bridger, Wyoming    What&apos;s the concept?Yonder Journal promotes the exploration of &quot;outsider&quot; America. We publish impressionistic guidebooks.  What motivated you to make it?We&apos;d spent years of unsuccessfully/successfully (it really all depends on how you look at it) hustling brand content for various clients, most of whom were wonderful, but all of whom were consistently sub-flush in the money and imagination departments. Two years ago we decided to self-publish, on the internet, and in print. We were already making the stories, we were already doing the work, we were already finding the people, so we bought a URL and created an Instagram account, and here we are. Who works on it and what are their backgrounds?We are Emiliano Granado, a commercial and editorial photographer living in Brooklyn, New York, and Daniel Wakefield Pasley, a documentarian living in Portland, Oregon. We started working together about five years ago producing brand content, and it was immediately clear that we both wanted to document (and publish) an anthropological study of outsider America. Tell us about the feature you&apos;re most proud of We&apos;re proud that we haven&apos;t given up. And the guides are bona fide helpful. Can you recommend any other travel publications (print or online) that we should read?Is Vice a travel publication? Monocle? Emiliano Granado and Daniel Wakefield Pasley We Are Here     Conor Purcell founder of We Are Here    What&apos;s the concept?The idea is to travel to a different city or district each issue and focus the whole magazine on it. It&apos;s very lo-fi and an attempt to move past the clich\u00e9s that dominate most travel magazines. I also wanted to feature local voices, as a lot of travel magazines parachute a journalist in (often on a paid-for junket) and the content is by-the-numbers \u2013 how can you expect to understand a place without having lived there? What motivated you to make it?I love travel literature and magazines, but there was no travel magazine that I wanted to buy. Who works on it and what are their backgrounds?I do most of it \u2013 the design, photography, and commissioning. And when I am on the ground, will meet as many people as possible, explain the concept and get local writers to pitch ideas. The latest issue (focusing on Kathmandu) was written mainly by local writers, so it goes beyond the clich\u00e9d &apos;Shangri-La/hippies/trekking&quot; narrative that most magazines focus on. Tell us about the feature you&apos;re most proud ofIn the first issue, I was surprised that the article How To Write About Dubai passed the censors in the UAE. It is basically a satirical article advising travel writers how to capture the city \u2013 it was written after a spate of poorly researched pieces were printed in the British press. Can you recommend any other travel publications (print or online) that we should read?There are a few newish publications I like from The Travel Almanac to Ling, a really cool in-flight magazine from Spain. I also love Freunde Von Freunden, a website that interviews creatives in their studios or apartments around the world. It might not be a conventional travel journal, but I also love Wilder Quarterly, which is a slightly trippy nature magazine from the US. Conor Purcell Cereal       Photograph: Cereal    What&apos;s the concept? Cereal is a quarterly travel and lifestyle publication that takes great inspiration from classic books. You can see this influence in our design, structure, editorial voice and approach, and even in our logo \u2013 the thin lines between each letter of &quot;Cereal&quot; are meant to emulate the lines of books on a shelf. We love and appreciate the sense of gravitas that comes with considered, beautiful printed titles and wanted this to come to life when creating Cereal. What motivated you to make it? What motivated me to start the magazine, at the risk of sounding trite, is passion: a passion for travel, a passion for writing, and a passion for great visuals. Cereal allowed me to combine all three, and is my dream job come to life. Who works on it and what are their backgrounds? We currently have three full time members of staff: Rich Stapleton (creative director), Robbie Lawrence (features editor) and me (publisher and editor). We&apos;ve also recently hired a part-time advertising manager (Abby Witherick), and work with a team of both local and international contributors to bring each volume to life. We all come from varied backgrounds. I have a background in luxury fashion and beauty marketing (I worked in this industry for about five years in New York) and moved to England to get a MA in English Literature. After graduation I did some freelance writing jobs, then worked full time for a local magazine before setting up Cereal. Tell us about the feature you&apos;re most proud of The feature that I&apos;m the most proud of is one that we&apos;re currently working on. We are doing a travel chapter (as our magazine is divided into destination-specific chapters) on Vancouver, which is my hometown, and there is a series of features in this chapter that are some of my favourites to date. Can you recommend any other travel publications (print or online) that we should read?My go to travel publication is National Geographic \u2013 it is my favourite magazine. I also love getting tips on cities from Monocle.

The moments in which the two finally open up to each other and admit their feelings are played in a simple and tender way. This isn&apos;t about two men being gay, it is about two people who realise they love each other. The interaction is so gentle, it is one of the most touching and beautiful depictions of a gay relationship I\u2019ve ever known in modern media. So where did this exchange of feelings take place? On television in some late night Channel 4 drama? In a cool art house movie? No, it was in a video game \u2013 the science fiction adventure, Mass Effect 3 by Bioware. Over the past couple of years games have crept ever closer toward mainstream culture. Once perceived as the brain rotting preserve of teenage boys and socially inept adults, they are now viewed as just another modern artform. Bafta has accepted games into its remit, Moma displays them in its galleries, the NFTS teaches game design at its hallowed Beaconsfield campus. And as games become more authentic and expressive, developers are starting to explore meaningful social issues.  Most notably perhaps, aspects of LGBT life have begun to enjoy more prominence. There was the heartbreaking side-story in The Last of Us, with apocalypse survivor Bill mourning the loss of his partner Frank during the game&apos;s devastating plague. He was later named as one of the most intriguing characters of 2013 by GLAAD. There&apos;s also Sir Hammerlock in Borderlands 2 and the Peter Gatien-like night club owner Gay Tony, in Rockstar&apos;s Grand Theft Auto IV: hardly a rounded character, but then, in GTA, who is? The larger representation of other lifestyles and choices is a good thing, and can only lead to more acceptance. Meaningful choices In the aforementioned Mass Effect 3, players have the option of starting relationships with both gay male and female characters. \u201cI believe that by the 22nd century, declaring your gender preference will be about as profound as saying, &apos;I like blondes&apos; \u2013 it will just be an accepted part of who we are,&quot; says Dusty Everman, the writer given the task of penning the relationships in ME3. &quot;So I tried to write a meaningful human relationship that just happens to be between two men\u2026 When Cortez says, &apos;I lost my husband&apos;, every player knows his sexuality, so precious word budgets aren\u2019t spent to establish that fact.\u201d  Bioware&apos;s determination to reflect a variety of sexual identities has, not surprisingly, met with some resistance. In 2011, after the release of the studio&apos;s fantasy adventure game Dragon Age 2, a particularly irate fan took to the official forum to complain that straight male gamers were being neglected. The missive was in response to a sequence in the game where a male character makes amorous advances towards the player\u2019s avatar. Bioware\u2019s response was wonderfully cutting. \u201cWe have a lot of fans, many of whom are neither straight nor male,&quot; wrote designer David Gaider. &quot;They deserve no less attention...\u201d Certainly, Bioware is one of the companies leading the charge with LGBT relationships in their games. But tellingly, in the earlier games, they limited this to lesbian encounters. In a straight male dominated world, relationships between women characters can, and have been, misused as titillation \u2013 yet because they are less threatening to male viewers, they have also been used as a way of showing same sex couples without instigating a storm of negative backlash. In the past year, two game companies at opposite ends of the design spectrum, have managed to weave female homosexuality into their titles in beautifully nuanced ways: Naughty Dog with the DLC for its blockbusting action adventure, The Last of Us, and The Fullbright Company, with its debut release, Gone Home. Feeling at home Why did these very different studios choose to tell stories of self-discovery and burgeoning sexuality? \u201cThe scope of Gone Home called for it to take place within a single, non-supernatural or fantastical American family home, so any conflict in the story would have to stem from the family dynamics within,&quot; explains Kate Craig, one of four members of the FullBright Company. &quot;Seeing someone your family disapproves of is one sure fire way to start that ball rolling, and in the 1990s, during the &apos;Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell&apos; years in the US, a story about the relationship of two teenage girls was a really interesting answer to that.\u201d Unfortunately, as with Dragon Age and Mass Effect, Gone Home has faced criticism and prejudice from those who do not want to see homosexuality depicted in games. \u201cThere\u2019s been some negative feedback,&quot; says Craig. &quot;Some of that may be valid or worth considering \u2013 mom\u2019s story feels undeveloped, for example \u2013 and some of it less so \u2013 anything aggressively against the idea of a game with women or LGBTQ characters as leads. Part of making a game is learning to recognise when there\u2019s something to a piece of negative criticism, and when, perhaps, it\u2019s better to keep scrolling.\u201d As Craig says, the aggression of those who are against any progress in the depiction of LGBT themes, often manifests itself in the comments sections of the large gaming websites, or in the official forums of offending titles. But homophobic insults also erupt into the games themselves. When I put out a question on twitter about receiving bigoted abuse while playing games, a large majority of the responders singled out games like Call of Duty, Battlefield and Halo where words like &quot;Faggot&quot; and &quot;homo&quot; are routinely used by players to insult each other, and to round on anyone who may seem different.  Dealing with abuse Nick Rego, an Editor for IGN in Dubai, has come across abuse in a game that is usually considered to be more welcoming: World of Warcraft. &quot;I joined a guild and signed up on their forums to learn more about WoW and pick up tips,&quot; he explains. &quot;In my forum bio I added a few of my hobbies and used the word &apos;gaymer&apos;. During one of the early dungeon raids, I wasn&apos;t doing too great and in the voice chat one guy said, &apos;Why did we let this f**king gay f**got join our guild?&apos; He went on a little mini rant about how shit I was at the game and that I needed to be kicked out of the guild. I messaged one of the mods but they didn&apos;t seem to really care that much and said I should just ignore the guy and keep on playing.&quot; Ignore the comments, carry on playing, disable voice chat, or simply don\u2019t load up multiplayer. These are often the options suggested to LGBT gamers when dealing with a stream of homophobic abuse online. But as the games themselves are starting to embrace LGBT themes, players and developers are feeling ever more emboldened to fight back. For the last couple of years, the Game Developers Conference in San Francisco has run an Advocacy track where industry insiders have been able to voice concerns, ideas and hopes around LGBT representation in the industry, culminating this year with Manveer Heir from Bioware Montreal, giving a talk entitles, &quot;Misogyny, Racism and Homophobia: Where Do Video Games Stand?&quot;. Gaymers strike back Matt Conn, is the CEO and Creative Director of Gaymer X, the first ever gaming and geek convention dedicated to the LGBT Community. The inaugural event took place last year in August, and a second is planned for this year in San Francisco. Gaymer X is the result of a hugely successful Kickstarter campaign that received widespread acknowledgment and support from the gaming press as well as companies like EA and Microsoft.  But has enough is being done to combat the hostility &quot;gaymers&quot; face? \u201cHonestly? I don&apos;t feel like the gaming public as a whole has made that societal shift towards true acceptance,&quot; says Conn. &quot;I see the press and game companies beginning to come around \u2013 realising that if everyone can play, there&apos;s much more money and market in the gaming world for them to be a part of. But the general &apos;gamer&apos; population has been slow to truly accept that diversity is going to be a larger part of gaming moving forward.\u201d If it&apos;s up to the game makers to guide their audiences, the first steps towards creating that environment are now being taken. Last year, Electronic Arts, one of the biggest game development and publishing companies in the world, organised Full Spectrum, the first ever event focused on LGBT issues within gaming. \u201cEA has a long history in supporting the [LGBT] community, both as an employer and in our games,&quot; says Sandy Goldberg, a corporate communications manager at EA who was part of the team that set up Full Spectrum. &quot;For our customers and employees that are part of or support the community, we have a commitment to foster a safe and friendly gaming environment, a place to have fun.\u201d A future together The Full Spectrum event is groundbreaking. The first time a major player in the gaming industry has come forward and started a discussion on issues that games companies will often try and side step. \u201cThe event was designed to trigger a conversation around the issues facing the LGBT community in games \u2013 from the development of content, to creating an inclusive work environment to hate speech inside of game forums\u201d says Goldberg. \u201cThese are very broad topics, so the event was designed to address and discuss a myriad of issues and inspire those attending to share their thoughts and experiences outside of the event so we can start to look at solutions to these issues\u201d Change doesn\u2019t happen overnight, it takes time, momentum and often a little nudge from the right people. With events like Gaymer X and Full Spectrum, as well as games like Gone Home, The Last of Us and Mass Effect, and the support of companies like EA, Naughty Dog, and Bioware, the changes will happen.  As Matt Conn says, \u201cI think it&apos;s important for people to know that we&apos;re not trying to come and tell them how to live or game, but that everyone, whether straight, gay, female, trans, or disabled, deserves a seat at the table when it comes to games and creating a fun, safe environment for everyone.\u201d \u2022 Gone Home \u2013 and how games can tell stories about everyday lives\u2022 LGBT content in video games: here come the old bullies\u2022 Are gamers really sexist?", "title": "Sharing joysticks: how video games are opening up to LGBT themes", "sentences": ["Dealing with abuse Nick Rego, an Editor for IGN in Dubai, has come across abuse in a game that is usually considered to be more welcoming: World of Warcraft."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-10T06:00:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/apr/10/corrections-and-clarifications", "tags": [], "article": "\u2022 An article about a Dubai sheikh advertising for 60 young women to help his family with their shopping on a visit to Europe stated that the advertisement was posted on behalf of Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, UAE vice-president and prime minister, and ruler of Dubai.

Giving evidence for the fifth day at the hacking trial, Stuart Kuttner denied he failed to pass on a new lead on the missing schoolgirl&apos;s whereabouts after the paper hacked into her phone and learned that someone had phoned her about a job interview in Telford. Private investigator Glenn Mulcaire hacked into Dowler&apos;s phone for the NoW after she went missing in 2002, the court heard. Kuttner then alerted police to a voicemail message suggesting Dowler may be alive, but only after journalists had been dispatched to Telford in an attempt to track her down, prosecutor Andrew Edis QC said. Cross-examining, Edis asked Kuttner: &quot;How did you think the NoW had come by the message? Kuttner said: &quot;I have no recollection.&quot; He said he passed on the information he had to the police. &quot;I also saw in the weeks following the disappearance of Sarah Payne, I saw the effect of a missing child on a family.

Kuttner responded: &quot;Hold up information from her parents, sir? I would no more do that than fly to the dark side of the moon.&quot; The jury has previously heard that Kuttner knew the tabloid was &quot;in possession&quot; of a recording of voicemails left on her phone after she vanished and that he passed the information on to Surrey police in a telephone call on 13 April 2002, the day before the paper published a story including a reference to her voicemails. He has said repeatedly he did not know that the voicemail had come from hacking and that he was unaware of the practice at the paper. The jury has also heard that he has suffered memory loss as a result of a brain stem stroke. Under repeated questioning from lead prosecutor Edis about the contact with the police, Kuttner said: &quot;You have made a number of references to my health. If I remember eight, nine, 10 years on [from] these events, I would not have hesitated giving the police the fullest information, I would not have hesitated for one moment.&quot; Edis put it to him: &quot;But you did have recollection of contacting the police, didn&apos;t you? It is not the case that your whole memory had been wiped out by ill health because you did remember contacting people when interviewed and before you were shown any documents didn&apos;t you?&quot; Kuttner said he &quot;wouldn&apos;t argue with that.&quot; &quot;You must have known that somebody had unlawfully intercepted this phone?&quot; &quot;No, I don&apos;t accept that,&quot; said Kuttner. Edis then referred back to a statement given to the trial that Kuttner had made a call to a Mark Hancox at Monday&apos;s Recruitment Agency in the Midlands on Saturday, 13 April, 2002. Mulcaire had picked up a voicemail on the afternoon of Friday, 12 April, mistakenly left on Dowler&apos;s phone about a possible job in Telford and dispatched reporters to the town. Hancox said the caller had &quot;said he was an editor, or editor-in-chief, or high-ranking employee of the News of the World&quot; and subsequently believed the voice of the caller to be Kuttner&apos;s. Kuttner said: &quot;I have made an admission to that effect [that he made the call to Hancox] but I have no recollection [of it]&quot;. &quot;If you did make that call, you must have known that the News of the World, without telling police, was investigating the voicemail?&quot; Edis asked. &quot;Although I have made an admission as to making that call, I have no recollection. &quot;If I had information there was any possibility that Milly Dowler was alive and well and in the Midlands, or wherever Telford is, my first and natural instinct would be to telephone the police.&quot; &quot;Why were you phoning Mr Hancox?&quot; &quot;I have no recollection of making that call and if I made that call,&quot; said Kuttner. Asked &quot;did you ask anyone where have you got this&quot; voicemail, Kuttner replied: &quot;I don&apos;t know&quot;. He said he was trying to be as helpful as possible, but as he had no recollection, the best he could do was &quot;reconstruct&quot; a possible scenario. Earlier this week he testified that he believed it was the paper&apos;s then chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck who told him about the voice message. Asked if he had asked Thurlbeck about the voicemail, he said: &quot;I have no recollection of Mr Thurlbeck telling me that or anyone had hacked the telephone.&quot; Saunders pointed out that Thurlbeck had told police himself that the voicemail had been hacked and said it might &quot;seem a bit strange&quot; that he didn&apos;t tell his managing editor. &quot;This one was no secret, [Thurlbeck] told the police because it was thought to be in the public interest,&quot; said Edis. &quot;It wasn&apos;t thought by me to be in the public interest. I do not accept it was in the public interest,&quot; said Kuttner. Rebekah Brooks was the editor of the paper at the time the News of the World published a story about Dowler mentioning her voicemails. The jury has heard she was on holiday in Dubai at the time but had made several phonecalls to the paper. Kuttner, who was managing editor of the tabloid for 22 years and worked with &quot;12 to 15 editors&quot; was asked: &quot;Was this a story in which the editor personally was interested?&quot; He told jurors that &quot;An editor in my experience was interested in most stories in his or her paper.&quot; Kuttner and Brooks deny a charge that they conspired to hack phones.", "title": "News of the World boss denies failing to pass on Milly Dowler lead to police", "sentences": ["The jury has heard she was on holiday in Dubai at the time but had made several phonecalls to the paper."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-11T13:53:26Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/11/horse-racing-tips-12-april-2014", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Ayr 1.30 Aalim 2.05 Valdez 2.40 My Tent Or Yours 3.15 Manyriverstocross 3.50 Lie Forrit (nb) 4.25 Brother Du Berlais 5.00 Tony Star 5.35 Saint Charles Bangor 1.55 Glowinginthedark 2.30 The Bear Trap 3.05 Polo Springs 3.40 Mist The Boat 4.15 Dunlough Bay 4.50 Trillerin Minella 5.25 Rain Down 5.55 How&apos;s My Friend Newbury 1.20 Mutakayyef 1.50 Mustashaded 2.20 Al Thakhira 2.55 Night Of Thunder 3.30 Brownsea Brink (nap) 4.05 Norab 4.40 Noble Gift Thirsk 2.15 Klynch 2.50 Royal Connoisseur 3.25 Trail Blaze 4.00 Breton Rock 4.35 Retirement Plan 5.10 Baytown Kestrel 5.45 Run Fat Lass Run 6.15 Trade Secret Wolverhampton 5.50 Consistant 6.20 Hustle Bustle 6.50 One Scoop Or Two 7.20 Dubai Dynamo 7.50 Full Moon Fever 8.20 Mazij 8.50 Yourinthewill", "title": "Horse racing tips: Saturday 12 April", "sentences": ["Ayr 1.30 Aalim 2.05 Valdez 2.40 My Tent Or Yours 3.15 Manyriverstocross 3.50 Lie Forrit (nb) 4.25 Brother Du Berlais 5.00 Tony Star 5.35 Saint Charles Bangor 1.55 Glowinginthedark 2.30 The Bear Trap 3.05 Polo Springs 3.40 Mist The Boat 4.15 Dunlough Bay 4.50 Trillerin Minella 5.25 Rain Down 5.55 How&apos;s My Friend Newbury 1.20 Mutakayyef 1.50 Mustashaded 2.20 Al Thakhira 2.55 Night Of Thunder 3.30 Brownsea Brink (nap) 4.05 Norab 4.40 Noble Gift Thirsk 2.15 Klynch 2.50 Royal Connoisseur 3.25 Trail Blaze 4.00 Breton Rock 4.35 Retirement Plan 5.10 Baytown Kestrel 5.45 Run Fat Lass Run 6.15 Trade Secret Wolverhampton 5.50 Consistant 6.20 Hustle Bustle 6.50 One Scoop Or Two 7.20 Dubai Dynamo 7.50 Full Moon Fever 8.20 Mazij 8.50 Yourinthewill"], "publicationDate": "2014-04-11T16:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/apr/13/boris-johnson-proper-debate-london-skyline", "tags": ["Planning policy", "Architecture", "London", "Boris Johnson", "Politics", "UK news"], "article": "Dear Boris Let&apos;s agree that towers can be beautiful. Let&apos;s also agree that London needs new homes and plenty of them. It may well be that many of the 200-plus tall buildings now proposed can play a useful role if, as you say, they are &quot;sensitively managed, well designed and in the right place&quot;. London is not Amsterdam nor Vienna, cities whose inherited profile is retained at all costs. But neither, as you once put it, should it be Dubai-on-Thames. Can you look at Strata SE1, the proposed One Nine Elms, or the polychrome blisters of Stratford, and say that they earn their place on the London stage? Or that the chaos of pricks at Vauxhall will be a well-formed piece of city of which we can be proud? Or that the proposed clusters at Vauxhall and Waterloo do not affect the settings of the Houses of Parliament and other historic places? Unesco thinks they do. Have you seen the effect of the Walkie-Talkie on views of the Tower and Tower Bridge from south of the river? Do you honestly think that a studio flat in the One Blackfriars development, with a starting price of \u00a31,015,000, is the best answer to London&apos;s housing needs? Between the 20th floor and the top of the proposed 49-storey Ludgate House, also in Blackfriars, 65 flats will be created. Does this small dent in your annual target of 49,000 justify the extra floors, which will dominate the river bank for centuries? As you say, some affordable housing is paid for by building towers, through the mechanism of planning gain. But it is not the only way to get this gain: developments that are lower and/or better designed could also deliver it. Is there any evidence that towers are the best way to achieve it? Before embarking on this radical transformation of the city, did anyone do the maths? When I ask your spokesman if you have any evidence on the numbers being created by tall buildings, I get the answer: &quot;We don&apos;t.&quot; I am in general concerned about your command of data. You trumpet that &quot;in a recent survey, the Gherkin was Londoners&apos; favourite building, followed by the Shard and then the Cheesegrater&quot;. That would be the Ipsos Mori poll in which people were asked to choose the best from a list of 13 towers. That the first three were all tall is therefore no more revelatory than that the Grand National was won by a horse. You also say that the new skyscrapers are the result of policies that have been publicly aired. But no Londoners, not even the mayor, have been shown the cumulative effects of these policies. The images that the Observer published on 30 March are more extensive than any seen before, but even they only show parts of the city. Many who saw them were amazed \u2013 they had no idea that anything like this is happening. Policy has been made blind and much of the consultation has been in name only. At times, you sound like a minister of the Harold Wilson era, preaching megastructures in the name of Progress and the People. The People, as tested by other questions in that Ipsos Mori survey, were split on the question whether more tall buildings should be built. But clear majorities said they wouldn&apos;t want to live in them and thought that siting and design were important. Before we further inflict the White Heat of Phallocracy, should we not be certain that we are meeting these wishes? If London is, as you like to say, the Greatest City in the World, it also deserves the greatest planning, not default solutions downloaded from other places. Do you want to be remembered as the Man Who Wrecked the Thames or as the mayor who showed the world how to combine density with beauty?", "title": "Boris Johnson must build a proper case for transforming London's skyline | Rowan Moore", "sentences": ["But neither, as you once put it, should it be Dubai-on-Thames."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-12T23:05:33Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/construction-industry-human-rights-qatar-dubai-russia", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Sustainability", "Construction industry", "Human rights", "Slavery", "Dubai", "Qatar"], "article": "This time last year, Pete Pattisson, a freelance journalist and filmmaker based in Nepal, began a daily journey to Katmandu airport. There he watched a steady stream of coffins arriving from across the Gulf, carrying the bodies of migrant workers back to their grieving families who couldn&apos;t understand how their young sons had left clutching job contracts and arrived back, some only months later, in body bags. Pattisson got on a plane to Qatar to try and find out what was happening to these men. The scale and severity of the abuses he found shocked him to the core. &quot;Any workers&apos; camp I went to I found stories of non-payment of wages, appalling living and working conditions, huge debts and confiscation of passports, this was the story told by almost everyone I met. This was not the exception, this was the rule for how things were done in the Qatari construction industry,&quot; says Pattisson. Pattisson&apos;s investigation \u2013 part of the Guardian&apos;s Modern-day Slavery project \u2013 revealed a spiralling death toll of migrant workers on building sites in Qatar and evidence of forced labour conditions on construction projects linked to the FIFA Football World Cup 2020. The story that some of the world&apos;s richest states are being built on the blood and sweat of an impoverished and exploited migrant work force is not a new one. Some years ago Dubai came under huge pressure over the human toll of it&apos;s intense construction boom. It is also not an issue exclusive to the Gulf States. The global construction industry is one of the world&apos;s biggest employers with a huge migrant labour force. According to a recent report (PDF), global construction output will grow by more than 70% to $15tn worldwide by 2025. The construction binges that precede major global events such as sporting tournaments provide fertile ground for the abuse of such a vulnerable and often unregulated workforce to thrive. In 2013 Human Rights Watch warned that migrant workers involved in the construction of Russian facilities for the Winter Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2014 are often subject to sub-standard working conditions, non-payment of salaries and are left unprotected and vulnerable. Yet how much responsibility should large construction companies bear for what happens down their sub-contracting chain? Much of the blame for the treatment of migrant workers on World Cup sites has fallen on the Qatari government, which despite launching new guidelines to protect its huge migrant workforce in 2013, has clearly failed to protect the workers. Some in the construction industry argue that the onus has to be on national governments to enforce the labour laws and that the construction and building industry can&apos;t and shouldn&apos;t be expected to police their supply chains. &quot;When you&apos;re looking at international construction projects, it is important to understand that foreign companies are only one small element of the chain and often don&apos;t have a huge ability to affect what is happening at the bottom. We are often not the client but just one service provider,&quot; says Andrew Link, chief operating officer at the Construction Industry Council. &quot;I think this is why when you have a story such as the recent investigation into worker abuses on Qatari World Cup sites, it&apos;s the government who is under the most pressure because not only are they the ones who should be enforcing local labour laws, but they are also the ones commissioning this work in the first place.&quot; Unlike the retail sector, where the human cost of consumer&apos;s addiction to disposable fashion has been widely documented, construction companies have so far avoided wide scale reputational damage. But how long can this last? James Lynch from Amnesty International, which also released a damning report into forced labour conditions in the Qatari construction industry last year, says that the industry must act now or face the consequences. &quot;Unlike the retail or garment sector, the construction industry hasn&apos;t had to deal with too much focus in terms of supply chains until recently but now this is changing, particularly around issues of health and safety and migrant labour,&quot; he says. Lynch believes that construction companies chasing big international contracts in a world with increasing global deregulation of the labour market, fierce competition and a growing migrant work force may soon find themselves unable to throw up their hands and plead either ignorance or denial of liability for what happens to those toiling on the ground. He says that during his research for Amnesty&apos;s recent report, he spoke to many local sub-contractors in Qatar who had absolutely no understanding of what kind of human rights standards they were supposed to uphold. &quot;It&apos;s not good enough for companies to avoid liability by pointing to their CSR policies. In many cases the construction industry is actually uniquely placed to make sure they know what is going on to workers on their projects, as they are often geographically located in the same place as sub-contractors, which often isn&apos;t the case with other sectors. Put simply it&apos;s the difference between writing a policy and actually dealing with a problem and stopping it from happening.&quot; It&apos;s perhaps a sign of how jittery or unwilling the industry remains to engage on issues of human rights in global supply chains, that I failed to find one big construction company willing to be interviewed for this article. Graham Hand, the senior industry adviser to the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative isn&apos;t surprised. &quot;There is still a huge nervousness in the industry about human rights, corruption and global supply chains,&quot; he says. &quot;The thing that makes it harder to engage is that our industry is famously secretive and very cautious about talking to each other about these issues and I&apos;m afraid to say it is difficult to imagine that they will band together and demand common standards to all and sundry. If they can avoid the onus being on them to take action then they will.&quot; Maybe Pete Pattisson sums it all up when he told me earlier this week, &quot;If I, working with very few resources found it easy to find cases of labour abuse in the construction industry in Qatar, it would be very easy for a well-resourced construction company or the Qatari authorities to do the same. The question is whether they have the will to do it.&quot; The social impact hub is funded by Anglo-American. All content is editorially independent except for pieces labelled advertisement feature.

She&apos;s read it five times and went to the Rose theatre in Kingston with great expectations for the best experience of her life. My 12-year-old son Freddy? As we were walking to our seats he hissed: &quot;Mum! I&apos;m the only boy \u2026&quot; But I saw at least one other boy in the audience \u2013 there is no way Hetty Feather or any Jacqueline Wilson book is just for girls. That said, 99.9% of the audience were young girls and their mums. The air felt fizzy with anticipation. We were all megafans. As the lights dimmed Violet told me, &quot;I&apos;m so excited! This is going to turn my fantasy into real life.&quot; No pressure then \u2026 It&apos;s strange seeing a play of a story that you know so intimately. Violet thought it was a bit like seeing Cinderella \u2013 the slipper will be lost, the handsome prince is going to find it. You&apos;re there for the retelling. So first the set: a circus ring with a trapeze, ropes and scaffolding to climb. We saw Hetty (Phoebe Thomas) for the first time, swinging in the ring of the trapeze, looking just perfect: small and skinny with gorgeous natural long red hair. As she had to look! And so the story began with the terrible decision Hetty&apos;s mum had to make when she gave her daughter up to the Foundling hospital. Collective shudder with the pain of it all. We meet the horrible Nurse Bottomley (Matt Costain) who we all hate from the start because we already know we hate her. We almost started hissing at her as if we were at the panto, and Matt does play her a bit like a panto villain (with a bit of League of Gentlemen thrown in). And then we got to meet Peg, Hetty&apos;s foster mother (Sarah Goddard) \u2013 we love her \u2013 and of course we love her foster brother Jem (Matt Costain again) who is going to save Hetty; and dopey fellow foundling Gideon (Paul Mundell) who doesn&apos;t want to be a soldier, he wants to be a servant girl; and the spiteful Saul (Isaac Stanmore). It&apos;s like meeting old friends. The live music by Seamus H Carey and Luke Potter is integral to the show, providing sound effects and keeping the momentum moving like a runaway train. Violet and I shed bucket loads of tears together reading Hetty Feather \u2013 anyone who reads Jacqueline Wilson will know she&apos;s an expert at pulling heartstrings especially when you are snuggling in bed together. But the play would be unwatchable if it was as emotional as the book. I welled up a couple of times. If the company had notched the emotion up more than they did, there would have been some sort of mass hysterical reaction among all those girls. In the books the circus plays a pivotal but small part. In the play it is central. The circus seems to symbolise Hetty&apos;s urge for freedom and self-expression. On the way to the theatre Violet was wondering how they were going to re-create Madame Adeline&apos;s horses. Would there be a real horse? Or a puppet like in War Horse? Instead, four of the actors popped on plumes and tails and became horses themselves. It was funny rather than &quot;budget&quot; (to quote Freddy). When Elijah the elephant appeared live on stage he had two fans for ears and a huge long piece of plumbing tubing as the trunk. The grimness of the Foundling hospital to which Hetty had to return when she was six was excellently done. The symbolic cutting of Hetty&apos;s hair was horrifying, with great loads of red ribbon thrown into the air. Violet loved it: &quot;It made me feel the way Hetty does. But it&apos;s different from the book. Hetty is my Hetty but this is different. I felt like I was in Hetty&apos;s head.&quot; The essence of the book was there, and something else besides. Freddy, who has never read the book, was captivated. The final verdict? Violet: 10 out of 10. Freddy: 8 out of 10. By the way, the Rose theatre has the most gorgeous and huge cafe so don&apos;t do as we did and have a big lunch before you go. Save room for amazing cakes. \u2022 Hetty Feather plays at the Rose theatre until 19 April. The show then tours Birmingham, Cheltenham, Dubai, Edinburgh, Cambridge and Sheffield.

The former News of the World editor said he had no idea that his news team had despatched a team to the Midlands to investigate the lead or that the tip had, in fact, come from a hacked voicemail on the 13-year-old&apos;s phone. Coulson said that he remembers the newspaper&apos;s belief at the time was &quot;sadly&quot; that the most likely scenario was that Dowler was dead. In an intense two hours of questioning about the Dowler story, Coulson also testified that he did not have any conversation with Rebekah Brooks about the article that was printed in the paper on 14 April 2002 mentioning a voicemail. He also said that he did not know at the time that hacking was a crime and that if he knew any of his staff were involved in the unlawful activity he would have viewed it as &quot;intrusive&quot; and &quot;lazy journalism&quot;. In the witness box for the second day at the hacking trial, Coulson told jurors that he remembered someone at the time suggesting that Dowler, who had vanished the previous month, was &quot;going to take a job in a factory&quot;. &quot;That&apos;s what I remember. It may have come out in conference. It might have been said to me and I&apos;m very clear about my memory of it. I thought it was nonsense,&quot; Coulson said. &quot;Why?&quot; asked his defence counsel Timothy Langdale QC. &quot;Because Milly Dowler was a 13-year-old schoolgirl and she was a 13-year-old who for all the wrong reasons had been pictured across all the national newspapers. &quot;The family had released video footage of her which was very moving and used widely by probably every news broadcaster in the country. &quot;The idea that she could move north and then take a job in a factory just seemed ludicrous.&quot; The jury has previously heard that Dowler&apos;s phone was hacked on 12 April 2002 and the tabloid reported two days later &quot;a new twist&quot; in the search for the missing schoolgirl &quot;after messages had been sent to her mobile phone after she vanished&quot;. It has also heard that the tabloid sent at least eight reporters and photographers to an Epson ink-cartridge factory hoping to land a scoop. Coulson said he did not remember reading the story at the time but reading it now said the reference to &quot;messages&quot; did not necessarily infer hacking. &quot;I do not think it is clear. I think I might have concluded that it may have come from sources, possibly even police sources,&quot; he said. &quot;The first thing is I do not remember the story,&quot; he said explaining to jurors that he might have thought police were involved in the story because there was no &quot;exclusive&quot; or &quot;News of the World investigates&quot; logo on the story. That suggested to him the story may have been a tip that had been passed to several Sunday papers. He said if he had been told one of his staff had hacked the phone his instinct would have been it was wrong. &quot;If you had been made aware that somebody at the instigation of the NoW was accessing voicemail on Milly Dowler&apos;s phone, what would your reaction have been?&quot; asked Langdale. Coulson replied: &quot;My instinctive concern was that this was interference with a police investigation.&quot; He told the jury he was not aware of hacking generally and not aware that Dowler&apos;s phone was hacked or that a team was despatched to chase the story down. Asked if he would have been told about a team being sent to Telford, he replied: &quot;Not necessarily, that&apos;s the news editor&apos;s job.&quot; Neville Thurlbeck, the paper&apos;s former chief reporter who has already pleaded guilty to hacking, was the news editor on the day, Coulson said. The News of the World dumped its first edition account of the voice message and in the third edition reported that the police believed that the job offer message was the work of a &quot;sick hoaxer&quot; who had also contacted BBC&apos;s Crimewatch. The story was also moved from page 9 to page 30, replacing what Coulson described as a &quot;glamorous&quot; story featuring a picture of scantily glad Star Trek actor Jolene Blalock in a bikini. Coulson repeated that he had not read the article and believed he would not have thought a story about a hoax merited a prominent slot. &quot;Hoaxes are not really stories by their nature and this is a hoax wrapped in a riddle. I don&apos;t think I rated this story,&quot; he added. &quot;I think I moved this story looking back at this distance, for cosmetic reasons, he said, explaining that he didn&apos;t generally want &quot;all the serious content squeezed together, you want to space it out&quot;. The jury was told that the Star Trek picture story on page 30 in the first edition was moved to page 11, two pages after the Dowler story was placed. The page 11 story was a &quot;serious&quot; story headlined &quot;SBS kill 100 Al-Qaida&quot; and that moved to page 9 replacing the Dowler story. It was the first time the jury was given Coulson&apos;s version of events about the Dowler story which is central to the crown&apos;s case against him and Rebekah Brooks. He was deputy editor at the time of the Dowler story but was on editing duty because Brooks was on holiday in Dubai. The jury have heard that she made calls to the office while on holiday including one that lasted 38 minutes. Coulson denied having any conversation with her about the Dowler story. Coulson told jurors he did not recall having a conversation with Brooks about the Dowler story when she returned from holiday.

That followed his sacking in the wake of England&apos;s 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Australia last winter, which made him available for a full IPL season for the first time.

Pietersen, sacked by England in the aftermath of last winter&apos;s shambolic Ashes whitewash in Australia, was set to lead Delhi against Bangalore in Sharjah on Thursday, with the 33-year-old&apos;s devaluation from England matchwinner to persona non grata making him available for an entire Indian Premier League season for the first time. He was promptly re-signed for \u00a3880,000 by the Daredevils and installed as captain by the South African coach Gary Kirsten. However, for now at least, the bruising sustained to the little finger on his right hand during pre-season for Surrey has prevented Pietersen from starting the newest chapter in his eventful career. Eric Simons, Delhi&apos;s assistant coach, confirmed: &quot;Kevin is still a few days away so he won&apos;t be considered for tomorrow. It is obviously a setback because he&apos;s an important player in our setup and an important player in any team. It is a difficult situation.&quot; Delhi play their second match of the tournament against Kolkata in Dubai on Saturday and Simons conceded that Pietersen is a doubt for that too. &quot;I think we&apos;ll take it one day at a time and see how it progresses each morning but he definitely won&apos;t be considered for tomorrow,&quot; the former South Africa all-rounder said. &quot;It&apos;s tough. I wouldn&apos;t call it a new start but he&apos;s certainly very enthusiastic about the role he&apos;s going to play for us this year. It&apos;s obviously disappointing for him as it is for us.&quot; For all the mud flung since Pietersen&apos;s conflict with the England and Wales Cricket Board in January, no definitive answers have yet been given for the parting with his adopted country. A look back to the controversy of the summer of 2012, when Pietersen was dropped for sending derogatory texts about former captain Andrew Strauss to South African opponents, offers an indication of the reasons why he has been discarded this time, and it appears the &quot;reintegration&quot; which saw him return for England&apos;s triumphant Test tour of India in late 2012, including a majestic 187 in Mumbai, turned sour during the winter. Yet the talk of dressing-room disharmony sits in stark contrast to his position at Delhi right now. &quot;He was with us the last two IPLs,&quot; said Simons. &quot;Last year he wasn&apos;t with us because of his knee injuries but the year before he was an amazing influence. &quot;He was an informal leader in that situation because he wasn&apos;t captain but his inspiration of all the team, the confidence he passes on to others is infectious. From that perspective \u2013 not only his runs \u2013 he played a major role for us.&quot; Kirsten said: &quot;It&apos;s been exactly the same this time around. He engages with everybody and I think that&apos;s crucial for a captain, the relationship he has with his players. I find him a very positive influence on the team, both from a cricketing perspective and in terms of the team culture.&quot; The initial stages of this year&apos;s IPL are taking place in the United Arab Emirates because of security issues surrounding the Indian general election. It is a tournament that has been clouded by corruption, with fears that this year&apos;s edition \u2013 the seventh \u2013 could be cancelled altogether after Chennai Super Kings and Rajasthan Royals were implicated in the spot-fixing scandal which has been played out in the Indian supreme court over recent weeks. The affair has brought not only the whole integrity of the tournament into question but has led to N Srinivasan, president of the Board of Control for Cricket in India, being suspended while investigations continue into the allegations against Chennai, owned by his Indian Cements company. The supreme court on Wednesday named Srinivasan as one of 12 people who have been named in the &quot;sealed envelope&quot; \u2013 which details allegations of IPL corruption \u2013 submitted to the Mudgal committee. Srinivasan, who has been replaced by the &quot;interim working president&quot;, Sunil Gavaskar, denies any allegations of wrongdoing. However, the pall of alleged malpractice looms over the IPL like an ash cloud. Pietersen, speaking before Delhi&apos;s departure for the Gulf, said: &quot;There&apos;s nothing I can do. There&apos;s nothing the coach can do, there&apos;s nothing anybody can do. You are who you are as a person and I&apos;ve been quite vocal on it. If you cheat and you fix matches and you do all those things then there&apos;s no place in the game \u2013 you should never play cricket again.&quot; It is a sentiment even Pietersen&apos;s strongest critics would agree with wholeheartedly.

But when Clive Palmer was awarded an A-League license back in 2008 he wasn&apos;t the way he is now. When he said he would move football in Australia forward, we believed he would do it. He was meant to be Australia&apos;s answer to Roman Abramovich. He promised to pump his mining billions into Gold Coast United and set new standards for Australian football. He was quirky, yes, but nothing more \u2013 there were no dinosaur parks, no replicas of the Titanic. Not yet. What could have been. Two years on from the death of Gold Coast United and few would look back on Palmer&apos;s three-season rollercoaster in the A-League with any wistfulness. A club born with a silver spoon in its mouth, United suffered an undignified end. In their final days, they trained in borrowed Socceroos gear provided by FFA because their banished owner had control of their regular kit. With a squad that became casualties of the war between Palmer and the FFA, the stench of doom \u2013 which had lingered, essentially, since day dot \u2013 was inescapable.  In hindsight, rushing in the Western Sydney Wanderers \u2013 then only known as &apos;New Sydney Club&apos; \u2013 was the right option. Even Geoffrey Schuhkraft, the man who wanted to clean up the mess and save GCU at the 11th hour, can admit to that now. The A-League is no longer exposed to ridicule through embarrassing Skilled Park crowds and for once, there is a sense of stability off the field. Western Sydney has been a runaway success \u2013 although, as Football Gold Coast general manager Damien Bresic says, &quot;If the federal government gave us $8m, I&apos;m sure we would have done the same thing.&quot; People are understandably bitter, as they are up in Townsville, and even more so after seeing the Wanderers treated with a degree of love and care that wasn&apos;t there in the first wave of A-League expansion. &quot;No, it hasn&apos;t recovered fully. But it&apos;s on its way to recovery,&quot; said Peter Williamson, chairman of the region&apos;s only National Premier Leagues side, Palm Beach. David Gallop and Frank Lowy won&apos;t acknowledge it publicly, but expansion is looming as one of the A-League&apos;s biggest issues. The 10-team format is growing stale. More clubs are needed to not only maximise FFA&apos;s next TV rights deal, but to ensure the competition itself advances. While consolidation is important, so is planning now to avoid a repeat of the blunders that were made in the past. There aren&apos;t exactly a multitude of options. Though FFA has all but turned its back on the Gold Coast, it remains the biggest sporting market from which the A-League is absent. Projections show the area\u2019s population will swell to nearly 750,000 by 2026. And while it has long been regarded as a sporting graveyard and irrelevant in football terms, that could be about to change. Four years from now the Gold Coast will host the Commonwealth Games. For a regional city still grasping its own sense of self, that is a big deal. Schuhkraft and the &apos;Save GCU&apos; movement he once led are banking on this event galvanising the Gold Coast&apos;s sporting culture and providing an environment in which an A-League franchise will be viable. &quot;Two years on, I&apos;m more enthusiastic about this than ever,&quot; said Schuhkraft, founder of talent empire International Quarterback and a veteran of the sporting management scene. In 2006 he joined forces with former client and current Milan coach Clarence Seedorf to create ON International - a company focused on &quot;changing the way the business of football is played&quot;. His passion project is to help the Gold Coast finally embrace the round ball. Just returned from a trip to the Middle East with Gold Coast mayor Tom Tate, he&apos;s making a good start. Tate was one of the businessmen involved in Schuhkraft&apos;s unsuccessful bid to keep United alive. He was elected mayor shortly afterwards and has since employed Schuhkraft as a senior advisor for Middle East relations for the Gold Coast City Council. Schuhkraft has friends in high places. He introduced Tate to the Crown Prince of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, who now get along famously, going skydiving together during Tate&apos;s recent self-funded trip to the United Arab Emirates. The Gold Coast and Dubai are sister cities and that relationship has helped open a lot of doors. It helped Schuhkraft convince the UAE national team to hold their pre-Asian Cup training camp on the Gold Coast later this year. He says that deal will give the city two weeks of saturation media coverage in the football-mad UAE. Qatar would be coming, too, if they weren&apos;t drawn in the same group. Schuhkraft helped to secure two other deals - the first a &quot;knowledge-sharing&quot; agreement with Qatar 2022&apos;s Supreme Committee of Legacy and Delivery, the second with Qatar&apos;s Olympic Committee. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of areas of collaboration and ways we can utilise the fact we&apos;re both regions preparing for global sporting events,&quot; Schuhkraft said.  The Gold Coast City Council is not concerning itself with the controversy surrounding Qatar&apos;s procurement of the rights to host the 2022 World Cup \u2013 and the treatment of migrant workers. &quot;We obviously are aware of a lot of the conversation around the World Cup but we are a city preparing for the Commonwealth Games. They are a country that&apos;s been granted the World Cup. We believe it&apos;s in the best interests of both parties that we embrace this opportunity and take a positive approach, because that&apos;s how we&apos;ll make positive change within Qatar and also our community. &quot;The reason why we&apos;ve been able to secure such extraordinary outcomes for the city is because of the way they view the Gold Coast. They don&apos;t view it like any other market within Australia. To people from the Middle East and China, it is a safe destination, a destination they love. These are substantial agreements that any state or city would be honoured to be able to achieve. Right at the centre of them all is football. We&apos;re planting the seeds and I&apos;m really quite excited about that.&quot; Tate and Schuhkraft devised a plan last year to float the idea of an A-League franchise to Chinese investors under the working title of &quot;Gold Coast Dragons&quot;, with the hope of building into the top tier through the National Premier Leagues in Queensland. That idea has developed into the motivation for the work that Schuhkraft is doing today. The council is also on board, and is set to engage a consultant specifically to help them develop a strategy for football and how the city can use it as a platform to do more business abroad. &quot;I honestly do believe there is a great future for football on the Gold Coast and the fact that we&apos;ve been made to sit back, take stock and consider every aspect has been a very healthy process for everyone,&quot; he said. &quot;Since the license was taken off Palmer it definitely hasn&apos;t dropped off the radar. All the key movers and shakers around sports strategy in the city, the Commonwealth Games and beyond, have all made sure that football is at the pointy end of the sword.&quot; &quot;Football is the biggest participation sport here. It is the most powerful sporting and entertainment package on the planet. The problem is it&apos;s never been organised into any sort of structure where we can build unity and passion around a club. We have to prove that we can deliver a minimum of 10,000 per game and that we have the people with the passion and a stadium that can offer prices and an entertainment package that would justify the reason for those people to attend. It all starts at the grassroots.&quot; Schuhkraft sure talks a big game but is the potential he speaks of even there anymore? The grassroots tell the tale. The local zone still has close to 10,000 registered players while there are an additional 3,000 based in northern NSW. That&apos;s an enormous catchment area. Most in the game agree it has never been harnessed correctly. Football has a long history on the tourist strip but not a particularly strong one. It never had a side in the National Soccer League, nor was it ever really in the national soccer conversation. &quot;When you look at some of these soccer clubs on the Gold Coast, they&apos;re exactly the same as they have been for the last 30 years,&quot; Williamson said. &quot;They might have tidied up their toilet block and clubhouse and put up a small grandstand even, but that&apos;s it. We&apos;re one of only two soccer clubs with a licensed club premises, which is where we get our money from. There&apos;s been no vision. The Gold Coast has got so much going for it; it&apos;s unbelievable. People aren&apos;t exploiting what we&apos;ve got here.&quot; With that background an A-League licence was always going to be a quantum leap, and had to be done right for it to work. It wasn&apos;t. &quot;I remember putting together a community engagement proposal and taking it to them and saying, &apos;you really need to get on board, we&apos;ve got so many players&apos;\u2026 they just weren&apos;t interested,&quot; said Bresic. Palmer&apos;s parting gift was a two-year sponsorship worth $50,000 from his company Minerology for the naming rights of the local competition. &quot;Unfortunately, the Palmer experience was an abject failure. But it was destined to fail,&quot; Williamson said. &quot;Football is a blue-collar sport. To tell everybody you&apos;re going to be flying around in private jets, it created a lot of resentment from all the local people in football. Had Clive hung in there longer and didn&apos;t and get some people offside, he would have got it right eventually. There is a lot of support for football here but it&apos;s got to be done properly and gradually. Fortunately all the groundwork that Clive should have done is being done now in the NPL.&quot; Palm Beach won the coast&apos;s only NPL license virtually unopposed. The only other bid came from FGC, which proposed a broader entity that was to pick up where United left off, like the Northern Fury. But an FFA directive that zones were to be excluded from the elite development pathway meant that it was never seriously considered. &quot;That really made it Palm Beach, and Palm Beach alone,&quot; said Football Queensland chief operating officer Ben Mannion.  As it stands, the job is too big for one club \u2013 especially since nearly a quarter of Palm Beach&apos;s players come from northern NSW. FGC and FQ both want a second NPL team in the Gold Coast&apos;s north to lighten the load. &quot;When you get past Nerang-Broadbeach Road, you&apos;re probably not going to come south to train at NPL level. A lot of kids have actually come up to Brisbane Strikers because of that,&quot; said Mannion. &quot;Just based on the numbers, there&apos;s something missing.&quot; Three local clubs \u2013 Coomera, Magic United and Mudgereeba \u2013 have already shown interest in filling the void. &quot;That&apos;s when you&apos;ll see football on the Gold Coast go from strength to strength. Then your A-League club goes on top,&quot; Williamson said. &quot;That&apos;s where we deserve to be. The players, the potential, most of the infrastructure is here. We just need a vision. The thing that&apos;s let us down is that people didn&apos;t have the vision 25 years ago. The ones that did were clocked on the head by people who couldn&apos;t manage change.&quot; With Schuhkraft working from the top down and the NPL slowly building from the bottom up, the challenge is making both movements align. As Bresic says, &quot;Let&apos;s make sure we build a garage before we go and buy a Ferrari to put in it.&quot; Last week, Schuhkraft met with FGC for the first time to discuss the state of play. Palm Beach are ready to help in whatever way possible. It would be a stretch to say there is a consortium in place, but perhaps for the first time in Gold Coast football history, all the game&apos;s main stakeholders are on the same page.  &quot;I don&apos;t give in, I don&apos;t give up, and until we&apos;ve got an A-League franchise here, I won&apos;t be giving up,&quot; Schuhkraft said. &quot;We have all the elements. It&apos;s now about how well we can execute this over the next five to seven years. That&apos;s one of the gifts I&apos;d love to give this city because on the back end of that will be many, many rewards that people might not understand today, but once it&apos;s up and running, they&apos;ll get it.&quot;", "title": "Is the Gold Coast ready to welcome an A-League franchise again?", "sentences": ["He introduced Tate to the Crown Prince of Dubai, Sheikh Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid al Maktoum, who now get along famously, going skydiving together during Tate&apos;s recent self-funded trip to the United Arab Emirates.", "The Gold Coast and Dubai are sister cities and that relationship has helped open a lot of doors."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-16T21:43:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/apr/17/talking-horses-best-bets-racing-news", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport", "Horse racing tips"], "article": "Today&apos;s best bets, by Greg Wood Toormore was the best juvenile of 2013 and Richard Hannon, his trainer, suggested at Newmarket on Wednesday that he will be ready to do himself justice in the Craven Stakes this afternoon. The market, however, does not seem convinced, and having drifted from odds-on on Wednesday evening, Toormore can now be backed at even-money for Britain&apos;s principal trial for the 2,000 Guineas. Timeform&apos;s ratings offer some explanation, however, as Toormore has a 3lb penalty to carry as a result of his success in the National Stakes at The Curragh last year and the figures from Halifax suggest that Be Ready (4.05), the second-favourite, has only a couple more pounds to find to give Toormore a serious race. Saeed bin Suroor&apos;s string has been in fine form all year \u2013 he beat Mike de Kock to be the top trainer at the Dubai Carnival \u2013 and True Story&apos;s win in the Feilden here on Wednesday suggested that his horses have returned to England in similar heart. He lost his maiden status in a Listed event at Doncaster last September, a sign of the regard in which he is held, and is worth an interest at around 2-1 to confirm himself a high-class three-year-old. Hamza (nap 3.30) was third home in the Prix de l&apos;Abbaye on his final start last season and also put up an excellent performance in a handicap over today&apos;s course and distance. He ran well at Meydan on World Cup night too and can get the better of Aljamaaheer, who drops back to sprinting for the first time since his juvenile debut three seasons ago. Seagull Star (2.55) had Johann Strauss back in fourth place when making a successful debut at Newmarket last season. He has not been seen since, while Johann Strauss has gone on to run well in Group One company, but at the prices, William Haggas&apos;s runner can be backed to confirm the excellent impression of his debut win. At Cheltenham, Cailin Annamh (3.15) has form on decent ground and looks the class act in a fiercely competitive handicap, having lined up against Quevega in the Mares&apos; Hurdle at Cheltenham last month. At Ripon, meanwhile, Maven (next best 3.40), who put up the best performance of her career over today&apos;s course and distance last summer, can build on her promising sixth place at Doncaster&apos;s Lincoln meeting.

The fact that the second horse home was The Grey Gatsby, a 16-1 outsider, contributed to Toormore&apos;s drift in the market, but at the start of what promises to be a long season of competition at the highest level, it would have been greedy for either punters or layers to expect anything more. As Richard Hannon, Toormore&apos;s trainer, pointed out, his colt won his first two races last season by a neck. &quot;You&apos;ve never gone &apos;wow&apos;,&quot; Hannon said. &quot;He does it the hard way.&quot; But Toormore does get it done, so far at least, and has not forgotten how to win over the course of the winter.

Yet grit can be a potent weapon too on the run to the line in the Classic, and Toormore does not look the sort to wilt under pressure. &quot;He&apos;ll come on a lot, all of ours need a trial and he&apos;s no different,&quot; Hannon said. &quot;He needed it mentally as well as physically. &quot;He&apos;s not a flashy horse, he&apos;s not going to come here and win six or seven lengths, even if he could [but] Ryan [Moore, his jockey] was happy with him all the way. He gave him a slap and he knuckled down and did his job for a bit, then gave him another slap and he went on again. He was carrying a penalty there too. &quot;People might say that the runner-up is a bit close, but this horse won a head first time, a head second time beating a Breeders&apos; Cup winner [Outstrip] and his most impressive performance was in Ireland [in the Group One National Stakes] where he won a couple of lengths.&quot; The big disappointment in the Craven Stakes was the performance of Be Ready, the second-favourite, who ran no sort of race and came home tailed off. It was a rare setback for the Godolphin operation over the course of the two-day meeting, however, and both Saeed bin Suroor and Charlie Appleby, Godolphin&apos;s principal trainers, had winners on Thursday&apos;s card. Suroor took the Wood Ditton Stakes, for unraced three-year-olds, with Basem, while Appleby won nearly \u00a385,000 as Sudden Wonder landed the \u00a3200,000 Tattersalls Millions Trophy over a mile and a quarter. Hamza, third home in the Prix de l&apos;Abbaye on Arc day, took the Group Three Abernant Stakes under a positive ride by Jamie Spencer, beating Es Que Love by half a length with Aljamaheer, dropping back to sprinting for the first time in three seasons, finishing fast into third. &quot;He&apos;s very tough,&quot; Kevin Ryan, Hamza&apos;s trainer, said. &quot;He had a hard race in Dubai [last month] but he&apos;s very game and genuine and he loves this track as well. Another horse came to him and he&apos;s gone again.&quot; Mull Of Killough, another horse who loves Newmarket, took the Group Three Earl Of Sefton Stakes for the second year running. &quot;I don&apos;t know why he likes it here so much,&quot; Jane Chapple-Hyam, who trains the gelding less than a mile from the track, said afterwards. &quot;Perhaps he knows that he can run on home for his bananas.&quot;", "title": "Toormore drifts in 2,000 Guineas betting despite winning Craven Stakes", "sentences": ["&quot;He had a hard race in Dubai [last month] but he&apos;s very game and genuine and he loves this track as well."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-17T17:45:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/17/kevin-pietersen-delhi-ipl-injury", "tags": ["Kevin Pietersen", "IPL", "Twenty20", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "Kevin Pietersen&apos;s comeback in the Indian Premier League looks set to be delayed further after it emerged he is unlikely to be fit for the Delhi Daredevils&apos; second game of the tournament on Saturday. The 33-year-old was ruled out of his side&apos;s opening defeat to Bangalore in Sharjah on Thursday with the finger injury he sustained in pre-season with Surrey. It appears Pietersen, installed as captain by coach Gary Kirsten after he signed an \u00a3880,000 deal with Delhi in February, will miss the Daredevils&apos; second match against Kolkata in Dubai. Publicly Delhi have refused to rule Pietersen out of that game, yet privately team officials confirmed they are unwilling to risk their star attraction so early in the tournament. Pietersen is eager to embark on a new chapter in his controversial career as a globetrotting t20 specialist after he was sacked by England following last winter&apos;s Ashes whitewash in Australia. However, he has been frustrated by the bruised little finger on his right hand, meaning unless he makes a remarkable recovery overnight, he is set for a further wait before he can lead his side in the tournament. Delhi&apos;s caution is exacerbated by the fact another blow to the digit could rule the South African-born batsman out of the second half of the tournament next month, when it returns to India following general elections. Asked on Twitter about the injury, Pietersen replied: &quot;I&apos;ll be back ASAP. Not risking it in first game. Injuries can be frustrating for everyone, but I&apos;m a believer in \u2013 everything happens for a reason!&quot; Team-mate JP Duminy said: &quot;Kevin&apos;s obviously a big loss to our team, he&apos;s our captain so the sooner he&apos;s back the better.&quot; Duminy top-scored for Delhi with 67 off 48 balls but it wasn&apos;t enough to prevent them from an eight-wicket defeat. Bangalore captain Virat Kohli, who was unable to call on West Indian power hitter Chris Gayle because of a back injury, helped his side cruise to their target of 146 with 20 balls to spare. Kohli, man of the tournament at the recent World Twenty20 in Bangladesh, struck 49 from 38 balls to underline his status as arguably the best batsman in the world right now across all three formats. Yet he was actually outshone for once, by Yuvraj Singh, who smashed 52 off 29 balls during an unbroken 84-run stand with his captain. It was a welcome return to form for Yuvraj, whose horror display in the World T20 final against Sri Lanka, when he scored just 11 off 21 balls, cost India the title and saw him receive death threats from irate fans. Earlier, Dinesh Karthik lost the toss and saw his side reduced to 17 for three and 35 for four before Duminy and Ross Taylor put on 110 from the last 78 balls of the innings to take the Daredevils to 145 for four after 20 overs. However, it never looked enough for a Delhi side who were already reeling from the loss of their injured captain.", "title": "Kevin Pietersen set to miss second Delhi IPL match with finger injury", "sentences": ["It appears Pietersen, installed as captain by coach Gary Kirsten after he signed an \u00a3880,000 deal with Delhi in February, will miss the Daredevils&apos; second match against Kolkata in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-17T20:00:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/apr/18/asgkan-dejagah-felix-magath-fulham", "tags": ["Fulham", "Felix Magath", "Football", "Wolfsburg", "European club football", "Sport"], "article": "Ashkan Dejagah cannot help but chuckle at the similarities. A team forlorn, enduring a trauma of a season under three different managers, has summoned the last, Felix Magath, in desperation with disaster looming large. His is a near-impossible task, with an established member of the elite teetering on the brink and four games left to define a campaign. &quot;Only it was actually a much worse situation back then,&quot; says the winger. &quot;We had no momentum, and had forgotten how to win. But we still did it. Felix still did it.&quot; For Fulham in the three weeks ahead, read VfL Wolfsburg three years ago. Bundesliga champions in 2009 with Magath in charge, Die W\u00f6lfe had stumbled under Steve McClaren and plunged further over the brief interim stewardship of Pierre Littbarski. They were last but one in the division when Magath was rehired in mid-March, two days after his sacking at struggling Schalke, but none of his first four matches were won and Wolfsburg were left pinning hopes on the run-in. Then came the revival. Three of those last four games were won, a nine-point haul enough to hold off a resurgent Borussia M\u00f6nchengladbach. Dejagah witnessed that upsurge first-hand as a member of Magath&apos;s side, a player flung on from the bench at Hoffenheim on the final day with the scores level and everything in the balance, before Mario Mandzukic and Grafite completed the visitors&apos; scoring. These days the Iranian and the man once nicknamed &quot;the Torturer&quot; by his overworked players are reunited, the former&apos;s role again often one of impact substitute \u2013 largely owing to a niggling groin injury \u2013 and with the last batch of fixtures critical: Tottenham Hotspur away , then Hull, Stoke and Crystal Palace. After Martin Jol and Ren\u00e9 Meulensteen, it is up to Magath to inspire the recovery. &quot;And winning the last two games has given us the belief and confidence,&quot; Dejagah says. &quot;Fulham has to play in the Premier League and Felix Magath is the right manager to achieve that. A good appointment, a good option. &quot;Back home in Germany he is a big name, a manager who has won championships with Bayern Munich and Wolfsburg, a man with a reputation. He has the ability to relax people, to get them focused. He knows when the time is to work, or to make &apos;funnies&apos;. He recognises the balance needed, and it&apos;s important to have someone who has been through this before. At Wolfsburg we needed a win on the last day [to avoid a relegation play-off] and he saw us through it. He speaks a lot to his players, reassures them, reminds us what our jobs are. The most difficult thing in this situation is the pressure, what happens in here [he taps his head], but he releases that just by talking to us. We believed before the Norwich game, and after the game we believed even more. We won at Tottenham last season, so we have a chance.&quot; Dejagah&apos;s attitude is almost matter of fact, that of a player who has seen this before and will endure the drama in the unswerving belief his team will emerge triumphant. Pressure might eat away at others but this is a 27-year-old who has endured much over a career that has taken in three clubs and two national setups, his allegiances inked on his body: his right forearm sports the word &quot;Teheran&quot;, the German spelling of the city where he was born in 1986; his left arm &quot;Berlin&quot;, where he grew up and played for Hertha. His neck is tattooed with the mantra: &quot;Never forget where you&apos;re from&quot;. He had been capped from junior to under-21 level by Germany, winning the 2009 European Championship after moving to Wolfsburg, before his club career endured a lull, his progress checked by injury, and a wave of younger players leapfrogged him in the pecking order. &quot;Germany had a lot coming through, a new generation, so that was a hard situation for me but I&apos;d always had the option to play for Iran. Both my parents are Iranian. My wife, like me, is Iranian but brought up in Germany, so we all spoke and I followed my heart. I was born in Tehran. I have a lot of family there. I still count Iran and Germany as &apos;my countries&apos;, but I&apos;m proud to represent Iran: a beautiful country whose fans love football. Sometimes people \u2013 team-mates, friends \u2013 ask me: &apos;How is it there?&apos; I can just say it&apos;s a nice country with nice people. Other things, I don&apos;t want to speak about. Other things \u2026 I go there to play football, to see my family, to represent my country. That is what I know. I&apos;m proud to play for Iran but a lot of people see just the negatives, the things that are reported in the news. That&apos;s why they&apos;re scared a bit about Iran. I can just say the Iranian people are very nice, and it&apos;s my country.&quot; That represents the extent to which Dejagah is prepared to dip into politics, his caution an acknowledgement Iran \u2013 where he established his career \u2013 is still considered a pariah state by the west. His reticence is understandable. It is seven years since he pulled out of a trip to Tel Aviv with Germany&apos;s Under-21s, a decision accepted by the coaching hierarchy and born of concern at potential reprisals on his family in Iran, whose government have not recognised Israel since the 1979 December Revolution. Iranian athletes have invented mysterious ailments to swerve similar dilemmas over the years, with Dejagah guilty most obviously of being too honest. Yet his withdrawal drew stinging criticism from Germany&apos;s Central Council of Jews and politicians in his adopted country. Recollection prompts a shudder of apprehension. &quot;This was a long time ago,&quot; he says. &quot;It is in the past. Yes, it helped me grow up but now I only look to the future.&quot; That future, beyond the culmination of the English domestic season, is a World Cup in Brazil where Iran, ranked 37 by Fifa and under Carlos Queiroz&apos;s stewardship, will attempt to unsettle Argentina, the Africa Cup of Nations champions Nigeria and the newcomers, Bosnia and Herzegovina. &quot;Team Melli&quot; have added talent from the Iranian diaspora to their squad \u2013 Dejagah, Daniel Davari, Reza Ghoochannejhad and Steven Beitashour, born in San Jose, California and currently with Vancouver Whitecaps \u2013 with Queiroz having called in his contacts to secure friendlies with Belarus, Montenegro and Angola as preparation next month. &quot;I know it&apos;s not easy to take friendly games with Iran but Queiroz has experience,&quot; says Dejagah, who scored twice on debut against Qatar. &quot;That&apos;s why he can arrange these games. It&apos;s an unbelievable thing for Iran, to be in Brazil. &quot;The whole country is proud, even if we felt obliged to qualify. We had 100,000 people in the national stadium screaming for us, and we are the second best team in Asia after Japan. But at the tournament itself, no pressure. We can go there and just play. If we get into the next round, it&apos;ll be the first time for Iran. Argentina will go through as group winners, but against Nigeria and Bosnia we have a chance. Why not? We have a talented team. &quot;I know there are not as many Iranians playing in &apos;big&apos; leagues now, particularly in the Bundesliga. There is Reza [at Charlton] also here but it&apos;s hard for our younger players to make names for themselves. I was luckier, growing up in Germany, but not many scouts go to Iran to watch games. Maybe they come from teams in Dubai or Qatar but you need a lot of luck to be spotted and given an opportunity by a European team. That&apos;s why I hope, in this World Cup, our players show the world how good they are.&quot; Until that pool of talent is tapped, Dejagah is a lonely ambassador for his country, a cult figure at Craven Cottage and an \u00e9migr\u00e9 with survival on his mind. &quot;If we stay up with Felix Magath in charge of us, Fulham will surprise a few teams with what we might achieve. Look at Wolfsburg: after that fight against relegation, we almost qualified for Europe the following season.&quot; The German club finished eighth, four points off the Europa League qualification places. Magath, and Dejagah, are hoping history repeats itself. Ashkan Dejagah was speaking at an event for Marathonbet, main sponsor of Fulham.

With Jonathan Trott&apos;s continuing battle with his stress-related illness placing his international future in considerable doubt, Kevin Pietersen&apos;s sacking and the indifferent contributions of Jonny Bairstow, Michael Carberry, Gary Ballance, Joe Root and Matt Prior during the Ashes tour, realistically there are England positions vacant at opener, No4, No5 and wicketkeeper. The door to the Test team is not just ajar, it is hanging off its hinges and Morgan, like plenty of others, is determined to seize his chance to stride back in. &quot;The appetite for county cricket is there, the hunger is there, with these opportunities that are arising,&quot; the 27-year-old says. &quot;It&apos;s brilliant. I&apos;ve never played county cricket before when there&apos;s been this much hype behind it. It&apos;s great for the game. &quot;Every year is a big year but with opportunities like this in the side, I think everybody sees it as a huge opportunity to take any role that they can in the England team. Certainly having played a bit in the past and really enjoyed my time in the Test team, I&apos;d like to be back involved.&quot; Ian Bell will presumably continue at No3 and Ben Stokes, if his recovery from a broken wrist continues to run on schedule, is pencilled in at No6 rather than in a third seamer&apos;s role, but the No5 spot has Morgan&apos;s name written all over it. The Middlesex batsman has not played in the England side since being spun unceremoniously out of the equation by Pakistan&apos;s Saeed Ajmal and Abdur Rehman in Dubai in February 2012. A focus on the shorter forms of the game followed but the recent state of flux around the England setup was enough to persuade him to make a late U-turn and forgo the riches of the Indian Premier League for the first time since 2009 in an attempt to win his place back in the XI. &quot;I was in the unique position in the interim between applying to go into the IPL auction and the auction itself,&quot; he said. &quot;You&apos;re legally binded to commit to that contract. And then things happened where positions [in the England team] were in question and the thing happened with Kev. I spent a bit of time thinking about it and I had a meeting with Paul Downton [the managing director of England cricket] and discussed the possibility of maybe withdrawing. The ECB were very accommodating, they worked with the BCCI in getting me withdrawn and that was pretty much it,it was as simple as that.&quot; Morgan began his first County Championship spring in five years first acclimatising to the differences between April in Britain and April in India \u2013 &quot;It&apos;s a bit colder than Chennai&quot; \u2013 and then landing a confident first blow in the battle for a Test spot with a fluent 86 in a partnership of 203 with another England hopeful, Sam Robson, against Nottinghamshire at Lord&apos;s. His team-mate&apos;s performance was enough to convince him that the 24-year-old born in New South Wales is ready for the Test arena. &quot;Watching him this week, absolutely. He was very calm at the crease, knew his game inside out, his ruthlessness of just wanting to score runs was very impressive,&quot;Morgan says. &quot;If I was choosing the team tomorrow I&apos;d pick him.&quot; While Robson is at the start of his Test career, Morgan admits that there were &quot;some stages&quot; when he thought that his own was over after only 16 caps. &quot;In a way, when you&apos;re out of the side you feel so far away from playing, it&apos;s quite strange really,&quot; he says. &quot;But in many ways I look back at how I got there, and it literally happened just like that. I went from having a good one-day year, we won the T20 World Cup [in 2010], came back played a game for Middlesex, and then I was playing Test cricket. I know things can turn around as quickly as that.&quot; But, at two years and counting, it has not been a particularly quick turnaround since Morgan was consigned to ODI and T20 specialism. He can take heart from the fact that a plethora of players \u2013 from Graham Gooch and Matthew Hayden to Carl Hooper and Andrew Strauss \u2013 only truly bloomed in Test cricket in the second half of their 20s. And despite his exile, Morgan has no regrets about putting the emphasis of his career on the 50- and 20-over game. &quot;I don&apos;t think a lesser stint at the IPL, an extra two or three months, April months, in England would have helped me in any shape or form,&quot; he said. &quot;In fact, I think playing in front of 80,000 people, being the overseas player, playing under pressure, helps you far more in the long term than worrying about your technique in April.&quot; Eoin Morgan was speaking in the buildup to the NatWest T20 Blast season, which starts on Friday 16 May.

Paul Downton, who made the decision to end Pietersen&apos;s international career shortly after taking over as the managing director of England cricket, said that the 33-year-old had become &quot;disconnected&quot; and &quot;disengaged&quot; from his team-mates during the dog days of the Ashes mauling in Australia, and that everybody he consulted agreed that he was no longer worth the extra effort required to &quot;accommodate Kevin&quot;. Downton also said that it had been Pietersen&apos;s decision to terminate his England contract, and ruled out any remote possibility that he might yet play again \u2013 one that Pietersen had alluded to in an ambiguous tweet in response to Moores&apos;s appointment, saying: &quot;Everyone deserves a 2nd chance.&quot; &quot;I don&apos;t see any intention of going back,&quot; said Downton. &quot;The sooner we understand that Kevin has had his time, the better.&quot; When asked for a response to Pietersen&apos;s message, Moores said: &quot;Good tweet. An important point to make is that I never fell out with Kevin \u2013 he fell out with me. I moved on quickly, went to coach a great club at Lancashire. I think that&apos;s a strength of mine, I prefer to move forward.&quot; Downton said &quot;there is no smoking gun, no specific issues&quot; surrounding Pietersen, but the picture he painted was vivid. &quot;I arrived in Sydney on 31 December and it was clear from Andy Flower that there were two issues we were facing,&quot; said Downton, taking questions for the first time since he succeeded Hugh Morris at the turn of the year. &quot;He [Flower] was uncertain about his future \u2013 and what were we going to do about Kevin?&quot; Downton was even talking in handy headlines. &quot;The issue was a senior player had got disconnected from the team. I spent two to three weeks speaking to all the coaches on the trip and the senior players about the situation. To the captain, to the national selector, and we came to the conclusion that if England are going to rebuild after a dispiriting 5-0 loss then we had to make a decision. Not for the next three months but for the future, the next two, three or five years. &quot;We had to build a new team with core values and it was decided that wouldn&apos;t happen with Kevin in the side. I don&apos;t see any intention of going back.&quot; Pietersen had been &quot;scoring runs for 10 years&quot; for the team but, whereas in the past England were &quot;a strong side with strong leadership that could accommodate Kevin&quot;, now &quot;that balance has shifted and a new side won&apos;t accommodate Kevin&quot;. &quot;Watch what happened in Australia,&quot; Downton continued, most devastatingly of all. &quot;I watched every ball of [the fifth Test in] Sydney, and I have never seen anyone so disengaged from what was going on. What you need from a senior player is backing and support and everybody working together, but we had got to a stage where that was no longer the case. &quot;We sat down, we talked about it over a number of hours, Kevin and I and his advisers, and he was the one in the end who wanted to terminate his contract, and we came to an agreement to do that.&quot; Pietersen is currently in Dubai where an injured finger has ruled him out of the first two Indian Premier League fixtures for his Delhi Daredevils. Cook welcomed the appointment of a man Downton had described as &quot;the outstanding coach of his generation&quot;, with whom the captain worked closely in his early days at the National Cricket Academy and with the England Lions. &quot;I&apos;ve been a bit in limbo the last couple of months so to finally get a new leadership group in place and be part of that is an exciting time,&quot; said Cook, who was told that he would be teaming up again with Moores when eating a hot dog on Good Friday afternoon \u2013 but expects to have lengthier discussions in the next few days over something more substantial. Moores confirmed that he would be using Flower, who has moved upstairs to a new role as technical director for elite performance and will be based at the academy in Loughborough, as &quot;a fantastic resource&quot; and &quot;a sounding board&quot;. There is no role in the new setup for Ashley Giles, who has been politely but brutally dumped, 20 months after being plucked from Warwickshire and earmarked as Flower&apos;s successor. &quot;No, the defeat to Holland didn&apos;t cost Ashley his job,&quot; said Downton, denying the common assumption that it was England&apos;s surprise defeat at the end of an underwhelming World Twenty20 campaign in Bangladesh that tilted the odds in Moores&apos;s favour. &quot;I drove to see him yesterday and he was obviously extremely disappointed not to be appointed to this role. In all honesty this has just come a bit too early for Ashley. He&apos;s been a coach since 2007, and you compare with Peter who has coached for the last 16 years and has a vast range of experience. What I said to Ashley yesterday was that this is by no means the end. I&apos;d be surprised if Ashley doesn&apos;t come back and maybe in the future he will be the England coach.&quot;", "title": "'No specific issues' behind Kevin Pietersen axing, says Paul Downton", "sentences": ["&quot;We sat down, we talked about it over a number of hours, Kevin and I and his advisers, and he was the one in the end who wanted to terminate his contract, and we came to an agreement to do that.&quot; Pietersen is currently in Dubai where an injured finger has ruled him out of the first two Indian Premier League fixtures for his Delhi Daredevils."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-19T13:43:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/19/australia-david-warner-jonathan-trott-england-ashes", "tags": ["David Warner", "Jonathan Trott", "England cricket team", "Australia cricket team", "Cricket", "IPL", "Sport", "Australia sport"], "article": "David Warner tells it like he sees it. Which is exactly what he did last November when, during the opening Ashes Test in Brisbane, he described Jonathan Trott as &quot;weak&quot;. The outspoken Australia opener was not to know Trott was going through such personal turmoil that he would fly home after the match with what England termed a &quot;stress-related illness&quot; and Trott later described as &quot;burnout&quot;. Warner was telling it like it was. Trott had played Mitchell Johnson&apos;s extreme pace poorly. He was not the only one. As a collective unit, England&apos;s batsmen probably did have the &quot;scared eyes&quot; Warner spoke of. However, his comments came from a position of ignorance. Nobody was to know that Trott&apos;s problems were far bigger than the game. That is why he was forced to take an extended break from cricket after playing one County Championship match for Warwickshire. Warner, like everyone, is no longer speaking from a position of ignorance and wishes Trott well in his recovery. Speaking in Dubai, where he is playing in the Indian Premier League for Hyderabad, Warner says: &quot;It&apos;s always disappointing to hear something like that about anyone. It doesn&apos;t matter who they are or what job it is. &quot;If you feel like you can&apos;t give 100% and commit 100% then he&apos;s done the right thing. What happened to him last year and what he said in his recent interview shows he&apos;s got problems. I wish him all the best and I hope he can get through this and get back on the park. If not, I wish him the best for his future endeavours.&quot; Trott&apos;s priority for now is his own wellbeing. But Warner hopes the man who was England&apos;s rock at No3 will one day be able to return to the game \u2013 possibly even for next year&apos;s Ashes series. &quot;If he gets the opportunity to play again and represent England on the park it&apos;ll be a good tussle again,&quot; he says. There would be no special treatment for Trott though. &quot;If he does, we&apos;re going to keep playing the brand of cricket we do, with that aggressive, in-your-face attitude.&quot; Asked if he now regretted his comments at the Gabba, Warner says: &quot;I&apos;ve always been as honest as I can in the media and I&apos;ll continue to do that. But my comments were probably over the top and at that time, when I didn&apos;t know there was a problem with Trott, I said what I said. But that&apos;s in the past now and we&apos;ve moved on from that.&quot; Whatever the make-up of England&apos;s side next summer, and there will be significant changes from the one whitewashed by Australia in the last series, it will be led by Peter Moores in his new role as head coach. It would take something as extraordinary as Moores&apos;s fall-out with the then captain Kevin Pietersen during his first spell in charge of England in 2009 for that not to be the case. Warner believes the former Lancashire coach will do a good job second time around. &quot;I&apos;ve read some stories about him and KP,&quot; he says. &quot;But he&apos;s a class coach and I&apos;m pretty sure he&apos;ll do well for England. What&apos;s in the past is in the past and I&apos;m sure he&apos;ll do a fantastic job for England.&quot; Does Warner hope the new coach make England more competitive by the time Australia visit? &quot;We know they&apos;re always competitive,&quot; says Warner, perhaps momentarily forgetting the whitewash in Australia. &quot;We know the type of opposition they are, the quality they&apos;ve got and the players they&apos;re producing. We know they&apos;re always going to put up a good fight and at the end of the day the best eleven that goes out and plays best will win that Ashes.&quot; From the low point of his dust-up with Joe Root in a Birmingham bar last June \u2013 an act that led to him being temporarily expelled from Australia&apos;s tour party \u2013 Warner&apos;s stock has since risen to stratospheric levels. His 528 runs that did so much to vanquish England were followed by another 543 \u2013 this time in three Tests \u2013 against South Africa. Twin centuries in the final match in Cape Town not only won the series for Australia but underlined Warner&apos;s status as the most explosive batsman in Test cricket. That was once the mantle of Pietersen, who was sacked by England in January and, like the Australian, is currently in the Gulf, as captain of Delhi Daredevils in the Indian Premier League. Pietersen has yet to play in this year&apos;s tournament after a finger injury ruled him out of a second successive game on Saturday night, this time against Kolkata. With his mind on next year&apos;s Ashes, Warner is glad Pietersen is unlikely to face Australia again. &quot;It&apos;s a massive bonus for us, 100%,&quot; says Warner. &quot;He&apos;s left a big hole there for them to fill. He&apos;s played a great part for England over many years and to see him go out like that, as a cricket person, is quite sad. If that was the right decision for them, well they&apos;ve done it. There&apos;s nothing else KP can do.&quot; After the IPL, which moves back to India at the end of the month following the general election, Warner&apos;s next big challenge is fatherhood. The 27-year-old has transformed his life off the field since meeting Candice Falzon, a professional ironwoman. They were engaged last month and the effects of that relationship on the field have been startling. &quot;The turnaround has definitely come with maturity and learning from your mistakes,&quot; Warner says. &quot;I&apos;m a much more mature cricketer and person. At the moment my life&apos;s in a great place, I have a wonderful fiancee who has supported me and I have a kid on the way, so I&apos;m starting a family.&quot; It is indeed a remarkable turnaround and one that makes that run-in with Root in the Walkabout seem an eternity ago.", "title": "Australia's David Warner sympathetic with plight of Jonathan Trott", "sentences": ["Speaking in Dubai, where he is playing in the Indian Premier League for Hyderabad, Warner says: &quot;It&apos;s always disappointing to hear something like that about anyone."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-19T21:00:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/apr/23/live-racing-23-april-2014", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Richard Hughes", "Sport"], "article": "11.30am Hughes given all-clear to return at Sandown on Friday Tony Paley: Richard Hughes has been given the all-clear to return to race-riding at Sandown on Friday.

The best bet of the day is the Victor Dartnall-trained Ut Majeur Aulmes (3.50) in the two-mile handicap chase. The selection looks the sort to make a better chaser than hurdler and looks on a workable mark over the bigger obstacles given his debut run over fences at Uttoxeter last time. There&apos;s a small field for the next race on the card but there should be a decent pace on and that will suit Strongpoint (4.25). This is a drop in class for the Irish raider following runs at the Cheltenham Festival and at Aintree and he should be more at home in this company.

From his brutally no-nonsense haircut and ramrod straight posture to an infamous inability to suffer fools, the 50-year-old who has led Leicester City to the Championship title looks every inch the military type. Beneath the gruff, often taciturn exterior Pearson proves rather less easy to stereotype. Where managerial peers holiday in Dubai, Barbados or southern Spain, the former Sheffield Wednesday and Middlesbrough centre-half prefers to go walking in Eastern Europe. If you see him at an airport he is more likely to be en route to Bucharest than Puerto Ban\u00fas. Romania&apos;s Carpathian mountains are a particular favourite despite Pearson having been lucky to survive on one break when, climbing alone, he was set upon by a pack of five wild dogs. Saved by a combination of his walking pole, which he poked into their eyes, and a nearby bed of nettles, which he steered the dogs into, Leicester&apos;s manager lived to fight another day. At least nothing in the Premier League next season can possibly be remotely as stressful for a keen student of military history who must imbue a well organised, highly efficient, physically strong and commendably spirited Championship side with a guile-infused Premier League sheen. Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Leicester&apos;s Thai polo loving, chairman, owner and billionaire businessman \u2013 he is Thailand&apos;s 11th richest man \u2013 is expected to provide a reasonable budget after effectively wiping out the club&apos;s \u00a3103m debt courtesy of a large-scale share conversion. Even so, Leicester fans are worried that Kasper Schmeichel, the son of Peter and another fine goalkeeper, is out of contract and may well leave; AC Milan are said to be interested. Pearson&apos;s 4-4-2 formation, a system he switched to after an ill-fated early season experiment with 3-5-2 , worked perfectly in the second tier but something more sophisticated involving five in midfield will probably have to be implemented next season. David Nugent and Jamie Vardy will be hoping the manager sticks with twin strikers after scoring 35 goals between them this season. While Nugent, still an expert penalty taker, won a senior England cap, the 27-year-old Vardy was playing non-league football at Fleetwood only two years ago. Might Vardy turn into the new Grant Holt or Rickie Lambert? If the French winger Anthony Knockaert and the midfielder Danny Drinkwater should thrive in elite company, there are question marks about several others. Will Wes Morgan be a similarly commanding centre-half when confronted with Luis Su\u00e1rez and company? Can Paul Konchesky prove he is not finished at the top level after all? Leicester will find the Premier League&apos;s topography very different from 2004 when they last resided in the top division. So much has changed that it is hard to imagine the famous side Martin O&apos;Neill built at the club&apos;s old Filbert Street home and then led to four straight top-10 finishes and three League Cup finals (two of which were won) between 1997 and 2000 prospering in today&apos;s environment. Since those halcyon days Leicester&apos;s star fell so low that the team briefly dropped into League One before Pearson led them back to the Championship in 2009. He made way for Sven-Goran Eriksson only to be persuaded to return after the former England coach&apos;s appointment turned into an expensive failure. When last season&apos;s promotion bid faltered, Pearson was again rumoured to be under pressure but the board held its nerve and the owner&apos;s loyalty has been rewarded. A &quot;grounded&quot; manager, who loathes the cult of celebrity and routinely spends days off walking in the Peak District hills near his home in Sheffield before taking his family to their local pub for the evening, can serve only as a welcome antidote to the antics of Jos\u00e9 Mourinho and company in the Premier League. In some ways Pearson is a 21st century managerial version of his great mentor, friend and fellow Sheffield resident Howard Wilkinson, with whom he has quite a lot in common. It would be very good to see him emulating some of his old Wednesday boss&apos;s success and flying the flag for English managers at the highest level. Not to mention emphasising that the RAF&apos;s loss is football&apos;s gain.", "title": "Nigel Pearson: Premier League holds no fears for Leicester City manager | Louise Taylor", "sentences": ["Where managerial peers holiday in Dubai, Barbados or southern Spain, the former Sheffield Wednesday and Middlesbrough centre-half prefers to go walking in Eastern Europe."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-23T14:07:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/conflict-free-minerals-ruling-litigation-apple-intel", "tags": ["Guardian sustainable business", "Brand", "Business", "Corporate social responsibility", "Ethical business"], "article": "The illegal trade of tantalum, tungsten, tin and gold from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and surrounding countries is fueling conflict in central Africa. Sales of these conflict minerals help fund arms for militias, ultimately leading to human rights abuses. Meanwhile, US companies that use these metals are facing growing pressure to find sources that are conflict-free. An Securities and Exchange Commission rule, scheduled to take effect June 2, would require the vast majority of US companies to disclose whether they use conflict minerals from the region.  Now the SEC rule has come under fire: A US appeals court last week ruled that part of the regulation \u2013 a provision requiring companies to state whether their products use conflict minerals \u2013 is unconstitutional. Some lawmakers are urging the SEC to move forward with the rest of the disclosure rule, but it&apos;s unclear how the commission will proceed, and ongoing litigation adds to the uncertainty about exactly how the conflict minerals rule will take effect.  The good news for companies is that compliance with these new regulations just got easier. In January, the Conflict Free Sourcing Initiative (CFSI) announced the existence of certified conflict-free smelters for all four of the conflict minerals. A key step in the supply chain, smelters turn rocks into purified metals for use in electronics. Tungsten was the last of the minerals to gain a verified smelter, and more smelters are expected in the coming months. As of 3 April, there were nearly 80 conflict-free smelters. Some big name companies are taking their efforts a step further. Apple has started publicizing which of its suppliers may be sourcing minerals from conflict zones. The first list showed 104 smelters that were not yet verified as safe. The company also has vowed to go completely conflict-free by the end of 2014, meaning that all of its minerals will come from verifiable sources. Intel also recently announced that all of its microprocessors released in 2014 will be conflict-free.  Conflict minerals 101 Tantalum     Tantalum. Photograph: Wikimedia    Tantalum is a crucial ingredient in electronics manufacturing. In fact, half of all mined tantalum goes into electronics, and it is found in almost all electronic equipment, including mobile phones, laptops and hard drives. It is also used on an industrial scale, in jet engines, ships and missiles.  Tantalum can hold the highest electrical charge of any metal, which makes it an ideal component for a device called a capacitor, which stores and releases an electric charge. An average mobile phone only contains about 40mg of tantalum \u2013 a relatively insignificant amount, until one considers the hundreds of millions of devices in use. According to the SEC, central Africa accounts for 15-20% of the world&apos;s tantalum supply, although some reports put the figure closer to 50%. The richest deposits of coltan, the naturally-occurring ore that tantalum is extracted from, are found in eastern Congo, where mining is done by hand.  In 2012, tantalum became the first mineral to gain a conflict-free smelter. And, according to the CFSI database, there are currently 26 conflict-free tantalum smelters, located predominantly in China and the US.  For an electronics company looking to clean up its supply chain, tracing its tantalum is a good place to start. Apple, for instance, focused its initial supply chain cleanup efforts on tantalum, and announced in February 2014 that all of its tantalum smelters were validated as conflict-free.  &quot;Tantalum is the one that has the biggest impact because it&apos;s in so many electronics,&quot; said Jess Kraus, chief executive of Source Intelligence, a company that helps businesses improve the transparency of their suppliers. Tantalum is also the easiest to trace, because it is used in &quot;very specific circumstances&quot;, Kraus said. By comparison, tin is &quot;found in almost everything&quot;, from cellphones to toothpaste to pipes.  Tungsten      Tungsten. Photograph: Wikimedia    Tungsten, which is largely derived from wolframite or scheelite, has the highest melting point of any pure metal. Its conductivity, meaning its ability to hold an electric charge, makes it attractive to electronics manufacturers. Along with gold, it is commonly used to make computer chips.  However, only very small amounts of tungsten are used in electronics, which may be the reason that it was the last mineral to acquire a conflict-free smelter. &quot;Tungsten is not as widely used as tin or tantalum or even gold,&quot; said Sasha Lezhnev, a senior policy analyst at the Enough Project, a non-profit organization that monitors conflict around the world.  More than 80% of tungsten ore comes from China; by comparison, Africa produces only about 1% of the world&apos;s supply. And the DRC&apos;s share is even smaller: According to the US Geological Survey, it was only responsible for around 0.5% of the world&apos;s supply in 2009.  The first conflict-free tungsten smelter came about largely thanks to Intel, Lezhnev said. Facing an internal deadline to produce a fully conflict-free product by the end of 2013, the company pushed the tungsten industry to look at conflict-free sourcing programs. &quot;It was a pretty heavy negotiation, but they successfully convinced them,&quot; Lezhnev said.  Due to anti-trust regulations, the CFSI website will not list a smelter or refiner unless there are at least three validated smelters for a mineral. CFSI has only validated one conflict-free tungsten smelter so far, an Asia-based factory owned by US company Global Tungsten and Powder Corp. As of 1 April, CFSI listed on its website 10 smelters that are either being audited or have agreed to be audited within the next two years. Observers expect at least some of these smelters to be certified within the next couple of months.  Tin     Tin. Photograph: Wikimedia    Tin is extracted from an ore called cassiterite, which is commonly found alongside coltan, the rock that produces tantalum. It is present in virtually all electronics, and roughly half of all tin mined today is used as a solder in circuit boards in products like mobile phones and laptops. While the DRC is Africa&apos;s largest tin producer, it only accounts for some 2.5% of the world&apos;s tin supplies. Indonesia is the largest exporter, and the country&apos;s Bangka Island is considered the world&apos;s tin capital. But illegal mining has devastated the island, causing environmental damage and dangerous conditions for miners.\u00a0 The explosion in demand for devices like smart phones has increased the demand for tin. In 2013, it was the best performing metal on the London Metal Exchange. Unfortunately, this popularity makes regulation difficult: Tin is probably the hardest mineral to trace in a company&apos;s supply chain because it is &quot;so ubiquitous&quot;, Kraus said.  &quot;It&apos;s hard to even tell what it&apos;s in,&quot; he said. &quot;The average company wouldn&apos;t know it&apos;s there.&quot; There are currently 11 certified tin smelters, located primarily in South America and Asia.\u00a0Soon after the US passed legislation requiring companies to report whether they used metals from central Africa, the majority of companies pulled out of the Congo completely. The country&apos;s tin production dropped dramatically, from 12,000 tons in 2009 to 2900 tons in 2011.  Gold     Gold mineral. Photograph: Flickr    Illicit profits from the 3T&apos;s (tantalum, tungsten and tin) have dropped by 65% since 2010, largely thanks to US legislation and pressure from technology companies. Rebel groups have since turned their attention to gold, which is now the most valuable mineral in the DRC, Lezhnev said. Thousands of unofficial mines operate throughout the country.  One of the main drivers of the illicit gold trade is the mineral&apos;s small size, which makes it is easy to smuggle across borders. Around $30,000 worth of gold can fit in a pocket and roughly $700,000 can be carried in a briefcase, according to a 2012 report from The Enough Project. By comparison, it would take 13 big trucks transporting 233 tons of tin ore to command the same value. According to the report, nearly four tons of gold were smuggled across the Congolese border to Uganda, Burundi and Tanzania in the first half of 2012. The illicit stocks were integrated in the local markets and then sold to international buyers.  A lot of the responsibility for gold now lies with the jewelry industry, which consumes about 50% of the world&apos;s gold, Lezhnev said. &quot;It&apos;s really time for them to step up,&quot; he said.  According to Julie Schindall, director of communications and stakeholder engagement at the Electronic Industry Citizenship Coalition, which oversees the CFSI, convincing the jewelry industry to clean up its supply chain is a &quot;long, ongoing conversation&quot;.  &quot;We&apos;re all aware gold continues to be a problem. It&apos;s very much an area we continue to collaborate on,&quot; she said.  Lezhnev said that clamping down on the trade in conflict gold requires a two-pronged strategy: praising the companies leading the charge against illegal mining, and sanctioning illicit gold traders.  There are bright spots on the horizon. Of the 82 conflict-free smelters, 42 work with gold. And it&apos;s getting harder for unregulated gold producers to hide their wares. Professional services firm Ernst &amp; Young recently discovered that a gold refiner in Dubai was hiding illegally mined gold from the Congo.  &quot;The more that happens&quot;, Lezhnev said, &quot;the better system we&apos;ll see getting put in place.&quot; Correction: This article was amended to correct the spelling of Sasha Lezhnev&apos;s name.

Thursday&apos;s best bets, by Greg Wood The new season opens at Brighton this evening with several course specialists on the card, and Pour La Victoire (6.25) is certainly worth an interest. The four-year-old has had three starts at Brighton, winning one and finishing second in the other two and is reunited with Robert Tart, who rode him to victory off a 4lb lower mark at last year&apos;s August meeting. Athletic (7.25) has yet to race at Brighton which is some cause for concern, and while he has made the frame in 50% of his starts on the all-weather, Andrew Reid&apos;s gelding has just a third-place finish to show for seven starts on turf. All the same, he has been admirably consistent over the winter and can race here off a lower turf mark and will take all the beating if he can translate just a little of his ability and consistency on the Polytrack circuit to this course. Five of the 12 declared runners at Beverley for the Rapid Lad Handicap, named in honour of a horse who was all but unbeatable over 10 furlongs here in the late 1980s, are previous winners over track and trip, but none can boast the recent form of Bling King (4.00). He has won his last two starts at a mile-and-a-quarter and can build on a recent second place over eight furlongs at Redcar now that he returns to 10. Henry Candy, the renowned trainer of sprinters, looks set for a good season with Music Master (3.10), who should start as he means to go on this term with victory at Warwick.

The 24 young Indonesians in attendance were scheming about how best to get themselves arrested. Young activists in developing countries usually have a steely righteousness about them. But there was a shyness in the room, and smiles spread with ease across the activists faces. The source of the shyness was Navicula, the most politically committed band in Indonesia.  They could have been with Sony BMG, their old label, or recording a song with collaborator, Alain Johannes, of Them Crooked Vultures and Queens of the Stone Age fame. Instead, they were deciding how best to travel east, deep into the jungle of Sulawesi. That jungle is home to one of Indonesia&apos;s key palm oil export facilities, along with the few thousand locals who rely on the refinery for their income.  In 2012 this band from the tiny Indonesian island of Bali decided they could no longer sit by as their country&apos;s vast natural riches were plundered by greedy multinationals. When promises to scale back the destruction were replaced by promises for more of it, and at a faster rate \u2013 in an attempt to hit an increasing global demand for palm oil \u2013 they were moved to act. Navicula locked horns with the palm oil industry. Employing more than 3 million people across Indonesia \u2013 the country produces more palm oil than any other \u2013 the palm oil industry is a formidable opponent, responsible for the widespread destruction of Indonesia&apos;s rainforests. With native fauna including the orangutan, Sumatran tiger and pygmy elephant pushed to the brink of extinction, and the region&apos;s indigenous people also threatened, Navicula mounted an audacious protest. The plan was to tour the palm oil industry stronghold of Kalimantan, playing shows and trumpeting their eco-message to anyone who&apos;d listen.      Punks outside the Twice Bar in Kuta, Bali. Photograph: Angga Pratama    In a country that witnessed the slaughter of half a million dissidents in the Suharto era, the risks were obvious. To fund the protest Navicula raised US$3,500 using Kickstarter \u2013 the first Indonesian band to do so. They sourced half a dozen dirt bikes from Greenpeace, along with riding suits painted with the stripes of the Sumatran tiger, and had security provided by a local indigenous people&apos;s alliance. Over 12 days in September 2012 they rode 2,500km across remote Kalimantan, playing shows and protesting against the palm oil industry.  Apart from the occasional spy, the trip went on without interference, but what they saw changed them forever. &quot;It was unbelievable,&quot; says the band&apos;s frontman, Robi Supriyanto. &quot;Sometimes a whole forest, as far as you could see, was gone. After that we are like, Navicula must be a satellite of information. We have to get the information out.&quot; The day I meet the band they&apos;re planning their next protest against the palm oil industry. A dozen or so Greenpeace activists plan to take over a palm oil refinery in remote Sulawesi and paint the holding tanks with the stripes of the endangered Sumatran tiger. Navicula will perform live in front of it. The mission is top secret and Navicula aren&apos;t expecting any opposition at the new site, though it&apos;s almost certain everyone involved will be detained by authorities.  &quot;We&apos;ll have legal covered,&quot; assures the Greenpeace representative at the meeting. No one mentions the elephant in the room: the 30 Greenpeace activists then in a Russian prison looking at 15 years for the doomed Arctic oil drilling protest. Nevertheless, the band remains committed. &quot;This is the action part. We make song and after that if the song is not enough you have to walk the talk,&quot; says Supriyanto.     The Twice Bar in Kuta. Photograph: Angga Pratama    As it turned out, Navicula never had to venture into Sulawesi to make their point. The palm oil company in question, Wilmar, yielded to their demands when they announced a &quot;no deforestation, no peat, no exploitation policy&quot; that pledged to stop removing forest, burning off waste and to adhere to the UN&apos;s universal declaration of human rights. In a further boost for Navicula&apos;s environmental crusade, the country&apos;s top Islamic council also took the unprecedented step of levelling a fatwa at any illegal wildlife dealers in Indonesia. The tide is turning but Navicula aren&apos;t convinced yet. &quot;I will believe it when Wilmar shows this policy in their actions, not just on paper,&quot; says Supriyanto.  Navicula hail from Bali, a slice of equatorial paradise in Indonesia&apos;s far east. It&apos;s also become one of Asia&apos;s activism hubs. In the 30 years since this tiny Hindu island burst on to the mainstream tourism map, it&apos;s gone from an idyllic surfers&apos; paradise to facing an almost certain environmental demise. By as early as next year, scientists are predicting Bali will face a terminal water shortage. Already more than half the island&apos;s 400 rivers have run dry, and those that haven&apos;t are clogged with the 11,000 cubic tonnes of waste that&apos;s left uncollected each day.  Property prices, meanwhile, continue to boom (they rose at the third highest rate last year \u2013 equal with Dubai) and some of the world&apos;s biggest development projects add more pressure to the island&apos;s already fragile equatorial ecosystem. Out of this a thriving punk and hardcore scene has risen to challenge law makers and unscrupulous developers. Two of the biggest bands in Asia right now, Navicula and Superman is Dead, both hail from Bali, and their rise to the top has been accompanied by staunch messages of environmental protection and anti-corruption.  Navicula met at university in Bali back in 1996, when all four members were studying environmental science and journalism degrees. At a time when Bali was feeling the first adverse affects of the tourism boom, the band formed &quot;to get the message out&quot;. Unfortunately, no one was listening. &quot;Seventeen years ago people don&apos;t care about music being into eco-awareness or political awareness,&quot; Supriyanto says.     A huddle at the Twice Bar. Photograph: Ang    The son of a farming family, he remembers all too well the first incursion of western business principles into Bali. That came in the 1970s when the green revolution \u2013 an American initiative aimed at boosting various crop yields \u2013 arrived on the island with a plan to make some &quot;improvements&quot; to the island&apos;s 11th-century Subak rice farming system. They almost crippled the now world heritage-listed system and left the island unable to feed itself.  Navicula began its career playing dozens of environmental and anti-corruption rallies around Bali, but it was only after Supriyanto met his wife, Lakota Moira, that the band&apos;s blend of musical talent and activist steel really took shape. Lakota is the daughter of Robin Lim, the philanthropist, activist and midwife, who in 2011 was named CNN&apos;s hero of the year for her work delivering some 26,000 babies for the underprivileged.  With Robin for a mother and an environmentalist filmmaker for a father, there was little chance Lakota was going to grow up doing anything other than working for humanitarian causes. After completing a public relations degree she took over managing Navicula, so beginning what can only be descried as an inspired era of DIY punk-activism.  Proudly laid out on the table in front of me is one such new-wave activist approach: an entire line of Navicula-branded conservationist products. There&apos;s honey and arak scented soap (palm oil-free of course); Navicula sunglasses made from upcycled offcuts of guitars (each purchase also gets you a tree in &quot;Navicula forest&quot; in Bali&apos;s mountains); their latest album cover made from upcycled Tetra Pak and old tyres; their promise that not a single tree be harmed in the making of their latest album; and, my favourite, the Navicula-branded seed bombs (tree seeds in a clay base which are given to local bikie gangs to toss into depleted patches of forest on their weekly burns).  Despite their growing stature in the music world the band has maintained a strong grassroots presence, running dozens of workshops for local people \u2013 from seed saving, organic and urban farming, to recycling, citizen journalism and how to make money off music. &quot;We&apos;re still trying to figure that one out,&quot; says Supriyanto. He has even published a book on permaculture. &quot;Ginseng! Great in salads and it makes your dick hard!&quot; he tells me as we pick through his garden. As Lakota explains: &quot;I told the boys if you play a gig or make a video no one cares. That&apos;s what a band is supposed to do. If you make soap, however \u2026 &quot;  It&apos;s a recipe that&apos;s taken them to the top of the music heap in Asia, earning collaborations with Michael Franti and most recently, Johannes, who produced their latest single, Tomcat. Lakota wrote it: &quot;It&apos;s a love song wrapped up in environmentalism.&quot;             More importantly, Navicula has managed to successfully cross-pollinate Indonesia&apos;s already gargantuan punk and hardcore scene with a newfound environmental awareness. And it&apos;s threatening to shake things up in the archipelago. Since the information flow began following the fall of the Suharto regime in the 1990s, punk, metal and hardcore has become the dominant strand of youth culture in Indonesia. The heart of that scene is in Bali. Instruments such as the gamelan \u2013 a metal, gong-like device which percussionists can thrash into a dizzying 17 melodies a second \u2013 provided a smooth transition for local musicians into the frenetic rhythms of punk and hardcore. The gory live animal sacrifices and demonic imagery of your average Hindu ceremony, meanwhile, have obvious links into metal culture, according to Supriyanto.  On a Saturday night I venture into the &quot;sacred home&quot; of the Indonesian punk scene; a sweaty shoebox of a bar called Twice Bar, in the seething tourist precinct of Kuta, Bali. Inside, the music is loud and the message even louder. &quot;This life is not just about the money, it is synchronised between human and nature, this world and this earth. If one of them not balanced it\u2019s going to be disaster for us,&quot; explains Jemy, a drummer for local band Fight Back.  The bar, which is owned by Superman is Dead drummer Jerinx, hosts an average of 15 bands a week with musicians ranging in age from teenagers to 40 and over coming to jam. On this night a metalcore outfit is holding the floor. With two women in the band \u2013 one on guitar and one on lead vocals \u2013 it&apos;s an uncommon sight in Indonesia, where women tend to occupy subservient roles. Not tonight. Between riffs the female guitarist spreads her fingers in a Gene Simmonsesque gesture, to the chortling disbelief of a chain of headbanging Indonesians not half a metre away.  It was here Navicula played after their Kalimantan tour in 2012 and the venue has hosted dozens of international musicians since, including members of Parkway Drive, Suicidal Tendencies and Macromantics. As it did in the west three decades ago, punk and hardcore has once again come to represent a generation&apos;s anger and discontent. In a land like Indonesia, where wealth and political influence remains concentrated among a select few, the ability of Indonesia&apos;s punks to force change \u2013 or at least the discussion of it \u2013 will be as good a gauge as any as to this country&apos;s prospects of entertaining a true democracy.

Despite competing in a sport that rarely received national media coverage, she saw her profile rocket overnight and the girl who &quot;liked kicking people in the head&quot; found herself appearing on the Jonathan Ross Show, and suddenly recognised in the street. &quot;People kept coming up to me and their little kids would show me their kicks,&quot; says the 21-year-old, whose recent grand prix victories in Dubai and Holland have propelled her to world No1 status. &quot;Sometimes people would just walk up to me and say: &apos;Can you kick me in the head?&apos; I&apos;d be like: &apos;No!&apos; &quot;Now and again I&apos;ll show them a kick, but not actually kick them in the head. That would make the papers, wouldn&apos;t it?&quot; she says, laughing. But the rush of Olympic excitement soon faded to leave a devastating low that made Jones question her passion for the sport, the pursuit she had dedicated her life to since her grandad took her to spar at the Flint community centre in Wales at the age of eight. &quot;The Olympics was always my be all and end all, so when I won it was the best feeling in the world. But I didn&apos;t realise how much it would affect me mentally,&quot; she says. &quot;All that pressure. I was only 19, I still didn&apos;t know everything about taekwondo, I wasn&apos;t experienced. I just did amazing on that day and won. People normally get their experience after years and years in the sport, but because I&apos;d won straight away I had to grow up much faster.&quot; Twelve months later and Jones had been knocked out of the quarter-finals at the world championships and had &quot;fallen out of love with the sport&quot;. She reflects: &quot;It wasn&apos;t fun anymore. I was just getting stressed all the time, my confidence was going down and I wasn&apos;t enjoying training. I wasn&apos;t myself. But no one really knew what I was going through; I&apos;d put the Olympics on such a pedestal that when it was over it was an anticlimax.&quot; It was after the world championships in Mexico last summer that Jones&apos;s long-time coach, Paul Green, gave her a pep talk. &quot;He said: &apos;Listen Jade, where&apos;s your medal?&apos; I was like: &apos;What do you mean? It&apos;s at the side of my bed.&apos; He said: &apos;No matter if you lose now, it&apos;s still going to be there.&apos; I had been thinking I&apos;ve got to win because I&apos;m Olympic champion; actually, no, it&apos;s &apos;I&apos;m an Olympic champion for life&apos;, I can just enjoy the rest. I should be making them nervous, not the other way round. I changed my whole attitude to it.&quot; But as Jones matured, regained her confidence, and became an even more formidable competitor, the sport also began to change. One major development since 2012 has been the size of the fighters. While Jones, at 5ft 7in, had always been considered one of the taller competitors, she is now dwarfed by such rivals as Eva Calvo G\u00f3mez of Spain, one of her key opponents at the European Championships in Azerbaijan next week. G\u00f3mez, currently ranked sixth in the world but holding the upper hand over Jones in recent head-to-head results, is a tough competitor. &quot;She&apos;s beat me twice now,&quot; says Jones. &quot;If I get her it will be in the final. &quot;I&apos;m really motivated to beat her up,&quot; Jones adds, only half-joking. &quot;She does the new style of taekwondo, the gangly, tall people thing. She&apos;s not strong, she&apos;s just dead awkward, and because her legs are so long when I&apos;m getting into her distance she&apos;s already scoring on me. But I&apos;ve got a good plan this time so hopefully all the hard work in training will pay off. I&apos;ll keep it a secret for now, just in case she finds out.&quot; Since 2012 the sport has also become more global. It is no longer defined by Asian talent and there are &quot;about six people&quot; who could win the European title next week, bringing the competition closer in line with the world championships. The Headhunter, as Jones is known, desperately wants another title to add to her Olympic gold, especially after missing out on the podium at the world championships last year, but she has also learned to widen her focus now that every grand prix event counts towards qualifying for Rio 2016. Points are cumulatively added, and the top six in the world come the end of 2015 will automatically qualify for the next Olympic Games. The Flint star is determined to be No1 in that pile. &quot;I used to be a person who just peaked for the big events, not doing too many competitions, but now you&apos;ve got to go round chasing all the points because if you&apos;re not taking them someone else is,&quot; she says. As a result, the -57kg fighter has had to adapt her competition approach. &quot;It was a bit weird at first, because you&apos;re not feeling all fresh and sharp [for a competition], you&apos;re just in general training phase,&quot; Jones explains. &quot;I used to panic when I was feeling like that, but now I&apos;m used to just turning up and fighting and not peaking for every event.&quot; Ultimately Jones will be aiming to defend her Olympic title in 2016. &quot;At times it feels a long way off. I just need to keep my foot on the pedal and keep training hard. It&apos;s amazing to get one Olympic gold but you have to be a legend to get two. And that&apos;s definitely my aim.&quot; Jade Jones supports Sport England&apos;s &quot;Engage to Compete&quot; programme, delivered by Fit For Sport, the Voice of Kids.

He received a \u00a3600,000 payoff from the paper when he quit, the jury also heard on Friday. Coulson told the jury that he had started a relationship with his former boss in 1998 but that this ended soon after. It restarted, he said, in &quot;2004, possibly the end of 2003&quot; and continued in an on-off fashion for years. &quot;In between times we had for a long period, the relationship was what it should have been which was a friendship. &quot;From 2004 onwards, it was by no means continuous. The affair did continue till around the time I left the News of the World.&quot; Coulson quit the paper on 26 January 2007, the day his royal editor was jailed for phone-hacking offences. He said he confided with Brooks about his resignation from News of the World ahead of the public statement. Months after he quit the paper he went to work as David Cameron&apos;s director of communications. The jury heard that around April he was in talks with George Osborne about the role. He met Cameron and following the local elections in May a job offer was made. The jury has already heard Brooks admit the &quot;dysfunctional&quot; affair, which the prosecution believed went on between 1998 and ended in 2004 because of the date of a draft letter found on her computer by police. She described Coulson as her &quot;very best friend&quot; and told him: &quot;I love you.&quot; Brooks told jurors in February that she began a physical relationship with Coulson in 1998, at a time when she had split up with Ross Kemp. She got back together with the former EastEnders actor that year and they planned on building a life together but the relationship began to unravel in 2003. She then reignited relations with Coulson and confirmed that there had been &quot;intimacy&quot; between &quot;2003 and 2005&quot; and that this had happened &quot;again in 2006&quot;. Coulson told the court on Friday that the pair were still intimately involved &quot;around the time&quot; of his departure from the News of the World in January 2007. The jury also heard Coulson received a \u00a3600,000 payout when he quit the News of the World. He was paid the equivalent of three years&apos; salary when he resigned in the wake of royal editor Clive Goodman&apos;s decision to plead guilty to phone-hacking offences. &quot;I had a two-year contract and as I understood it the contract was two years plus a month for every year&apos;s service and I did not consider that to be unusual,&quot; said Coulson. Coulson has told jurors that he decided to resign after consultation with his wife Eloise over Christmas 2006 and worked out a deal with a News International executive about 13 or 14 January, two weeks ahead of Goodman&apos;s sentencing. His resignation was kept secret from Goodman and not announced until after the reporter was sentenced on 26 January 2007. Coulson denied this was to &quot;keep the lid&quot; on the situation and stop Goodman naming names of others who knew about hacking on the paper. Goodman&apos;s lawyer, David Spens QC, put it to Coulson that the &quot;reason you did that was because you were fearful of provoking Mr Goodman into telling the truth about your real involvement&quot;. &quot;It would risk him coming out with the truth,&quot; he added. Coulson denied this was the case. Spens put it to him that if he had told Goodman of his decision to resign before his sentencing, &quot;his faint prospect of keeping his resignation would go&quot;. The jury heard that Coulson wrote to a News International executive on 13 January to say he had decided it would &quot;only work for the company and the paper if there&apos;s a clean break&quot; and he resigned. The following day, he proposed a draft statement in which he would say &quot;Although I knew nothing of Clive&apos;s illegal activities, they were wrong and should not have happened on my watch.&quot; This was deleted from the final public statement, the jury heard. Under cross-examination by lead prosecutor Andrew Edis QC, Coulson was quizzed about the edition of News of the World carrying the story reporting that the &quot;hunt for Milly Dowler took a new twist&quot; when it emerged that a voicemail had been left on her phone about a job in a Telford factory. Edis put it to Coulson that he had said the idea that a 13-year-old school whose face had been all over national TV and press would be working in the Midlands was &quot;absurd&quot; in his earlier testimony. Yet, Edis said, 11 people were working on the story and that &quot;could not have happened in Telford without you knowing about it&quot;. Coulson replied: &quot;It could absolutely happen without me knowing about it. It was not my job to track reporters.&quot; He would not have been able to edit the paper if he was &quot;micromanaging&quot; reporters, he said. Coulson said he could not remember who told him about the new lead that Dowler might have run away from her Surrey home for a job in the Midlands. &quot;The idea that she could walk into a factory was unbelievable,&quot; he added. Edis asked: &quot;Is this based on memory or are you inventing it?&quot; Coulson replied: &quot;I&apos;m not inventing it.&quot; Coulson admitted that if Milly Dowler had been found alive and working at a factor in Telford it would have been a better front-page story than the one the paper did carry on 14 April 2002 about actor Michael Greco leaving EastEnders. Coulson said he did not recall any conversation with the then editor Brooks, who was holidaying at the time in Dubai, about the Dowler story, which he thought was &quot;weak&quot;. &quot;If a story came in that was going to mean the reworking of page 1 in a significant way I think it is quite likely I would have told her,&quot; he said. He told jurors that he was stepping up from his deputy editorship to edit the paper and he would not have been &quot;minded to ring Rebekah every five minutes&quot; as this was an opportunity to show he could do the job himself. Coulson is facing three charges including one that he conspired to hack phones. He denies all charges.

Sandiva and Toormore did not shorten for the Guineas after scoring at the recent Craven meeting and Western Hymn became the latest example of the phenomenon when his odds for the Derby became marginally bigger after his victory in the Classic Trial here on Friday. John Gosden&apos;s colt remains unbeaten in three runs and should still be capable of better but it is probably fair to say that the bloom is off the rose and he is not quite the &quot;could be anything&quot; prospect that he was in the horsebox here from Newmarket. Though he travelled smoothly at the back of this small field and moved alongside his rivals readily enough, he did not then pull clear in the hoped-for manner and his head carriage, awkwardly high, does not bode well. For these reasons, the bookmakers responded with a collective &quot;meh&quot; and Western Hymn, who was 14-1 for the Epsom Classic in six weeks&apos; time, is now available at 16-1. A flood of takers is not expected. Still, we should perhaps remember that even the mighty Shergar was as big as 8-1 for the Derby after winning here 33 years ago. As with all trainers of classy Flat racers, Gosden is duty bound to do what he can to shore up his horse&apos;s reputation, especially since this one is part-owned by his wife. He was persuasive as ever in arguing that the rain-softened ground had robbed Western Hymn of his acceleration. He felt also that William Buick had taken him to the front &quot;a good furlong too soon&quot;. &quot;It probably looked a bit workmanlike but I think it was more him hitting the front and then saying, where am I? It&apos;s hard to look impressive in this ground. I ran a horse in the first, a nice horse, he couldn&apos;t go in it. It&apos;s nobody&apos;s fault but we&apos;ve been training on good, good to firm and suddenly we&apos;re running on soft. But I&apos;m pleased he&apos;s come here and passed his test. I was thrilled that he handled the ground, thrilled he handled the trip on the ground. I didn&apos;t know how he&apos;d handle a mile and a quarter on this, you know, and he showed to me that he&apos;s got the stamina as much as the resolution.&quot; Western Hymn&apos;s head carriage was, he felt, &quot;babyish&quot; behaviour that he should hopefully leave behind. &quot;Have you ever walked up that straight? It&apos;s quite daunting with the stand and everything. I&apos;ve had them hit the front before the pedestrian path many times and seen them beaten late. But the trouble is soft ground, I know what William&apos;s thinking: if something gets three lengths on me, I&apos;m in trouble. On good ground, you can afford to wait longer.&quot; Gosden will send the winner to the Dante at York next but his thoughts over the next seven days will be dominated by next Saturday&apos;s 2,000 Guineas, for which he trains the hot favourite, Kingman. The colt will have a gallop &quot;at some stage over the weekend&quot;, the trainer said. &quot;One would be hopeful of some rain but we wouldn&apos;t want it to go to this.&quot; Richard Hughes made his return to action here, four weeks after fracturing a vertebra in a fall at Meydan on Dubai World Cup night. It is, on the face of it, extraordinary that a man can return to such a physically taxing job so soon after breaking his back but the jockey insisted he was lucky with this particular injury and that it hadn&apos;t caused him any lasting discomfort. Indeed, he maintains that he never took a single painkiller after his initial discharge from hospital. His day was unproductive until the closing handicap, when he guided the favourite Windshear to victory and declared himself &quot;fit and ready to go&quot;. It was his first winner since the Flat season officially began (on the day he was injured) and he may have to work hard to retain his title as champion jockey, since Ryan Moore is 21 winners ahead. Title-chasing is a thing of the past for Frankie Dettori, reduced to two rides here after two others were withdrawn, but he got the 14-1 shot Hay Chewed into second place and it continues to seem odd that so little use is made of his talent. Still, he has five rides at Haydock on Saturday before flying to France for Sunday&apos;s Prix Ganay and a second chance to climb aboard Treve, officially the best racehorse in the world. &quot;We&apos;re all excited, it goes without saying,&quot; he offered between rides here. &quot;Cirrus Des Aigles sets a good benchmark and we&apos;ll see where we are. &quot;She&apos;s got to win. Only a win will do. She&apos;s putting her reputation on the line, she&apos;s unbeaten at three, an Arc winner and let&apos;s hope she&apos;s got the same ability, the same zest as last year. &quot;But in the morning, she gives me all the good vibes. We&apos;ve got a pacemaker to make sure it&apos;s not a silly race, quite a decent pacemaker, so it should be quite a regular race. Fingers crossed.&quot; A steady drizzle here totalled 10mm of rain by the end of racing and there may be more to come before Saturday&apos;s card, which brings down the curtain on the jumps season. It seems that the hurdles and chase courses will not ride quite so soft as the Flat track did. Andrew Cooper, responsible for turf management, was expecting a mix of good to soft and soft as he left the course, with mostly good to soft on the chase track, which will stage the feature Bet365 Gold Cup.", "title": "Western Hymn on drift for Derby after Sandown Classic Trial win", "sentences": ["&quot;One would be hopeful of some rain but we wouldn&apos;t want it to go to this.&quot; Richard Hughes made his return to action here, four weeks after fracturing a vertebra in a fall at Meydan on Dubai World Cup night."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-25T17:04:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/27/kevin-pietersen-cricket", "tags": ["Kevin Pietersen", "Cricket", "Sport", "IPL"], "article": "Kevin Pietersen led his Delhi Daredevils team to a six-wicket victory over Mumbai Indians in his second appearance of the Indian Premier League campaign in Sharjah on Sunday.

There are no fewer than 12 Grade One National Hunt contests at Punchestown&apos;s festival meeting between Tuesday and Saturday, when the 2,000 Guineas at Newmarket will be the first Group One of the British Flat season, and it can be difficult to stop and reflect when there is always so much to anticipate. The 2013-2014 jumps campaign did not leave a long sequence of images etched on the memory as some have done in recent years, though the afternoon at Towcester in early November when Tony McCoy rode the 4,000th winner of his career stands out as a moment when racing, and a fair proportion of the general public too, paused to appreciate one of the truly extraordinary sporting careers. Nor could it have had a more emblematic horse of the year than Sire De Grugy, who received the majority of votes in an online poll conducted by the Racing Post to beat a field which included Quevega, who beat Golden Miller&apos;s record of five straight wins at the Festival when she took the Mares&apos; Hurdle for the sixth year in a row. Sire De Grugy had a Zelig-like ability to be there at the season&apos;s pivotal moments. First, he emerged as the winner when Sprinter Sacre pulled up on his first, and as it turned out only, start of the season at Kempton on 27 December. Then, 24 hours after the death of Our Conor in the Champion Hurdle had cast a long shadow over the first day at Cheltenham, his victory in the Queen Mother Champion Chase was one that everyone could celebrate. The weighing room cleared to acknowledge Jamie Moore&apos;s first Festival winner, and the mood of the entire meeting was changed in an instant. Sire De Grugy&apos;s victory in Saturday&apos;s Celebration Chase at Sandown was his fourth Grade One in a season which seemed to promise little more than a string of second places behind Sprinter Sacre at its outset. Paul Nicholls and Nicky Henderson dominated the trainers&apos; championship, while Willie Mullins made it a three-cornered fight at the festivals, but Sire De Grugy and Pineau De Re, who took the Grand National for Dr Richard Newland&apos;s tiny 12-horse yard, were the sort of horses and stories that fire the enthusiasm of many National Hunt fans in the first place. Flat racing, meanwhile, now offers the prospect of four Classics and Royal Ascot in the space of eight weeks. Technically, of course, the 2014 turf season is already more than a month old, with both the Craven and Greenham meetings in the book, but it is Guineas weekend, rather than the Craven, which feels ever more like the point at which the campaign really starts. The 2,000 Guineas in particular looks like an outstanding and fascinating renewal, both in terms of its horses and its people. Kingman, Kingston Hill and Toormore are all unbeaten, while Australia \u2013 by a Derby winner out of an Oaks winner \u2013 has, like a fair few before him, been described by Aidan O&apos;Brien as possibly the best he has trained. A personal view is that Australia is the key horse in the field, because he is priced on a mixture of hope and hype with surprisingly little in the book to back it up, and that seems to feed into other markets too. He might be a better horse than Galileo, George Washington, High Chaparral and company, but he still has a huge amount to prove. O&apos;Brien won the first four Classics in 2012 but still could not beat John Gosden \u2013 who saddled two Group One winners all season \u2013 to the trainers&apos; championship. Yet he is joint-favourite for the title with Richard Hannon, who has taken over from his father Richard Hannon Sr, the champion in three of the last four seasons. With the strings in the major yards increasing all the time, it becomes ever more difficult even for a trainer of O&apos;Brien&apos;s immense talent to take the title with just a handful of Group winners. Hannon sends Toormore to the Guineas with a live chance and has several top-class older horses plus, above all, a weight of numbers that no other yard can match. He remains odds-against at 11-8 for the trainers&apos; title, a bet that can provide a regular interest throughout the season with every prospect of a payout at the end. Ryan Moore, meanwhile, also looks big at evens in what is surely a two-runner race with Richard Hughes for the jockeys&apos; title. Hughes was less than 20 winners clear last time around and his injury in Dubai has given Moore a head-start of similar proportions this time. Moore is riding as reliably and impeccably as ever, and also makes plenty of appeal at the prices to finish the Flat season as champion once again.", "title": "Aidan O'Brien's Australia tantalises as Flat season jumps into unknown | Greg Wood", "sentences": ["Hughes was less than 20 winners clear last time around and his injury in Dubai has given Moore a head-start of similar proportions this time."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-27T17:46:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/apr/29/top-10-worst-london-skyscrapers-quill-odalisk-walkie-talkie", "tags": ["Architecture", "Art", "London", "Planning policy", "Culture", "Cities"], "article": "&apos;London is growing up!&quot; trumpets a sign in the window of the New London Architecture centre. Inside, there&apos;s a forest of\u00a0sticks and stumps, blobs and lumps \u2013 just some of the novelty silhouettes due to appear on the city&apos;s skyline over\u00a0the coming years. There are more than 230 such towers in the pipeline, a\u00a0figure that shocked even the city&apos;s deputy mayor for business, who might be thought to know about such things. Sprouting over every corner of the\u00a0city, most are of an architectural quality that recalls the outskirts of Dubai or Shenzhen. The overall impression is of an unplanned free-for-all, a steroidal frenzy of building tall, with little attention to individual design quality, or the cumulative effect that these scattered hulks might have on the city. The Planning Decisions Unit of the Greater London Authority, the body responsible for greenlighting these schemes, begs to differ. &quot;It is simply not true to say these towers haven&apos;t been planned,&quot; says director Colin Wilson. &quot;They have been very carefully planned.\u00a0But we prefer to use a flexible\u00a0framework, rather than a rigid\u00a0masterplan. This liberty is what makes London successful.&quot; The London Plan, the mayor&apos;s rulebook for development across the capital, supports tall buildings where they &quot;create attractive landmarks enhancing London&apos;s character&quot;. It states that such\u00a0developments &quot;should be of the highest design quality \u2026 attractive to look at and, where appropriate, inspire, excite and delight&quot;. So how are these rules shaping up in reality? Here, we give our verdict on 10 new towers, built and imminent, counting down to the very worst offender \u2026 10. 1 Merchant Square Location: Paddington Basin | Floors: 42 | Height: 140m | Architect: Robin Partington | Status: approved | Use: residential and hotel     1 Merchant Square     Already home to a motley collection of brash waterside blocks, all competing for attention with their jazzy cladding, Paddington Basin will soon be joined by Westminster&apos;s first skyscraper, in the form of this shiny blue cucumber. Designed by Robin Partington, architect of the Carbuncle Cup-winning Strata and the giant ground-scraping slug of Park House on Oxford Street, its apartments will apparently represent the &quot;height of luxury living&quot;. Clad in a &quot;midnight-blue ceramic rainscreen&quot;, this plump cousin of the Gherkin (in which Partington also had a hand) appears to be bursting out of its corset of &quot;white porcelain ribs&quot;, which overshoot the penthouse skybar to form a tacky tiara on the skyline. The GLA planners said: &quot;An attractive form and a high-quality finish, and the impact of the building would be positive.&quot; 9. Canaletto Location: City Road | Floors: 31 | Height: 100m | Architect: UN Studio | Status: on site | Use: Residential.     Canaletto    &quot;Designed by genius&quot;, proclaim the billboards on City Road. &quot;An architectural masterwork.&quot; Behind these slogans rises a concrete lift shaft that will soon service some of the most expensive penthouses in London. This is Canaletto, a tower designed by Professor Ben van Berkel of Dutch practice UN Studio, and one of the most hyped apartment buildings of recent times. With fat silvery frames wrapping around groups of floors in a vain attempt to break up the sheer bulk, it looks like a stack of hard drives or the back of a computer server \u2013 an accidental nod to the nearby Silicon Roundabout. The first of an unintended cluster, it has opened the doors for a thicket of forthcoming towers by Foster and Make, rising to more than half its height again. The GLA planners said: &quot;The materials used provide a homely feel to the building, reflecting its residential use as well as responding positively to the surrounding conservation areas.&quot; 8. Helix Location: Canary Wharf | Floors: 35/29 | Height: 122/104m | Architect: Make &amp; Darling Associates | Status: approved | Use: residential     Helix    Standing on top of a drive-through McDonald&apos;s like two oversized air ducts conjoined by a knotted tangle of wiring, the Helix towers will be a bizarre addition to Canary Wharf \u2013 a place increasingly choked by plans for silly silhouettes, each trying to stand out among the forest of corporate slabs. Designed by Make \u2013 no strangers to dressing up mindless buildings in novelty outfits \u2013 the two cylindrical towers will be connected at certain floors by sinuous metallic bands, supporting a series of &quot;sky gardens&quot; for a chosen few flats. Described by its developer, the real-estate arm of McDonald&apos;s, as &quot;an intricate landmark project&quot;, you can&apos;t help feeling they&apos;ve missed a trick: wouldn&apos;t a giant pair of golden arches be better? The GLA planners said: &quot;The images and elevation detail indicate a design that is unique and high quality.&quot; 7. Imperial West Location: White City | Floors: 35 | Height: 141m | Architect: PLP | Status: approved | Use: residential     Terracotta wedge \u2026 Imperial West tower Photograph: /PLP Architects    The lumbering west-London cousin of Richard Rogers&apos; Cheesegrater, the Imperial West will stand as an angular wedge on the skyline, a terracotta Dalek looming above the terraced streets of north Kensington. It is intended to be a &quot;gateway&quot; to London for those driving into town along the Westway, and a &quot;landmark&quot; for Imperial College&apos;s new campus at White City, announcing the presence of a &quot;new ecosystem for research and innovation&quot;. So will it contain a thrilling world of skylabs and experiments in the clouds, scientists liberated from their windowless basements? Alas, no. It is another a silo of luxury flats, to be sold to fund the rest of the development, over which the tower will cast a long shadow. A local campaign group, Imperial Folly, says it &quot;will be remembered for many years for destroying the western skyline for all those living in this part of London&quot;. The GLA planners said: &quot;[It will] provide a striking skyline feature and distinctive focal point that could contribute to local legibility.&quot; 6. Vauxhall Tower Location: Vauxhall | Floors: 50 | Height: 181m | Architect: Broadway Malyan | Status: built | Use: residential.     Vauxhall Tower    Like a cigarette stubbed out by the Thames, the Vauxhall&apos;s lonely stump looks cast adrift, a piece of Pudong that&apos;s lost its way. It was generally agreed to be in the wrong place, sprouting slap-bang in the middle of the view from Westminster Bridge, and was refused permission. John Prescott, then a deputy PM keen to leave his own mark on the skyline, called the scheme in and gave it permission in 2005 \u2013 against strong warnings from his advisers that it &quot;could set a precedent for the indiscriminate scattering of very tall buildings across London&quot;. How right they were. It has since opened the floodgates for second-rate totems that will soon turn this part of the river into mayor Boris Johnson&apos;s nightmare of &quot;Dubai on Thames&quot;. The GLA planners said: &quot;The new tower is likely to result in an improvement in visual terms \u2026 it would be a welcome addition to the riverside and skyline.&quot; 5. Stratford Halo Location: Stratford | Floors: 43 | Height: 133m | Architect: Stock Woolstencroft | Status: built | Use: residential.     Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Like flies to a compost heap, developers swarmed to Stratford in the runup to the 2012 Olympics, each determined to build the &quot;gateway to the Games&quot; and cash in on the legacy gold-rush. Paying over the odds for small plots, they had to go tall to claw back profits. The result is a physical bar chart of inflated land values: steroidal towers now march down the high street, each trying to be more iconic than the next, forming a shouty gauntlet of cheap coloured cladding panels and bolt-on balconies. The Stratford Halo, at 43 storeys, is the biggest and boldest, wrapped with dubious purple pinstripes and topped with a jaunty quiff \u2013 and hosting a gaudy light show by night. What the GLA planners said: &quot;It has the potential to contribute towards the consolidation of a cluster of tall buildings at Stratford and the enhancement of its skyline.&quot; 4. Strata Location: Elephant and Castle | Floors: 43 | Height: 147m | Architect: BFLS | Status: built | Use: residential.     Photograph: View Pictures/UIG via Getty Images    If south London had always felt a bit like Mordor to some, then that reputation was firmly cemented by the arrival of its very own Dark Tower in 2010, topped with no fewer than three Eyes of Sauron in the form of wind turbines \u2013 which have remained stationary ever since. Variously compared to a knuckleduster aggressively punching at the skies, or an electric razor waiting to give the clouds a quick trim, the Strata, with its sinisterly sculpted peak, has certainly put Elephant and Castle on the map. Dressed in a sporty livery of black and white stripes, it was the deserved winner of the Carbuncle Cup for the worst building of the year, &quot;for services to greenwash [those three wind turbines have never moved], urban impropriety and sheer breakfast-extracting ugliness&quot;. What the GLA planners said: &quot;The proposal is welcome, as it will initiate the regeneration of Elephant and Castle \u2026 the scheme should provide a positive addition to the London skyline.&quot; 3. Walkie-Talkie Location: City of London | Floors: 36 | Height: 160m | Architect: Rafael Vi\u00f1oly | Status: Under construction | Use: office     Photograph: Stuart Forster/REX    Trumpeted as &quot;the building with more up top&quot;, the Walkie-Talkie swells as it rises to pack in more office space at the upper levels, where rents can be higher, giving it the shape of a bulging pint glass. As a literal diagram of developers&apos; greed, it provides the painful proof that form follows not function but finance. An aberration of the planning system, the building stands alone outside the planned City cluster, like the school bully expelled from the classroom, poking its unwelcome bulk into the skyline from almost every possible vista. Not content with looming aggressively above its neighbours and blocking out their light, the Walkie-Talkie has even scorched them with its own death ray \u2013 channeling the sun in its concave facade to temperatures capable of melting cars. The GLA planners said: &quot;The quality of the design would make a significant contribution to London&apos;s architecture and reinforce the distinctiveness that other tall schemes have contributed to the City skyline.&quot; 2. The Odalisk Location: Croydon | Floors: 55 | Height: 199m | Architect: CZWG | Status: approved | Use: residential and hotel     The Odalisk    &quot;The days of drab grey buildings are at an end,&quot; pronounced Piers Gough when he unveiled his design for the Odalisk, a self-consciously whacky totem pole for Croydon, planned to house a four-star Intercontinental Hotel and luxury serviced apartments within in its lumpen shell. Looking as if it has suffered a severe mauling from a Rottweiler, the tower appears to have been ripped to pieces and stitched back together in the wrong way, standing as a monstrous Frankenstein concoction. A looping bronzed band swoops and swirls up and down the building, gouging out great gashes here and there, cutting slippery fissures into the facade, before flaring out in a graceless canopy above the street. The GLA planners said: &quot;The projecting and recessing features are strong elements that help add depth and character.&quot; 1. The Quill Location: Southwark | Floors: 31 | Height: 109m | Architect: SPARRC | Status: approved | Use: student accommodation     The Quill    What would a building look like if it had a fight with a gigantic porcupine, and the porcupine won? You can get some idea by looking at plans for the Quill, a great silver cliff-face of a thing that will sport a broken assortment of spines on its top. This ungainly hulk was miraculously granted permission by Southwark council&apos;s planning committee, who described it as &quot;dynamic&quot; and &quot;dramatic&quot;, no doubt wooed by the architect&apos;s claims that the form was &quot;inspired by the literary heritage&quot; of the borough. The spines, you see, are supposed to look like the top of a feathered quill pen, of the kind local lad Shakespeare might have used. But there the cultural connection ends: this spiny monster will house high-end accommodation for 500 students, mostly international, who will be able to peek out from their luxury lair through mean, arrow-slit windows. The GLA planners said: &quot;A building with a unique composition, with a striking roof form and an architectural appearance of the highest order, consistent with the aspirations of the London Plan.&quot;", "title": "Horror storeys: the 10 worst London skyscrapers", "sentences": ["Sprouting over every corner of the\u00a0city, most are of an architectural quality that recalls the outskirts of Dubai or Shenzhen.", "It has since opened the floodgates for second-rate totems that will soon turn this part of the river into mayor Boris Johnson&apos;s nightmare of &quot;Dubai on Thames&quot;."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-28T18:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/apr/28/great-leighs-newcastle-all-weather-wolverhampton-tapeta", "tags": ["British Horseracing Authority", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Significant change is on the horizon for all-weather racing in Britain following a series of announcements on Monday to the effect that more tracks and more surfaces will be used from next year. Great Leighs was finally given approval to re-open as a racecourse, while it was confirmed that Newcastle will be allowed to install an artificial track and Wolverhampton will switch from Polytrack to Tapeta. But the sport&apos;s ruling body was at pains to say that all those bits of news do not mean there will necessarily be more all-weather racing in future years, or that it will make up a greater proportion of the fixture list than its present 20%. A fixture list review, being compiled by Deloitte and expected in the next two months, is intended to determine the question of how much all-weather racing is needed, taking into account sundry factors including the horse population. Great Leighs opened in 2008 and closed the following year after going into administration. A company called MC Racetracks applied for fixtures there in each of the last two years but was turned away for reasons that were not made public but were thought to include concerns over the robustness of the business plan. This year&apos;s application, from a new syndicate involving the bookmaker Fred Done of Betfred, was based on a new business plan and has met with approval from the British Horseracing Authority. It will even involve a new name for the track, henceforth to be called Chelmsford City. There was some concern about the possible peripheral involvement of John Holmes, closely associated with the original Great Leighs, who was arrested with others for alleged VAT fraud in December; no charges have yet been made. He is reportedly a consultant to Betsi Ltd, the racecourse&apos;s betting partner, but this is thought to be an acceptably remote position. The BHA said that the corporate structure of Done&apos;s syndicate had been &quot;independently reviewed and verified \u2026 John Holmes is not involved in the management of the applicant company&quot;. Meanwhile, a spokesman for Arc (Arena Racing Company), which owns Newcastle, said there was &quot;no fixed date&quot; for work to commence digging up the existing Flat turf track and replacing it with an all-weather surface. The turf jumps track will remain and may yet, with obstacles temporarily removed, stage future renewals of the historic Northumberland Plate. Wolverhampton&apos;s switch to Tapeta is something of a surprise in light of the criticism to which the surface was subjected during March&apos;s Dubai World Cup meeting. However, ARC pointed to a recent survey of British trainers in which Tapeta was as popular as Polytrack. Racing on the new surface is expected to start on 11 August and Tuesday&apos;s fixture at Wolverhampton will be the last before then. Newmarket&apos;s turf course, which will stage the Guineas meeting this weekend, remained good to firm after 5mm of artificial watering on Monday. The clerk of the course, Michael Prosser, said that had been necessary to maintain the &quot;health and wellbeing of the sward&quot; following less recent rain than had been predicted, totalling just 3mm in the past fortnight. Prosser is alive to the risk of being criticised for watering while there is rain in the offing but said the latest forecasts predict only 4mm to 6mm on Thursday. In light of that, he felt it was essential to water on Monday in order to maintain moisture levels in what he describes as &quot;a free-draining course&quot;. Seventeen horses remain in Saturday&apos;s 2,000 Guineas, led by Kingman, the 11-8 favourite. Aidan O&apos;Brien said he expects to run both Australia and War Command.

The billionaire American, whose existing golf course project in Scotland has been overshadowed by a series of controversies, has bought Turnberry from the Dubai-based Leisurecorp. The sum is undisclosed but Trump is believed to have paid considerably less than the \u00a352m Leisurecorp bought the venue for in 2008. The subsequent economic crash effectively led to Turnberry being on the market immediately with Trump&apos;s name routinely linked with a buyout. Within the last week, that speculation intensified with the deal now confirmed by Trump himself. Turnberry boasts a five-star hotel as well as three golf courses. &quot;It was an opportunity, as far as I was concerned,&quot; Trump told golf.com. &quot;Turnberry is considered one of the greatest courses in the world. It&apos;s a special place. It&apos;s an important place. &quot;This is a fabulous property in a great location. We&apos;re going to bring a new level of luxury to the hotel. Our aim is to make it the finest golf hotel in the world.&quot; Trump was uncharacteristically coy when asked if one of the most famous venues in golf will bear his name. &quot;Trump Turnberry&apos; has a nice ring to it, doesn&apos;t it?&quot; he said. &quot;We&apos;ll make that decision fairly soon. In a couple of days.&quot; Turnberry was restored to the Open Championship rota in 2009 after earlier concerns about the infrastructure around the venue. Attendances at Turnberry Opens also tend to be low in comparison to other Open venues. Still, the Royal &amp; Ancient&apos;s outgoing chief executive, Peter Dawson, offered a public welcome to Trump&apos;s latest golfing move. &quot;Turnberry is a great favourite among the players and it&apos;s on the Open rota for sure,&quot; Dawson said. &quot;Donald Trump is investing in golf properties in Great Britain and Ireland. He must have great faith in the future of the game, which is very heartening from a businessman of his stature. &quot;I&apos;m quite sure if he does buy Turnberry, he will be putting a lot of investment in.&quot; Trump was similarly upbeat about his relationship with the R&amp;A, which promises to be a source of intrigue. &quot;Some of the greatest championships in the history of golf have taken place at Turnberry,&quot; he added. &quot;And the golf course itself is considered one of the greatest in the world. Some rate it as the best in the world. &quot;I&apos;m not going to touch a thing unless the Royal &amp; Ancient ask for it or approve it. I have the greatest respect for the R&amp;A and for Peter Dawson. I won&apos;t do anything to the golf course at all without their full stamp of approval.&quot; Trump&apos;s newly-built International Links on the outskirts of Aberdeen has seen the businessman embroiled in high-profile rows with the local community and the Scottish government. A plan to place wind turbines within view of the course infuriated Trump to the extent that he took legal action in a bid to halt it. A court ruling went against Trump earlier this year. As recently as last month, Trump insisted he would divert attention away from Scotland and towards the Doonbeg course he recently purchased in Ireland. &quot;I said until they give up that charade of these ugly turbines that kill all the birds and probably make people sick with the humming noise and just destroys the environment, until they give that up [we won&apos;t invest any more],&quot; Trump said. &quot;We have our great course, you can&apos;t even get on it, it&apos;s so packed, it&apos;s phenomenal. And I said I&apos;m going to build a second course and other things, when they abandon that nonsense of the wind farms. &quot;In the meantime, I bought Doonbeg, and I&apos;m sure Scotland is not exactly thrilled about that; I can tell you for a fact they are not. I bought Doonbeg and I&apos;m focusing our efforts on Doonbeg in terms of Europe. Doonbeg is going to be amazing.&quot;", "title": "Donald Trump confirms purchase of iconic Turnberry golf course and resort", "sentences": ["The billionaire American, whose existing golf course project in Scotland has been overshadowed by a series of controversies, has bought Turnberry from the Dubai-based Leisurecorp."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-29T22:22:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/apr/30/us-open-course-pinehurst-rory-mcilroy-golf", "tags": ["US Open Golf 2014", "Rory McIlroy", "Justin Rose", "The Masters", "US Open", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Rory McIlroy&apos;s pre-Masters assertion that participation in golf has dropped by 13% was understandably lost in the subsequent tournament melee. Apart from anything else, McIlroy&apos;s comment lacked context; where, since when, among whom? But the Northern Irishman had struck upon an important issue. It is now generally recognised that recreational golfers are playing more than ever but encouraging youngsters to take up the game in the first place has never been tougher. Golf&apos;s return to the Olympics, it is hoped, will provide a positive legacy in the latter regard. However, a glance at the setup of Pinehurst&apos;s No2 course for the upcoming US Open hardly augurs well. At par 70, the venue is more than 7,500 yards long. There are four par-four holes in excess of 500 yards. Three par threes measure more than 200 yards. Leading amateur players would be entitled to say &quot;no thanks&quot; to such a golfing slog; professionals will of course turn up because of the stature of the competition. Stand by, though, for sniping. Players who miss the Pinehurst fairways will find their ball in scrappy, sandy, weeded areas. Approach shots? They&apos;ll be hit into treacherous, upturned saucer greens. Put all of this together and you have attritional \u2013 routinely dull \u2013 golf, the like of which preceded Justin Rose&apos;s victory in last year&apos;s US Open at an aggregate of one over par. Merion provided a brutal, borderline unfair, challenge. Nothing should be taken away from Rose&apos;s triumph, which was terrific in itself. However, too many high-profile events are being turned into the sort of grind which will hardly prove appealing to would-be golfers. Early indications, unfortunately, suggest the 114th US Open will follow suit. It promises to be engaging, but lacking in that wow factor which boosts participation in the sport. Pinehurst at 7,214 yards was hardly a stroll in the park for the 2005 US Open. The halfway cut fell at plus nine. After four rounds, no player had broken par. Amid paranoia by tournament organisers about players shooting rounds of 62, excitement is being drained from championships. There were even glimpses of such at the Masters; for all of Bubba Watson&apos;s brilliance, Augusta National&apos;s iconic back nine didn&apos;t produce anything like the thrills and spills of previous years. And these are the world&apos;s top professionals; what chance for run-of-the-mill amateurs if clubs decide these formats are valid? McIlroy clearly has a legitimate concern about golf&apos;s direction, away from the professional level where cash rewards have never been better. Offering more chances for blue-chip players such as McIlroy to thrill rather than fret over the consequences of tiny errors would have a bigger impact than some people seem willing to recognise. So when will Donald Trump preside over his first Open Championship? That is the burning question after confirmation arrived that the billionaire has completed his purchase of Turnberry after months of speculation. Those perturbed by Trump&apos;s arrival should bear three things in mind; this is simply a business swapping hands from Dubai to the United States, and the new owner has an impressive track record for spending big on the sport at a time when few others will do likewise. Trump also represents the polar opposite of golf&apos;s crusty, oft-criticised membership culture. Peter Dawson, the Royal &amp; Ancient&apos;s chief executive, chuckles when recalling his early exchanges with Trump. The businessman insisted back then that he would seek to host an Open at his purpose-built Aberdeenshire resort. Dawson duly explained the complexities and formalities associated with such a scenario; Trump marched over to inform waiting media that his Open dream was very much alive. A few years later, it&apos;s reality but at an alternative venue. Turnberry spent years in the Open wilderness amid concerns about infrastructure around the Ayrshire course. Those worries weren&apos;t entirely placated at or after it hosted the third major of the year in 2009. Historically, Turnberry Open crowds are at the low end of the scale. The fact a 59-year-old Tom Watson came within a whisker of winning five years ago, albeit a terrific story, raised questions about Turnberry&apos;s strength. Still, the outgoing Dawson is adamant that Turnberry remains part of the Open rota. Venues have been announced up to and including 2016, with the 2017 host course due to be named imminently. After successive years in Scotland, Royal Birkdale appears the favourite. Thereafter, an inevitably revamped Turnberry resort has a live chance. And one fuelled, suffice to say, by plenty of campaigning from its&apos; owner. Anthony Kim: gone as fast as he arrived? This weekend&apos;s Wells Fargo Championship marks the second anniversary of Anthony Kim&apos;s last appearance on the PGA Tour. Even then, Kim withdrew after just 18 holes. Kim is in danger of becoming a forgotten man, which is a terrible shame given his undeniable level of talent. When people do speak about him, it is commonly in reference to a party boy lifestyle rather than a Ryder Cup appearance and rapid arrival on to the professional scene. Between 2008 and 2010, Kim won three times in the United States. He has subsequently picked up injuries but apparently lost interest in the game he was once a rising star in. Ominous words appeared this week from the golfer&apos;s agent, in an interview with the Golf Channel&apos;s John Hawkins. In short, even Kim&apos;s representative has no clue as to when the 28-year-old will return to tournament action. He isn&apos;t even playing golf for fun. It is getting harder and harder to foresee a comeback.", "title": "US Open course proves Rory McIlroy is right to worry about golf's direction | Ewan Murray", "sentences": ["Those perturbed by Trump&apos;s arrival should bear three things in mind; this is simply a business swapping hands from Dubai to the United States, and the new owner has an impressive track record for spending big on the sport at a time when few others will do likewise."], "publicationDate": "2014-04-30T09:59:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/football-cliches/2014/may/01/-minute-by-minute-as-it-happened-mbm-live", "tags": ["Football", "Sport", "Paul Gascoigne", "World Cup", "World Cup 2014", "England"], "article": " Hello, everyone. A 2011 study by language professor Gunnar Bergh of Mid-Sweden University hypothesised that &quot;public football commentary is typically organised in accordance with the principles and parameters of warfare&quot;. In studying the Guardian&apos;s minute-by-minute coverage of the knockout stages of Euro 2008, Bergh found that Sean Ingle&apos;s report of the semi-final between Russia and Spain contained 117 &quot;war-inspired expressions&quot; in its 90-minute window. If, as Orwell once essayed, &quot;sport is frankly mimic warfare&quot;, then the minute-by-minute report is its most faithful document. Minute-by-minute football coverage (or MBMing) is the written equivalent of Soccer Saturday: reading someone writing what they see in a football match, as they see it. Bergh describes it as &quot;a hybrid of oral commentary and written reports in newspapers&quot;.  With its innate immediacy comes a certain informality that gets professionally sandpapered out of a &quot;proper&quot; match report. But just who&apos;s reading it, I found myself briefly wondering on my recent MBM debut. Perhaps minute-by-minute reports might have been better suited to Ceefax&apos;s heyday, before unpoliceable internet live-streaming opened up the 3pm Saturday kick-offs to anyone living in Derby as well as Dubai. The coverage was pioneered by the Guardian&apos;s website during the 1998 World Cup. It&apos;s an intense format \u2013 there&apos;s essentially a deadline roughly every 90 seconds \u2013 and an uneventful game is arguably just as challenging as a pulsating, end-to-end barnstormer. Bergh again observes: &quot;The noted variation in word count is probably due to such factors as the length of the match ... the character of the play ... and the idiosyncracies of the commentator (e.g. his personal bent towards verbosity).&quot;  And Gazza Misses the Final, a new book by seasoned (dare I say grizzled?) MBMers Rob Smyth and Scott Murray, seeks to revisit the most famous matches in World Cup history and present them again in real time and, crucially, at face value. Some of the most endlessly replayed moments on football&apos;s greatest stage stand side-by-side with the gloriously mundane  23 min: The sun&apos;s out!  Particularly for someone with my attention span, it&apos;s virtually impossible to read this book directly from cover to cover. You&apos;re drawn immediately to the game that most captures your imagination: England v West Germany in 1990 in my case. In turn, your eyes are irresistibly dragged towards the iconic incidents, which are identified by bold text and a suitable number of exclamation marks!!! These plot twists are well-worn nostalgia, but this format brings them back to life as unexpected moments of drama. These are convincing snapshots of quasi-immediacy that, despite being written decades after the event, convey the sensation of a World Cup moment that the diminishing returns of straightforward nostalgia cannot.   Semi-forgotten close shaves, disallowed goals and other coulda-woulda-shoulda turning points, many of which have been glossed over by sheer time, are brought back into the equation. I would use the word &quot;narrative&quot;, but there is no artificially added narrative here, no knowing foreboding of whatever was to unfold. As Smyth and Murray point out in the preamble: &quot;Even a match report hurriedly filed on the final whistle is viewed through the filter of the result ... nobody ever goes back to rewrite a live report.&quot;  Nevertheless, this book faces a running battle against the insidious corruption of hindsight. The authors can&apos;t resist some dramatic irony as Hurst puts the icing on the 1966 cake (&quot;I wonder what Wolstenholme&apos;s saying over on the BBC?&quot;) and there&apos;s some occasional poetic licence applied \u2013 Gordon Banks&apos;s 1970 wondersave from Pel\u00e9 is afforded around 300 words. 1962&apos;s infamous Battle of Santiago, meanwhile, is depicted as an almost slapstick, put-up-ya-dukes scene. Perhaps quite accurately:         41 min: But here come dark clouds! WHAT A LEFT HOOK!!! You can get too pious about stuff like this, so let&apos;s just say that&apos;s the best left hook you&apos;ll ever see on a football pitch! Pow! Right in the kisser! Straight to the moon!           34 min: CHRIS WADDLE HITS THE BAR FROM 45 YARDS!  It wouldn&apos;t have counted, as the referee had blown for a foul by Platt a split-second earlier. That was reminiscent of Pel\u00e9 in 1970 but this time it was a bloody Englishman doing it.           83 min: With Anderton lining up a free-kick on the right wing, the camera shows Merson laughing. How can you stand there guffawing at a time like this, man?! Don&apos;t you know what we&apos;re going through?   The incredulous upper-case outbursts, shamelessly partisan asides and the delightfully convoluted similes (&quot;Fenwick nearly sent Maradona&apos;s kneecaps whirling like Catherine wheels towards Guadalajara!&quot;) are vital ingredients in what make the format so worthwhile. Smyth and Murray are rightly proud of the reporting style that they helped to make so popular: &quot;It&apos;s the most honest appreciation of a match you&apos;re ever going to get.&quot; In Murray&apos;s case, in a 2003 Cricket World Cup report, perhaps even too honest.  In the spring of 2014, one early symptom of World Cup fever is a craving for football nostalgia. Indulge it by firing up YouTube and getting hold of a copy of the most original way to relive the most well-documented World Cup moments (and some that you may just have forgotten after all this time).

Atl\u00e9tico&apos;s extraordinary season, which could yet see them lift the Spanish title and the Champions League, has meant increased exposure for an incongruous sponsor: the oil-rich eastern European country of Azerbaijan. Wednesday&apos;s semi-final victory, against a club owned for more than a decade by a Russian oligarch and played out in front of Gazprom advertising hoardings, was just the latest example of the shifting nature of sporting politics and investment over that time. The slogan &quot;Land of Fire&quot; that is emblazoned on the front of the shirts sported by Diego Simeone&apos;s team is part of a wider push by the country to raise its profile that has also taken in the Eurovision Song Contest, an Olympic bid and preparations to host the inaugural European Games in 2015. It is a model of using sport as an arm of diplomacy also being pursued by others including Qatar, through its purchase of Paris Saint-Germain and Qatar Air&apos;s sponsorship of Barcelona, and Abu Dhabi, through Manchester City. But this season it is Azerbaijan that has come up trumps for a fraction of the cost. The initial sponsorship deal, which ran for a season and a half from January 2013, cost the Azerbaijanis just \u20ac12m. Not only did that include shirt sponsorship, but a wider strategic agreement that saw the Atl\u00e9tico squad and coaching team travelling to the country last spring and a plan to train young Azerbaijani footballers in Madrid and Baku. When the deal was renewed until the end of the 2014-15 season earlier this year, the Atl\u00e9tico president Enrique Cerezo said: &quot;We are two travelling companions who embark on a common path that allows them to develop multiple joint actions. In just one year, we have been able to project the image of Azerbaijan for the world and promote bilateral relations between our countries.&quot; It is just one plank of the country&apos;s ambitious plans on the world stage and at home. Huge investment in Baku is driving the construction of new hotels, apartments and a Dubai Palm-style luxury development in the Caspian Sea. Its bid to host the 2020 Olympic Games failed at the shortlisting stage but this week it has also announced a deal to host the country&apos;s first Grand Prix in 2016 \u2013 the must have accoutrement for any nouveau riche state. Like some of those other oil-rich countries that have sought to boost their profile through sport, however, Azerbaijan has also faced criticism over its human rights record. Campaigners accuse the former Soviet state of suppressing opposition, restricting freedom of protest and religion and forcibly evicting thousands of families to make way for construction projects. But Atl\u00e9tico, which has ambitions of its own to grow its brand beyond the borders of Spain, insists its relationship with the country is a force for good and extends far beyond a traditional shirt sponsorship. &quot;The link between Azerbaijan and Atl\u00e9tico Madrid is much more than a traditional commercial sponsorship associated with a shirt sponsorship, because it has a tremendous value, as the tool to achieve important goals, through actions of a different nature, sports, commercial, communication, marketing and corporate social responsibility for the benefit of all parties,&quot; it says in a comprehensive mission statement on its website. If Atl\u00e9tico go on to achieve the unlikely feat of beating their more illustrious city neighbours in the Champions League final, expect the expensive champagne to be flowing not only in Lisbon but also on the banks of the Caspian Sea.", "title": "Azerbaijan's sponsorship of Atl\u00e9tico Madrid proves spectacular success | Owen Gibson", "sentences": ["Huge investment in Baku is driving the construction of new hotels, apartments and a Dubai Palm-style luxury development in the Caspian Sea."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-01T13:25:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/01/serco-contracts-scandal-profile", "tags": ["Serco", "Business", "UK news"], "article": "Sometimes described as the &quot;biggest company you&apos;ve never heard of&quot;, Serco was in celebratory mood just over a year ago, with profits surging after it had won a record number of contracts ranging from community healthcare in Suffolk to retaining the joint running of Britain&apos;s nuclear warheads store at Aldermaston. But everything changed for the giant outsourcing conglomerate when it became mired in a series of scandals, saw its stock market value slump and was ignominiously ejected from the FTSE 100 index.

It has won a number of healthcare contracts as private involvement in the NHS increases, such as out of hours GPs in Cornwall \u2013 damned in a report by the House Of Commons public accounts committee  that was prompted by reports in the Guardian and found Serco had replaced clinicians&apos; on out-of-hours GP services in Cornwall with call-handlers without medical training.

It was a fifth colts&apos; Classic success for the jockey and his first in the race for eight years. His mount, who was winning for Richard Hannon in the first year since the trainer took over at his Wiltshire stable from his father, reversed Greenham Stakes form with the favourite Kingman. Kingman had looked likely to collect the prize when taking up the running in the closing stages but was caught close home by the winner, who he had well behind him in second at Newbury last time. But there was a huge scare for supporters of the eventual winner who veered across the track and nearly into the path of third-placed Australia. Fallon said: &quot;I thought he&apos;d given it away, but he&apos;s a good horse and hopefully he can continue.&quot; An emotional Hannon said: &quot;I didn&apos;t have time to enjoy it - I was watching [my other two horses in the race]. But we&apos;ve always though a lot of Night Of Thunder and he&apos;s done it well. We were a bit disappointed with him in the Greenham but today he showed how good he was. &quot;He gets a mile, no problem, and he settled better today. He pulled a little bit in the Greenham and he&apos;s turned the form around with Kingman.&quot; Night Of Thunder now has the option of travelling to The Curragh to contest the Irish 2,000 Guineas on May 24, for which he would need to be supplemented. Hannon said: &quot;We&apos;ll have to talk to Bruce Raymond [racing manager for owner Saeed Manana] but I&apos;d imagine it will be either the Irish Guineas or the St James&apos;s Palace at Royal Ascot. Shifting Power ran great to finish fourth and could be a French Derby horse.&quot; The race was an unsatisfactory one as the field split into two groups soon after the start, with the Hannon-trained Toormore moving to the stands&apos; rail under Richard Hughes and Spanish raider Noozhoh Canarias leading the far-side runners, which included the eventual first and second. Kingman came with a strong run on the outside of the far group and looked like he would justify the high opinion of him, while on the near side Toormore was headed a furlong out, with Australia going on from Hannon&apos;s other runner, Shifting Power. Aidan O&apos;Brien, trainer of Australia, was very pleased with the run of the third home who could hardly have run a better race with the Derby in mind. He said: &quot;[Australia] ran a great race and you have to be delighted with him. We&apos;ll talk to [the owners] and they will decide but the Derby trip was never going to be a problem.&quot; 3.35pm Ryan keen on sprinter Hot Streak Tony Paley: There was a lot to like about Hot Streak&apos;s run in the Palace House and trainer Kevin Ryan told Racing UK: &quot;All along I&apos;ve said [Hot Streak] is the best horse I&apos;ve ever trained. If he doesn&apos;t win a Group 1 I&apos;ll give up training.&quot; 3.30pm Choir proves on-song in Jockey Club Stakes Tony Paley: Gospel Choir was an emphatic winner of the Qatar Bloodstock Jockey Club Stakes at Newmarket. Ryan Moore, completing a quick double, said: &quot;The race went very well, very smoothly.&quot; Winning trainer Sir Michael Stoute said: &quot;I knew he was spot-on, but I didn&apos;t think he&apos;d beat Trading Leather.  &quot;He&apos;s really progressing, this fellow. I think he&apos;s reached a pretty good standard, but here&apos;s hoping he can find a bit more improvement. We&apos;ll stop and think, but he&apos;s in the Hardwicke [at Royal Ascot] and he&apos;s in the Eclipse [at Sandown].&quot;  3pm Power powers to Palace House victory Tony Paley: Sole Power kept up Chris Cook&apos;s excellent run when recording back-to-back-victories in the Palace House Stakes. Ryan Moore switched right for a clear run and the 9-4 favourite got home by half a length from Kingsgate Native, who was also second 12 months ago. Hot Streak ran a very promising race for a three-year-old, when just a head away in third. Moore said: &quot;He&apos;s probably the best five-furlong horse in England and Ireland. He was back to best today. If he gets a hard pace to run at he&apos;s about the best there is.&quot; Successful trainer Eddie Lynam said: &quot;Ryan said he was super today. Unlike his trainer, he is improving with age. He&apos;s very honest - too honest - and Ryan loved him today.  &quot;We&apos;re looking forward to another good season. If he gets three things - his ground, that he&apos;s bouncing out of his skin, and that Ryan Moore rides - he&apos;ll go to the Temple Stakes. If not, then he&apos;s off to the King&apos;s Stand at Royal Ascot.&quot; 2.30pm Cooking the books with Niceofyoutotellme Tony Paley: Chris Cook, the Guardian&apos;s chief tipster, is in excellent form and continued his winning ways with the Ralph Beckett-trained Niceofyoutotellme winning the valuable opening event of Guineas weekend at Newmarket.  Beckett said of the 10-1 winner: &quot;This has been the plan for a while as he likes this place. He&apos;s had terrible trouble with his feet - I believe it runs in the family - and he had three months off without shoes. He wants quick ground and a mile on this sort of track.&quot; There was plenty to like about the run of Michael Stoute&apos;s Bold Sniper, who made good progress into third. One to watch out for over longer trip. 1.50pm Record \u00a35m Scoop6 bet up for grabs Tony Paley: The Scoop6 bet, which is odds-on at 4-9 with Betfred to be won today, starts in 15 minutes with the 2.05 race at Newmarket. The other legs are: 2.40 Newmarket; 3.00 Thirsk; 3.30 Goodwood; 3.40 Thirk and 3.50 Newmarket. There is \u00a32,096,863 in the in pool with the bonus fund standing at \u00a31,777,220. Around \u00a32m is expected to be invested this afternoon. 1.30pm Kiyoshi non-runner in 1,000 Guineas Tony Paley: Kiyoshi is a non-runner in Sunday&apos;s 1,000 Guineas having been found to be lame. She was a best-priced 16-1 at the time of her withdrawal.  Saturday&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook Three years after Frankel&apos;s runaway performance in the 2,000 Guineas racing purists will return to Newmarket for the colts&apos; Classic today in the hope of seeing something comparably brilliant from another powerful bay colt carrying the same pink and green colours. Kingman&apos;s odds have drifted to an uneasy 7-4 this week as his followers have fretted over whether he would be risked on good to firm ground but little doubt remains on that score and he is likely to be popular in betting shops this afternoon. &quot;He&apos;s not Frankel,&quot; says Lord Grimthorpe, racing manager to the man who is lucky enough to own both horses, Khalid Abdulla. &quot;Having said that, I hope he wins the Guineas from stall one [as Frankel did]. &quot;But he has a long way to go to be that. Frankel was champion two-year-old.&quot; Of course, Kingman might have been champion juvenile, too, had he not required ankle surgery after his Solario win in August. &quot;True,&quot; concedes Lord Grimthorpe, &quot;but &apos;might have, could have, should have&apos; don&apos;t look very good in the form book, or your bank balance. Both were impressive Greenham winners, of course. Believe me, I hope he is [another Frankel] but I would be amazed if he reaches those heights. &quot;Kingman is a Group Three winner, trying to be a Group One winner. Everything he&apos;s done suggests he is going to be competitive [in the Guineas]. We hope and expect that he will improve again but he will need to. It&apos;s a very high-class race and you can make a case for a lot of them. It&apos;s all up for grabs and everyone else will be thinking, &apos;We could have a chance here.&apos;&quot; Much has been made of the shortage of rain at Newmarket in recent weeks but the GoingStick reading of 7.6 suggests there is more give in the ground for this Guineas than in the years it was won by Dawn Approach (9.0) or Frankel (8.8). This going should be fine for Kingman but other things can go wrong and even 7-4 does not appeal in what looks a hot contest. The second-favourite, Australia, may not be the best alternative as he is bred to need further than a mile and took an age to locate top gear when last seen as a juvenile. But much may be said for his stablemate War Command (3.50), trying to be the third Dewhurst winner in four years to follow up in the Guineas. As early as last June, he was a brilliant Coventry winner but is bred to be better at a mile this year. He is proven on the course and will be ridden for the first time by Ryan Moore, who stole the 1,000 Guineas two years ago for the same connections. War Command looks overpriced at 9-1. Potentially the market has made an even bigger mistake in leaving Outstrip on 28-1, considering he is a Breeders&apos; Cup winner who will be well suited if the surface does indeed prove to be fast. But his stable&apos;s form is questionable and he might be better suited by the St James&apos;s Palace Stakes around a bend at Royal Ascot. Rest of Channel 4 races 2.05 Newmarket  The winner of his first two races last year, Niceofyoutotellme comes from an in-form yard. 2.20 Goodwood Waila can be forgiven her soft-ground flop last time but may find it hard to reel in Special Meaning, who will be sharper for her reappearance. 2.40 Newmarket  A sound surface should allow Sole Power to step up on what he showed in Dubai, just as he did when landing this last year. 2.55 Goodwood  Magic City is unbeaten in three visits here and still seems on a fair mark. 3.10 Newmarket  The Irish Derby winner Trading Leather holds easily the best form claims and this return to a mile and a half should help.

The outsider beat the two hotpots in the race, Kingman and Australia, by less than a length and delivered Classic glory at the first attempt for his trainer, Richard Hannon Jr. It was an unsatisfactory race, in that the field split into two groups, who each raced hard against the rails with an acre of grass between them. Connections of Kingman claimed that their horse had beaten all those on his side of the track, implying that he may have been unlucky, but this is true only inasmuch as Night Of Thunder ended up on the stands&apos; side after veering across the track; he began on the far rail, close to Kingman, and stayed there until the final 100 yards or so. That the chestnut was able to quicken past Kingman while hanging away from Fallon&apos;s whip hand is indicative of serious quality. If there was an unlucky horse, it was Australia, who pulled clear of those on his side, had nothing to race against for the final furlong and presumably knew nothing of the winner until he came flying across in the dying strides with intimidating force and almost knocked into him. &quot;It was unbelievable, the way he quickened for me,&quot; Fallon said. &quot;He was always going to pick up Kingman, until he started to veer and then I started to worry a bit. But at that stage, it&apos;s too late, it happened very quickly.&quot; This was the Irishman&apos;s fifth success in the 2,000 Guineas during a career at least as erratic as the path plotted by his mount here. His peaks include six champion jockey&apos;s titles and a long list of major races but there have been some serious troughs along the way, some of which would have been easily avoided by another man. But Fallon is not lacking in self-knowledge and appears to have made a diagnosis of forensic accuracy last summer when telling the Guardian that a lack of opportunities to ride out each morning had caused him to fall into a rut. &quot;I&apos;ve gotten lazy, so I have, for the first time in my life,&quot; he said. By the end of the season, it seemed that retirement could not be far away, that it might indeed be the only dignified option, to give up the game before it gave up on him. But he made himself available in Dubai this spring, did well and has been riding out since his return here for Godolphin&apos;s trainer, Saeed bin Suroor. It was, he felt, the connection that led to him being booked for Night Of Thunder, owned by Saeed Manana, an associate of Sheikh Mohammed. &quot;Riding out for Godolphin has really helped my confidence because I&apos;m riding good horses every morning,&quot; Fallon said. &quot;When you&apos;re not riding the good horses, you obviously lose confidence and it affects your race-riding.&quot; Fallon inherited the ride when Richard Hughes chose to ride the winner&apos;s stablemate, Toormore, who was a disappointing seventh. It was put to Fallon that Hughes would be especially doleful about the outcome but that provoked a scornful laugh from the winning rider, who does not expect to keep the mount. &quot;He&apos;s not going to be gutted because he&apos;s got a good horse to ride for the season,&quot; Fallon said. This was a huge moment for the 38-year-old Hannon, who was finally allowed to take over his father&apos;s stable near Marlborough in the new year after many years as assistant to Richard Sr. He has been gifted the sort of training operation that anyone would dream of having, together with a squad of such talent as to drive most of his rivals wild with envy, but he has made his own contribution to building it up over the last decade. &quot;We always thought a lot of him,&quot; he said of the winner, though it clearly required an effort in the thrilling aftermath to produce cogent utterances. &quot;I feel very sorry for Hughesie, who loves the horse and wanted to ride him at Newbury [in the horse&apos;s prep race, when he was beaten by Kingman]. &quot;We were a little bit disappointed in the Greenham but he showed how good he was there. They didn&apos;t go quite quick enough for him and he pulled a bit.&quot; Night Of Thunder will now be aimed at the Irish Guineas, while Hannon&apos;s Shifting Power, fourth under Frankie Dettori, has the Derby and the Irish Derby as possible targets. The Derby is also the target for Australia, who did much to justify his reputation here and is now no bigger than 7-4 for Epsom. John Gosden, trainer of Kingman, did his best to be philosophical but was plainly irritated by the way the race had unfolded. &quot;That&apos;s life, that&apos;s the way it goes,&quot; he said. &quot;But when they split into two, it doesn&apos;t create the perfect race, does it? Let&apos;s be honest about that. &quot;I don&apos;t know, what do you do? Do you narrow the track? It seemed a bit stupid, with [only] 14 runners, to do what they did, diverge.&quot; Kingman&apos;s next obvious target is the St James&apos;s Palace Stakes at Royal Ascot, though he may have another crack at Night Of Thunder in the Irish Guineas on 24 May. Joseph O&apos;Brien can expect to be disciplined when he returns to Newmarket for Sunday&apos;s 1,000 Guineas. The stewards wanted to inquire into his use of the whip aboard Australia but found he had left the course before they could do so. The cheerful mood of the day was shattered after the last race when a fight between two groups of young men broke out in the betting ring and was sustained, with interludes, for around 10 minutes. No arrests were made but police escorted the two groups from the premises. Officers reported no significant injuries and it is not believed that any bystanders were hurt. &quot;Someone spoke to someone else&apos;s girlfriend,&quot; said one young man who had been on the fringes of the action. &quot;It&apos;s just young lads after a lot of drink.

I understand what students are going through when they&apos;re struggling to apply themselves in lessons. I was a bright kid at school but wasn&apos;t as engaged as I should have been, so I ended up not doing very well in my A-levels, doing the wrong university course and eventually dropping out. The experience made me a better teacher \u2013 I know how important it is to motivate students, and I know every excuse, duck and dive in the book. When I left school, I ended up working in industry, first as a quality assurance technician for a company that made silicon sealants, and later as a production manager for Nestl\u00e9 in Newcastle. My department at Nestl\u00e9 was jelly tots and fruit gum packaging \u2013 it&apos;s not as fantastic as it sounds \u2013 where I had 40 geordies working for me. I enjoyed it at first, but deep down I knew that I couldn&apos;t do it for the rest of my life: I had a sense of restlessness. After a few years working with gummy bears I took voluntary redundancy. A friend suggested that I become a teacher \u2013 something that had always appealed to me because I&apos;d enjoyed helping younger students while at school. So I decided to go back to university and train to be a geography teacher. The PGCE course was the hardest year of my life. I was a mature student and so didn&apos;t get the same financial support as others. I used to do lorry driving at night for a poultry company to support myself and pay the mortgage. The teaching itself was highly pressured \u2013 those kids only get one chance with education, and I&apos;m the person who is trusted to stand at the front and help them \u2013 but I enjoyed it from day one. Managing kids is very different from managing people. At the Nestl\u00e9 factory, workers would have to come to work \u2013 if they didn&apos;t then they wouldn&apos;t get paid and they could potentially lose their job. You have a false type of relationship. They know that I&apos;m their boss and if I&apos;m asking them to do something then, in reality, I&apos;m telling them to do it. You don&apos;t get very far telling kids what to do. Students need enthusiasm, they need to know that you really care and they need to hear and see it over and over again. The more you show them that you care, the more they respond. Kids have all kinds of baggage or different backgrounds that you would never guess just by looking at them \u2013 it&apos;s only by sitting down and talking to them that you find out. The challenge of meeting students&apos; individual needs is the most fantastic thing about teaching. People who don&apos;t teach don&apos;t really how appreciate how challenging or rewarding it is. I remember being on my placement and having a class of year 7s for only nine weeks. I had to develop a curriculum that would engage them. As a trainee, I didn&apos;t realise the emotional impact that it can have when students recognise that the teacher is actually trying to do something new that they will enjoy. I remember when my mentor told the students that it was my last lesson, there were sudden protests of &quot;Nooo you can&apos;t leave!&quot;. I still have in my portfolio all the thank you cards and notes that students have sent to me over the years. Since starting teaching my PGCE in 2002 I&apos;ve worked my way up as Duke of Edinburgh coordinator, head of geography and then director of learning at a school in Derbyshire. A few years ago I decided to teach in Dubai. You can imagine lots of geography teachers have a map on their office wall with pins in it showing where they&apos;ve been. For me, I&apos;d done traveling and trips abroad over the years, but there was a big gap in the middle east. I saw that a job came up for an assistant principal in Dubai.

On a recent Friday, players at Damascus Zenobians RFC held a sevens tournament among themselves. They pulled together three teams. With the almost constant threat of war on the city&apos;s doorstep, it was a small triumph for a group struggling on all fronts. Founded 10 years ago, the Zenobians once served as an excuse for the city&apos;s expat rugby fans to meet up. Foreigners working for oil companies and NGOs held training sessions and, later, teams from across the Middle East came to Damascus to play. &quot;Back in 2003, rugby in Syria was just a bunch of fairly unfit French oil workers from Total and a few diplomats from the British embassy,&quot; said Rob Bennett, a Londoner who played with the Zenobians until he left Syria in 2006. Soon, Syrians took an interest. At the height of the sport&apos;s popularity in 2008, about 65 people trained twice a week in Damascus: Arabic language students, expats and locals. But since winning an amateur competition at the Dubai International Sevens in 2011, the club&apos;s fortunes, in step with the rest of the country, have deteriorated. Named after a Syrian queen who ruled during the third century AD, the war has cost the club its entire complement of foreign players and it has been hit by financial problems. When Shell and other multinationals moved out as the revolt turned to war at the end of 2011, so did the sponsorship money they stumped up. Today, the team has no dedicated sports ground and training sessions depend on funds available at any one time. &quot;The last foreign player left in late 2011 when his company closed,&quot; said 29-year-old Hani, the team&apos;s number eight, who fell in love with rugby after attending a Zenobians&apos; training session nine years ago. &quot;Today, we can call on a core of only 10 players. They have been always there and never been absent, even for one training session.&quot; The team has been invited to tournaments in Cyprus, Istanbul and Dubai this summer but, as it stands, players have no money to attend. For a forthcoming competition in neighbouring Lebanon, the Zenobians must go and return on the same day to try to avoid the dangers of travelling through the Syrian countryside at night. &quot;We have zero dollars in our pocket and we have been supporting the poor players in the team to travel, but we cannot do it any more,&quot; said Hani. In recent weeks, the far-off din of clashes in Damascus&apos;s rebel-controlled suburbs has been replaced by the sound of incoming mortar shells as rebels try to unsettle government-controlled districts of the capital before the presidential elections this summer. This month alone, at least 26 people, including seven children on their way to school, have been killed by shelling of the city centre from opposition-controlled suburbs. More than a hundred have been injured. &quot;What is not dangerous in Syria?&quot; said Mohammed Jarko, a 37-year-old mechanical engineer with the UN and the team&apos;s openside flanker. &quot;The biggest difficulty is getting to the field.&quot; As their surroundings increasingly resemble an open war zone, the small group of rugby fanatics are torn. &quot;For me, rugby is not only a sport, it is a culture, it is a way of life,&quot; said Hani. &quot;But I will never leave the place where I was born.&quot;", "title": "Damascus rugby team plays on amid chaos of Syrian war", "sentences": ["But since winning an amateur competition at the Dubai International Sevens in 2011, the club&apos;s fortunes, in step with the rest of the country, have deteriorated.", "They have been always there and never been absent, even for one training session.&quot; The team has been invited to tournaments in Cyprus, Istanbul and Dubai this summer but, as it stands, players have no money to attend."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-04T18:54:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/04/miss-france-1000-guineas-kieren-fallon-derby-true-story", "tags": ["The Derby 2014", "Kieren Fallon", "The Derby", "Godolphin", "1,000 Guineas", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Andr\u00e9 Fabre completed the set of English Classics on the Rowley Mile here on Sunday as Miss France took the 1,000 Guineas ahead of Lightning Thunder and Ihtimal, but it was Kieren Fallon who emerged from Guineas weekend as the biggest winner and with another high-profile engagement to anticipate as the Flat season moves on towards Epsom. Fallon, who won the 2,000 Guineas on Night Of Thunder on Saturday took a minor race on Elite Gardens for Godolphin&apos;s Saeed bin Suroor, and the trainer later confirmed that Fallon will take over from Silvestre de Sousa on True Story, a live contender for the Derby, when he runs in the Dante Stakes at York next week. &quot;Kieren is one of the best jockeys,&quot; Suroor said after Elite Gardens&apos; victory. &quot;I&apos;m happy to give him a chance in all the big races. He rode True Story today on the gallops and he gave me good information. He&apos;s going to ride him in the Dante.&quot; De Sousa has been Suroor&apos;s principal jockey since Frankie Dettori lost his job as Godolphin&apos;s No1 rider in the autumn of 2012 and he rode the trainer&apos;s African Story to win the Dubai World Cup, the world&apos;s richest race, in March. He also rode True Story to an impressive success in the Fielden Stakes at Newmarket&apos;s Craven meeting in April but the news that Fallon will replace him in the Dante suggests that Godolphin are already thinking two steps ahead to Epsom, and want to secure a jockey whose record at the demanding downland track is second to none. It also suggests that De Sousa can no longer be sure of the ride on Suroor&apos;s main contender for a major race. While Godolphin has adopted a loose structure with regard to riding arrangements since Dettori&apos;s departure, with no overall No1 jockey, Fallon has quickly become a significant part of Suroor&apos;s operation and now seems to be the rider among the Godolphin team whose star is in the ascendant. Fallon has won the Derby four times and has talked in the past of an affinity he feels for the track as similar to that of Dettori&apos;s love for Ascot. The likelihood that he will be aboard True Story at Epsom to attract the attention of punters. Miss France, an impressive winner of the Oh So Sharp Stakes at Newmarket last season, was the winter favourite for the 1,000 Guineas but could finish only sixth on her seasonal debut last month. Sent off at 7-1 on Sunday, she appreciated a stronger pace in the Classic and took the lead about a furlong out under Maxime Guyon before holding the late charge of Lightning Thunder by a neck. Ihtimal, trained by Suroor and ridden by De Sousa, was third. &quot;It was the exact opposite of the way I wanted [her to] be ridden but it worked,&quot; Fabre said. &quot;[Her seasonal debut] was not a race, anything but a race. I was waiting for her morning work [afterwards] and I got very confident when she worked very well in the morning. She will go further, it&apos;s not a problem and she will go for the Prix de Diane [French Oaks].&quot; Asked whether he was pleased to have completed a full set of all five English Classics, Fabre said: &quot;It doesn&apos;t mean anything, it&apos;s just another racing day. I&apos;m just happy and it&apos;s a solved problem.&quot; A significant contender for the Oaks at Epsom in early June emerged in the Pretty Polly Stakes as Taghrooda, already prominent in the ante-post betting following her maiden success here last season, stormed six lengths clear of her field and is now top-priced at 3-1 for the Classic on 6 June. &quot;She wants a mile and a half now,&quot; John Gosden said, and Taghrooda will go straight to Epsom. &quot;We can always take her to Epsom and have a look around as they have an open day,&quot; Gosden added, &quot;and her father [Sea The Stars] got around there no problem.&quot;", "title": "Miss France wins 1,000 Guineas as Kieren Fallon steals Derby spotlight", "sentences": ["He&apos;s going to ride him in the Dante.&quot; De Sousa has been Suroor&apos;s principal jockey since Frankie Dettori lost his job as Godolphin&apos;s No1 rider in the autumn of 2012 and he rode the trainer&apos;s African Story to win the Dubai World Cup, the world&apos;s richest race, in March."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-04T19:33:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/may/05/horse-racing-live-5-may-2014", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Today&apos;s best bets, by Greg Wood Today&apos;s bank holiday means that quantity overtakes quality in terms of the number of meetings, but, though the jumps card at Ffos Las is decidedly thin, with an average of just under six runners in each of the jumps races, there are fair fields for most of the remaining meetings and a few horses worth a second look.

He will make an immediate application to the British Horseracing Authority, asking that they do not reciprocate the ban, citing flaws in the process followed by the Emirates Racing Authority. &quot;We are deeply disappointed with the decision,&quot; said Paul Struthers, chief executive of the Professional Jockeys&apos; Association. &quot;This is an unfair and as yet unexplained decision and we believe the appeal board has seriously erred in its judgment. &quot;Whilst we are well aware that Australasian stewarding is different in style to European stewarding and that their rules are not always the same as ours, some of the behaviour and processes that we witnessed fell far below the standards one would expect from a fair and reasonable regulator. The result is that we have serious misgivings about the rules and stewarding in Dubai and do not believe that jockeys can be assured of a fair hearing.&quot; Christopher Stewart-Moore, Cosgrave&apos;s solicitor, complained that the appeal had effectively been run as a complete rehearing, even though ERA rules say it should take the form of a review. Struthers said he had additional concerns about the delay in arranging an appeal hearing, the fact that Cosgrave was banned pending appeal, a lack of timely responses to correspondence by the ERA and an additional delay of seven days before the appeal result was announced, even though the verdict came without detailed reasons. Struthers added that he was &quot;disappointed and concerned that there has already been an attempt to put pressure on the BHA&quot;. This is believed to be a reference to an ERA letter, sent to the BHA, which alluded to the damage that would be done to relations between the bodies if the ban were not reciprocated. While Cosgrave&apos;s appeal succeeded in part, the ERA nevertheless ordered that he should meet the costs of the appeal board and of transcribing the hearing in addition to his own costs. Struthers said the necessary application would be on the relevant desk at the BHA when staff return to work on Tuesday morning after the bank holiday. He expected that a hearing could be arranged in &quot;two or three weeks&apos; time&quot; and added that the BHA would be asked for a stay of penalty in the meantime, which would allow Cosgrave to return to the saddle. The jockey&apos;s ban, initially for six months, was announced on 18 March and will now run until 17 July unless the BHA can be persuaded to intervene. Cosgrave was punished for his ride on Anaerobio in a Group One race at Meydan on 8 March, when he was ruled to have made a &quot;blatant&quot; manoeuvre to the advantage of a stablemate, Vercingetorix, who eventually won. Martin Dwyer persuaded the BHA not to reciprocate a ban he received in India last year, when the BHA accepted there had been a lack of fairness in the process. Richard Hughes failed in a similar application the year before. Aidan O&apos;Brien won the Mooresbridge Stakes at The Curragh for a fifth year in succession on Monday when Magician scrambled home ahead of Parish Hall. The winner will be aimed at the Tattersalls Gold Cup on 25 May. O&apos;Brien had news of his two beaten runners from Saturday&apos;s 2,000 Guineas. Australia, who finished a close third after racing alone on his side for most of the final furlong, will go straight to Epsom for the Derby, the trainer saying he was &quot;very happy with the way he&apos;s come out of the race&quot;. War Command, a disappointing ninth, will be aimed at the Irish 2,000 Guineas on 24 May. &quot;He&apos;s a big, bulky horse and he&apos;s going to improve from the run,&quot; O&apos;Brien said. The trainer said it had been a mistake to run Tapestry, who started favourite but finished last in Sunday&apos;s 1,000 Guineas. O&apos;Brien said he had been concerned the horse was &quot;light&quot; and short of peak condition but was persuaded to run the filly because she was working so well. &quot;She&apos;ll have to have a bit of a break to get some condition back on her,&quot; he said. O&apos;Brien has three entries for Lingfield&apos;s Derby Trial on Saturday. Also in the race is Peter Chapple-Hyam&apos;s Arod, an impressive recent winner at Windsor, but connections said he was more likely to run next week in York&apos;s Dante Stakes.", "title": "Pat Cosgrave has Dubai ban cut but cries foul over 'unfair' process", "sentences": ["Pat Cosgrave had two months chopped off his Dubai ban when the result of his appeal was announced on Monday but the jockey has hopes of a still better outcome.", "The result is that we have serious misgivings about the rules and stewarding in Dubai and do not believe that jockeys can be assured of a fair hearing.&quot; Christopher Stewart-Moore, Cosgrave&apos;s solicitor, complained that the appeal had effectively been run as a complete rehearing, even though ERA rules say it should take the form of a review."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-05T18:17:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/may/06/live-racing-7-may-2014", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "11.30am The Great War impresses Timeform with Curragh romp Tony Paley: The Great War looks likely to be all the rage at Royal Ascot after his effortless win in the Most Improved European Breeders Fund Race at The Curragh on Monday.

O&apos;Brien said: &quot;I nearly got a heart attack looking at him [before the race]. He was away in Dubai and things didn&apos;t go right for him. We gave him a little rest and he had a good tummy on him today. He&apos;s going to come back here for the Tattersalls Gold Cup. He&apos;s in a good place now and Joseph was very happy and said he won snug.&quot; Today&apos;s best bets, by Chris Cook It&apos;s a fine line between generous and ostentatious but I feel that Wes Welker was on the admirable side of it when he handed out $100 bills to the crowd as he left the Kentucky Derby on Saturday. Sharing the wealth seems absolutely the right way to respond to a big win. Of course, there&apos;s no guarantee that Welker actually backed a single winner. He&apos;s richer than Croesus because of his success as a player in the NFL; he could just have been handing out his own money. Anyway, it appears that those present were very appreciative. Alas, Welker doesn&apos;t do this kind of thing on a consistent basis. When we met at Royal Ascot a couple of years ago, he was very generous with his time, considering he was talking to an unfamiliar reporter while on holiday, but I did not see the colour of his money. It&apos;s probably just as well, because obviously I&apos;d have had to turn down any offers of cash in order to maintain my journalistic objectivity, hem hem. But I pass on this story in case he returns to Britain&apos;s racetracks this summer and you happen to bump into him. Free money is unlikely to be on offer at Brighton this afternoon but I hope to earn some through Secret Missile (5.25), a 6-1 shot from the in-form William Muir yard. He won a couple of sprint handicaps at Bath last year from marks just below the one he has today and will be sharper for a couple of reappearance runs. His trouble has been staying close enough to the pace to make his finishing kick count but first-time blinkers should help. Earlier, Dark And Dangerous (3.20) is interesting, returned to Flat racing for the first time in years after finding some success over obstacles for Brendan Powell. The trainer&apos;s daughter, Jenny, rated a promising apprentice by some, takes the mount and I note that she is three from 14 when riding for her pa. They&apos;re 9-2. David Lanigan has made a habit of doing well with his early runners and, although his first three this year have rather blown out, Warrior Of Light (3.40) is interesting at Kempton, where he won his maiden in November. On pedigree, the extra three furlongs should really suit. Tipping competition - a new week Congratulations to last week&apos;s winner, 23skidoo (+26.25), who found Flippant (6-1) on Friday. That was just barely good enough to hold off erifder (+25), who ended the week with Burn And Turn (7-1).

The Burj Khalifa in Dubai is the tallest building in the world. Shanghai\u2019s Pudong boasts a 21st century skyline of bubbles, crowns and globes. These buildings are designed to be instantly recognisable, a signature brand for both their city and their architect. But if every city has them \u2013 and they all hire the same elite group of architects to design them \u2013 how unique can cities\u2019 images be?  Yet uniqueness is the goal of city branding, which during the past few years has grown into a global industry connected to tourism and the media-sports-and-entertainment complex. Originally a promotional scheme meant to lure new residents, city branding is now a slogan tied to a public relations campaign to make the places where we live into \u201cdestinations\u201d. As always with branding, image is everything.  But competition between cities accelerates the need for image-making so that no city can ever win. If the brand process begins with \u201ca desire to be extraordinary\u201d, as one place-branding agency suggests, then predictably, according to the so-called Lake Wobegon effect popularised by the US radio host Garrison Keillor \u2013 who satirises a town where &quot;all the women are strong, all the men are good-looking and all the children are above average&quot; \u2013 then every city turns out to be \u201cextraordinary\u201d.  So how did this counterproductive exercise in collective egotism begin? Cities have long had visual \u201cbrands\u201d: from tourist photos to scenes in a film, our mental postcards of a city become the DNA of its essence; with endless repetition, this essence becomes a meme or a logo for the city\u2019s brand. Think of postcards made around 1900 of the engineering marvel of the Eiffel Tower, or the fantasy pavilions at Coney Island, and the famous photo of the Flatiron Building by Alfred Steiglitz. These are powerful city images.  But city branding as a discipline proper was born in the industrial decline and fiscal stress of the 1970s. It was led by efforts in New York, which hit the limits of a diminishing tax base and vanishing bank loans in 1975 and was pushed to the brink of municipal bankruptcy. During the 1980s, with Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan promoting an era of pro-business exuberance, cities became more entrepreneurial, too. They chased the mobile capital that was let loose by deregulation of financial markets and was concentrated in the sovereign funds of oil-rich states.  Cities didn\u2019t have much choice. Abandoned by local companies eager to merge with much larger corporations and outsourcing production to wherever they could pay low wages and taxes and avoid government regulation, city managers turned to self-promotion. They pursued the \u201cthree Ts\u201d: trade, talent and tourists.  But the old images, devised when cities were actively making products rather than consuming them, were no longer attractive, or even accurate. The slogan \u201cNew York, Empire City\u201d reflected a time after the completion of the Erie Canal in the 1820s, when goods were shipped into New York\u2019s port and then taken further west to Ohio by barge. In 1914 the poet Carl Sandburg called Chicago \u201chog butcher for the world, tool maker, stacker of wheat,\u201d when the city\u2019s stockyards and factories were the economic engine \u2013 and human cesspool \u2013 of the entire midwest.  The more abstract \u201cI (Heart) New York\u201d slogan was created in the 1970s, in conjunction with a family-friendly tourism campaign. By the 1990s, every city wanted to be like New York: to be seen, in other words, as clean, safe and \u201copen for business\u201d. The worldwide tourism industry was rapidly growing, and the concept of top-dog, \u201cglobal\u201d cities was gaining ground, fed by academic researchers on the one hand, and widely read \u201cbest city\u201d lists on the other. From Las Vegas to Seoul, city governments reshaped their convention and visitors\u2019 bureaus into more professional, market-savvy organisations, revved up their advertising budgets and hired brand consultants to show them the ropes.     Krak\u00f3w in Poland was named European Capital of Culture in 2000 \u2013 but the title does not always translate into growth. Photograph: Art Widak/Demotix/Corbis    Globalisation accelerated the branding process. Organisations such as the modern Olympics, Unesco World Heritage Centre and European Capitals of Culture, all of them founded to promote ideals like friendship among nations and preservation of nature and culture, were soon seen as catalysts of economic growth for cities. International cooperation led to intense competition, as cities elbowed each other aside in the bid for coveted designations that would put them in the spotlight of global media. The benefits have been mixed. If the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona sparked a big jump in public-sector investment and created a brand-new city image, other Olympic sites \u2013 Athens, Sydney \u2013 have not been so lucky. Krak\u00f3w, the European Cultural Capital in 2000, was ranked just 30th out of 46 European cities on Saffron brand consultants&apos; 2008 European city brand \u201cbarometer\u201d [pdf], tied with Cardiff and Chi\u015fin\u0103u, the capital of Moldova.  Branding can also be a political liability, if local people and politicians see it as diverting scarce resources from public goods like housing, sewage systems and transportation. Rio will host both the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Olympics, but huge demonstrations swept Brazil last summer to protest the money being spent to ready the city for its moment in the sun. In Cape Town, this year\u2019s World Design Capital, a decision on the city\u2019s new logo and branding slogan has been delayed until after the next general election, in May, because of discord between political parties over the costs.  Consultants advise cities to begin branding by cataloguing their strategic assets. This is a complex process: it involves asking a wide range of stakeholders what they feel about their city, and comparing their reactions to those of potential consumers, who hold no stake in the city at all. There is, of course, some overlap. Everyone likes clean streets, low crime rates and the sense of well-being that is exuded by pleasant public places. Yet the everyday authenticity that city residents enjoy may not match the heightened, \u201cstaged authenticity\u201d that Dean MacCannell described in his classic 1976 critique The Tourist.  Modern-day cities, with New York again in the lead, are gentrifying their old quarters, replacing dive bars with Starbucks and turning whatever old buildings remain into malls and museums. There\u2019s a big difference between this programmed \u201cauthenticity\u201d and the \u201csoul\u201d of a neighbourhood, founded on everyday routines and local character that is so low-key, most residents are not conscious of it at all.  By contrast, Saffron\u2019s model defines a city\u2019s uniqueness in terms of a \u201cpervading sense of exoticism\u201d. The highly desirable \u201cOoh, I could live here\u201d reaction is identified as \u201cthe Barcelona effect\u201d. Yet what could be less desirable if you already live there?  Branding, to be crass, is a means of selling a place \u2013 a building, a district or a city. Capitalising on image demands metrics, and metrics imply control \u2013 of the image, the message and, ultimately, the men and women who flesh out the image: us. In the end, the most important metrics in city branding are increases in property values and tourist spending. Yet these are not necessarily good for city dwellers, especially rental tenants and people who depend on public services that may be underfunded while municipal budgets are diverted to creating and maintaining tourist attractions.  So I\u2019m happy for the cities whose global brands are strong. But ooh, I\u2019m not sure I want to live there.

In a unanimous decision, the constitutional court ruled that Yingluck had acted with a hidden agenda when she transferred a senior civil servant to another position shortly after taking office in 2011. &quot;The prime minister&apos;s status has come to an end,&quot; one of the court&apos;s nine judges said in a statement broadcast live on television. &quot;Yingluck can no longer stay in her position acting as caretaker prime minister.&quot; Analysts called the ruling a &quot;new and potentially dangerous escalation&quot; of Thailand&apos;s political crisis. On Thursday a grenade was thrown at the house of a judge on the constitutional court. No one was hurt, police said. Another ruling against Yingluck is expected on Thursday, when Thailand&apos;s anti-corruption commission decides whether she failed to act against corruption in a botched rice-pledging scheme that has cost the government \u00a314.5bn and led to some bankrupted farmers killing themselves. While Yingluck&apos;s Pheu Thai party described the verdict as a virtual coup and conspiracy to oust her from government, the 46-year-old accepted the decision in an emotional press conference. &quot;I am proud of every minute I have worked as prime minister, because I came from a democratic election,&quot; she said. Yingluck was accused of removing Thailand&apos;s then chief of national security, Thawil Pliensri \u2013 who had been appointed by the opposition \u2013 in order to promote her brother-in-law to another post as national police chief. Although such a move was legal, the court ruled, it was done too quickly and without &quot;moral principles&quot;. The court also ruled that the nine current cabinet ministers who were in office at the time of the transfer must also step down \u2013 among them the labour, finance and foreign ministers. While anti-government protesters are likely to be happy to see Yingluck gone, the verdict falls short of their desire to see her entire government removed. The commerce minister, Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan, was named by the Thai cabinet as Yingluck&apos;s replacement until a planned general election on 20 July. While the Pheu Thai party is widely expected to win \u2013 variations of the party have won every election since 2001 \u2014 it is unclear whether anti-government protesters will allow the election to go ahead. A snap election called by Yingluck on 2 February was marred by violence and protests, with whole provinces prevented from voting. Yingluck&apos;s supporters \u2013 who mainly come from Thailand&apos;s rural north and north-east \u2013 have vowed to hold a rally on Saturday and argue that the courts have sought to topple her at the behest of anti-government protesters led by the People&apos;s Democratic Reform Committee (PDRC). The protesters accuse her of acting as a proxy for her brother Thaksin, the former prime minister who was removed from government in 2006 and now lives in self-exile in Dubai. They have staged rallies and sit-ins at government buildings since November, sparked by the midnight passage of an amnesty bill that would have allowed Thaksin to return from exile. &quot;The opposition will try to delay [elections] until unspecified political reforms are carried out,&quot; said Thailand analyst Jacob Hamstra of the Economist Intelligence Unit. &quot;These changes, presumably, would in effect increase the influence of the anti-Thaksin military and bureaucratic establishment in Bangkok at the expense of Thailand&apos;s poor, rural majority.&quot; Wednesday&apos;s verdict is not unusual. Yingluck is the third Shinawatra-linked prime minister to be judicially removed from post since 2006, a point that analysts stress marks a &quot;fascinating development in the Shinawatra saga&quot; of political to-and-froing since his ousting. &quot;What is interesting about the current iteration is the bloodless, legal nature of the approach,&quot; says Liam McCarthy, an expert on south-east Asia at Nottingham Trent University. &quot;Using the legal process to take what the coup couldn&apos;t secure, and the polls couldn&apos;t guarantee.&quot; While Wednesday&apos;s ruling could be seen as a victory for the PDRC, it is unlikely to assuage protesters, who may now turn on the new caretaker prime minister, said Thitinan Pongsudhirak of Thailand&apos;s Institute of Security and International Studies. &quot;They lost Yingluck but they haven&apos;t lost her government, so I think we are set up for more drama,&quot; he told the Guardian. &quot;He [Niwatthamrong Boonsongpaisan] is really a Thaksin lackey and Yingluck confidante, and now that he is acting PM, I suspect very quickly that will become the new lightning rod \u2013 [as] he comes from the family business.&quot;", "title": "Thai prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra forced to step down", "sentences": ["The protesters accuse her of acting as a proxy for her brother Thaksin, the former prime minister who was removed from government in 2006 and now lives in self-exile in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-08T05:20:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2014/may/08/corrections-and-clarifications", "tags": [], "article": "\u2022 A column in G2 (So Elliott Smith&apos;s music killed Peaches Geldof: why do pop stars still get the blame for everything?, 7 May, page 5) referred to &quot;the results of the inquest into Peaches Geldof&apos;s death&quot; being announced last week.

The Ballydoyle trainer is well placed to land Saturday&apos;s Lingfield Derby Trial for what would be the fourth time in seven runnings, fielding two horses, the better of which may be Blue Hussar (2.55). He won his only race so far, a seven-furlong maiden at Leopardstown in November, staying on strongly after having only two of his 13 rivals behind him at the turn for home. A son of Montjeu, he should be perfectly comfortable at this sort of distance with some cut in the ground and can make sufficient progress to win what does not seem a hot race. His stablemate, Mekong River, is much more of a known quantity after five races last season and his flop at Saint-Cloud in November suggests he is short of Derby quality. He will be the mount of Joseph O&apos;Brien, which may make some think that he is the stable&apos;s first string, but jockey bookings are not a completely reliable guide to such matters and the booking of Ryan Moore is clearly not a negative for Blue Hussar. Sudden Wonder gives Godolphin a fair shot at this prize, having won a valuable pot at the Craven meeting, but Charlie Appleby&apos;s string has not fared all that well since then and he looks short enough in the betting. 1.50 Haydock A Grade One winner at Aintree last spring, L&apos;Unique has worked her way back to peak form in the last month and should again go well. The way she has finished her last two races suggests this three miles should be a help. 2.05 Ascot Restraint Of Trade is a fascinating contender and will surely prove better than his present rating in time. He was one of the horses doped with stanozolol by Mahmood al-Zarooni, the trainer who was given an eight-year worldwide ban last year. Restraint Of Trade was banned from racing for six months, along with the other horses involved, but is back in action and will be the first of the doped horses to run in Britain since the story broke. He showed some promise in Dubai earlier this year but may be best watched this time, with the Charlie Appleby yard short of peak form. Hamelin scored on his handicap debut in October when last seen and should appreciate this softer surface. He still looks well treated. 2.20 Lingfield A daughter of Andrew Balding&apos;s Oaks winner, Casual Look, Casual Smile is winless but showed excellent form last year, notably when beaten a neck by Taghrooda, who is now Oaks favourite. By Sea The Stars, Casual Smile should be a lot better this year and over this extra distance. 2.40 Ascot Nicky Henderson has a fine record with his Flat runners and seems to have coaxed a bit of improvement from Area Fifty One, judged on his Doncaster win in March. A repeat of that could be enough here, with not all rivals certain to relish some cut underfoot. 3.15 Ascot James Fanshawe won this race four years ago and immediately had it in mind for Ribbons after she made a promising return behind Zurigha at Kempton. A mile might possibly be on the sharp side for her on a sound surface but there will be some give here. 3.30 Haydock Loyaute has been in good form and her third behind Polly Peachum and L&apos;Unique at Cheltenham reads well in the context of what those horses did next. But she has less scope to be ahead of her mark than Dubawi Island, a Venetia Williams runner who makes his handicap debut unbeaten over hurdles after three starts. A winner off 83 on the Flat, he is not bereft of speed and is versatile as to going. 3.50 Ascot This looks a fascinating renewal of the Victoria Cup which should offer clues to many major handicaps later this summer. Glen Moss has improved for his move to David Brown&apos;s yard and should go well again with an extra 5lb to carry after his Haydock win. But there may be some value at 16-1 in backing Dont Bother Me to turn the form around, having run fourth that day. Marco Botti&apos;s horses have generally been needing their first outing this year and this one in particular seemed likely to benefit from that run. He was seventh in the Jersey Stakes last summer when trained in Ireland and setting the pace but more restrained tactics seem likely to help and he is an interesting handicap prospect.", "title": "Talking Horses: today's best bets and all the latest racing news", "sentences": ["He showed some promise in Dubai earlier this year but may be best watched this time, with the Charlie Appleby yard short of peak form."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-09T22:59:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/david-conn-inside-sport-blog/2014/may/10/manchester-city-face-down-uefa-financial-fair-play", "tags": ["Manchester City", "Financial fair play", "Finances", "Business", "Uefa", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Manchester City need only to draw with West Ham on Sunday to win the Premier League and, while the ghosts of calamities past hovered during the goalless first hour of Wednesday&apos;s 4-0 victory over Aston Villa, there is no longer genuine dread at City that something has to go wrong. Sergio Ag\u00fcero slayed many of City&apos;s demons with his stoppage-time winner in that nerve-shredding final game against Queens Park Rangers to seize the title two years ago and the talk has not, as in 2012, been all about the trophyless years since the 1970s. Six years and a still barely believable \u00a31bn into the club&apos;s ownership by Sheikh Mansour, of Abu Dhabi&apos;s ruling Al Nahyan family, this is a transformed Manchester City. Expected to claim their second title in three seasons, the League Cup won, a place in the Champions League knockout stage secured, City are where Mansour&apos;s executives, led by the chairman, Khaldoon Al Mubarak, targeted them to be by now. They have world-class footballers in each position, a manager they sought \u2013 whose calm and charm has been admired \u2013 a &quot;brand&quot; going global, with clubs bought in New York and Melbourne, while attending to thankful fans and local roots: a modern, corporate sports organisation, growing accustomed to getting what it wants. That is why the talk during the run-in this time \u2013 raining on City&apos;s planned parade \u2013 about Uefa&apos;s &quot;investigatory chamber&quot; finding the club&apos;s \u00a3151m loss in 2011-12 and 2012-13 in breach of the financial fair play rules, has upset the ownership so markedly. Uefa set a deadline of Friday for City to accept a \u20ac60m (\u00a349m) settlement to be paid to the European governing body over three years, a 21-player limit to next season&apos;s Champions League squad and a wage cap to the current level. City&apos;s executives are understood to argue emphatically that they have not breached the rules, and are particularly affronted that their sponsorships with Abu Dhabi companies and the country&apos;s tourist authority have been called into question \u2013 and, on Friday, the deadline passed with no action by Uefa. It is now said that Uefa will decide on Monday what to do next; whether to stick with its finding and refer City to potentially tougher sanctions from its &quot;adjudicatory chamber&quot;, which the club&apos;s ownership will almost certainly fight. While, in crude terms, the Abu Dhabi relaunching of Manchester City is the most spectacular injection of cash by an owner to buy rapid success in football history \u2013 anathema to traditionalists and influential German clubs that are still owned by their supporters and have always sought to break even, financially \u2013 inside City, they pride themselves on\u00a0having done things professionally and properly. Uefa&apos;s break-even rules \u2013 the stated aim of which is to encourage financial responsibility and dampen down player wage inflation \u2013 limits clubs&apos; losses to \u20ac45m between 2011 and 2013. City are understood to be adamant, however, that their \u00a3151m loss is brought within that much smaller limit after they discount major expenditure on youth development, community work and infrastructure, which is allowed by Uefa to encourage long-term progression. The rules also say clubs will be considered &quot;favourably&quot; if their \u00a337m deficit is due to their loss in 2011-12, and was due to player wages on contracts signed before the rules came into force. City, who lost \u00a399m in 2011-12 and \u00a352m in 2012-13, are understood to believe this applies to their situation. Galling to City was the apparent Uefa determination that the sponsorships with Abu Dhabi companies \u2013 including the airline Etihad&apos;s \u00a335m a year naming rights for the stadium, shirt and new training campus \u2013 are not &quot;fair value&quot;; that they are more lucrative given their connections with Mansour. City insist their sponsorships were properly agreed, and that Etihad receives good value, as opposed to the Qatar tourist authority&apos;s \u20ac200m per year deal with Paris Saint-Germain, which looks flagrantly overpriced. Uefa&apos;s investigators are also thought not to have accepted the two deals that City&apos;s accounts stated had earned them \u00a347m in 2012-13: \u00a322m selling their branding, football and other expertise to their own women&apos;s and New York teams; \u00a325m selling players&apos; image rights to third-party agencies. Again, City executives argued these were genuine transactions for good corporate reasons. More generally, they argue that they have shaped their football project the right way, whatever people feel about the gulf states&apos; extraordinary super-funding to claim English and European trophies.

Across Manchester, the Glazer family bought United with \u00a3525m of borrowed money and have caused almost \u00a3700m to drain out of the club in interest, fees and other charges. Yet, because that has not pushed United into big losses in 2011-13, they face no sanction. Uefa do approve of City&apos;s community investment, but, simply put, the club breached the rules, which were agreed in 2010 by the 200 top clubs in the European Club Association, and the European Professional Football Leagues, which includes the Premier League.

The defender&apos;s departure was confirmed on the day United had a \u00a327m bid for Southampton&apos;s Luke Shaw rejected, signalling that a summer of rebuilding has begun in earnest. Ferdinand said recently that he hoped to stay at United and he is determined to continue his career. The former England captain and centre-half, at 35, is keen to play on in the Premier League if he receives an offer that suits. He will weigh his options carefully and is sure to field offers from abroad, including from Dubai, China and Major League Soccer. There is the strong possibility that Ferdinand will move into coaching at some point, so a player-coach role may be considered. Ferdinand, who is from Peckham in south London, had been away from his home town since being transferred from West Ham United to Leeds United in 2000. Harry Redknapp, who gave him his first-team debut at West Ham, is now in charge of Queens Park Rangers. The pair continue to enjoy good relations and Redknapp may try to tempt him to join the club as a player and as part of his backroom staff. Ferdinand&apos;s departure ends a highly successful spell at United where, having being signed from Leeds United in July 2002 for \u00a330m, a record for a defender, he won six Premier League titles, the Champions League and two League Cups. In a statement on his website Ferdinand implied that the decision to leave Old Trafford was his, although it is understood this was not the case. He has not been a regular first-choice this season and has been troubled by injury. &quot;I have thought long and hard over the last few months about my future and after 12 fantastic years playing for what I regard as the best club in the world I have decided the time is right for me to move on,&quot; he said. &quot;I joined Manchester United in the hope of winning trophies and never in my wildest dreams could I have imagined how successful we would be during my time here. &quot;There have been so many highlights, playing alongside some great players who have become good friends, winning my first Premier League title and also that fantastic night in Moscow are memories that I will cherish forever. He added: &quot;Circumstances didn&apos;t allow for me to say goodbye the way I would have liked but I&apos;d like to take this opportunity to thank my team-mates, staff, the club and the fans for an unbelievable 12 years that I&apos;ll never forget. &quot;Winning trophies I dreamed about as a kid came true at this great club. I am feeling fit and healthy, ready for a new challenge and looking forward to whatever the future holds for me.&quot; United tweeted: &quot;#mufc would like to thank Rio Ferdinand for his long and distinguished service, and wish him well for the future.&quot; As the club plan for their own future, they have been told by Southampton that Shaw is not for sale but United are still confident of securing the left-back&apos;s transfer, with Southampton&apos;s stance viewed as a bargaining position. United value Shaw in the region of \u00a330m, with the 18-year-old, who was named by Roy Hodgson in England&apos;s World Cup squad on Monday, keen on the move. His preference is that the deal should be completed before the tournament begins in Brazil next month. United believe they can conclude the transfer that would make Shaw the most expensive teenager in domestic football history and the best rewarded. As reported by the Guardian, United will make Shaw the highest-paid player ever under 20 by offering him a \u00a3100,000-a-week salary over five years and are set to beat off interest from Chelsea and Manchester City for his signature. These terms would quadruple his earnings and would see Shaw placed well above the bracket of Adnan Januzaj, who when agreeing a fresh five-year contract at Old Trafford last autumn accepted a salary of around \u00a360,000 a week. United finished seventh in the Premier League following a dismal title defence and are expected to appoint Louis van Gaal as their manager this week. Although the club do not plan to have a formal unveiling of the Holland coach until after the World Cup, Van Gaal will have been consulted over Shaw to ensure the Dutchman would want him. There are doubts over whether two of the coaching staff, Phil Neville and the goalkeeping specialist Chris Woods, will be kept on. Shaw would represent the first signing of what United hope will be a major overhaul of the squad in the summer transfer window. Yet despite the club being in a state of flux until a new manager arrives \u2013 Ryan Giggs&apos;s interim tenure ended on Sunday \u2013 Darren Fletcher has claimed this should not concern players too much. &quot;I think you can sometimes worry too much about that,&quot; the midfielder said. &quot;It&apos;s important to focus on yourself and make sure you come back for the new season in the right condition and whoever is the manager you have to try to impress him in pre-season and training. It&apos;s never been any different here and that&apos;s always been my mindset. It&apos;s a big squad with competition for places and you have to impress when you get an opportunity.&quot;", "title": "Rio Ferdinand leaves Manchester United after glittering 12-year career", "sentences": ["He will weigh his options carefully and is sure to field offers from abroad, including from Dubai, China and Major League Soccer."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-12T21:19:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/may/13/an-urbanists-guide-to-dubai", "tags": ["Cities", "Dubai", "United Arab Emirates"], "article": "Dubai is a city that is a work in progress. Moving around you will see a patchwork of developments that taken together do not yet add up to a coherent whole. This is why many people dismiss Dubai as artificial or as lacking a strong urban fabric. Much still remains to be done but perhaps the biggest strength of Dubai, even with its current state of unfinished development, is the diversity of urban experiences which it offers.  From the traditional alleyways and roads of Deira and Bur Dubai, to the cosmopolitan Baniyas square, and the new and glamorous spaces of Sheikh Zayed Road, the Downtown area around Burj Khalifa, Marina and beyond, one can encounter a vibrant urban setting which defies the conventional and cliched image of a city that is exclusive, catering only to the rich and privileged.     Dubai emerges from the desert. All photographs: Yasser Elsheshtawy    The desert surrounding the city makes this such a unique place. The sight of a city emerging from the desertscape as one approaches is truly breathtaking.  Best building     Dubai's World Trade Centre    Surprisingly, Dubai lacks distinctive buildings with a strong architectural quality \u2013 but there are exceptions.  For me the one building that stands out both for its form and also history is the World Trade Centre, or as it is known among local residents, Burj Rashid (the tower of Rashid, Dubai\u2019s former ruler). He presciently insisted in the 1970s on its current location even though at the time it was on the outskirts of the city overlooking a deserted highway. With time it has become part of the city\u2019s convention centre complex and through its distinctive architecture offers a counterpoint to the commercialised, nondescript towers surrounding it.  Designed by British architect John Harris it echoes and evokes traditional elements and through its deep facade moderates the intense heat. The building appears on the back of the 100 dirham note, and forms part of a tower trilogy marking various phases in the city\u2019s development: the other two are the twin Emirates Towers, and Burj Khalifa (the tallest building in the world).   Worst building      The Madinat Jumeirah complex - a mockery of history and tradition    Unlike the previous category there are quite a few candidates here. Since my background is in architecture my focus relates to aesthetic concerns, and the one building which, in my view, is representative of all that is wrong in the city\u2019s architecture is the Madinat Jumeirah complex. Built in the 1990s at the western edge of the city, it is a mixed-use complex, encompassing retail, residences and hotels. While functioning well as a social space (for the well-to-do mostly) its architecture is a copy of the traditional Bastakiya district with its distinctive wind-towers. But unlike the small scale that characterises Bastakiya, Madinat Jumeirah\u2019s wind-towers are exaggerated in scale and have no functional purpose. It is the ultimate representation of spectacle, a mockery of history and tradition, which serves and caters for tourists and expatriates. Thankfully recent developments have moved away from this model.  How clean is the city?     The Hor al Anz area at least appears lived in and used     Dubai is too clean in my view. There is a desire, bordering on obsession, to regulate and sanitise every corner in the city.  Yet sometimes a little decay here and there, some graffiti, flyers posted on walls and lampposts, can add liveliness to what would otherwise be a drab urban experience.  Such elements of \u2018disorder\u2019 can still be found in the traditional parts of the city; in its hidden neighbourhoods like Satwa, Hor al Anz and Rashid Colony, which appear to be lived in and used.  By global city standards even those are quite clean and orderly, but compared with the rest of the city they offer a stark contrast. A little messiness does not hurt anybody!  What\u2019s the best way to get around?     Dubai's metro is an excellent way to discover the city    That depends. Cars are the preferred mode of transportation but that is not available for everybody and traffic can be an issue particularly during rush hour.  The metro is very popular \u2013 and can be a very convenient way to reach the city\u2019s most popular destinations \u2013 but its reach is limited. Taxis and an extensive bus service can then take you further. Walking is only feasible within areas and neighbourhoods. Travelling by foot to other areas entails crossing multi-lane highways, a dangerous proposition. It is not a city planned for walking.  What does your city sound like?      An abra near the traditional district of Bastakiya    Given that the city is so widespread and scattered it is hard aside from traffic to detect a specific sound. But there is one part of the city, located along the creek and the traditional district of Bastakiya, where one can hear the sound of motorboats, called abras, transporting people from one side to the other, and the sound of pigeons, the lapping of waves, and the cacophony of various languages. They all add up to a unique sound landscape which is distinctly Dubai.  Best place for a conversation  This is highly personal but for me the best place is the Gerard Caf\u00e9, a coffee shop in an outdoor shopping complex in the district of Jumeirah. There&apos;s a bookstore is nearby which is usually not very busy. Even in the hot summer months, the shade means it is possible to sit. The place has been there since I first came here in 1996 and has not changed much since. It is a true Dubai institution \u2013 a rare occurrence in a fast-changing city. And for a conversation with a culinary element there is no place like Special Ustadi, one of the oldest Iranian restaurants in the city, in the traditional Fahidi neighbourhood. A true sense of history and the role played by migrants permeates the space. With the owner\u2019s collection of bank notes, as well as newspaper clippings and photographs, it is a unique gem which does not suffer from the pretentiousness of contemporary restaurants elsewhere in the city.  What one thing is indispensable for life in your city?     South Asian workers in Dubai\u2019s Al-Aweer vegetable market    An ability to tolerate people from different cultures. Given that the city is home to close to 200 nationalities, the extent to which one can communicate and interact with people from varying cultural backgrounds is an indispensable skill.  Are you optimistic about your city\u2019s future?      Much of the Shorta neighbourhood is  slated to be demolished to make way for new developments in preparation for Dubai Expo 2020    Dubai was written off as a viable urban centre after the financial crisis of 2008. The city has bounced back since then, showing that it is quite resilient and that its emergence on the world stage in the 1990s was not an accident or a one-off. Yet there is a danger that the mistakes of the past are being repeated: a reliance on real estate speculation, a return to spectacular architecture and a focus on exclusive developments.  There also seems to be a revival of a kind of trigger-happy development whereby old and traditional buildings and settlements are being replaced by high-end schemes catering to the wealthy. Pockets of such places can be found in the neighbourhoods of Shorta, Satwa and Hor al Anz.  It seems to me that a city is in the process of being created without facilitating a kind of bottom-up urbanism that allows for the emergence of spontaneous activities and encounters. These are the key ingredients for a true urbanity some of which still exists but seems to be on the way out. Perhaps a realisation that a city is more than simply a canvas for real estate investment may lead to an urban environment that is truly representative of a new kind of urbanism.  \u2022 Read more at Yasser Elsheshtawy&apos;s blog: Dubaization", "title": "An urbanist's guide to Dubai: \u2018A city too clean for its own good?\u2019", "sentences": ["Dubai is a city that is a work in progress.", "This is why many people dismiss Dubai as artificial or as lacking a strong urban fabric.", "Much still remains to be done but perhaps the biggest strength of Dubai, even with its current state of unfinished development, is the diversity of urban experiences which it offers.", "From the traditional alleyways and roads of Deira and Bur Dubai, to the cosmopolitan Baniyas square, and the new and glamorous spaces of Sheikh Zayed Road, the Downtown area around Burj Khalifa, Marina and beyond, one can encounter a vibrant urban setting which defies the conventional and cliched image of a city that is exclusive, catering only to the rich and privileged.", "Dubai emerges from the desert.", "Best building     Dubai's World Trade Centre    Surprisingly, Dubai lacks distinctive buildings with a strong architectural quality \u2013 but there are exceptions.", "For me the one building that stands out both for its form and also history is the World Trade Centre, or as it is known among local residents, Burj Rashid (the tower of Rashid, Dubai\u2019s former ruler).", "The Hor al Anz area at least appears lived in and used     Dubai is too clean in my view.", "Dubai's metro is an excellent way to discover the city    That depends.", "They all add up to a unique sound landscape which is distinctly Dubai.", "It is a true Dubai institution \u2013 a rare occurrence in a fast-changing city.", "South Asian workers in Dubai\u2019s Al-Aweer vegetable market    An ability to tolerate people from different cultures.", "Much of the Shorta neighbourhood is  slated to be demolished to make way for new developments in preparation for Dubai Expo 2020    Dubai was written off as a viable urban centre after the financial crisis of 2008.", "\u2022 Read more at Yasser Elsheshtawy&apos;s blog: Dubaization"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-13T09:23:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2014/may/13/showcase-exporting-the-jackloc-company-limited", "tags": ["Small Business Showcase"], "article": "Name: The Jackloc Company LimitedCity: LutterworthWebsite: www.jackloc.com  Despite being a small family business set up 11 years ago, our drive, enthusiasm and innovative approach has achieved phenomenal success in reaching a global market.

They tell me it is drying there and it will help. They are nice horses in the race and it will be tough. &quot;He is stepping up from a Listed to a Group Two, so we will see how good he is.&quot; The trainer said he named all the yard&apos;s horses early in their juvenile year and made a point of giving what he felt to be a &quot;nice name&quot; to True Story, who had always struck him as being an exciting prospect for the yard. The 6-1 second-favourite for next month&apos;s Derby, True Story is no bigger than 8-11 for Thursday&apos;s important trial, when he will be ridden for the first time by Kieren Fallon. Bin Suroor said that the booking should not be interpreted as indicating that Fallon had become his first-choice jockey over Silvestre De Sousa, who was aboard when True Story won the Feilden Stakes at the Craven meeting at Newmarket last month. &quot;Frankie Dettori was Godolphin&apos;s No1 but, since he left, we don&apos;t have a No1,&quot; the trainer said. &quot;Always, we have two jockeys and we decided, there is no No1. We will use who is best for the horse on the racetrack.&quot; Bin Suroor accepted that Fallon&apos;s excellent record at Epsom, where he has won the Derby three times and the Oaks four, was part of his thinking when he decided to give him the mount on True Story. But he added: &quot;Silvestre has done a really good job for us in Dubai and here and we&apos;ll keep going with him.&quot; Anthea Morshead, York&apos;s assistant clerk of the course, reported that she was walking the course under &quot;a heavy shower&quot; at 5pm but had earlier changed the official going to soft, good to soft in places.

It&apos;s soft in the straight but the Knavesmire drains well these days and it&apos;s certainly going to be drying conditions by the time racing starts.&quot; Should the ground remain testing on Thursday, the Dante is at risk of being reduced to four runners, because Peter Chapple-Hyam has also expressed concern about soft ground for his Arod, an impressive maiden winner at Windsor last month. &quot;It needs to dry up a bit,&quot; Chapple-Hyam said. &quot;He is in at Newmarket [on Saturday] but I would sooner go to York if I could.&quot; True Story also has the Newmarket race as an alternative if he is withdrawn from the Dante. Richard Hannon has no concerns about the going for Bunker, who is second-favourite for the Dante at 7-2. &quot;He&apos;ll be OK, it was nearly soft at Haydock the first time he ran,&quot; the trainer said. Hannon added that Bunker had been taken to Kempton for a racecourse gallop on Monday and had pleased Dettori, who will get the leg-up again on Thursday. Grant Cockburn was the object of much criticism from punters after falling off between hurdles when leading the field to the second-last at Sedgefield.

A document emerged yesterday, considering the question of whether pubs should be allowed to open late during the World Cup; seeking to measure the likelihood of England making it to the latter stages of the competition, the policy wonk in question turned to the leading exchange website. On the whole, I&apos;m comfortable with this development. The betting market gets smarter every year and Betfair has had a lot to do with that in the last decade. The odds on their site are a fair stab at the probability of each outcome, based on available knowledge. Still, I&apos;d like to think there are areas in which the government might have access to information that is not widely available, putting them in a better position to predict the future than the average punter. When we start to see Betfair odds being referenced by the Chancellor, say, it might be time to start organising that coup we&apos;ve talked about on here. I&apos;m hoping Betfair has got it wrong about Tiger Twenty Two (3.50) at York today because he&apos;s trading at bigger than 40-1 as I type. He comes from the Richard Fahey yard that does so well at this track and has won this race three times in five years. Admittedly, he is the least fancied of Fahey&apos;s three in the race but I feel it is a mistake to count him out on that score alone. He has form on soft ground, as he should do, being a son of Authorized, and won a nursery at this track last summer. He progressed well through last season and struck up a good relationship with Fahey&apos;s useful claimer, George Chaloner, who rides again today. I couldn&apos;t find a betting angle in the Musidora, in which Cambridge looks the pick of a not very exciting bunch. But Body And Soul (3.15) looks a fair play at 14-1 in the Duke of York. She was a zippy two-year-old in 2012, winning Newbury&apos;s Super Sprint and Redcar&apos;s Two-Year-Old Trophy, both times when there was plenty of give. She won a handicap here off 95 last summer, beating a subsequent Group Two winner (who ran off 93). She&apos;s made a slow start to this year but had no luck in running at Nottingham on Saturday, looking as though she had come on plenty for her reappearance run. Better can be expected this time.

That win alone would have made this a good week for Fallon, with Madame Chiang likely to contest either the Oaks or its French equivalent next time, but it could be better still by the middle of Thursday afternoon if True Story, the second favourite for the Derby, takes his chance in the Dante Stakes. Madame Chiang, who started at 8-1, was one of five runners in the 10-strong field on Wednesday with an entry in the Investec Oaks, but only a 25-1 outsider set off at a bigger price than David Simcock&apos;s filly, who had won her sole start at two at 33-1. She was slow to leave the stalls and then driven along half a mile out, but once she hit her stride Madame Chiang stayed on strongly to beat Lily Rules by one-and-a-quarter lengths. The good-to-soft ground was in the winner&apos;s favour, and Simcock said afterwards that she will not run in the Oaks at Epsom on 6 June unless the conditions are similar. The Prix de Diane (French Oaks) would be an obvious alternative given the likely going at Chantilly, but Fallon, who has already won the 2,000 Guineas this season, will have a realistic chance to add another Classic to his record wherever she ends up. &quot;She&apos;s a lovely, big filly and this is a great trial,&quot; Fallon said. &quot;When she hit the front, she idled which is why she didn&apos;t go away, but this was only her second start and she&apos;ll improve. She pricked her ears when she hit the front. When they do that you know they&apos;ve got more left. &quot;She&apos;s a beautiful mover and she could go on any ground so long as it&apos;s not too firm. She&apos;s honest and she tries, and she&apos;s laid back which is a big help as well.&quot; Madame Chiang can be backed at 16-1 for the Oaks, while Taghrooda, the ante-post favourite, shorted up with several bookies after the Musidora and is now top-priced at 2-1. Fallon has played an increasingly prominent role in Saeed bin Suroor&apos;s wing of the Godolphin operation this season and is due to replace Silvestre de Sousa on True Story in Thursday&apos;s Dante, before an expected run in the Derby on 7 June. The colt, a son of Manduro, is likely to start at odds-on if he takes his chance in the Dante, and is currently the 6-1 second favourite for the Derby behind Aidan O&apos;Brien&apos;s Australia. Maarek, last season&apos;s Prix de l&apos;Abbaye winner, was a 12-1 chance for the Group Two Duke Of York Stakes, but carried his Group One penalty to victory. &quot;He&apos;ll go to Royal Ascot if there&apos;s an ease in the ground. He&apos;s in both races [King&apos;s Stand and Diamond Jubilee] and he&apos;s very effective over both distances,&quot; said the winning trainer, Evanna McCutcheon. The Royal meeting could also be a target for That Is The Spirit, who carried top weight to a smooth success in a competitive handicap on only his second visit to the track. &quot;The Jersey Stakes would be the obvious race if he&apos;s good enough,&quot; David O&apos;Meara, That Is The Spirit&apos;s trainer, said. &quot;He&apos;s got a lot of ability and is potentially the classiest horse we&apos;ve had.&quot; The Dubai World Cup, the world&apos;s richest race, will be run on dirt for the first time since moving to Meydan after a decision to replace its synthetic Tapeta surface. A move to replace Tapeta with dirt in order to encourage more American-trained runners at Meydan was the subject of strong rumours during this year&apos;s World Cup meeting in March. American-trained horses, including the top-class performers Cigar and Curlin, won eight of the 14 World Cups staged on dirt at Nad Al Sheba between 1996 and 2009, but only one of the five staged on Tapeta. This year&apos;s World Cup did not have a single US-trained runner, while only three appeared on the World Cup card. The news will come as a disappointment for many European trainers, and also for Tapeta&apos;s inventor Michael Dickinson, the former champion National Hunt trainer who is best remembered in Britain for saddling the first five horses to finish in the 1983 Cheltenham Gold Cup.", "title": "Kieren Fallon wins the Musidora Stakes at York with Madame Chiang", "sentences": ["&quot;He&apos;s got a lot of ability and is potentially the classiest horse we&apos;ve had.&quot; The Dubai World Cup, the world&apos;s richest race, will be run on dirt for the first time since moving to Meydan after a decision to replace its synthetic Tapeta surface."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-14T16:41:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/may/14/qatar-migrant-workers-live-qa-post-your-questions", "tags": ["Global development", "Migration and development", "Employment", "World news", "Middle East and North Africa", "Qatar"], "article": "The Guardian&apos;s revelations about the abuse of migrant workers labouring on building sites for the 2022 World Cup in Qatar triggered global debate on the employment conditions of foreign staff in the country.

Pete Pattisson, who exposed the story of forced labour in September, and James Lynch, a researcher on migrant workers in the Gulf for Amnesty International, answered your questions on the latest announcement and the broader situation facing migrant workers. We posted the questions and answers here to make the conversation easier to follow:         Guardian contributor     PetePattisson    15 May 2014 1:02pm  Hi. I'm Pete Pattisson and I'm based in Kathmandu, Nepal. I'm looking forward to answering your questions.               Guardian contributor     JamesLynch    15 May 2014 1:03pm  Hello - I'm James from Amnesty. I've been researching migrant rights in Qatar for the last 18 months, during which time we have published reports on abuse in the construction sector and of domestic workers. I'm pleased to be here and looking forward to answering your questions.      @soemoyo asks embassies are unable to engage with Qatar:          Guardian staff     ClaudineSpera    15 May 2014 10:02am  Over on Twitter @soemoyo asks Pete Pattisson and James Lynch:    Why are embassies unable to engage with Qatar &amp; stop #migrant worker deaths?              Guardian contributor     PetePattisson    15 May 2014 1:04pm  I think the embassies do try to engage with the authorities in Qatar, but speaking for the Nepali embassy I know they are very under-resourced. They have only a small team of staff who have to deal with hundreds of problems every day. One of the most useful things the Nepal government could do is increase the number of staff in their embassies (and in a country like Lebanon, which doesn\u2019t have an embassy, establish one). From talking to a government official this week, I believe they are planning to do just that.             Guardian contributor     JamesLynch    15 May 2014 1:06pm  Hi @soemoyo - really good question. We have spoken to a number of embassies that represent migrant workers. They can sometimes be very frank about the nature of the problems facing their nationals, but very rarely say so in public. The remittances that migrants send back to their home countries are an important source of income for the governments, so the embassies feel in a delicate position - they don't want to jeopardise the recruitment opportunities for their nationals by derailing their relationsd with Qatar. The critical problem this causes is that this means that migrant workers don't get the vital political support, advocating for their rights, which they deserve. We've called on several countries of origin, including Nepal, India and Indonesia, to do much more diplomatically to support their nationals' rights overseas (not just in Qatar but in other destination countries).      And an anonymous question for Pete about the investigation:          Guardian staff     ClaudineSpera    15 May 2014 10:22am  And here's a question sent in by an anonymous user:    For Pete Pattisson: Did any of the migrant workers featured in your stories face repercussions for speaking to you?              Guardian contributor     PetePattisson    15 May 2014 1:08pm  Good question. It\u2019s something I try to be very careful about. Where there is any chance they may face repercussions, I don\u2019t name them or I give them an alternative name (or obscure their face in the case of video). Most of the workers I have named were in such a dire situation that they were quite happy to be named - I think they wanted to draw attention to their plight. Either way, I will always ask them whether they want to be named or not, and absolutely respect that.      IndependentBrain asks about the role of the UN:             IndependentBrain    15 May 2014 11:06am  What is the United Nations role on this?Is the same or similar happening to British and American migrants or do they have better escape routes from a situation like this?How can migrants who are seeking to wrk in Qatar protect themselves from employer abuse if the kafala law is not abolished?             Guardian contributor     JamesLynch    15 May 2014 1:15pm  Hi IndependentBrain. The UN has played a helpful role up until now - the Special Rapporteur on migrant rights has produced a really comprehensive report recommending fundamental reform of the restrictive sponsorship system (see here: http://www.ohchr.org/Documents/Issues/SRMigrants/A-HRC-26-35-Add1_en.pdf) - saying the government should go far further than yesterday's announcement. Several UN committees have also highlighted the discriminatory laws against domestic workers in Qatar and the need for workers to be able to form and join trade unions. In terms of other countries, labour exploitation is a global problem; there are abuses of migrant around the world. You ask about the UK specifically - I suggest having a look here at this excellent BBC investigation into labour exploitation in the construction industry, including trafficking of migrants (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b042ztrk). Many countries also have problematic sponsorship systems. Having said that, there are certain unusual features of Qatar's sponsorship system which are particularly ripe for abuse - the exit permit, for example, which means you can't leave the country without your employer's permission.             Guardian contributor     PetePattisson    15 May 2014 1:13pm  Three questions in one! If you don't mind IndependentBrain, I'll focus on questions 2 and 3. 2. All migrant workers, whether they be British or Indian, are subject to the same labour laws in Qatar, but those laws affect them in very different ways. Migrant workers from south Asia have to pay large recruitment fees to get a job in the Gulf (and often take out large loans at high interest rates to afford them), they are far more likely to be cheated on their journey to the Gulf (be it through fake contracts or false promises about wages), the work they do is likely to be much more dangerous, their living conditions may be appalling and when things go wrong it is much more difficult for them to seek redress. 3. The short answer is they can\u2019t. Even if the recruitment process in their home country was perfect, they could still be exploited by unscrupulous companies in the Gulf because of the kafala system. The right to leave your job and leave the country are very basic labour rights, and until the kafala system is abolished those rights cannot be respected. Sometimes I think it helps to look at it from the perspective of the employer \u2013 imagine you are an employer and you know that your workers cannot leave you, regardless of how you treat them. What incentive is there to treat them well?      How can real change happen? asks @jayde_bradley:          Guardian staff     ClaudineSpera    15 May 2014 11:07am  Another question from Twitter, @jayde_bradley asks:    What can the international community do to help achieve real change in Qatar?              Guardian contributor     JamesLynch    15 May 2014 1:18pm  Hi Jayde - I think one thing that the international community can do is put pressure on Qatar to address these abuses. A start was made on that at the UN review of Qatar's human rights situation earlier this month (http://dohanews.co/un-member-states-pile-pressure-qatar-reform/) but Qatar's major political allies can do much more to highlight what is happening and to provide assistance to the Qatari government to address this. Also, governments whose construction firms are angling for major contracts have a responsibility to ensure that those companies fully understand the risks to workers they employ - and who work on their projects for subcontractors. This is an important responsibility for foreign governments which I'm not convinced many are taking on right now.             Guardian contributor     PetePattisson    15 May 2014 1:19pm  Hi Jayde. I think public pressure is important here. Everyone loves the World Cup \u2013 it\u2019s the World Cup - so we all feel it belongs to us in some way, and no one wants to be associated with something that is tainted. So its important the public demands better working conditions (for all workers, not just those building the stadiums), via petitions, FIFA, elected representatives etc.  However, I don\u2019t support calls for a boycott of the Qatar World Cup. I think the real achievement would be for Qatar to host a fantastic World Cup, and in doing so transform the way it treats migrant workers. That would be a really impressive World Cup legacy.      Denny Michan asks is Fifa might respond:          Guardian staff     ClaudineSpera    15 May 2014 12:12pm  A question from Denny Michan via email:    How likely is it that FiFA could strip Qatar of hosting the World Cup?              Guardian contributor     JamesLynch    15 May 2014 1:21pm  Hi Denny. Ultimately you'd have to ask FIFA! Clearly a lot of attention has been placed on Qatar's hosting, for reasons connected to migrant rights but also other issues people are concerned about. Some people have called for the World Cup to be taken away because of abuses against workers. But there is also a compelling argument to say that the reason Qatar is under so much pressure to improve workers' conditions is because of the spotlight the country is under. Without the World Cup, would we be having this discussion?             Guardian contributor     PetePattisson    15 May 2014 1:24pm  Hi Denny. I think it\u2019s highly unlikely for a number of reasons, one of them being that FIFA has not shown a great deal of willingness to put pressure on Qatar to improve working conditions there. This is a shame because they could be a real force for good.  However, I hope they don\u2019t strip Qatar of the World Cup because I think it creates an opportunity to shine a spotlight on the treatment of migrant workers across the region, which may lead to real and lasting improvements.      What about broken promises of work? asks@bee9100:          Guardian staff     ClaudineSpera    15 May 2014 12:27pm  And on Twitter \u200f@bee9100 asks:    Is there much fraud with people being promised work and accommodation in Qatar? What is the govt doing about it?              Guardian contributor     JamesLynch    15 May 2014 1:24pm  Hi @bee9100 - it is unfortunately far too common for migrant workers to be promised decent working conditions and salaries, but arrive to find the reality is different. Some of the responsibility for this lies in the sending countries, who need to do far more to police unscrupulous recruitment agents who trick migrants into signing contracts that turn out to be worthless (see our report here on how Nepal's government is failing on this http://www.amnesty.org/en/news/nepal-protect-nepalese-migrants-false-promises-work-abroad-2011-12-12). But the Qatari government itself has to do more as well. It has announced various schemes including electronic web databases for recruitment to address this - but we haven't really seen any details of what these will entail in practice and whether they will address the problem.             Guardian contributor     PetePattisson    15 May 2014 1:29pm  There\u2019s a great deal of fraud, both in the countries of origin and the destination countries. It starts in rural Nepal (or India or Bangladesh, or increasingly some African countries) when brokers charge extortionate fees to arrange jobs for would-be migrants. Then they may be promised salaries that a far higher than are really on offer, or jobs which turn out to be different on arrival in Qatar (or any other Gulf country).  Part of the problem is that many migrants are completely unaware of the risks they are taking. One migrant rights activist told me that he often meets departing workers at Kathmandu airport, who literally do not know what country they are about to fly to.  The fraud can continue on arrival in Qatar. Workers might be promised a job as a carpenter, only to find they are working as a plumber, or discover that their salary is much lower than promised. There are many cases of migrants not being paid on time (or at all) which is a serious problem in itself, but it becomes much more serious when your family back home is relying on you to send them money.      Matt asks what the UK can do to support change:             mfranklin    15 May 2014 1:02pm  What are the key labour rights organisations in Qatar organising around this - if any?  Despite the strict restrictions of workers rights in Qatar are any ongoing attempts at organising amongst migrant workers, if so has there been any success?  To what extent do you think that the change in the labour law and the abolition of the kafala system will solve the abuses of workers rights in the World Cup construction? and what can we do in the UK to support the workers further?  Thanks,  Matt             Guardian contributor     JamesLynch    15 May 2014 1:30pm  Hi Matt -  It's illegal for migrant workers for organize unions in Qatar. And forming NGOs is highly restricted. There are some organizations funded by the government which have a mandate to work on human rights and trafficking, including the National Human Rights Committee. However, in terms of what you're talking about - grassroots activism or trade union organizing - it's probably fair to say this is something that is really a new concept for Qatar. I'm not sure that we are really seeing an &quot;abolition of the kafala system&quot; yet. The announcement yesterday referred to some changes to way in which kafala works, and a renaming of the system. some of these could potentially help workers, but the key facts remain the same - any worker who wants to move job will, for the duration of their contract, need permission from their employer. And their employers will still - it seems - be able to block their exit from the country.             Guardian contributor     PetePattisson    15 May 2014 1:38pm  Hi mfranklin. Good questions. Let me try to answer the last one. The announcements made in Qatar yesterday about reform of the labour law were a little confusing, however to the best of my knowledge, I wouldn't say that the kafala system is being abolished. In particular, as I understand it, workers on short-term contracts (2 - 3 years) will still not have the right to change jobs within that period. This applies to many south Asian workers, who are typically on a 2 year contract.  Now the reforms may give them the right to leave the country, but that's a last resort for them. They need to stay in the country to earn enough money to pay off their debts and look after their families, but they deserve to be treated fairly, and have the right to change jobs, while they are there.      @adrian_a_bucher asks about action by other Gulf states:          Guardian staff     ClaudineSpera    15 May 2014 1:07pm  And on Twitter @adrian_a_bucher asks:    How likely will other Gulf states improve worker's rights following events in Qatar &amp; how can the int. community pressure them?              Guardian contributor     PetePattisson    15 May 2014 1:43pm  Very likely. I spoke to one person in the know who said Dubai are really taking notice now that they have been awarded the World Expo in 2020.             Guardian contributor     JamesLynch    15 May 2014 1:35pm  Hi @adrian_a_bucher  The other Gulf states are likely to be following the pressure on Qatar very closely. With variations between the way they organize things, all the 6 GCC states have sponsorship systems not too different from Qatar's. And there are comparable abuses in those countries too. We hope that should Qatar take serious steps towards really deep reform of kafala, the other GCC states might take note and consider following suit. Qatar should show the rest of the region that ambitious development and workers rights are not mutually incompatible. How should the international community pressure the rest of the GCC? By raising this issue, in private but also publicly. It is extremely rare to hear foreign governments discussing migrants' rights in the gulf publicly. That is to some extent down to the economic opportunities that many governments are seeking in the GCC region. So public pressure will be needed on those governments too.      B Yogi has a question about Amnesty&apos;s involvement in the issue:          Guardian staff     ClaudineSpera    15 May 2014 1:08pm  And B Yogi has emailed in to ask James Lynch:    The Amnesty has highlighted the plight of Nepali migrant workers in Qatar for the last few years. Have you noticed any changes both in Nepal and Qatar after your reports were published?              Guardian contributor     PetePattisson    15 May 2014 1:41pm  Hi B Yogi. I know you aimed this question at James, but being based in Nepal, I sense there is some movement on this from the government. This article may be of interest:  http://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/may/01/nepal-clampdown-migrant-worker-exploitation-operation-de-pogo             Guardian contributor     JamesLynch    15 May 2014 1:41pm  I hope that part of the impact of our research in Nepal and Qatar - combined with strong media reporting, including of course by Pete and his colleagues! - has been to increase public awareness of the issues that migrant workers face, and to spark debates about the failings of both governments to protect workers from abuse. In Nepal this has become an increasingly political issue and is now part of almost every political party's programme for elections. In Qatar the government asked the law firm DLA Piper (who were commissioned to look into migrants' rights after the Guardian investigation) to examine our report into the construction sector as part of its research. Their report which has been handed to the government is consistent with a lot of our findings, and several of their recommendations are identical to ours. The key question is .... will the government implement?      tidemarc asks, is there hope for workers living in KSA?             tidemarc    15 May 2014 1:12pm  I live in KSA and conditions here are far worse than in Qatar. (yes I have seen both and the UAE). Qatar is high profile because of the World Cup, but it would be nice, no great, to know that all ME countries will be scrutinised for their treatment of migrant workers. Can you give me any hope?             Guardian contributor     PetePattisson    15 May 2014 1:48pm  Thanks tidemarc. I think I agree with you on that. I have heard some terrible stories from migrants about their experiences in Saudi Arabia, and the deaths rates of migrants there are very high.  From the perspective of a journalist, it is of course much harder to work in Saudi Arabia, which means exposing this kind of abuse is more difficult. In that sense, credit should go to Qatar for at least being willing to be open to some scrutiny.             Guardian contributor     JamesLynch    15 May 2014 1:51pm  Hi tidemarc - you raise a very important point.  I hope that the attention on Qatar will lead to greater scrutiny of other Gulf countries - absolutely including Saudi Arabia - now that awareness has been increased of the plight of migrant workers in the region. I know that Amnesty has plans to continue research on this issue in other Gulf countries but it's worth noting also that organizations like Human Rights Watch have in recent years produced several excellent reports on abuses faced by construction and domestic workers in other GCC countries. So there is no lack of desire on the part of human rights organizations to go beyond Qatar.      A question from Bile Khalif on EU migrant worker rights:          Guardian staff     ClaudineSpera    15 May 2014 1:11pm  Also via email, Bile Khalif asks:    There is serious blinding of eyes when it comes to the treatment of migrant workers by the EU and the rest of the developed world? what concrete action are these international bodies and the UN doing about it, has there even even been an attempt to curb this?              Guardian contributor     JamesLynch    15 May 2014 1:46pm  Hi Bile KhalafYou're right that until recently there was very little focus on this issue by European and other countries. This has begun to change. In February I took part in a session at the European Parliament highlighting abuses against migrant workers in Qatar (http://dohanews.co/european-parliament-puts-qatars-kafala-system-in-crosshairs/) and a delegation from the Parliament went out on an official visit, calling for fundamental change, shortly after. At the global level, there has been more pressure recently (http://dohanews.co/un-member-states-pile-pressure-qatar-reform/). The key thing is that this is sustained, and that Qatar's international partners hear a consistent message, namely that partial reform won't be enough to address what are widespread and serious abuses.      marklinden asks if we&apos;re focusing too much on the Middle East:             marklinden    15 May 2014 1:45pm  Question for both: Do you feel that there has been increased focus on the worker issues in Qatar due to longstanding prejudices held against the Middle East?  With tragic employment practices taking place across the globe, why do you think Qatar has continued to be front page news? Surely there is more driving this debate than just the World Cup - otherwise we'd be discussing issues in Russia around 2018 in a similar amount of detail. Shouldn't we be featuring other cases of employment and political malpractice from elsewhere as much as we are investigating into Qatar? Thoughts?             Guardian contributor     PetePattisson    15 May 2014 1:59pm  Hi Mark. Good questions, and I'm also wondering when Russia will come under the spotlight. There have been complaints that there is some kind of conspiracy against Qatar, but I've been reporting on the treatment of migrant workers in the Gulf for a little time now, and certainly before Qatar was even awarded the World Cup, for example here: http://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2011/apr/12/nepali-slaves-united-arab-emirates-video             Guardian contributor     JamesLynch    15 May 2014 2:00pm  Hi marklinden I can't speak for everyone who's talking about Qatar, but Amnesty's work on Qatar is driven by the serious human rights issues affecting individuals - and our belief that there is real potential for change in Qatar. It's part of our global work on labour exploitation (see here on Indonesian domestic workers in Hong Kong: http://www.amnesty.org/es/node/44285 - and here on migrant agricultural workers in Italy https://www.amnesty.org/en/news/italy-time-address-exploitation-migrant-workers-2012-12-17). Sport is definitely a big part of it. We have a campaign highlighting human rights abuses around the Brazil World Cup right now, and we ran a campaign around the Socchi Olympics. So if Qatar is in the spotlight, it's because they won the right to host one of the biggest international tournaments there is.      Unashamed2bMdlClass questions awareness of worker&apos;s rights in the Gulf:             Unashamed2bMdlClass    15 May 2014 1:45pm  What sort of awareness is there among Qataris and other Gulf-state citizens about the plight of their migrant workers? I mean both ordinary people as well as factory owners and job providers, In either of your experience of interacting with these people, what has been their reaction to this situation in their country?             Guardian contributor     JamesLynch    15 May 2014 2:04pm  Hi Unashamed2bMdlClass It's difficult to speak on behalf of other people, but many Qataris I've spoken to about this are aware of the issues, unhappy that such abuses take place in their country, and want to see the Government to address the problem. There is, I understand, an increasingly open debate about this topic among Qataris. But we shouldn't underestimate the level of division, too. As well as meeting people who definitely recognise the seriousness of the issues, there are others who believe that the international media and NGOs have exaggerated the scale of the problem and that the violations reported are just restricted to a few rogue companies.      A question from ID7588575 around foreign investment and sub-contracting:             ID7588575    15 May 2014 1:57pm  Hi. A couple of questions, answer whichever you like! I had thought/asumed that many of the construction companies behind these stadia etc were Western, and therefore would respect workers' rights to a higher degree irrespective of the kafala system. Is it not them who are employing the migrant workers? Although I know that state-owned companies tend to be in petro-extraction/production rather than construction, are there many state-run construction companies? If so, is there a difference in the treatment of migrant workers between these and private companies? Or is this distinction in ownership academic? Can pressure not be put on state-owned companies initially, and this be used to influence others?  Sorry for a very convoluted question...             Guardian contributor     JamesLynch    15 May 2014 2:09pm  Hi ID7588575 - maybe a convoluted answer to follow....! Most of the serious abuses we have documented have been experienced by workers employed by small or medium-sized subcontractors. some of those were working for international (including western) main contractors, on projects commissioned by developers with strong links to the state.  The key responsibility for any major contractor (be it Western or from wherever) or a client commissioning a project is to ensure they have policies and procedures in place to ensure that their workers, and their subcontractors' workers are not abused - and if they are, that they then address and mitigate this abuse. The problems caused by the kafala system can't be any excuse for a company to avoid these responsibilities.             Guardian contributor     PetePattisson    15 May 2014 2:09pm  Hi. You are right, Western companies are behind many of the many infrastructure projects in Qatar at the moment, but unfortunately your assumption that they would demand higher standards does not necessarily follow. The problem is partly that there are so many layers of subcontractors, it is easy to pass the blame.  That's why I was encouraged to see in the report on the treatment of migrant workers in Qatar by the law firm DLA Piper, that one of their recommendations is that lead contractors (often Western companies) should be responsible for workers' welfare through all the layers of subcontracting.

Over the years, it grew to become a midsized industrial powerhouse, known as \u201cGlass City\u201d for its glass-making companies, and also as the \u201cAuto Parts Capital of the World\u201d (Detroit is only 60 miles away). Like much of the Rust Belt, deindustrialisation hit Toledo hard; the local newspaper, the Toledo Blade, counts 140 factories that have closed since 2000 alone. With a population of about 300,000, Toledo is just one of many cities in the US and across the globe that flies largely under the radar. It lacks the large urbanist booster class that exists in many bigger cities. Rust Belt self-loathing remains in fashion here: a local videographer has achieved a degree of fame by posting videos to YouTube of him driving around what seems to be a mostly vacant city, with names like Only in a Dump like Toledo, or Welcome to Downtown Toledo Ohio&apos;s Fabulous Nightlife (&quot;Believe it or not, 300,000 people live here&quot;). But beyond the plant closings and the civic struggles, today Toledo is making positive global headlines for something other than shuttered malls and urban decay: for the millions of dollars in Chinese investment it is attracting.  Chinese investor groups have bought the Park Inn Hotel and Seagate Hotel downtown. Another Chinese group purchased a large tract of land on the waterfront for a &quot;new urbanist&quot;-style marina, which will include a mix of residential, retail and commercial uses. Ten separate Chinese companies have established sales offices in the region. The previous mayor, Michael Bell, kicked all this off. Knowing he was unlikely to get much help from Washington in attracting investment, he decided he&apos;d go drum it up himself. He made China his city&apos;s top foreign target for investment and led several trade trips to China personally. Until recently, the Toledo/Northwest Ohio region had a full-time representative in China.     Smoke stacks at the Chrysler assembly plant in Toledo. More than 100 other factories in the area have closed down since 2000. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty    Unlikely Toledo is an example of an increasing trend around the world: small cities going it alone in search of success in a globalised, urbanised age. They are increasingly finding it necessary to act more like city-states such as Singapore, Hong Kong or Dubai, directly selling themselves to global investors and potential residents. Cities, big and small, now trade not just provincially or nationally, but globally. They&apos;re also economically specialised at both the macro level (think of fashion and luxury in Paris) and the micro (the design of super-tall skyscrapers in Chicago). Migration patterns often follow city-to-city networks. Even crime is now global.  What all this means is that each city\u2019s needs are both global and particularised \u2013 and each needs to come up with its own strategy. Large cities have led the way here: S\u00e3o Paulo is focusing on diplomacy, with an &quot;office of foreign affairs&quot; and direct relationships with the US, Britain and France, aiming to tap into global networks of money, people and expertise. In New York, the police department has created its own international anti-terrorism unit with officers stationed everywhere from London to Tel Aviv and embedded at agencies such as the FBI, New Scotland Yard and Interpol. Mayors from around the world, realising they have more in common with each other than with their countries, have formed the C40 group to tackle climate issues, as national governments continue to squabble and fail to act. But the city-state model comes with risks, especially for small cities. Too narrow a focus on global economic success can open fissures at home. In Britain, a chasm is opening between London and everywhere else. Even in the capital itself there has been a massive widening of the income gap and skyrocketing housing prices, not to mention riots.  In Rio de Janeiro and other Brazilian cities, an ill-timed raise of transit fares just as the country was pouring billions into the Olympics triggered protests. One of those cities was S\u00e3o Paulo, the &quot;leader in foreign diplomacy&quot;, forced to come to terms with the fact that its citizens were throwing Molotov cocktails because of very local issues. Global investment might be flowing into Istanbul, but try to pave Gezi Park and watch what happens. A city too focused on its role in the global economy is like a national government obsessed with military spending.     Toledo's Maumee River. Another Chinese group has purchased a large tract of land on the waterfront for redevelopment as a marina. Photograph: Alamy    It can also be taken too far, to a comical extent. Rather like Toledo, three cities in Indiana \u2013 Indianapolis, Anderson and Muncie \u2013 each took independent foreign trade trips in 2013. Yet all three are part of a single economic region, and only Indianapolis probably has the scale to operate globally.  Cooperation, here, is surely more important \u2013 as was recognised by Louisville and Lexington, two smaller cities (albeit the two largest in Kentucky) that joined forces to boost manufacturing. \u201cCities need to be excellent at partnering with each other internal to the state\u201d to compete globally, says the mayor of Louisville, Greg Fischer. Rather than city-states proper, perhaps a better way to think about these new urban areas is \u201cmetro city-states\u201d. Toledo has smartly taken this regional approach. \u201cWe always make sure to say Northwest Ohio,\u201d says Paul Zito of the area\u2019s regional growth agency.  Nevertheless, Toledo remains a deeply troubled city. The poverty rate is high and job creation anemic. So far, the hype about the China strategy probably outstrips the reality. Chinese investment has certainly put some money in the city\u2019s coffers, but it has not yet created many jobs, and the marina remains on the drawing board. Zito says that Chinese investment in Toledo is following the pattern of Japan, with commercial real estate as only \u201cthe first wave\u201d \u2013 but the new mayor, Mike Collins, says he won\u2019t make as many personal trips as his predecessor. But while full recovery for Toledo, and a potential harvest of significant jobs from its Chinese efforts, might be a way off, the fact that foreign investors are putting money into property in the urban heart of the Rust Belt shows how small cities can carve out a place for themselves on a global scale. Nick Kubiak, a Toledo expat who was living in Detroit, decided to apply the same DIY ethic happening in Motown to his own hometown. He returned last year to open a wine bar downtown, and says declining Toledo rents actually opened the door for him and others to get in where they previously couldn&apos;t before. Though he welcomes Chinese investors, Kubiak points out that many in this blue-collar union stronghold are suspicious of foreign investment. Still, as he says: &quot;You&apos;re not going to see change in Toledo without investing a lot of money \u2013 and that has to come from somewhere.&quot; And realistically, what alternative does this small city have? In a global age, cities simply have no choice but to be in the game.

The Grey Gatsby is not entered for the Derby and will not be added at the supplementary stage, as Kevin Ryan, his trainer, does not feel that either the trip or the track will suit him. Four of his five rivals on Thursday do hold an entry, however, including True Story, the Feilden Stakes winner, who started the day as the Derby second-favourite and set off at odds-on for the Dante but left his supporters with little hope to cling to as he could finish only third. True Story will still run at Epsom according to Saeed bin Suroor, his trainer, and will be joined in the field by Arod, who was three-quarters of a length behind The Grey Gatsby in second place. Both colts, though, are now out to around 16-1 for the Classic and deservedly so. Ryan Moore, who rode The Grey Gatsby, picked up a two-day ban for careless riding as his mount drifted right in the closing stages and hampered True Story but it did not affect the result and the Godolphin runner simply did not look like the same horse who raced seven lengths clear in the Feilden last month. &quot;Kieren [Fallon] said good, fast ground will be better for him,&quot; Suroor said. &quot;He said a mile and a half will also be better. We think he will be fine [to run at] Epsom.&quot; Peter Chapple-Hyam, the trainer of Arod, has two Derby victories to his name already and remains hopeful of adding a third next month. &quot;Jamie [Spencer] said he just got a bit too far back really,&quot; Chapple-Hyam said. &quot;I wanted him to relax today and he did and he wants better ground than this. It will be up to Sheikh Fahad [his owner] but I suppose we will go to Epsom. &quot;I think in another half a furlong we might have won it but the winner is a tough horse. This to me is always the best Derby trial there is.&quot; The Grey Gatsby, meanwhile, is likely to run in the Prix du Jockey-Club [French Derby] over 10 furlongs. &quot;This wasn&apos;t a surprise to me,&quot; Ryan said. &quot;He was still in his comfort zone turning in and, if he got the trip, he was going to take a lot of beating. I would think the French Derby is the obvious race for him. I definitely don&apos;t think he would go to Epsom.&quot; Bunker, who also went into Thursday&apos;s race prominent in the ante-post betting for the Derby, finished fifth of the six runners and may be aimed instead towards the St Leger. &quot;Frankie [Dettori] said he was a bit rusty,&quot; Richard Hannon, Bunker&apos;s trainer, said. &quot;He&apos;s still only a baby and he will improve but he might just lack a gear for the Derby. We&apos;ll sleep on it.&quot; Ambivalent, a Group One winner last year and third home in the Dubai Sheema Classic in March, took the Group Two Middleton Stakes under a well-judged front-running ride by Andrea Atzeni. Roger Varian&apos;s mare is highly strung and travels to the races with a pony to keep her calm but had enough talent to defy a Group One penalty and beat Secret Gesture, the runner-up in last year&apos;s Oaks, into second place. Alan Jarvis, whose training career will conclude later this month after the British Horseracing Authority decided that it will no longer licence him due to a &quot;serious lack of commercial integrity&quot; in his bloodstock dealings, saddled what may prove to be his last winner on the Knavesmire as Navajo Chief took the Hambleton Stakes. Jarvis has twice been declared bankrupt, and an appeal against the licensing committee&apos;s decision to refuse him a licence was thrown out earlier this week. In its written reasons, the appeal panel said that the trainer had &quot;shown no understanding that anything he did was improper&quot; in regard to debts to Doncaster Bloodstock Sales of nearly \u00a3900,000, adding that &quot;his primary stance has been to blame DBS for allowing him the credit, and then pursuing him for it.&quot; Jarvis is currently training on a temporary licence which will expire later this month. He insisted after Thursday&apos;s race that the BHA&apos;s decision had been wrong, but said that he will not pursue the case any further. &quot;I&apos;ve had a great life in racing,&quot; Jarvis said. &quot;I don&apos;t think I deserved to have my licence taken away but they&apos;ve decided different. That&apos;s how they operate, everybody knows that. Owners, trainers and jockeys, they hate them [the BHA] with a vengeance. &quot;One of my owners said he would back me even if it cost \u00a3300,000 to have a judicial review, but I said that at my age, I&apos;ve got better things to do with my life. There&apos;s a life outside racing, I was going to retire at the end of the year anyway but I&apos;d have liked to retire on a nice note.&quot; Jarvis added that he plans to write a book about his life in racing. &quot;I&apos;ve got a long memory,&quot; he said, &quot;and there&apos;s other ways to get your own back.&quot;", "title": "Australia odds-on for the Derby after True Story flops in Dante Stakes", "sentences": ["We&apos;ll sleep on it.&quot; Ambivalent, a Group One winner last year and third home in the Dubai Sheema Classic in March, took the Group Two Middleton Stakes under a well-judged front-running ride by Andrea Atzeni."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-15T17:45:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/19/chris-cairns-cricket-denies-match-fixing-icc", "tags": ["Cricket", "Sport", "New Zealand cricket team"], "article": "     Chris Cairns, the former New Zealand and Nottinghamshire all-rounder, has released a statement reiterating his previous denials of any involvement in match-fixing, following a report that &quot;the net is closing&quot; around a big name in the game. Cairns has not been publicly identified as that name, who is alleged to have made approaches to the former New Zealand batsman Lou Vincent and the current captain Brendon McCullum several years ago. But the 43-year-old, who has remained a high-profile figure in New Zealand since his international retirement in 2006 and was working as a commentator last December when he was named as being under investigation by the International Cricket Council with Vincent and Daryl Tuffey, was sufficiently aware of speculation that he is the man in the sights of the ICC&apos;s Anti-Corruption and Security Unit that he issued a lengthy statement to the Fairfax Media Group. &quot;I am being asked whether I am Player X,&quot; he said, in response to the references to Player X in the evidence presented by Vincent and McCullum to the ACSU investigation, which has been seen by the Daily Mail. &quot;Based on the limited information I have received during this investigation, I believe it is being alleged that I am that player. These allegations against me are a complete lie.&quot; Cairns confirmed for the first time that he had been interviewed as part of a separate Metropolitan police interview in New Zealand last December. He won a libel trial against Lalit Modi, the former commissioner of the Indian Premier League, at the High Court in London in 2012 over claims of corruption in the Indian Cricket League, which is now defunct. Cairns played for the Chandigarh Lions in that competition in 2008. Andrew Fitch-Holland, a lawyer who appeared as a witness for Cairns in that trial, who he describes as a friend, was arrested in March by the Met on suspicion of perverting the course of justice in relation to that case. Cairns insisted then that he had &quot;nothing to hide&quot;, and he repeated that sentiment in his latest statement. &quot;I ask that people reserve judgment until all the facts are brought to light,&quot; he said. &quot;I have nothing to hide. I have been to court to demonstrate conclusively that I am not a match fixer before. I will have no hesitation in doing so again. &quot;I conclude by saying that I believe there are dark forces at play. These forces have long arms, deep pockets and great influence. I acknowledge that recently I have upset some powerful people in the world of cricket, including raising my own concerns about the health of the game. I believe I am paying the price for that now.&quot; He said that Vincent, who was a team-mate in Chandigarh and went on to play county cricket with Lancashire and Sussex, &quot;is in a desperate position. He faces potential prosecution and in trying to negotiate a plea bargain, he appears to be willing to falsely accuse me of wrongdoing&quot;. Of McCullum, who described Player X as &quot;my hero&quot;, Cairns added: &quot;I have no understanding why he would say the things he is alleged to have said. To be clear, I have never approached Brendon, or anyone else, about match-fixing or any other improper activity. I am doing everything I can to get to the bottom of these allegations.&quot; The Mail story also included one further, potentially significant, allegation, that McCullum had been told by Player X how money made through fixing could be hidden through a property deal with &quot;a man in Dubai&quot;, who is understood to be associated with the sport.

Most of us were born in Athens, but have lived abroad and travelled the world, which is one of the reasons we believe Athens can be a liveable place if its citizens become engaged with its myriads of errors.  We created City of Errors \u2013 an audiovisual platform for the things we can do in our everyday lives to make our city better \u2013 to promote and spread this idea. Tell us about your city     Graffiti adds an artistic touch to countless dull grey buildings. All photos: City of Errors    Athens got its name from Athena, the goddess of war and wisdom, which is itself a contradiction. Surrounded by mountains and sea, the city enjoys the sun almost all year round, yet its natural beauty is undermined by lack of environmental policies and a certain lack of humanity.  Poor urban planning and a lack of civil education have turned Athens into a chaotic city, which the recent economic crisis has transformed into an urban jungle full of wonders and dangers. The jungle\u2019s treasures are many but it takes an exploring eye to understand this city and to realise where its potential lies: in the unity, perseverance and inventiveness of its citizens. Best and worst buildings     Neo-classical buildings live side by side with newer additions in Athens    Athens offers some of the best and worst examples of architecture in Europe. It takes nothing more than a short walk in the city\u2019s main roads to confirm this fact unambiguously; the sharp contrast between the old city and its newer additions is inescapable. Everywhere you look there are exemplary neoclassical buildings such as Athens City Hall which was designed in 19th century and the Cultural Centre of the National Bank of Greece, living side by side with shockingly hideous post-modern buildings without any sense of aesthetic and a mind blowing aggressiveness. But keep an eye out for graffiti: it adds a serious artistic touch to the countless dull grey buildings in the city. Note that they are considered illegal \u2013 and architectural ignorance isn\u2019t.  How clean is the city?     Tags and stickers cover this phone booth in Athens \u2013 although it does benefit from its unusual proximity to a bin    It&apos;s not. This is caused by the inefficiency of central waste management \u2013 low recycling numbers and overflowing garbage containers, for example \u2013 and by the absence of an environmental mentality in the majority of its citizens (throwing cigarette butts and litter directly on to the street instead into a bin is still a common reflex for most of Athenians).  The quality of air, although much better than during the pre-metro era, is still a serious issue. Extreme increases in the price of heating fuel has forced people to turn to the much cheaper solution of burning wood, causing high concentrations of micro-particles in the air which translates into thick winter fogs.  If you take a walk in the centre of Athens, you may notice that tags, stickers and street posters cover every inch of available wall, you\u2019ll probably step on dog poo and you will definitely realise how scarce waste bins are when you want to throw away that sandwich wrapping.  What&apos;s the best way to get around? The best way to get around the centre of Athens is on foot. However, one should always be aware that motorcycles and bicycles may suddenly appear where they shouldn&apos;t, and cars often occupy pedestrian areas. The number of bicycles in the city is rapidly increasing, however the city is not very flat and car drivers are not very considerate, making it a little scary for inexperienced riders.  If you want to move around the outskirts of the city, the metro network is growing and the tram can also be convenient, especially for the areas near the coast.  Unfortunately Athens is a very unfriendly city for anyone with mobility challenges such as people in wheelchairs, older people and mothers with pushchairs. Pavements \u2013 if they exist at all \u2013 are narrow and often occupied by vehicles, road signs, restaurant tables and other obstacles; as are ramps and pedestrian streets. Most shops, public buildings and archeological sites don&apos;t have ramps. What does your city sound like? The city\u2019s sound is a mix of traffic noise, drilling sounds and loud human voices. Noise pollution is a problem which remains unsolved mainly because most people don\u2019t realise its vast consequences. Best place for a conversation     Open space near the Acropolis    Anywhere under the Athenian sun! Sunny days motivate the locals to enjoy the city, usually in one of its countless cafes. Drinking coffee and sharing long conversations, jumping from topic to topic, is something of a sacred ritual for Greeks. The pedestrian walk around the Acropolis is also another place where people hang out when the sun falls. What one thing is indispensable for life in your city? For those of us living in Athens, patience is the most indispensable thing. Everything here takes three times longer to do than it should and unless you have a magic wand you will have to be patient. Deep knowledge of the city makes your life easier: knowing what to avoid and what to enjoy. If you don\u2019t know the city well, however, you may be confronted with its negative side in an overwhelming manner.  Are you optimistic about your city&apos;s future?     Taking photos on the streets of Athens    Our city\u2019s future is not a matter of abstract optimism or magic potions \u2013 it&apos;s a matter of choice. The choice to engage ourselves in both collective and individual initiatives that will step by step, place by place make this city flourish again. By conquering the negative mood of a community mercilessly struck by social and financial crisis, and by stimulating public dialogue, all kinds of interesting projects pop up in Athens and other, equally problematic, Greek cities.  Athens is a place of contradictions and surprises, where ancient beauty meets contemporary architectural monstrosity and extreme kindness and hospitality clash with unexpected rudeness and ignorance. Athens is sunny, beautiful, hard and harsh. But above all it is a place of vast potential. Seizing this potential requires critical rethinking, application of innovative solutions and the active involvement of its citizens. \u2022 The urbanist&apos;s guide to Dubai: &apos;A city too clean for its own good&apos;", "title": "The urbanist's guide to Athens: 'a city of wonders, dangers and potential'", "sentences": ["\u2022 The urbanist&apos;s guide to Dubai: &apos;A city too clean for its own good&apos;"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-19T16:16:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/may/19/vote-yes-rid-scotland-of-feudal-landowners-highlands", "tags": ["Scotland", "Land rights", "Scottish independence", "Environment", "Animals", "Wildlife", "Politics", "Farming", "Business", "UK news"], "article": "Power&apos;s ability to resist change: this is the story of our times. Morally bankrupt, discredited, widely loathed? No problem: whether it&apos;s neoliberal economics, tax avoidance, coal burning, farm subsidies or the House of Lords, somehow the crooked system creeps along. Legally, feudalism in Scotland ended\u00a0in 2004. In itself, this is an arresting fact. But almost nothing has changed. After 15 years of devolution the nation with the rich world&apos;s greatest concentration of land ownership remains as inequitable as ever. The culture of deference that afflicts the British countryside is nowhere stronger than in the Highlands. Hardly anyone dares challenge the aristocrats, oligarchs, bankers and sheikhs who own so much of this nation, for fear of consequences real or imagined. The Scottish government makes grand statements about land reform, then kisses the baronial boot. The huge estates remain untaxed and scarcely regulated. You begin to grasp the problem when you try to discover who owns them. Fifty per cent of the private land in Scotland is in the hands of 432 people \u2013 but who are they? Many large estates are registered in the names of made-up companies in the Caribbean. When the Scottish minister Fergus Ewing was challenged on this issue, he claimed that obliging landowners to register their estates in countries that aren&apos;t tax havens would risk &quot;a negative effect on investment&quot;. William Wallace rides again. Scotland&apos;s deer-stalking estates and grouse moors, though they are not agricultural land, benefit from the outrageous advantages that farmers enjoy. They are exempt from capital gains tax, inheritance tax and business rates. Landowners seek to justify their grip on the UK by rebranding themselves as business owners. The Country Landowners&apos; Association has renamed itself the Country Land and Business Association. So why do they not pay business rates on their land? As Andy Wightman, author of The Poor Had No Lawyers, argues, these tax exemptions inflate the cost of land, making it impossible for communities to buy. Though the estates pay next to nothing to the exchequer, and though they practise little that resembles farming, they receive millions in farm subsidies. The new basic payments system the Scottish government is introducing could worsen this injustice. Wightman calculates that the ruler of Dubai could receive \u00a3439,000 for the estate in Wester Ross he owns; the Duke of Westminster could find himself enriched by \u00a3764,000 a year; and the Duke of Roxburgh by \u00a3950,000. With the help of legislators and taxpayers, the owners of the big estates are ripping apart the fabric of the nation. The hills in many parts look as if they have been camouflaged against military attack, as they have been burned in patches for grouse shooting. It is astonishing, in the 21st century, that people are still allowed to burn mountainsides \u2013 destroying their vegetation, roasting their wildlife, vaporising their carbon, creating a telluric eczema of sepia and grey blotches \u2013 for any purpose, let alone blasting highland chickens out of the air. Where the hills aren&apos;t burnt for grouse they are grazed to the roots by overstocked deer, maintained at vast densities to give the bankers waddling over the moors in tweed pantaloons a chance of shooting one. Hanging over the nation is the shadow of Balmoral, whose extreme and destructive management \u2013 clearing, burning, overgrazing \u2013 overseen by Prince Philip, president emeritus of the World Wide Fund for Nature, is mimicked by the other landowners. Little has changed there since Victoria and Albert adopted an ersatz version of the clothes and customs of the people who had just been cleared from the land. This balmorality is equivalent to Marie Antoinette dressing up as a milkmaid while the people of France starved; but such is Britain&apos;s culture of deference that we fail to see it. Today they mix the tartans with the fancy dress of Edwardian squires, harking back to the last time Britain was this unequal. But despite this lockdown, there is, if not quite a Highland spring, the beginnings of something different: on one side of me, here in Boat of Garten, is the bare, black misery of the Monadhliath mountains; on the other, the great rewilding that is quickly but quietly spreading through the north-west of the Cairngorms national park. Across 100,000 hectares, the RSPB, the Forestry Commission, the National Trust and Wildland Ltd (owned by the Danish textiles billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen) are seeking to reverse the destruction, reduce the deer to reasonable numbers, and get trees back on the braes. On Povlson&apos;s estates the area of woodland has doubled (to 1,400 hectares, or 3,450 acres) since 2006, solely through the control of deer. It&apos;s not land reform, but it&apos;s the best that can be done with the current, dire model of Scottish ownership. The forests at the moment are bright with birdsong. In some places, looking down on lochans surrounded by marshes and regenerating pines, you almost expect to see a moose emerging from the trees. Trees are racing up the denuded hillsides: in Glenmore I&apos;ve come across young pines, birch and rowan growing at 800 metres. Already people are talking about reintroducing lynx here within 20 years. As the return of the ospreys to the lakes and forests in this part of the park shows, the potential for ecotourism, which spreads income and employment through the economy, is vast. The contrast with the scorched and scoured grouse moors of the east side of the national park, which employ hardly anyone, concentrate wealth in tax havens and are unmysteriously devoid of most birds of prey, could not be greater. It doesn&apos;t reverse the other injustices, but it begins to undo the centuries of physical destruction. I would vote yes in September if I lived here, on the grounds that it presents an opportunity to do something new, and I furiously hope, despite the evidence, that an independent Scottish government will take it. It should list all the beneficial owners of the land; impose the taxes Westminster refuses to levy; ensure that only farmers get subsidies and cap them at \u00a330,000 a head; ban burning; control deer numbers; and turn Scotland into a land where you can actually see green shoots of recovery.

The jury was told that the crown&apos;s case against the former editor was based on inference and theorising, and that it was supported by misleading police evidence and at least one witness who lied. Starting his closing speech, Brooks&apos;s barrister, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, told jurors that cruelty, vitriol and biased commentary in the media has disadvantaged her defence. It has meant that she is &quot;some yards from the starting line and she cannot win,&quot; Laidlaw added. The jury of eight women and three men was told that everyone appreciated what they had done &quot;at some considerable cost&quot; to their own lives in the past seven months. &quot;This case has been described as a trial of the century \u2013 it probably feels like that to you. Much nonsense, complete nonsense have been said about these proceedings and awful things have been said about Rebekah Brooks,&quot; Laidlaw said. He asked jurors to imagine instead if they had spent the past seven months in the public gallery watching a &quot;loved one&quot; fight their case. &quot;You would be all too painfully aware that the case was conducted against the backdrop of significant attention from the media,&quot; he said. &quot;Attention from the media in all its modern forms, opinions have been expressed with views running from criticism and comment, to inaccuracy and bias to downright cruelty and vitriol. &quot;Inevitably from up there you would worry on its impact on the jury.&quot; Unlike those in the public gallery who are free to watch and read reports about the trial, jurors have been frequently instructed by the judge not to discuss the case or to look at internet or social media commentary. Laidlaw said Brooks was not seeking or asking for &quot;special treatment&quot; but asked: &quot;Can anyone be independent enough, strong enough to avoid being influenced by it [media attention]?&quot; If you were a relative in the public gallery, he said, you would fear that whatever has been achieved in the case, &quot;she is starting at a disadvantage, some yards behind the starting line and she cannot win.&quot; Laidlaw said the prosecution case against her was &quot;conducted around inference&quot; and kept changing as the seven-month trial went on. He said the prosecution relied on at least one witness, golfer Colin Montgomerie&apos;s former wife Eimear Cook, who had &quot;lied&quot; and accused one police witness of giving &quot;misleading&quot; evidence to a court in relation to a warrant application to search Brooks&apos;s home. The prosecution&apos;s attitude seemed to be &quot;theory first, evidence later&quot;, Laidlaw asserted. Brooks is facing four charges including one that she conspired with others to intercept phones of the rich, powerful and famous between 2000 and 2006. Laidlaw said analysis of hacker Glenn Mulcaire&apos;s phone records showed that there was only one story that could be linked to hacking that was published during Brooks&apos;s editorship between 2000 and 2003. &quot;That of course as you know was the Milly Dowler story and it was published when she was thousands of miles away when she was on holiday in Dubai.&quot; &quot;Can that really be a coincidence, that in her three years in editing the News of the World, there is not a single phone hacking story in a paper she edited,&quot; he asked. Laidlaw told the jury twice that hacking &quot;did not take place at the Sun&quot; and it did not follow her &quot;from one paper to another&quot; when she left the News of the World in 2003 to become editor of the Sun. &quot;It has been suggested that Mrs Brooks was the architect of phone hacking at the NoW. But that was not the case. You came to realise when [lead prosecutor] Mr Edis sat down having opened the case over four days, there was no smoking gun in the evidence said to be suggestive of Mrs Brooks&apos;s guilt,&quot; he said. The prosecution&apos;s best point was &quot;she must have known&quot; about hacking when she was editor of the News of the World, he added. Laidlaw told jurors that it &quot;just doesn&apos;t follow&quot; that because two news desk heads, Greg Miskiw and Neville Thurlbeck, had pleaded guilty to phone hacking offences that &quot;Mrs Brooks must be guilty too&quot;. Of the 550 times that Mulcaire appeared to have been tasked by the News of the World, only 12 could be linked to phone hacking or preparation for phone hacking, Laidlaw said. He accused the prosecution of making a &quot;completely false point&quot; in relation to the Mulcaire evidence when police analysis categorised so many of his calls were either for &quot;blagging&quot; or could not be stated with any firmness to be blagging or hacking. He said it was &quot;just wrong&quot; of the prosecution to &quot;give you the impression&quot; that Mulcaire did not do &quot;anything else other than hacking&quot;. Brooks has denied all the charges against her.

Brooks was not consulted about the hacking of the missing Surrey schoolgirl and did not sanction the interception, her defence counsel has said. In his closing speech for Brooks, Jonathan Laidlaw QC told the jury that if there one was one thing in the trial of which they could be certain it was that she was &quot;not guilty&quot; over the hacking of Dowler&apos;s phone. Brooks was on holiday in Dubai in April 2002 and &quot;not party&quot; to the agreement between the paper&apos;s chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and investigator Glenn Mulcaire to hack Dowler, he said. Nor was she sharing confidences with her deputy editor Coulson who was at the helm at the time and with whom she had an on-off relationship, he added. &quot;No matter how close they were, I am sure, and [lead prosecutor Andrew] Edis does not do that, he is not asserting that they may have communicated telepathically over a distance of 3,000 miles,&quot; Laidlaw said. He said the affair between Brooks and Coulson was not continuous and they did not share everything as both were married at the time. &quot;The reality of any extramarital affair \u2013 a relationship that Mrs Brooks told you, is by definition, dysfunctional \u2013 there may be many things they keep from each other, their real lives at home for example,&quot; said Laidlaw. He accused Edis of being &quot;guilty of being far too black and white in his reading&quot; of a draft letter Brooks wrote after Coulson broke off the relationship in 2004 and discovered by police following the investigation into the News of the World in 2011. Laidlaw said Brooks&apos;s pain was real and truthful, but it should be read in the context of the break-up. &quot;We all know that in the immediate aftermath of the break-up there is a tendency to over-emphasise the importance of what you have lost even to yourself,&quot; he said. &quot;They always feel like the person you cannot live without the moment they tell you will have to live without them.&quot; Laidlaw said the prosecution had been &quot;extremely reckless&quot; suggesting that Brooks and Coulson had discussed the Dowler hacking in a text exchange between editions of the News of the World on 14 April 2014 when the Dowler story, based on a hack, appeared. He told the eight women and three men on the jury that the prosecution had no evidence that &quot;she sanctioned the hacking of Milly&apos;s phone in advance&quot;. &quot;There&apos;s no evidence she knew about hacking phones before she stepped on to that plane to Dubai,&quot; he said. The jury has already heard that Mulcaire was tasked on 10 April by Thurlbeck to hack Dowler&apos;s phone and that the hacking took place between 10 April and 12 April 2002. This was two days before the News of the World reported a development in the search for the missing schoolgirl based on a voicemail about a job in an Epson factory in Telford. Brooks went on holiday to Dubai on 7 April and Laidlaw told jurors that telephone records show she was not in contact with the paper before the tasking. &quot;There is no telephone contact with anyone at NoW prior to the tasking on 11 April [the day after the tasking]. There is no telephone contact with the NoW in either direction,&quot; said Laidlaw. &quot;Mrs Brooks could not have been a party to that agreement [with Mulcaire]; the evidence demonstrates that she was not. &quot;There is no evidence, simply no evidence at all that anybody at NoW, Thurlbeck or anybody disturbed her holiday about anything prior to 11 April, let alone consulted her about a hacking of Milly Dowler&apos;s phone.&quot; Moving to the allegation that Coulson told Brooks about the hacking of David Blunkett&apos;s phone after she moved from the NoW to the Sun, Laidlaw accused Edis of &quot;desperate stuff&quot;. &quot;Lovers they may have been but there was no love lost between their papers, the two of them were perfectly capable of protecting their own papers and their scoops,&quot; he said. He said the prosecution had invited the jury to &quot;leap to conclusions about the News of the World and the Sun&quot; when Brooks was promoted to the daily. He said any &quot;basic research&quot; would have shown to the prosecution that the Mirror had broken the story about pregnancy about the woman with whom Blunkett was having an affair and that this did not come from a hack.

Haigh, who denies all allegations, was arrested shortly after arriving in Dubai and has been in custody since then. GFH \u2013 the investment bank that bought Leeds from Ken Bates in December 2012 before selling the club to the Italian businessman Massimo Cellino in April this year \u2013 has made the accusations relating to its time as owner of the club. Haigh previously worked for GFH Capital, a subsidiary of GFH, but left his position with the organisation this year. He played a key role in Cellino\u2019s takeover, worth more than \u00a330m, and had been in line to become chief executive in the new regime before resigning from Leeds shortly after the Italian was cleared to buy United by the Football League following a lengthy appeal process. A friend of the 36-year-old\u2019s said: \u201cDavid has done absolutely nothing wrong or illegal. He is appalled to find himself in this position. However, as someone who knows Dubai well and respects its institutions he is confident that the authorities will see these allegations for what they really are and clear him from any wrongdoing.\u201d A Foreign Office spokesman said: \u201cWe are aware of the arrest of a British national in Dubai on 18 May 2014. We are providing consular assistance.\u201d It is the latest twist in a series of extraordinary events surrounding Leeds in recent months, starting when GFH decided to sell the club because of spiraling debts. Before Cellino\u2019s takeover it was losing more than \u00a31m a month and the Italian has been ruthless in controversial cost-cutting since arriving, temporarily closing the training ground, Thorp Arch, and making a significant number of staff redundant. The future of the Leeds manager, Brian McDermott, appears in serious doubt and Benito Carbone, a former Sheffield Wednesday and Bradford midfielder, has been appointed as a technical and football consultant. Cellino has ordered the players and manager to cut their holidays short and return early for pre-season training. Haigh was interviewed by West Yorkshire police this month after allegations from Cellino that thousands of pounds in club money were fraudulently used to pay for security cameras at the stadium, found in the boardroom toilets at Elland Road. Haigh says that the surveillance equipment was \u201cproperly paid for by the club\u201d and that it was installed because of alleged \u201crecent misuse of class-A drugs\u201d on the premises. Haigh\u2019s consortium, Sport Capital, which had been in the running to buy the club from GFH, has issued a winding-up petition against Leeds for an unpaid loan of around \u00a31m.

The army&apos;s declaration of martial law in the early hours of Tuesday \u2013 without consulting the government \u2013 further undermines the embattled administration and the kingdom&apos;s fragile democracy. Under the Martial Law Act of 1914, military commanders now have wide-ranging powers to detain suspects, censor the media, impose curfews and prohibit public gatherings. Fourteen television stations have been taken off the air, and the Bangkok Post reported on Wednesday that the military was &quot;restricting comments on TV and in the print media by prohibiting remarks that could confuse society or provoke violence&quot;. There were also reports that books on Thai politics had been taken off the shelves at some shops. This was a clearly a coup in all but name, and it was greeted with deep concern by the international community. As Brad Adams of Human Rights Watch said, &quot;Thailand&apos;s friends in the world&apos;s capitals should make it clear that they expect this de facto coup to be reversed immediately.&quot; The causes of the bitter conflict tearing Thailand apart are complex, and civil war remains a strong possibility. The army justified the imposition of martial law by claiming it was necessary to restore order amid heightened tensions and fears that rival groups would clash in the streets. For the past six months, the former deputy prime minister Suthep Thaugsuban has led protests aimed at unseating the Pheu Thai government, which won a 2011 election observers said was largely free and fair. In February, it won another election, which was boycotted by the opposition Democrat party while Suthep&apos;s thugs blocked polling stations. The inept, elitist and misnamed Democrats, led by the Eton- and Oxford-educated Abhisit Vejjajiva, appear to have given up on parliamentary democracy altogether. The government commands strong support in the rural north and north-east of the country, while the protesters are drawn mainly from Bangkok&apos;s middle class and elite, and from opposition strongholds in the south. They claim the government is controlled by the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was overthrown in a 2006 coup and now lives in Dubai; he faces a two-year jail sentence if he returns to Thailand. Thaksin, a policeman-turned-telecoms-billionaire, is a deeply divisive politician who appealed directly to the rural masses, upsetting the status quo and making many enemies among the traditional elite. Many of the middle-class protesters make no effort to conceal their scorn for the government&apos;s &quot;red shirt&quot; supporters, whom they portray as ignorant, uneducated &quot;buffalos&quot;. In doing so, they display only their own ignorance. A few days ago, it emerged that the newly crowned Miss Thailand Universe had said on Facebook the red shirts were dirty, and the leaders should be executed. A member of the election commission, which organises polls, previously described the red shirts as &quot;low class and vile&quot;. Suthep and his followers have vowed to &quot;eradicate the Thaksin regime&quot;. They have powerful allies in the military and the heavily politicised courts, which have repeatedly ruled against the government. Earlier this month, Thaksin&apos;s sister Yingluck, who was elected prime minister in 2011, was dismissed by the courts over the transfer of an official who was openly hostile to her government. It was the third time a prime minister loyal to Thaksin had been dismissed by a dubious court decision; one lost his job after appearing on a television cooking show. In another blow to the government, 36 senators were indicted last month for backing an &quot;unconstitutional&quot; bid to make the senate fully elected. The elephant in the room is the looming royal succession. Thailand&apos;s King Bhumibol is 86 and ailing, but strict lese-majesty laws make it impossible for journalists based in the country \u2013 including this one \u2013 to discuss the issue openly without fear of arrest. The crown prince is widely seen as an ally of Thaksin, and credible analysts view the current political turmoil through the lens of royal intrigue and a fight for control of the crown property bureau, which is worth billions. The army&apos;s intentions will become clearer in the next few days. Many government supporters fear that it will appoint a new administration, which the protesters have been clamouring for \u2013 despite doubts over whether the constitution allows it. If this happens, the red shirts will surely take to the streets again, and more bloodshed will be inevitable. Those of us who love Thailand and value democracy must stand with the country&apos;s flawed but democratically elected government. This does not mean supporting Thaksin, who has been described by Human Rights Watch as &quot;a human-rights abuser of the worst kind&quot;. It means allowing the Thai people to elect their own leaders \u2013 even bad ones \u2013 and control their own destiny.", "title": "We must defend Thailand's fragile democracy \u2013\t or civil war looms | Mark Fenn", "sentences": ["They claim the government is controlled by the former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was overthrown in a 2006 coup and now lives in Dubai; he faces a two-year jail sentence if he returns to Thailand."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-21T15:43:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/21/horse-racing-tips-22-may", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Ayr 1.50 Denton Dawn 2.20 Bunce 2.50 False Witness 3.25 Kolonel Kirkup 4.00 Polar Forest 4.35 Ingleby Symphony 5.10 Busatto 5.45 Elle Rebelle Goodwood 2.10 Estidhkaar 2.40 Best Kept 3.15 Story Writer 3.50 The Confessor 4.25 Secret Pursuit (nap) 5.00 Saarrem 5.35 Perfect Muse Salisbury 6.05 Brazen Spirit 6.40 Picc Of Burgau 7.15 Backstage Gossip 7.50 Burnham 8.20 Dry Your Eyes 8.50 Curbyourenthusiasm Sandown Park 5.55 Russian Heroine 6.25 Maxie T (nb) 7.00 Cape Icon 7.35 Munaaser 8.10 Mutakayyef 8.40 Lady Guinevere Wetherby 2.00 Oleohneh 2.30 Jimmy The Hat 3.05 Inoogoo 3.40 Dubai Prince 4.15 Alderbrook Lad 4.50 Lost Glory 5.25 Church Bray", "title": "Horse racing tips: Thursday 22 May", "sentences": ["Ayr 1.50 Denton Dawn 2.20 Bunce 2.50 False Witness 3.25 Kolonel Kirkup 4.00 Polar Forest 4.35 Ingleby Symphony 5.10 Busatto 5.45 Elle Rebelle Goodwood 2.10 Estidhkaar 2.40 Best Kept 3.15 Story Writer 3.50 The Confessor 4.25 Secret Pursuit (nap) 5.00 Saarrem 5.35 Perfect Muse Salisbury 6.05 Brazen Spirit 6.40 Picc Of Burgau 7.15 Backstage Gossip 7.50 Burnham 8.20 Dry Your Eyes 8.50 Curbyourenthusiasm Sandown Park 5.55 Russian Heroine 6.25 Maxie T (nb) 7.00 Cape Icon 7.35 Munaaser 8.10 Mutakayyef 8.40 Lady Guinevere Wetherby 2.00 Oleohneh 2.30 Jimmy The Hat 3.05 Inoogoo 3.40 Dubai Prince 4.15 Alderbrook Lad 4.50 Lost Glory 5.25 Church Bray"], "publicationDate": "2014-05-21T16:16:20Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2014/may/21/bollywood-shah-rukh-khan-actor", "tags": ["Bollywood", "Film", "Rich lists", "Business", "Film industry", "India", "World news"], "article": "Bollywood&apos;s highest earning celebrity Shah Rukh Khan earned in excess of \u00a325m last year, securing his title as the second richest actor in the world.

A number of the owners of these companies are private equity firms and they are selling because they think it&apos;s a good time to sell.&quot; The experience of Saga and others has not deterred easyJet&apos;s founder, Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who announced yesterday that he was listing his easyHotel business on the stock market in the billionaire&apos;s first flotation since his budget airline went public in 2000. EasyHotel is seeking to raise up to \u00a360m on London&apos;s Alternative Investment Market to fund expansion. The company did not say how big a stake it would sell or what market value it hoped to secure. Haji-Ioannou launched his budget hotel chain in 2004, one of the many businesses under his &quot;easy&quot; brand. The company, which is fully owned by easyGroup Holdings, has 20 hotels, 17 of which operate as franchises. It has seven hotels in London, one each in Edinburgh and Glasgow and the rest spread across European cities, Dubai, Johannesburg and Haji-Ioannou&apos;s native Cyprus. Haji-Ioannou said: &quot;I see easyHotel as one of the best, most natural extensions of the easy brand from the airline. &quot;EasyHotel is raising money to accelerate growth at a much faster rate than I could have grown it as a private company, whilst enabling me to spend more time on my diversified portfolio of other investments.&quot; As well as funding growth in European cities, the money will be used to repay a loan to easyGroup. The listing will also allow easyHotel to tap equity investors in order to raise further cash for investment. The chain claims to offer &quot;clean, comfortable and safe&quot; accommodation at bargain prices. It said there was little competition in its &quot;super-budget&quot; category and the easy brand gave it an advantage in marketing to budget travellers. EasyHotel is led by Simon Champion, who spent 16 years as a City analyst covering the leisure industry before joining easyHotel last year as chief executive. Champion said: &quot;I have enjoyed working with Stelios, and am delighted he will remain a significant shareholder.&quot; Floats that have sunk this year Card Factory, the budget greetings card chain, floated on 15 May to tap interest in low-cost retailers. It boasted 17 years of unbroken sales growth and replaced the failed Clinton Cards as a listed card retailer, but its shares have fallen 12% since they went on sale. Just Eat, the online takeaway service, fed investors&apos; appetite for internet stocks when it listed on 3 April. Valued at \u00a31.5bn, it was the biggest technology float on the London market for eight years. After an initial burst of enthusiasm on the day of its IPO, its shares have fallen 16%. Pets at Home was valued at \u00a31.2bn when it floated on 12 March. Analysts praised the pet equipment and vet chain&apos;s prospects after it fared well during the recession. With an enthusiastic customer base and little online competition, it was seen as a star retailer. Its shares, however, have fallen 18%. Appliances Online&apos;s shares soared by more than a third on their first day of trading on 26 February. In a sign that IPO fever had taken hold, the company&apos;s market value hit \u00a31.6bn that day, but it is now valued at little over \u00a31bn, down 13% on the price at which the shares were first sold.", "title": "Stelios to float easyHotel to fund growth in European cities", "sentences": ["It has seven hotels in London, one each in Edinburgh and Glasgow and the rest spread across European cities, Dubai, Johannesburg and Haji-Ioannou&apos;s native Cyprus."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-23T17:37:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/may/24/thomas-bjorn-six-birdies-pga-championship", "tags": ["Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Suddenly, this is Thomas Bjorn\u2019s tournament to lose. His double bogey on the opening hole of the third round of the BMW PGA Championship offered hope to up to 20 players. The Dane\u2019s wobble was soon and comprehensively offset; a terrific run of six birdies in a row from the 11th pushed Bjorn out to 14 under par and six strokes clear of the field. By close of play on Saturday, that advantage sat at five from Luke Donald. This could yet be a procession, albeit Donald\u2019s bogey-free third round was the latest indicator of a man returning to form. Despite struggles with the putter, Shane Lowry is still a danger, one shot adrift of Donald. At 43 years old, Bjorn\u2019s recent renaissance has been one of the more endearing tales on the circuit. In direct relation to this event, his prominence is a surprise; Bjorn has not earned a top-10 finish here since 1998. This time around, a Thursday score of 62 placed Bjorn in a position that he has managed to keep a firm grip on. YesterSaturday\u2019s one-off highlight was a curving 20ft putt on the 15th, thereby providing the penultimate birdie of Bjorn\u2019s stunning run. He narrowly missed a putt on the 17th to make it seven in a row. A three-hour, rain delay did little to break Bjorn\u2019s stride, that opening aberration and further bogey at the 5th aside. After two wins in 2013, he is now on track to confirm a first success of this year. Rory McIlroy matched Bjorn\u2019s six on the 1st. He, too, was to recover, closing at eight under after picking up a shot on the 17th. Another top-10 finish, which would be an eighth in nine strokeplay events, beckons for McIlroy. This would be the most admirable of all of them, given the drama that has engulfed McIlroy\u2019s private life. Anthony Wall had more than a third-round 67 to be pleased with. The Queens Park Rangers season ticket holder was out on the course as his team earned promotion to the Premier League courtesy of a late winner. At six under, Wall could yet cap a memorable weekend with tournament glory. \u201cI had just hit my tee shot at 17 and someone in the crowd said, \u2018Do you want to know the score?\u2019\u201d Wall said. \u201cThen he smiled, and I said, OK then, so I knew what way the game had gone. \u201cI was disappointed that I was teeing off later today, because they were playing at three o\u2019clock. I just prayed that they were going to win and I have recorded it.\u201d The lowest round arrived from Francesco Molinari, who belied poor conditions to score 65. The Italian has now placed himself firmly in contention to win at the same aggregate as Wall. Joost Luiten, Henrik Stenson, Chris Doak, Jamie Donaldson and Pablo Larraz\u00e1bal are among others who have aspirations of hunting down Bjorn. A collapse from the leader, or something special from those in pursuit, is needed for Bjorn to be denied here. \u201cThere are more guys in the field than Thomas,\u201d Luiten said. \u201cHe can make mistakes, as well.\u201d Peter Uilhein, who withdrew from this event, has also now pulled out of Monday\u2019s US Open qualifier at Walton Heath. The European Tour\u2019s 2013 rookie of the year has been toiling with a back injury, which means he will not appear in the US Open, at Pinehurst next month, for the first time as a professional. Padraig Harrington and Matteo Manassero are among those who will feature at Walton Heath. Stephen Gallacher, meanwhile, appeared nonplussed in his reaction to concerns aired by Tony Jacklin about his Ryder Cup potential. Gallacher, who has won the Dubai Desert Classic in back-to-back years, carded a 68 and sits at three under par, though in a tie for 22nd. Jacklin, a four-time European captain, had been asked about the possibility of Gallacher turning out in Paul McGinley\u2019s team in September at Gleneagles. What followed amounted to a verbal volley; if one which may yet inspire Gallacher. \u201cI\u2019m not try to be unkind, but Stephen Gallacher looks a bit iffy sometimes,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a bit tender-minded maybe.\u201d When informed of Jacklin\u2019s remarks, Gallacher said: \u201cIt\u2019s up to him, it\u2019s his opinion.

News of the king&apos;s move, delivered through local media, came the same day that the junta dissolved the country&apos;s last remaining democratic institution \u2013 the senate \u2013 and ordered dozens of activists and journalists to turn themselves in to the army. King Bhumibol Adulyadej, 86, who is ailing and frail, is not expected to attend the a royal ceremony on Monday morning at the Royal Thai Army headquarters in Bangkok. But his endorsement will give legitimacy to the junta&apos;s new government and allow its leader \u2013 army chief and acting prime minister Gen Prayuth Chan-ocha \u2013 to establish an interim constitution and legislative and reform committees. Under the name of the National Council for Peace and Order (NCPO), the junta has brought sweeping changes in a matter of days. On Thursday, it dissolved the lower house of parliament and suspended the constitution - one Gen Prayuth had previously helped draw up during the last military coup in 2006. By emptying out both the house and senate, junta can bypass the need for parliamentary approval of new laws. By late on Saturday the junta had also announced it had dissolved the senate and would be assuming control of all lawmaking powers. Several hours earlier, it had summoned 35 prominent academics and activists to report to army headquarters in addition to some 155 leading politicians and leaders it had already called in for questioning. The council has also sacked the police chief and head of the Department of Special Investigations \u2013 Thailand&apos;s FBI. On Sunday afternoon it called in the editors of 18 major Thai newspapers - among them Khaosod, the Bangkok Post, ASTV, Matichon and Thairath - according to the online news portal Prachatai. It was not clear if the editors would be allowed to leave or detained in unknown locations like those arrested earlier. In a separate summons, the outspoken columnist Pravit Rojanaphruk, who writes for English-language paper the Nation, was asked to meet independently with the junta and said on Sunday morning he was en route to army headquarters. &quot;On my way to see the new dictator of Thailand. Hopefully the last,&quot; he tweeted. He did not appear to have been released by Sunday evening. More than 100 people remain in military detention in secret locations in what has been seen as a push to suppress dissent and potential opposition to the military takeover. Those who refuse to answer the army&apos;s summons are under threat of being court martialled, facing a two-year prison sentence and a fine. &quot;What is scary now is that the army appears to be the most united institution in Thai society,&quot; said Paul Chambers of the institute of south-east Asian affairs, which is affiliated to Chiang Mai University. Former prime minister Yingluck Shinawatra, had been taken into custody on Thursday but was released on Saturday. A military source from the junta told CNN that Shinawatra had been asked to &quot;help us maintain peace and order and not to get involved with protesters or any political movement.&quot; Thailand&apos;s army said it seized power to restore peace and order after six months of political infighting left 28 people dead and more than 700 injured after anti-government protesters, calling for reforms, attempted to overthrow the Shinawatra-led government. The Shinawatra clan is a polarising family in Thailand. Its billionaire leader, Thaksin, a former premier deposed in 2006, now lives in self-imposed exile in Dubai. His supporters have fought bloodily with his critics for eight years and some observers say that the current military detentions could be seen as an attempt to &quot;purge&quot; the nation of any Shinawatra influence. But the coup leaders are also facing trouble in southern Thailand, where at least 10 bombs exploded on Saturday, reportedly killing three people and wounding 63. An Islamic insurgency has been under way in the south for a decade. Troops were deployed across central Bangkok on Sunday, concentrated around the shopping malls of Rajprasong, and later Victory Monument, to dispel a growing crowd of protesters defying a public ban on anti-coup gatherings. The crowd shouted at the soldiers, held up banners and called for elections and a return to democratic rule.           Similar &quot;pop-up&quot; protests have taken place in the northern city of Chiang Mai, a political stronghold for the now-deposed Pheu Thai party, as well as in the beach resort of Pattaya and at Khon Kaen in the north-east. But they are matched, at least in Bangkok, with &quot;pro-coup&quot; protesters who claim to support the junta and meet under the banner name of &quot;We love the army&quot;. Many of the activists and academics told to report to the junta appear to have been outwardly critical of Thailand&apos;s l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 law \u2013 known as Article 112 \u2013 which calls for up to 15 years&apos; imprisonment for defamatory, insulting or threatening comments about the royal family. Critics claim it stifles public debate and helps to maintain the status quo. The junta has also said that all l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9 and sedition cases will now be tried in army courts. Recent attempts to reform the law have met fervent resistance by royalists, among them Prayuth, who according to the Associated Press told critics: &quot;If you guys play hardball I&apos;ll have no choice but to do so too.&quot; A 10pm-5am curfew still stands across the nation and about 14 Thai TV channels and radio stations are still off-air. Some websites have been shut down and some international channels, like BBC and CNN, are still inaccessible on certain providers. Chambers said the speed at which the junta was instituting change was &quot;very worrisome&quot; and that the immediate future for Thailand looked bleak. &quot;I see more jailings. I see the enshrinement of more army power. I see the beginning of civil war after Thaksin announces a government in exile,&quot; he said.

Welbeck, speaking for the first time about the uncertainty surrounding his future, said he had started to feel disaffected because of his \u201cfrustrating\u201d inability to establish himself in the central role he craves. It had been his \u201cunhappiest season, without a doubt\u201d and the player is concerned it will continue that way when Van Gaal takes charge after the World Cup. \u201cI\u2019d like to play centrally,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve been playing on the left for a while and it\u2019s got to the time when I want to stake a place up front.\u201d Those chances appear slim, as Welbeck is aware, when the competition is provided by Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney and especially when United\u2019s exploratory talks about Edinson Cavani\u2019s potential availability from Paris St-Germain demonstrate they are open to the idea of bringing in another attacker. Welbeck\u2019s advisers have already let United know he is willing to sever his ties with the club, albeit reluctantly, and Tottenham Hotspur are among his admirers. Asked directly whether he could clarify that he still wanted to leave, he replied: \u201cI\u2019d rather not answer that question.\u201d Welbeck was subsequently asked whether it had reached this point because of his desire to play as a centre-forward. \u201cYes,\u201d he said, \u201cit does get frustrating. You want to play in a certain position and you\u2019re not getting the opportunity to do that. It\u2019s the same for everyone else when they are being played out of position and they don\u2019t really like it.\u201d The 23-year-old is often criticised for his goal output but made the point that, as a wide player, it was regarded as \u201ca bonus\u201d to score. His issue is particularly when United operate with a 4-4-2 system. \u201cIt depends what formation we are playing. On the left of a four-man midfield there are a lot more defensive duties so you can\u2019t find the time to keep attacking. But if you\u2019re on the left of a 4-3-3, I find that position really good. I can play in any formation but, if I play on the left, I\u2019d rather play there if there are three in midfield.\u201d Ideally, though, he wants the chance to show he can score regularly as an orthodox striker. \u201cI played there for United over the Christmas period and scored a few then. I just want opportunities.\u201d Welbeck said he had become particularly unhappy over the last season \u2013 \u201cI\u2019d rather not think about it,\u201d he replied, when asked to elaborate \u2013 and is known to be one of the players who found it difficult accepting David Moyes\u2019 style of management. At one point Moyes publicly stated that Welbeck should put in extra work on the training ground, a statement that went down badly with the player. \u201cI was pretty surprised, to be honest. I\u2019ve grown up at Manchester United and been professional all through my career and I always do extra work. It\u2019s born and bred in me to do extra work after training. He came out with that statement but, before then, I had been doing extra training. Maybe he just didn\u2019t see it.\u201d To illustrate the point Welbeck took a personal fitness trainer with him to Dubai when the members of Roy Hodgson\u2019s World Cup squad had a week off before joining England\u2019s training camp in Portugal. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say I play better for England but my goals-per-game ratio is definitely better,\u201d he continued. \u201cFormation-wise, I\u2019m much freer up front because, when I play on the left for England, with three in midfield and three up front, there is more defensive cover rather than me being that defensive cover. For United I\u2019m more likely to be left-wing in a four-man midfield, with only two central midfielders, so it\u2019s a bit more difficult for me to make runs and score goals when I\u2019ve got to think about my defensive duties.

Following an incredibly tense assessment day I made it through to the final interview stage. Within three weeks I received a phone call congratulating me on being successful and that I would be moving to Dubai in June. I was briefly told that I would have to meet some medical conditions, but never imagined what was to unfold next. After finally receiving the extensive medical forms, I was shocked to learn that Emirates does not accept employees with long-term recurrent mental health issues, and that isolated cases required a doctor&apos;s report. I was slightly concerned, having suffered with isolated bouts of depression in the past. I supplied the required report, where my doctor states that I am mentally and physically fit, that I no longer require any medication and that these were isolated cases linked to specific traumatic events. Throughout the whole process I was required to receive a numerous amount of costly vaccinations, dental examinations and medical reports within a tight deadline. Me and my family started to prepare for my departure to Dubai a matter of weeks away. Last week I received an email from Emirates stating that I had not met their medical conditions and that the job offer had been withdrawn. The single paragraph left me shocked and heartbroken. I had had my dream job taken away from me and lost a substantial amount of money because I suffered with depression. Mental health discrimination is illegal in England and Wales but Emirates seem to avoid this because they abide by UAE laws. I don&apos;t feel as if the company that was voted &quot;world&apos;s best airline&quot; should be treating its employees and potential employees in this manner. If the person is medically fit, capable of performing the job, and free of use of medication, then why deny them the role? They have already proven their suitability through the rigorous interview process, however a past use of antidepressants automatically negates this. I think a serious 21st-century reconsideration is needed in Emirates&apos; selection process \u2013 not that they agree, having since released a statement stating that they have a &quot;clear and fair recruitment process&quot;. Depression has made me a stronger, healthier person and has provided me with skills to empathise with all types of people and to deal with high-pressure situations. I initially set up a Facebook page called Emirates Against Depression to warn other aspiring cabin crew against the unfair treatment by the airline. I have received an overwhelming response from people all over the world sharing their personal stories of Emirates, other airlines and even other industries. I want to continue to raise awareness of discrimination against mental health sufferers and help people who have been in my situation. The messages I am receiving clearly show that there remains a stigma attached to mental health sufferers within the workplace. This is not acceptable. I am not afraid of talking about my depression, it&apos;s made me who I am today; a strong, resilient, hard-working person.

The Lambourn trainer was celebrating a victory with High On Life in very soggy conditions at Windsor on Monday but with plenty more rain forecast this week was adamant that his UAE Derby winner would not be travelling to contest the colts\u2019 Classic if the weather does not improve. Owner Michael Buckley paid \u00a38,000 to enter the colt for Britain\u2019s premier Flat race following his horse\u2019s runaway win on the Tapeta all-weather surface in the UAE Derby on Dubai World Cup night in March and he is currently a general 25-1 chance for next week\u2019s contest. \u201cHe\u2019s in good form and has been doing everything we ask of him well,\u201d said Osborne. \u201cOne of my doubts would be him getting the trip, and if it is raining like this at Epsom and keeps doing so he won\u2019t run. \u201cIn a way we\u2019re working back from next year\u2019s Dubai World Cup and I wouldn\u2019t want to risk him by running in a soft-ground Derby. \u201cHe has won a Group Two [race] and I would like him to win a Group One as a three-year-old. The obvious race to do that would be in Chicago in August for the Secretariat Stakes. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be against going to the Breeders\u2019 Cup, which would be a nice preparation for Meydan. The aim is the Dubai World Cup and I wouldn\u2019t want to drag his guts out in a soft-ground Derby.\u201d In contrast, Hughie Morrison, also at Windsor, was relishing the underfoot conditions and Osborne\u2019s fellow Berkshire trainer said Marsh Daisy, who would be a fancied runner if she turned up at Epsom for the Oaks, is more likely to take her chance now. Morrison\u2019s runner was an impressive winner of the Height of Fashion Stakes at Goodwood last Thursday, and while the trainer was initially sceptical of the idea of going to Epsom he is now coming round to the prospect. \u201cMarsh Daisy is well and we may supplement her for the Oaks if she is well and if the forecast [for more rain] is right,\u201d said Morrison. Meanwhile, Berkshire, an easy winner of the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot last June, will not be seen on the track for at least a few months after undergoing colic surgery. The three-year-old looked an exciting prospect for this campaign but was bitterly disappointing on his return to action in last month\u2019s Greenham Stakes at Newbury. Trainer Paul Cole\u2019s son and assistant Ollie, who was also at Windsor, said: \u201cBerkshire had something called an enterolith, which is a piece of cloth which he swallowed. He probably ripped it off his rug. \u201cHe swallowed it down and minerals and everything go around this enterolith and it ends up being grapefruit-sized. Then he had to have a colic operation. \u201cAt the moment he\u2019s fine, everything has gone well and we\u2019re hoping to bring him back in a month\u2019s time.\u201d Asked whether Berkshire could race again this season, Cole said: \u201cMaybe in October.

Ferdinand is attracted to working again under Harry Redknapp, who gave him his senior debut in 1996 when the QPR manager was in charge of West Ham United. The central defender, who spent 12 years at Old Trafford following his record \u00a330m transfer from Leeds United in the summer of 2002, is a huge admirer of Redknapp, considering him a mentor during the formative years of his highly successful career. Ferdinand has learned to manage the back problem that threatened to force him into early retirement a couple of seasons ago and is minded to play on at the highest level should the right opportunity present itself, saying recently: \u201cI\u2019m feeling fit and healthy, ready for a new challenge, and looking forward to whatever the future holds for me.\u201d With QPR once more in the Premier League after Saturday\u2019s 1-0 Championship play-off final victory against Derby County, and the Peckham-born defender keen to relocate back to the capital with his family, the west London club could prove ideal. Redknapp believes Ferdinand would be a key asset in the challenge of ensuring QPR are not relegated straight back down. The club did so under his management at the end of the 2012-13 campaign, though the 67-year-old had taken over that season from the sacked Mark Hughes, who handed over a team that was in bottom place after 13 games, seven points from safety. However, with expected interested from other Premier League clubs, as well as from those in China, Dubai, and Major League Soccer, Ferdinand will not rush into any decision. Redknapp sealed promotion for QPR through Bobby Zamora\u2019s closing moment\u2019s strike against Steve McClaren\u2019s Derby at Wembley, after Gary O\u2019Neil had been sent off for the Hoops in the 59th-minute for a professional foul on Will Hughes as the midfielder advanced on Robert Green\u2019s goal.              O\u2019Neil is one of several QPR players whose contract expires this summer and whose futures are unclear. Robert Green, Armand Traor\u00e9, Jermaine Jenas, Zamora, Andy Johnson, Alejandro Faurl\u00edn, Luke Young and St\u00e9phane Mbia could all leave. O\u2019Neil would like to stay at the club, but is yet to have his situation clarified by Redknapp and the chairman, Tony Fernandes. \u201cI\u2019ve had a fantastic year,\u201d the 31-year-old told TalkSport. \u201cI\u2019ve really enjoyed my time there. I enjoy working with Harry. We have got fantastic lads, fantastic fans. The atmosphere was fantastic in the Championship at the stadium so, hopefully, I will get a chance to taste it in the Premier League.\u201d Redknapp\u2019s busy summer of restructuring his squad for the top-flight is further underlined by him having eight loanees \u2013 Ravel Morrison, Beno\u00eet Assou-Ekotto, Niko Kranjcar, Kevin Doyle, Tom Carroll, Aaron Hughes, Modibo Ma\u00efga and Will Keane \u2013 all returning to their respective parent clubs. The manager also has five more players who had been out on loan returning \u2013 Julio C\u00e9sar, Adel Taarabt, Samba Diakit\u00e9, Esteban Granero and Lo\u00efc R\u00e9my. Park Ji-sung, who was at PSV Eindhoven on a temporary basis, has announced his retirement from the game because of a knee injury. With Ferdinand joining Nemanja Vidic in an expected exodus of players from United this close season, the 20-times champions remain in a strong position to sign Luke Shaw from Southampton despite his prospective transfer having stalled. United had been convinced that the deal to take the left-back to Old Trafford was all but sealed and despite Shaw now taking time to consider his options and Chelsea \u2013 plus a host of other top domestic and continental clubs \u2013 closely monitoring his situation, it would still present a major surprise should United fail to secure the 18-year-old\u2019s signature. Whether Wilfried Zaha, who cost United \u00a315m in January 2013, has a chance to impress the new manager, Louis van Gaal, is in the balance.

If anyone is a \u201cmaster of the universe\u201d, it is Justin, who never does tell me how much he earns, nor even how many digits his income runs to. I&apos;d hazard a guess at seven, maybe eight in a good year. \u201cI&apos;m underpaid for what I bring in to the bank,\u201d is all he&apos;ll say. My initial contact with him is a Saturday-morning phone call. I am just struggling into consciousness; Justin has been up for hours, sealing a deal in Africa. He says he gets to his office at 7am every day, and is often still there at midnight. The attraction of the City of London for financiers is that it spans time zones and acts as a bridge between the US and the rest of the world \u2013 hence the 17-hour day. The other seven hours can be left to Wall Street. Even investment bankers occasionally have to sleep. A few days after our initial phone conversation (when Justin warns me that \u201cwe see the Guardian as the enemy\u201d), we meet at a hotel in Mayfair, where he has been having lunch with clients. Mayfair, Canary Wharf and the old City, based around the Bank of England, are the three centres of London&apos;s financial world. Canary Wharf \u2013 modernist, faceless, towering \u2013 houses the mighty investment banks; the City \u2013 quirky, crowded, knotty, historic \u2013 has the brokers, insurers and ancillary services; Mayfair \u2013 discreet, stylish, cosmopolitan \u2013 is home to the hedge funds and private equity companies. I am trying to understand the culture of the City; to find out whether those who work there have learned the lessons of the crash of 2007-08, and if the City can ever be made \u201cdisaster proof\u201d \u2013 a question that has vexed politicians, financiers and the public ever since (indeed Mervyn King, the former Bank of England governor, has been warning the Hay Festival that another Fred Goodwin \u2013 the disgraced former Royal Bank of Scotland boss \u2013 will emerge unless the banking system changes). Seeking an insight into the City\u2019s problems is a thankless task. The terminology is baffling \u2013 I still can&apos;t distinguish between a credit default swap (CDS) and a collateralised debt obligation (CDO); organisations, including the Bank of England that refuses to grant me an interview, thrive on opacity; and City insiders are paranoid about talking to the media. I have never met so many people who insist on anonymity and demand to see quotes, or who, like Justin (not his real name), want both. He really must see me as the enemy, but to his credit he does talk \u2013 even if later he doubts whether he should have given the interview. \u201cThe City is the equivalent of Venice in the middle ages,\u201d Justin tells me. \u201cIt&apos;s a massive international melting pot that drives London and the rest of the country.\u201d He accepts there are bad guys, especially among the hedge funds, but insists the malign aspects of the City are outweighed by its benefits to the UK economy \u2013 providing more than 10% of the Treasury&apos;s total tax take. \u201cTo the aesthete Guardian, the average City trader looks pretty ugly because they drive swanky cars and are spivs,\u201d he tells me, \u201cbut you should respect the mores and the facts.\u201d I promise to try.     The City of London is opaque to outsiders. Photograph: Martin Godwin    Justin startles me by extending his Venetian analogy. If the City is Venice, he says, then the rest of the UK is Mestre \u2013 the boring bit on the other side of the causeway that no one visits. \u201cThe banks are here [in the UK], but almost everything they do is not here,\u201d he says. \u201cI&apos;ve got no clients in this country. I&apos;ve got clients in Russia, Mexico, South Africa, Australia, Switzerland. That&apos;s very normal in the City. The City doesn&apos;t service London and the UK; it starts off in India and goes all the way to Ireland, then up to Russia and down to Cape Town.\u201d The City is not especially interested in the UK; it exists to serve \u2018Emea\u2019, a land known only to bankers: Europe, the Middle East and Africa. He doubts whether I will really grasp the City. \u201cOne of the problems for you is that the big banks are so massive. If I leave my desk and walk 10 yards, I have no idea what the people sitting there do. I&apos;m on one floor of a huge, multi-storey building, and each floor is the size of a football pitch.\u201d It sounds loathsome. Does he enjoy it? \u201cWith a bank you have to be in a competitive frame of mind. If you&apos;re good at it, you like it and you make money for yourself and the bank. You enjoy it and you like the buzz of money. If you&apos;re not good at it, you&apos;re unhappy, you don&apos;t make any money and eventually you get shot. I really hate it if I&apos;m not doing well. It&apos;s like a big competitive cocktail party where you have to be personable and outgoing and persuasive, but also you&apos;ve really got to think through the issues, understand the complex beast you&apos;re working for, and exploit all the various things it can do. Most of these banks can do anything.\u201d In a good way, he means. A few days after meeting Justin, I have dinner with three members of a City-based book club \u2013 a partner in one of the big four accountancy firms, a partner in a large City law firm, and a senior analyst at an investment bank. They are thoughtful, friendly, articulate; they don&apos;t share Justin&apos;s hang-ups about the Guardian; they accept there are many legitimate criticisms of the City \u2013 the accountant even recognises that the domination of the big four accountancy firms is a cartel; and they don&apos;t wash down the expensive meal (paid for by the accountant, thank goodness) with a ludicrously overpriced bottle of wine; in fact they don&apos;t drink any alcohol. Conclusion one: the image of the drink and drug-fuelled City may be overstated; these guys like good food, lively conversation \u2013 an antidote to the ritualised alternation of home and work, says one \u2013 and thought-provoking books. They are the antithesis of spivs. The analyst (all three have requested anonymity) rejects my assertion that the City is hermetically sealed from outsiders and almost deliberately opaque \u2013 my main conclusion by the time I meet them. With a comment that underlines the difficulty facing the newly launched Banking Standards Council (an independent body that will monitor the City\u2019s attempts to restore its reputation), he says, \u201cYou have to be careful when you refer to \u2018the City\u2019. It doesn&apos;t really exist. There are lots of different parts of the City that often work together, but it&apos;s a very long way from being homogeneous. They&apos;re all financial markets to some extent, and the City just happens to be the geography and the legislative regime that everybody operates in. \u201cIt&apos;s a lot less homogeneous than it used to be,\u201d he continues. \u201cIt&apos;s much more fragmented. There&apos;s no trade body, there&apos;s no single profession, the regulators have been fairly fragmented, and the client base is all different. I&apos;ve got hedge fund clients who are often managing money on behalf of very wealthy individuals. I&apos;ve got pension fund clients who are managing the retirement funds of shopfloor workers. The only thing that&apos;s homogeneous about it is that very little of it is consumer facing. It&apos;s all professional clients. There&apos;s a vague commitment to keeping London competitive as a financial centre, because that&apos;s in everyone&apos;s interest, but that&apos;s as close to esprit de corps as you get.\u201d   Hard Times interactive Interactive graphic: the divisive toll of the economic slump   The esprit de corps of the old bowler-hatted public-school City of the 1960s and 70s has gone. The US-born lawyer tells me that when he first came to the UK in the late 1980s, the City ran entirely on personal trust and had no regulation at all. \u201cIt shocked me coming from the US, where the securities markets [markets where assets such as stocks, bonds and futures are traded] had been regulated since the 1930s.\u201d He says deals were done with a handshake, and the lawyers drew up the contracts later. In the US it was always the other way round. That informality and sense of belonging to a club, in which the main sanction was the threat of being blackballed by your fellow members, largely disappeared with the restructuring (or rather destructuring) of the City that took place in 1986 \u2013 the so-called &quot;big bang&quot;, from which both London&apos;s dramatic rise as a global financial hub and the collapse of 2007-8 directly stem. The analyst says banks are now too big. \u201cMost banks are a series of silos,\u201d he says. \u201cThere&apos;s a fixed-income [government bonds] business, there&apos;s an equities [company shares] business, there&apos;s an advisory business, there&apos;s a fund management business, and they all operate with different regulators, different chinese walls, different operational requirements. In theory there&apos;s a synergy in having them all together, but in practice they&apos;re actually quite different institutions, and sometimes, in my more cynical moments, I think the only reason organisations get bigger is so the CEO can get paid more, because there&apos;s a strong correlation between the size of the organisation and how much money the CEO makes.\u201d He says that these multi-function banks, which have emerged since big bang, are impossibly complex. \u201cI look at our business and I think, how could one person understand a big, sophisticated international investment bank? It&apos;s almost impossible, particularly because the financial instruments have got a lot more complicated. With some of the financial instruments, you may be able to value them accurately today, but tomorrow it could be completely different. There are so many complicated things driving the valuation that no one can really understand what goes on, and the speed of trading makes it potentially very dangerous.\u201d In the age of high-frequency trading, where computers are increasingly making decisions with minimal human supervision, many insiders believe that, if there is another crash, the dominoes will fall even faster than last time. In 2008, chancellor Alistair Darling had 48 hours to make sure the ATMs didn&apos;t run out of cash. Next time the window may be a lot smaller (though optimists suggest it might be possible to program the computers to shut down if markets are in freefall). What is certain is that we are entering unknown territory, and that a future crash will take a different form from that of 2007-8.     The trading floor of the London Stock Exchange as the Big Bang reforms took effect in 1986. Photograph: PA    Big bang Justin and my dinner companions are denizens of the new City of London. This came into being on 27 October 1986, when the Thatcher government stripped away all the old rules and conventions governing financial life, in particular the brokers&apos; fixed commissions that had made it a closed shop, and heralded a revolution that became known as big bang. \u201cBig bang changed everything,\u201d says David Kynaston, author of a highly regarded four-volume history of the City. \u201cUntil then, the City was just the Square Mile, and in many ways it was a village.\u201d The governor of the Bank of England had almost papal powers and, it was said, could exert authority by arching an eyebrow. \u201cIt wasn&apos;t just that the financial centre was a physically much smaller place, which gave it a greater intimacy,\u201d says Kynaston. \u201cBusiness itself was conducted in a much more personal way, partly because institutions were smaller but also because markets were face to face. They became very impersonal with screen trading. There were also infinite personal connections. You had City families where one brother went off to a merchant bank and another brother went off to a discount house and another went to a stockbroking firm and so on. There was an intricate interconnected web of personal relationships.\u201d The upside \u2013 personal trading that bred the culture of \u201cmy word is my bond\u201d \u2013 had a downside: this really was a closed world of public school chaps who all knew each other, dined with each other, played golf or went shooting together, and earned a comfortable living because of the closed-shop practices that Margaret Thatcher, in the City as elsewhere, quite rightly set out to destroy. She ushered in a new, meritocratic world that is much more tolerant than the old City (where anti-semitism was endemic), but also made possible the takeover of the City by American banks in the 1980s and 90s, sweeping away most of the cautious old family-owned institutions and prepared the ground for the ultra-competitive anything-goes culture that produced the crash. In 2000 Philip Augar, a former high-flying City broker, wrote a book called The Death of Gentlemanly Capitalism, which chronicled the end of the old City. Even then, long before the great reckoning of 2007-8, he had an inkling of what was in store. \u201cOwnership brings control and it is the City&apos;s lack of control over its own destiny that creates concern,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere are good reasons to believe that ownership matters and that the consequences will appear in due course.\u201d When I meet Augar, he tells me that after a 20-year career in the City, which straddled big bang, he started to worry about what he saw going on around him. \u201cDuring the 90s I started to get very unhappy about what was happening in the City, and one reason I left NatWest [where he was head of global equities and bonds] was that it was running a full-blooded trading, market-making business, and I felt that was risky. I didn&apos;t like the model and moved to Schroders [which then had an investment bank] because it was a different kind of firm \u2013 family dominated, been around a long time \u2013 and had a number of very happy years there. But I was getting less enamoured about what was going on in the City \u2013 the culture, the business model, how level we were with people \u2013 and I had the idea that I would write about it.\u201d The Death of Gentlemanly Capitalism, in some respects a lament for what had been lost, was the result. He says the book shocked people in the City. \u201cAt the time, the British-owned investment banks had blown up to the extent that they had sold themselves to foreign firms,\u201d he says. \u201cThe view at the time was, \u2018Hey, this is globalisation, that&apos;s what happens, and isn&apos;t it great.\u2019 But I took the view that it wasn&apos;t just about globalisation. There had been a lot of mismanagement in the City, and we needed to shine a light on that, and that&apos;s what the book tried to do. I also felt that no good would come of this. I felt that not having an indigenous investment banking industry would mean that the City would lose business. That bit was wrong. The bit that was right was that we would import the hard-charging American investment banking culture, which means conflict of interest, making money at the expense of everything and high leverage, by which I mean you borrow a huge amount of money to run your business.\u201d     Canary Wharf  (front) and the old City of London emerge from the fog. Photograph: Reuters/Metropolitan Police/MPS Helicopters    Augar&apos;s follow-up book, published just before the crash, was The Greed Merchants: How the Investment Banks Played the Free Market Game, which exposed the conflicts of interest at the heart of investment banks. \u201cI tried to explain how, by being able to act for the buyer and the seller in a deal, investment banks had an edge that gave them an advantage over every other market user. I saw that the culture was wrong and the business model was wrong, and that it was going to blow up somehow.\u201d He says that if he goes into investment banks or broking firms now, he realises he couldn&apos;t work in such an environment any more. \u201cI feel uncomfortable being in the City or Canary Wharf,\u201d he says, \u201cand overhearing conversations in coffee shops and wine bars.\u201d He finds \u201cthe certainty, the self-confidence, the reluctance to open up to alternative views\u201d depressing. \u201cThe view that you get is that there is just one way and ours is the right way. That view has started to soften around the edges, but hardcore City man and woman is still a very competitive alpha male/female focused on personal goals and some corporate goals. They still believe in the unfettered market economy, and I don&apos;t. I believe in the managed market, and that fundamental difference is why I had to stop.\u201d I wonder, given this philosophical divide from the culture of the City, how Augar coped in the two decades he spent at its heart. \u201cThe business model that was being run in the City then was fairly moderate,\u201d he says. \u201cThe conflicts of interest, the high leverage, the short-termism, those things weren&apos;t prevalent, and I felt for many years we were doing a good job for our customers, our shareholders and our staff and playing a responsible role in the economy at large. That started to change in the early 90s, and that was when I started to feel uneasy. I used to visit institutional shareholders with the then chief executive of NatWest, the late Derek Wanless, and I could see the pressure that they were putting him under. It felt wrong. It was all about results now, now, now, and if you fail to deliver we&apos;re going to shoot you, and eventually they did.\u201d He locates the start of the City&apos;s cultural transformation in the mid-90s. \u201cIt was the time when Morgan Stanley made a bid for SG Warburg [in 1994]. That started to tell you that the game was really beginning to change. The world that I&apos;d grown up in and was comfortable in was becoming something different.\u201d Big bang had triggered an even bigger bang. \u201cThe real watershed occurred in 1995,\u201d says Augar. \u201cIt was quite soon after the Barings debacle. Warburgs was forced into a merger, Kleinworts followed suit, Smith New Court sold themselves to Merrill Lynch. That opened the gates to the very highly leveraged, dangerous, risky model of trading, and after that everyone really went for it big time, all of which led to the banking crisis of 2007.\u201d Banks simply had too little capital to support the level of bad debts on their books, and without government bailouts many would have gone to the wall in 2007-8. Without a taxpayer-funded rescue, the bankers&apos; hubris would inevitably have been followed by nemesis. There&apos;s a great phrase that I hear again and again \u2013 \u201chaving your skin in the game\u201d. The old family-owned investment banks and stockbroking partnerships were dealing with their own money. The new conglomerates were not. The ecology of the old City made it much more small-scale and cautious. The post-big bang, post-consolidation City was expansionist and risk-taking, because the risks were being taken with someone else&apos;s money. Big bang ended the old nepotism, but introduced a form of financial despotism, when mega-banks \u2013 banks that in the end proved too be too big to fail \u2013 held the rest of society of ransom. In banking, small can be beautiful, but whether that old ecology can ever be recreated is highly doubtful. The global financial system is simply too interconnected. Putting &quot;moral hazard&quot; \u2013 the doctrine that says that if a bank makes a mistake, it pays for it \u2013 back into the system would be the single greatest step that could be taken in making the City more stable, but the Bank of England admits that we are still very far from achieving this. Banks are still too big to fail, and if there was another crash tomorrow the government would again have to step in to save the system from collapse. These days, the only skin in the game is the taxpayers&apos;.           Video analysis by Phillip Inman: the financial crisis, five years on    Evading responsibility  Meeting Kynaston and Augar was crucial to my understanding that, in a way, we were all responsible for the crash. We \u2013 the public, journalists, politicians \u2013 let it happen because we didn&apos;t challenge the City, didn&apos;t try to understand it. New Labour thought it had discovered a magic money-tree and gave up on regulation; journalists on the whole failed to read the runes or question the new macho expansionist, masters-of-the-universe culture; the public liked the easy credit and soaring house prices and was too lazy to examine what was happening in the City; and what naysayers and doom-mongers there were tended to be marginalised. Much of this remains true even today. Who understands the implications of George Osborne&apos;s great pensions reform, and who is bothering to find out what it means? Is the alleged collusion in foreign exchange trading getting the play it deserves? Do we understand the recent shake-up of personnel at the Bank of England, which saw the installation of a new head of financial stability?  The Financial Conduct Authority has been much in the news because of the bungled announcement of an investigation into pensions and other investments, but do you really understand where they fit into the complicated web of financial supervision that has been constructed in the wake of the crash? It&apos;s complicated, technical and needs a long-term commitment to telling the story. Most of the time we can&apos;t be bothered, even though the way the City behaves and regulates itself affects the lives of every one of us. \u201cThe City has always managed to evade its responsibilities because people find finance incomprehensible and boring,\u201d says Kynaston, \u201cand the City itself didn&apos;t do much to change that. In the 1870s, following the scandals that prompted Trollope to write The Way We Live Now, the Royal Commission on the Stock Exchange recommended that a viewing gallery be erected so that people could go and see what was happening in this place. The commission reported in 1878; the viewing gallery was erected 75 years later, in 1953.\u201d I approached the present-day stock exchange \u2013 now just a central supervisory office next to St Paul&apos;s Cathedral, as trading is done remotely from banks&apos; trading floors \u2013 for an interview and to observe the official start of trading at 8am (a visiting dignitary is sometimes allowed to sound the bell that declares trading open). The press office team were very friendly and sent me a very nice video of the Dominican ambassador opening trading in June last year, but I am still waiting for the interview. I was told I would receive a call to set up a visit and an interview with one of the executives. Three weeks later, I&apos;m still waiting. This remains a world fundamentally opposed to viewing galleries. A group of young activists inspired by the Occupy movement now do tours of the Square Mile, Canary Wharf and Mayfair. I joined the Mayfair tour one Sunday afternoon, and for two and a half hours we strolled around looking at the offices of all the hedge funds and investment companies in the area. What was most striking was that not a single one had a nameplate on the elegant building that housed them. They didn&apos;t want anyone to know they were there. There were about 20 people on the tour, which has to be booked online, and I got talking to a woman in her 20s. It&apos;s ridiculous, she told me, that finance isn&apos;t an integral part of the curriculum \u2013 both personal finance and the big-picture stuff about the City. She is of course right. How are we supposed to make decisions about our own finances \u2013 should I cash in my pension pot and buy that Lamborghini? \u2013 or even try to understand the City without a basic grounding? The Square Mile is run by the City of London Corporation, which traces its lineage back almost 1,000 years and prides itself on being like no other local authority. The Occupy activists see them as secretive and insular, as part of the problem. I found them efficient and eager to help, though I accept Occupy&apos;s point that they lack the democratic accountability of an ordinary local authority. The electorate is small \u2013 the 9,000 residents of the City and senior figures in the businesses that operate there; the electoral structure of wards, councillors, aldermen, sheriffs and, at the top, the lord mayor labyrinthine. The Occupy activists have a good deal of fun with the &quot;Remembrancer&quot;, a legal official from the corporation who represents the City&apos;s interests in the House of Commons and gets to sit behind the speaker&apos;s chair \u2013 a prime example, according to Occupy, of the overly close embrace of politics and big business. Canary Wharf, a private estate with a private security force, is even more of a closed world. It feels as if it could be anywhere in the world \u2013 Dubai, Singapore, Shanghai. Both the old City and the new are self-governing islands of wealth: not only not part of the UK but barely part of London. The fact that the Corporation of London has its own 800-strong police force, separate from the Met, emphasises that this is a world entire unto itself. The Square Mile grew up within London&apos;s old Roman wall, and that wall has become symbolic of its otherness and defensiveness. Most City buildings may be made of glass these days, but they are still far from transparent.     The City of London is a world unto itself. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Macho culture The Dutch writer Joris Luyendijk spent two years from 2011 to 2013 writing a blog for the Guardian about the City of London, and next spring will publish a book encapsulating his thoughts about this strange, secretive, self-contained world. The fact that he is an anthropologist by background has helped him delineate its tribes and rituals, and when we meet \u2013 in his favourite Turkish restaurant in north London \u2013 he tells me he has reached a counterintuitive conclusion about the inhabitants of the City. They are not masters of the universe, he insists; they are victims \u2013 clocking up 100 hours a week, working in an ultra-competitive environment, getting kicked out with just a few minutes to toss their possessions into a cardboard box if they can&apos;t hack it. \u201cHow they survive is by self-delusion,\u201d he argues. \u201cThey completely deny and ignore their own vulnerability.\u201d The City, he points out, is full of psychotherapists giving help to troubled financiers. \u201cThe bankers are the best-paid victims of a system that turns all of us into victims. The whole culture of always squeezing more growth and wealth out of something makes for a very totalitarian system where everybody&apos;s constantly after success.\u201d Luyendijk sees Canary Wharf as the empty heart of City life \u2013 towering offices, glitzy shops and a setting that (except for the dreary London weather) could be anywhere in the world. \u201cIt&apos;s the crassest illustration of the human condition in the 21st century,\u201d he says. He calls the working life of people in the City \u201cdysfunctional\u201d and says there is no evidence it has changed since the crash. \u201cThere is ripping off, where you lie to your clients. There is market rigging, where you lie to the central administration of Libor or forex. Then there is risking, where you lie to yourself about the risks you are taking or lie to your superior and then the regulator. And then there&apos;s rogue trading, where somebody hides their losses for a long time.\u201d Some banks are more predatory than others, but the prevailing culture remains short-termist. \u201cAs long as you can be out of the door in five minutes,\u201d he says, \u201cyour horizon is five minutes.\u201d A Dutchman like Luyendijk is horrified by such a culture. Dutch society is founded on social-democrat and Christian-democrat principles \u2013 long-term relationships based on trust rather than control \u2013 whereas the City now runs on anglo-American neoliberal rules of zero job security and control rather than trust. \u201cThe City of London is a little pocket of Hobbesian jungle,\u201d he says, \u201cand I don&apos;t think that&apos;s tenable in the long run.\u201d Luyendijk&apos;s critique is powerful, though it is rejected by most of those who work in the City. They accept the high-risk, high-reward structure, and say no one is forcing them to work there. But burn-out rates are undoubtedly high. In quitting after 20 years, Augar is by no means untypical. This is a world of ambitious young people on the make, and by the age of 50, especially on trading floors, you are ancient in City terms. Savvas Savouri, who has worked in the City for more than 20 years and is now a partner in a hedge fund that manages assets worth \u00a32.5bn, says the value placed on youth in the City is misguided. He also argues that the fact that many of the people entering the City have no financial qualifications \u2013 he speaks as someone who has an economics PhD and was an economics lecturer in the 1980s \u2013 is insane.  \u201cThe first thing you should ask anybody in this industry \u2013 very carefully, because they can get rubbed up the wrong way \u2013 is, \u2018Do you mind giving me your background?\u2019 Their instinct is to tell you where they&apos;ve worked, but you say, \u2018No, no, your education.\u2019 You&apos;ll be frightened by what you&apos;ll hear. You&apos;ll have professionals that have degrees in the humanities and the arts, and most recently engineers and physicists. I&apos;m not suggesting that those aren&apos;t laudable subjects, but they don&apos;t have an application in this industry. It&apos;s like asking someone who&apos;s trained as a mechanic to become a surgeon.\u201d In the course of a long conversation, in which he dismisses the veneration of the pre-big bang City as \u201cnostalgic crap\u201d, he keeps returning to this theme that the standard of people entering to the City has to be improved. \u201cWe are in the same state of development as medicine was before it was formalised,and you had to go and do a medical degree. In the old days, your dentist or your barber or your butcher was also your surgeon. We&apos;re still in that in finance, and that&apos;s why 2007-8 happened. Rather than regulate bonuses, regulate and manage the human capital that comes into it.\u201d     The City of London. Photograph: Martin Godwin for the Guardian    Russell Taylor has spent the past 25 years chronicling the ups and downs of City life through his cartoon character Alex, which started in 1987 in the London Daily News, migrated to the Independent when the LDN closed and currently trades in the Telegraph. He says he and cartoonist Charles Peattie concocted an archetypal monstrous, money-obsessed yuppie from their imaginations, and then, as they got to know the City better. were shocked to discover he really existed. \u201cI remember once talking to someone in the City about Alex and saying, \u2018Well, he&apos;s just a prat, isn&apos;t he?\u2019, and he said, \u2018But he&apos;s my hero, my role model.\u2019\u201d Taylor&apos;s view is that many of those who went into the City in the 70s and 80s drifted into the City, but that the new intake are totally committed. \u201cThe Alex generation [of the 1980s and 90s] has cleared the way for them morally by saying it&apos;s OK to be shallow. It&apos;s OK just to want money. You don&apos;t have to pretend that you want to save the world or write a protest song.\u201d Many observers believe that getting more women into the City, especially at board level, might help to curb the macho culture. There are a healthy percentage of women in law and human resources, but very few in trading or in the upper echelons of banking management. The analyst I met at dinner told me he had recently attended a meeting of almost 50 executives at his bank, only one of which was female \u2013 and even she had just returned from maternity leave. This remains a man&apos;s world, especially at the sharp end. At a breakfast discussion of women in the London economy at the office of the Centre for London thinktank, there is general agreement that anti-social hours and the culture of presenteeism in the City are barriers to women. There is a further problem, Diane Perrons, professor of gender studies at the London School of Economics, tells me after the discussion. \u201cWithin an organisation it&apos;s often very unclear what the progression structures are. Many of the mechanisms for promotion or pay increases are very opaque. What tends to happen is that people make judgements about other people&apos;s qualities in terms of leadership, dynamism, competitiveness, drive and so on, and they tend to be based on what one can think of as a kind of reciprocal recognition among peers. Other kinds of skills that may be important, more competitive, collaborative skills, are not really appreciated.\u201d They are the very skills, she says, that women are likely to have, but all too often they are ignored by male executives who tend to promote in their own image. Perrons describes research she did at a bank that said it wanted to change its working practices to encourage women, but found it very hard to do so. \u201cPeople at the lower levels of the organisation took advantage of leave schemes,\u201d she says, \u201cbut people higher up did not because of what were seen to be the negative effects of how they would be understood by the organisation.\u201d She says she had found no evidence that women were breaking into trading and other traditional male areas. Women do have one significant champion in the City \u2013 the Lord mayor, Fiona Woolf, only the second woman in more than 900 years to occupy that position. I meet her at the Mansion House, the lord mayor&apos;s residence close to the Royal Exchange and the Bank of England in the heart of the old City. Woolf is an energy lawyer, an area of relative female strength, but she recognises there are other areas where women are finding it hard to break in. \u201cThere are curious pockets where women are absent, like in asset management,\u201d she says. \u201cEven the law still has a long way to go. It has a long-hours culture, and measures success by the number of hours charged rather than the quality and efficiency of the output.\u201d \u201cWe want a much more diverse working culture, and we haven&apos;t got there yet,\u201d admits the accountant with whom I have dinner. \u201cPersonally, I think we should have quotas, and we should start at every promotion stage and fill them half male and half female. We have 50% male and 50% female at graduate level, but by the time you get up to senior management level we&apos;re 70:30. That&apos;s because we don&apos;t try to create the working environment that accommodates being a working mother.\u201d But getting more women in the City is unlikely to be a panacea. \u201cThe chief financial officer of Lehman Brothers was a woman,\u201d the lawyer points out drily. The analyst is also sceptical that more women in the City would have averted the crash, arguing that the problem is not too few women at the top, but too many traders. \u201cNever let a trader run a bank,\u201d he says emphatically. Traders are instinctive gamblers, and, as the crash showed, when banks place huge bets the most likely losers are the rest of us.     Bank bailouts compared. Click for a larger image. Graphic: Paul Scruton    After the crash Has anything really changed since the crash of 2007-8? That&apos;s the trillion-dollar question. Have lessons been learned in the City? Can the culture truly be said to have changed? Can we trust the new system of regulation? Some insiders argue that there are encouraging signs of a cultural shift, but plenty of others are sceptical. My most worrying encounter is with a derivatives trader who trades interest rate futures. He insists behaviour is as bad as ever, supervision as lax and, with increasingly high-frequency trading, the market even more unstable than it was in 2007-8.  \u201cThere is no morality in the City,\u201d he tells me. \u201cThere is no justice, no law, it&apos;s ruled by Billy the Quid, it&apos;s a free-for-all. There are fewer colourful bankers hanging out in chatrooms calling themselves &apos;the Cartel&apos; these days. Now it&apos;s mathematicians and computer scientists programming algorithms from the Czech Republic. The Financial Conduct Authority no longer have any control over these foreign-based hedge funds.\u201d The trader says misbehaviour is endemic. \u201cIf you&apos;re in an environment where misbehaviour is taking place, it&apos;s accepted. For example, with Libor if you were there you would have to have done it. If you didn&apos;t do it, they [your employer] would have said &apos;What&apos;s your fucking problem? Out.&apos; You&apos;d have been fired. There is an ongoing manipulation of interest rate futures on a scale much larger than Libor. We all know it&apos;s going on, we see it every day, we&apos;ve reported it and it&apos;s been brushed under the carpet.\u201d He claims algorithms and trading from overseas make rigging easier, the regulators are weak, and the exchanges are primarily interested in the volume of trading. The picture he paints is nightmarish. Luyendijk is convinced that the steps taken so far in terms of regulation and reining in bonuses are a charade. He argues that both banking and politics are run by mutually supportive cartels, and that the status quo is inherently unstable. I ask him for his prescription. He replies with a counter-question. \u201cCan you have global finance without global government? And if you don&apos;t want global government, what do you do about global finance?\u201d He says the banks are so large and powerful that they have co-opted politicians and academics, and despite the shock to the system in 2007-8 have now reverted to global business as usual. \u201cThe way the economics profession have washed their hands of all this is quite astonishing,\u201d he says. \u201cOn the global issue I don&apos;t have a solution. I really don&apos;t know whether you can have global finance without global government, and I don&apos;t want global government. But various steps [worth taking] would be that credit rating agencies should not be paid by the banks they rate, and accountancy firms should not make lots of money through consultancy to banks whose books they audit. It&apos;s deeply incestuous.\u201d Savouri says the conflicts and overlaps will get worse, as accountancy and legal firms, eyeing the investment banks&apos; fat fees in merger deals, start to develop banking arms of their own. He may not be nostalgic for the ordered pre-big bang City, but he doesn&apos;t seem too enamoured of the chaotic of the one that has emerged since, though he does say that, with so much misinformation and mismanagement, a hedge fund which knows what it&apos;s doing and can sort through the rubbish can find that edge which everyone in the City is pursuing. Luyendijk rejects the whole system \u2013 a tempting, if impractical, position. Lobby group CityUK \u2013 another organisation that was reluctant to grant me an interview \u2013 likes to point out that financial services account for 8% of UK GDP and almost 12% of tax revenues. It also claims almost 2 million people work in finance and associated professional services, though that figure is largely meaningless as it will include large numbers of lowly paid workers in high street banks \u2013 not really part of the City by any proper definition. Justin sees high street banks as corner-shop operations compared with the investment banking titans. A more relevant figure might be that the old City and Canary Wharf each has around 45,000 fully fledged bankers. But even allowing for CityUK&apos;s inflation of the real figures, this is not a sector that can be dismantled without taking the UK economy down with it. Reform and some degree of disaster-proofing seem the only answer. My three dinner companions are, however, doubtful whether that can be achieved. \u201cYou always solve the problems that you don&apos;t have any more when you try to do these things,\u201d says the lawyer. \u201cWe&apos;re just bolting the stable after the horse has gone,\u201d says the analyst. \u201cGreater regulation won&apos;t future-proof the industry. It just pushes up the cost of doing business.\u201d So what should have happened, I ask him? \u201cWe should have sent more people to jail. Not enough senior people were put to the sword.\u201d \u201cAnd more banks should have been allowed to go bust,\u201d chimes in the accountant. \u201cI&apos;d have let them all go, personally.\u201d Andrew Hilton, the affable director of the Centre for the Study of Financial Innovation, takes a similar line, arguing that moral hazard is the only way to ensure the operation of a free market. Hilton says the answer is to have less regulation rather than more, and to let the failures go to the wall. \u201cBig banks like regulation,\u201d he explains. \u201cRegulation is a fixed cost, so the bigger you are, the more clout you have to amortise [spread] it over. It favours the big over the small, and is another row of bricks in the wall that keeps competition out. You may complain like hell about it, but in the end you like it because it preserves your oligopolistic position. There isn&apos;t a single regulator in the world who has ever advanced his or her career by letting a bank go broke, so the answer to every problem for a regulator is a regulation, like a carpenter and a nail. So you have an ineluctable tendency for regulators to regulate more and more, and for banks to get bigger and bigger. We&apos;re in a cul de sac, and heading for gridlock in the financial system.\u201d Hilton welcomes the growth of hedge funds and what he calls the \u201cshadow banking\u201d sector because the institutions are smaller, more flexible, less closely regulated and can be allowed to go under. \u201cThey may be very loathsome people,\u201d he says, \u201cand I&apos;d want to count my fingers after I&apos;d shaken hands with some of them, but the model is good because these guys have their own money at risk and they&apos;re not too big too fail.\u201d Hilton hopes this shadow banking sector will grow \u2013 though not so much that the institutions in it start to pose their own systemic risk \u2013 and also believes peer-to-peer lending will expand, with internet marketplaces matching entrepreneurs and private investors. Everyone, except Justin the investment banker who blames two uppity Scottish banks, recognises that, in the years leading up to 2007-8, thinking in the City was suicidally short-termist. \u201cThere was so much emphasis on what you delivered this year,\u201d says one City insider. \u201cI can remember times when bosses in banks and hedge funds would turn around and say, \u2018You&apos;re just not performing well enough this year. If you&apos;re not performing by the end of the year, you&apos;re fired.\u2019 Some guy would come through and make a load of money and he&apos;d be hailed as the new star trader, but it was just that he was on the right side of whatever wave was striking the markets that year. I&apos;ve seen a number of people do really well one year and then do terribly the next year, but because of the asymmetric nature of the bonuses you might get a million euros one year and nothing the next, but you&apos;ve still got 500,000 euros a year.\u201d James Barty, strategy director at the British Bankers&apos; Association, insists the City is now being more rational about remuneration. \u201cSalaries have gone up, and bonuses [the analyst at dinner insisted on calling them \u2018variable pay\u2019] have been deferred.\u201d You can take some of the bonus, but the rest is kept back in case you perform poorly in subsequent years. If you &quot;blow up&quot;, to use the argot of the City, your anticipated bonus will not be paid, or it will be much reduced. In theory, it reduces risk-taking, makes traders take a more long-term view, and is also a way of ensuring loyalty among staff. \u201cIt changes behaviour,\u201d says Barty. \u201cIf you say, \u2018I got a really good bonus last year, but I&apos;m either going to get zero or possibly get fired this year if I don&apos;t make enough money,\u2019 you&apos;re incentivised to roll the dice because you&apos;ll think, \u2018If I lose \u20ac5m I&apos;ll get fired and if I lose \u20ac10m I&apos;ll get fired.\u2019 But if you say to somebody, \u2018OK, you made \u20ac20m last year, you&apos;re down \u20ac5m this year, we&apos;re going to claw back a little bit of your bonus but if you go to down \u20ac20m we&apos;re going to claw back everything,\u2019 it changes people&apos;s behaviour, and that&apos;s a very healthy thing to happen.\u201d     A worker walks away from the Canary Wharf office of Lehman Brothers on 15 September 2008 when the 158-year-old Wall Street firm sought bankruptcy protection. Photograph: Andrew Winning/Reuters    Regulatory failures The other key contributor to the crash was the failure of the new system of regulation set up by the Labour government. \u201cThe regulators didn&apos;t do their job properly,\u201d says one former hedge fund manager. \u201cThe Bank of England got away with murder, Mervyn King [the then governor] in particular. There is some evidence that the Bank of England saw some of the problems coming, but if it saw some of the problems coming why did it not say to RBS when it was going to buy ABN Amro [the Dutch bank which helped bring RBS down], \u2018You are our biggest bank, we&apos;re worried about the stability of the financial system, we cannot allow you to take an acquisition like this, which is going to leverage you up so much that you will put the UK economy at risk\u2019? \u201cA whole bunch of us in the City in 2007 were saying, \u2018Why is RBS still trying to buy ABN Amro?\u2019 because everyone knew that ABN Amro was probably the worst and most leveraged bank in Europe, with lots of horrible stuff on its balance sheet. RBS should either not have been allowed to buy it, or the regulators should have insisted they raise equity to buy it. They were allowed to fund the acquisition with debt, which is why RBS had so little equity to absorb the losses. That should never have been allowed to happen.\u201d The Financial Services Authority carried the can for the regulatory failures, and has now been replaced by two regulators (which are costing \u00a3128m a year more to run than the FSA, according to recent figures). The Prudential Regulation Authority, which operates under the Bank of England&apos;s umbrella, is responsible for the financial health of the banks, building societies, insurers and investment companies. The Financial Conduct Authority concentrates on the way they behave and how they treat their customers. Critics of the quality of regulators say they have difficulty dealing on equal terms with highly paid City professionals. There is also a risk that staff, who tend to earn a lot less than the people they are supposed to be regulating, will be poached, especially at a time when in-house compliance officers are multiplying. This need to show they can compete on level terms may be why the FCA&apos;s office in Canary Wharf is so imposing. The reception area is vast, and the scanners and TVs make it feel like an airport. The reception staff are efficient and keep calling me by my first name. There is a sense that the new organisation is trying very hard. I am here to meet Clive Adamson, the FCA&apos;s director of supervision. Like many at the FCA, he used to work at the FSA, but that was then. This is year zero in bank regulation terms \u2013 a fresh beginning. \u201cA real breakdown in trust has occurred,\u201d he says, \u201cand we have to restore that trust.\u201d He accepts the regulators were, as the cliche has it, \u2018&quot;asleep at the wheel&quot;. \u201cThere was so much froth in the financial system that we didn&apos;t spot where the froth was leading too. Financial engineering, over-leverage, a lack of capital in the system, no real liquidity, banks taking on too much risk. While everything looked good, it looked good, and nobody really spotted the elephant in the room. In the UK it was unclear who was really responsible [for the well-being of the system], the central bank or the regulator, and because the regulator was too over-stretched and had too broad a remit, it was insufficiently focused on those issues.\u201d Can we now be confident the regulator is awake at the wheel and knows an elephant when it lumbers into the boardroom? \u201cThere have been several key changes,\u201d says Adamson. \u201cThe regulator has been split into two. The PRA looks at individual firms&apos; financial robustness and works out if they fail, how would they fail? The Bank of England&apos;s financial policy committee looks at the system as a whole. And the FCA has a very clear remit about consumer protection, market integrity and competition, which is all about making markets work well for the benefit of consumers. By splitting it in that way, we can be much more focused. \u201cThe other key thing that&apos;s changed is that we now put the interests of the consumer at the heart of what we do. Historically, we focused more on firms, but now we are focused on the consumer. Thirdly, we&apos;ve changed culturally. We are much more forward-looking and pre-emptive now, and want to act quicker when we see things. We don&apos;t always want to be fighting the last battle. Conduct regulation tends to be very reactive, dealing with things when they&apos;ve happened and trying to clear the mess up, as opposed to asking what the next mess is going to be and trying to stop it before it happens. That in essence is what we are now trying to do, and it&apos;s very difficult.\u201d The light-touch regulation beloved of the Blair-Brown governments has now been abandoned, but Andrew Hilton at the CSFI will be pleased to hear that Adamson is wary of going too far. \u201cIt&apos;s a real issue how to get the balance right,\u201d he admits, \u201cbecause what we don&apos;t want to do is to be so intrusive that we stop markets developing. That&apos;s partly why we have a competition objective \u2013 to make markets work better.\u201d He says the stability of the financial system can never be guaranteed. \u201cYou can&apos;t disaster-proof. What we can do is reduce the risk of something going wrong. We can&apos;t eliminate the risk. And if we did try to eliminate the risk with ever tougher regulation, by for example prudentially demanding more and more capital and from a conduct perspective being much more prescriptive on products, the costs would be too high.\u201d I ask Adamson whether he believes the culture in the City has changed since the crash. \u201cI think it&apos;s changing,\u201d he says after a moment&apos;s hesitation. \u201cThat&apos;s the biggest issue of all \u2013 to change both the corporate culture and individual attitudes. In our experience when bad things have happened, whether it&apos;s financial problems or big conduct issues like PPI [payment protection insurance], in virtually all cases there&apos;s an aspect of the culture in the firm that&apos;s wrong. Either the incentive system is wrong, or the people at the top didn&apos;t know what was happening. So we think very strongly that in order for less bad things to happen in the future, the culture and behaviour in the firms have to support doing the right thing, and that&apos;s difficult to change.\u201d     Workers in the Canary Wharf business district. Photograph: Eddie Keogh/Reuters    Towards an ethical City In 2010, the lobby group CityUK brought together 21 young professionals from banking, asset management, accountancy, insurance and the law to write a manifesto for the future of the City. Called Next Generation Vision, its conclusions were eminently sensible. Its mantra was that financial services should be \u201ca part of society, not apart from society\u201d \u2013 Venice needed to engage with Mestre.  The document produced by the 21 called for \u201ca standardised, formalised moral code to encompass the industry as a whole\u201d; \u201cremuneration based on the long-term value created\u201d; greater transparency and accountability in an effort to regain trust; and \u201can independently audited annual report assessing the wide-ranging aspects of the contribution of our industry to society\u201d. It also called for industry to \u201cwork with the appropriate education experts and bodies to establish an enhanced programme of lifelong financial education and assistance, embedded into our school curriculum and beyond\u201d. All laudable aims that, if acted on, could transform the relationship of the City and wider society, which at the moment, if it can be said to exist at all, is a combustible mixture of incomprehension, envy and loathing. I have breakfast with Alan Mak, a 30-year-old corporate lawyer turned private investor who was one of the co-authors of the Next Generation Vision, and ask him why he got involved. \u201cIt&apos;s about generation Y, the next generation of leaders in the City, setting out a vision for what they think it should be like in 10 to 15 years,\u201d he tells me. \u201cIt&apos;s not a minute blueprint of everything that should happen; it&apos;s more a vision of how things should be: an ethical marketplace that is tied to society; a sector that should be successful but should also help businesses, communities and families.\u201d Mak&apos;s background has shaped his proselytising mission. His parents were Hong Kong Chinese who came to the UK in the 1960s, and he grew up in Yorkshire. They were poor but very ambitious for their son, who studied law at Cambridge and joined a big City law firm, which nominated him for the Next Generation Vision project. He is also a Christian, and the combination of his religion and the deprivation he experienced as a child gives him a strong moralising mission. \u201cThe City has to be successful \u2013 it employs hundreds of thousands of people, provides the finance for hundreds of thousands of businesses, and keeps food on the table for hundreds of thousands of families \u2013 but those who are successful in it have a duty to use that success to benefit others. There was a sense in the crash that certain parts of the sector had become detached from wider society.\u201d He also emphasises that the City is unique among industries in that it is systemic. It has the power to take every other business down with it, so unethical activity in the City poses society-wide dangers. In a lecture at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral to mark the publication of his biography of the great financier Siegmund Warburg in 2010, the historian Niall Ferguson spelt out the need for an ethical reawakening in the City. \u201cThe real lesson of history is that regulation alone is not the key to financial stability,\u201d he said. \u201cIndeed, over-complicated regulation can be the disease it purports to cure, by encouraging a culture of box-ticking \u2018compliance\u2019 rather than individual moral judgment ... What is more important is to instil in financial professionals the kind of ethical framework that was the basis of Siegmund Warburg&apos;s life and work. \u2018Success from the financial and from the prestige point of view is not enough,\u2019 Warburg told his fellow directors in 1959. \u2018What matters even more is constructive achievement and adherence to high moral and aesthetic standards in the way in which we do our work.\u2019\u201d Warburg, the king of the old City, died in 1982, just as the new anything-goes culture was about to destroy it. Take a short walk down Cheapside from the Bank of England and you come to St Paul&apos;s Cathedral. In the City, God and mammon are intimately connected. On virtually every street corner, there&apos;s a gorgeous church designed by Christopher Wren to fill the gaps after the great fire of 1666, which destroyed the medieval city. Goldman Sachs chief executive Lloyd Blankfein once claimed he and his fellow bankers were \u201cdoing God&apos;s work\u201d, and, judging by the way banks and churches sit cheek by jowl, the City seems to take the same view. St Paul&apos;s has its own chinese wall, with contentious political and economic issues dealt with by the St Paul&apos;s Institute, which, according to its website, exists \u201cto engage the financial world with questions of morality and ethics\u201d. Until 2011 it was run by Canon Giles Fraser (now a parish priest in south London and a Guardian columnist), but he resigned in October of that year because he disagreed with the cathedral&apos;s decision to evict the Occupy protesters camped all round the great church. \u201cI would have wanted to negotiate down the size of the camp and to have appealed to people to help us keep the cathedral going,\u201d Fraser said at the time, \u201cand if that meant that I was thereby granting them some legal right to stay then that is the position that I would have to wear.\u201d     Occupy London demonstrators outside St Paul's Cathedral in 2011. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    Since Fraser&apos;s resignation, the institute has been overseen by Peter Selby, the former bishop of Worcester and author of Grace and Mortgage: The Language of Faith and the Debt of the World, though a new full-time director will be appointed later this year. Selby is a thoughtful, articulate 72-year-old with a wonderfully sonorous episcopal voice, and all through our conversation at the cathedral, I feel he wants to be more radical in his prescriptions for remaking the City than the institute&apos;s rules of engagement allow him to be. Selby tells me the institute surveyed financial professionals in the City, and that he was struck by the apparently contradictory findings the survey threw up. \u201cIt goes to the heart of many of the questions you are raising,\u201d he says. \u201cTwo thirds of the people that were surveyed said financial-sector professionals were overpaid, and two thirds of them also said they were in it for the money. If you draw a Venn diagram, you can see that there are a significant number of people who are in it for the money and feel the profession is overpaid, which I think is the kind of conscientious difficulty that the church ought to be sticking a crowbar into and prising open.\u201d The conflicted nature of the respondents to the survey may be another aspect of the self-delusion that Luyendijk pinpoints as a feature of City life. The bishop highlights another feature of the survey. \u201cMore than half of them said the big bang had contributed to a decline in ethical standards. Given the almost universal acceptance at the time of the necessity of deregulation, that&apos;s also an intriguing area in which we need to insert ourselves. How can a huge community of people say that the work [they do] is absolutely necessary and wrong?\u201d So what needs to change? \u201cThe prescriptions are very hotly debated,\u201d says Selby, \u201cand most of them in my view don&apos;t go to the heart of the matter. The real question is how far the City is connected with and deeply committed to the real economy of people&apos;s actual work. The difference between the virtual and the real economy is another crucial area in which we need to work. The virtual economy is entirely about numbers and money, and that&apos;s what led us to the abyss.\u201d I ask him how Jesus would have dealt with the City. I don&apos;t get a direct response to this question, but there&apos;s not much doubt Selby would want to take a hard line with the moneylenders. \u201cWe have to say to certain people, \u2018What you just said doesn&apos;t tally with what you just did. And this is not being said to you because we want to condemn you personally. It&apos;s the system that is leading you into these contradictions.\u2019\u201d A few days before coming to St Paul&apos;s, I had met a leading figure from a Christian charity who recalled having lunch with a banker friend high up in the executive dining room of a City office. \u201cWe are buying that company tomorrow,\u201d the banker had told him, pointing to a building far below, \u201cand most of the staff will have to be sacked.\u201d \u201cThat&apos;s terrible,\u201d the man from the charity said to his friend. \u201cWhy are you doing that?\u201d \u201cIt&apos;s the will of the bank,\u201d said the banker. The charity man told me he had tried to unpick what that phrase meant, and had found it impossible to discover who had made the decision. The bank had become an impersonal entity, almost literally with a will of its own. The story and the phrase had stayed with me, and I put it to Selby that this was crucial to the dehumanised way in which the City tended to operate. He cites Vince Cable&apos;s recent criticism of the bankers for saying they feel they have to earn multimillion-pound salaries because all their peers in other banks do \u2013 a feeble reason, Selby (and indeed Cable) thinks. Selby&apos;s colleague, Canon Mark Oakley, who has overall responsibility for the institute and has joined our meeting, makes a wider point: \u201cThat picture you describe says so much about the anger of a lot of people. Money represents a huge source of power that is seemingly out of democratic control, and that gets us nervous. But if something is out of democratic control in a democracy, it&apos;s a political problem.\u201d \u201cIt&apos;s worse than that,\u201d adds Selby. \u201cIt&apos;s not only out of control. It&apos;s in control of the things it should be being controlled by.\u201d Oakley is right: only the politicians can really get to grips with the City and decide what part it should play in our national life. But do they have the will to do so? The Vickers and Tyrie commissions, set up in the wake of the crash to look at both the way banks operated and the culture within them, have made a series of sensible suggestions \u2013 dividing investment banking from retail banking; making bank executives personally responsible for scandals such as Libor; deferring bonuses; protecting whistleblowers \u2013 but there has no fundamental questioning of the role of the City in our lives, and we are now more or less back to business as usual. As David Kynaston points out, the City scandals of the 1870s produced a royal commission; why wasn&apos;t there one this time? Many of the people who work there deny it, but the City does feel like a separate, self-contained world, protecting its age-old rights, wary of intruders. The Occupy activists told me that, when I visited the Mansion House to meet the lord mayor, I should look at the stained-glass window in the dining room where the chancellor makes his annual speech. It shows Wat Tyler, leader of the Peasant&apos;s Revolt in 1381, being slain by the then lord mayor, William Walworth. One doesn&apos;t necessarily want to take sides in that 600-year-old battle between property and privilege, but I did wonder if replacing it might be one symbolic way for the City to mark a fresh beginning in its relationship with the peasants who exist outside its gilded world. \u2022 Stephen Moss on why Russians are obsessed with London", "title": "Special report: an outsider\u2019s guide to the City of London", "sentences": ["It feels as if it could be anywhere in the world \u2013 Dubai, Singapore, Shanghai."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-27T08:37:55Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/may/28/serco-contract-caledonian-sleeper-service", "tags": ["Serco", "Rail transport", "Scotland", "Transport", "UK news", "Business"], "article": "Serco, the company that has been dogged by scandals from overcharging for prisoner tagging to allegations of sexual assault at an immigration detention centre, has been given the contract to run sleeper trains between London and the Highlands of Scotland. Scottish transport minister Keith Brown said Serco&apos;s bid for the franchise to run the much-loved Caledonian sleeper service from April next year &quot;reflected the Scottish government&apos;s objectives to transform this iconic Scottish rail service&quot;. The huge outsourcing firm, which runs luxury train services in Australia , landed the deal with a promise to create hotel-style cabins with en suite bathrooms, as well as a top-notch dining service serving Scottish produce. The RMT rail union said Serco was &quot;a company with a truly shocking track record in the delivery of public services&quot; and should never have been considered to run the service. Serco estimates that it will earn \u00a3800m from the 15-year deal, including \u00a3180m from franchise payments. The contract is a fillip for the outsourcing group, which has been dogged by scandals. It faces an investigation by MPs after it was forced this month to disclose a secret internal report revealing evidence that it failed to properly investigate a claim of repeated sexual assaults by one of its staff against a female resident at Yarl&apos;s Wood immigration detention centre. MPs on the public accounts committee had previously published a scathing report on its &quot;substandard&quot; GP out-of-hours service in Cornwall and it is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office over tagging of prisoners. Serco&apos;s running of the NorthLink ferry service, connecting the Orkney and Shetland Islands to the mainland, has also come under fire after engine failure led to a temporary suspension of the &quot;lifeline&quot; service last year. The decision is a blow to its rival bidder, the Aberdeen-based First Group, which operates the service as part of a bigger contract to run ScotRail. Arriva also lost out to run the sleeper on the sleeper contract. The Scottish government decided to split the sleeper contract from the main ScotRail franchise after a recent review of transport policy. More than \u00a3100m will be spent on 72 &quot;state-of-the-art&quot; carriages for four trains, which will come on track in the summer of 2018. About \u00a360m will come from the Scottish government, which has promised trains that are &quot;emblematic of Scotland&quot;. Serco said it would be spending about \u00a340m on trains under the terms of the franchise agreement. Serco chief executive Rupert Soames has been an outspoken critic of Scottish independence in his previous role at Aggreko, but the company said it has no plans to invoke the seven-year break clause in the event of a &quot;yes&quot; vote in September. The company said it had no plans to cut staff, while unions vowed &quot;fierce resistance&quot; in the event of threats to jobs and conditions. The sleeper service has seen a resurgence in popularity in recent years, with 270,000 passengers a year taking the train, that links London, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Fort William, Inverness and Aberdeen. Serco, which employs 120,000 people in more than 30 countries, has a vast transport business: it runs the Docklands Light Railway and the &quot;Boris&quot; bikes hire scheme in London and holds Britain&apos;s largest passenger rail franchise with Northern Rail in partnership with the Dutch company Abellio. Beyond the UK, it operates the Dubai metro system, as well as railway routes in India and Australia. The RMT rail union said it was deeply concerned about the decision to award the franchise to Serco. &quot;Quite frankly, with their appalling list of failures in the UK and globally they should never have even been considered as contenders for the Scottish sleeper service. The logical option of public ownership was not even looked at,&quot; said the RMT&apos;s acting general secretary Mick Cash. Manuel Cortes of the TSSA union said: &quot;This decision flies in the face of everything Alex Salmond has been saying about an independent, financially strong Scotland. He has taken the contract away from a Scots firm and handed it to an English based firm which will be given a \u00a360m subsidy to build new trains in Spain.&quot; Soames, who took up his post this month, said: &quot;I am delighted that we can use this unique blend of expertise to transform the iconic Caledonian sleeper into a modern, high-quality hospitality service to make Scotland proud. Serco has a very constructive relationship with many parts of Scottish government and already operates essential public transport and many other services.&quot; First Group said the sleeper service accounted for just 2% of First ScotRail&apos;s annual revenues and its medium-term targets were unchanged. It added that it was shortlisted for a number of other rail franchises with the aim of maintaining its earnings. The company found out last week it had lost out in the bid to run the Thameslink rail link, one of the UK&apos;s busiest commuter routes. &quot;We will continue to provide sleeper passengers with the best possible service until the new franchise commences, and will work closely with the new operator to ensure a seamless handover,&quot; said the First Group chief executive, Tim O&apos;Toole.

He said he hoped to &quot;open the doors for great British designer collections to be showcased here&quot;. Resort, cruise or pre-collection (all are essentially the same thing, a collection between the main autumn/winter and spring/summer shows) are becoming increasingly important in the fashion calendarand are now beginning to compete with the main shows for attention and industry standing.     Roland Mouret Resort 2015    Naturally the clothes shown by Mouret emitted the body-conscious, restrained glamour that we expect from the Mouret house. This time there was, in the words of the designer, a &quot;south of France-slash-London&quot; flavour to the collection, with folded scarfdetails at waistbands, cropped tops and capri pants reprised in fluoro peach and aqua; zips and structure realism meets Riviera optimism. The standout piece was a monochrome jumpsuit with Mouret&apos;s trademark bandage structure providing the back view. They were clothes which you can imagine hanging in the plush carpeted changing rooms of the Mayfair store, which is, of course, exactly the point; these clothes will account for 70 per cent of Mouret&apos;s retail sales and represent the commercial point of view of the brand. It isn&apos;t really the trends that matter here (although they will become actual street style if your street is Bond Street, you favour a sleek silhouette, and your credit card is platinum) it&apos;s more the fact that showing a resort or cruise collection on a catwalk has become a trend in itself, a trend that London is now part of. It isn&apos;t a move that all designers are enamoured with. Tom Ford told style.com earlier this week that cruise catwalk shows missed the point. &quot;The fact that cruise is now shown with these giant productions means it&apos;s no longer what it was supposed to be, which was clothes that were maybe not strong enough to show but were your real bread and butter; the clothes that women wanted to wear. But now that they&apos;re being shown, they&apos;ll have to be amped up, and women won&apos;t want to wear them any more,&quot; he said.     Roland Mouret Resort 2015    However Mouret&apos;s resort show, with its downplayed salon-like atmosphere, was without pretension. He admitted that pre-collections are &quot;what makes my company exist because they are relevant in my customers&apos; wardrobes&quot;. The designer also pointed out that for him this trend within the industry of spotlighting resort is reminiscent of the moment when Yves Saint Laurent moved from showing only couture to showing ready to wear as well in the 1960s. &quot;It&apos;s that same transition. The ready to wear shows are more the image of the designer in terms of craft and mentality and the pre-collections are what we are living with.&quot;", "title": "Roland Mouret brings pre-collections trend to London with resort show", "sentences": ["While other designers have chosen to present their pre-collections at strategic international points on the retail map \u2013 Chanel in Dubai, C\u00e9line in Beijing and Louis Vuitton in Monaco \u2013 Mouret became the first designer to show his commercial collection in London to a small group of editors and buyers, and he hopes others will follow suit in the coming seasons."], "publicationDate": "2014-05-29T16:51:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/may/31/confused-pension-options-retiring-abroad", "tags": ["Retirement planning", "Pensions", "Tax", "Savings", "Isas", "Family finances", "Money", "Annuities"], "article": "It sounds a brilliant wheeze: if you take all your pension pot at retirement under the new freedoms that come into force next April, the tax bill could be massive, with HMRC pocketing 45% of everything over \u00a3150,000; but what if you hop off to some sunny, low-tax location such as Gibraltar, Cyprus or even Australia, transfer the pension money over to the new country, and draw it down there, avoiding almost all the tax in the UK? Pop back a year later, and you&apos;ll have managed to take your pension pot almost tax-free, or so the story goes. It&apos;s an idea that has been doing the rounds in the online comment section below our recent stories on the new pension freedoms. Trouble is, it&apos;s not anywhere near as easy as people make out. The Gibraltar/Dubai tax-free option If you take your pension in Gibraltar, the tax rate is just 2.5%. In Dubai it is zero. So if you have a \u00a3500,000 pension pot, and exercise your new right to withdraw the lot, the tax saving could be more than \u00a3150,000. But there&apos;s no chance that HMRC will let you transfer your money out there and take it tax-free if you have any plans on coming back to the UK soon. Mike Warburton, tax director at accountants Grant Thornton says: &quot;This would be caught by the temporary non-resident rules.&quot; This means that you will be charged the full amount of tax if you return to live in the UK at any time within the following five years. You will also have to establish residency in your offshore tax haven. What&apos;s more, you will have to decide what to do with your money when you are there \u2013 and the quality and security of local financial services firms and banks may not be entirely robust. The Australian option \u2013 if you&apos;re rich If you are very wealthy, Australia and New Zealand present an interesting opportunity. In Britain you obtain tax relief on the money you pay into a pension scheme when working, but at retirement the income you take is taxed in the normal way. In Australia, there are no tax advantages when putting money into a pension, but it&apos;s free of tax when you take it out. So if Britons retire to Adelaide, take their pension pots with them and draw them out there, they can almost completely avoid tax. There are, however, some catches. As Paul Davies of advisers GlobalQrops.com says, you have to transfer your money to an HMRC-approved qualifying recognised overseas pension scheme (Qrops), then wait five years before you can take the full amount tax-free \u2013 although that might change next year. But the big drawback is that to get into Australia, the main avenue is the investor retirement visa, which obliges you to bring in assets of at least A$750,000 (\u00a3411,000), invest A$500,000 (\u00a3274,000) and prove a separate minimum income of A$65,000 (\u00a335,700) a year. What happens if I retire to Spain? If you&apos;ve qualified for your state pension, it will be paid (and taxed) in Spain, but uprated every year in the same way as the UK. Note that the personal tax allowance in Spain is \u20ac6,069 (\u00a34,923) compared with \u00a310,000 in the UK. The basic rate of tax is also higher, at around 24% compared to 20% in the UK. And in Spain there is no 25% tax free lump sum available when retiring, and any Isas you have in the UK will be liable for tax if you become resident in Spain. But Andrew Oliver, of deVere financial advisers, says that if the pension money is transferred to a Qrops, there are ways to cut the subsequent tax bill to as little as 3% to 8% by drawing down the income through temporary annuities and bond investments \u2013 although there are costs to having the money in one of these plans. There&apos;s also an equivalent to Isas in Spain which, though not as generous, do offer tax advantages.", "title": "Confused about your pension?

In his summing-up of the case, which is now in its 126th day, Mr Justice Saunders told jurors that &quot;everyone is entitled to their privacy&quot; and not to have their phones hacked. He said the jury should not to be &quot;dazzled&quot; by the fact that some of the defendants, which include former News of the World editors Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson, were friends of politicians and stars and were in positions of influence. The jury already knows that Brooks received advice from Tony Blair at the height of the phone-hacking scandal. &quot;Some of those on trial enjoyed a lifestyle you can only dream of, not just in financial terms but influence they brought to bear,&quot; Saunders said. &quot;They were friends of politicians, they are friends of the stars. Many people only get to see them in the cinema or the football pitch. &quot;You do not envy them their success or be dazzled by it. &quot;Respect their success but everyone is subject to the law of the land \u2013 no one is so powerful they can ignore the law.&quot; Saunders gave detailed directions to the jurors on how they should consider each count against the seven defendants and addressed allegations by the prosecution that some defendants may have lied or withheld evidence during police interviews that they later relied on court. He told jurors that Brooks was being tried on a number of different bases, one of which was that at the very latest she must have known that Milly Dowler&apos;s phone was hacked was April 2002 when she returned from holiday. She was editor of the News of the World at the time, but was away in Dubai the week it carried a story which contained references to the missing school girls voicemails. The paper was edited by her deputy, Coulson, who the judge reminded jurors had said he hadn&apos;t rated the Dowler story and had moved it back in the paper between editions. Saunders said if the jury was &quot;sure&quot; that the prosecution&apos;s allegation that Brooks would have learned about the Dowler story, and therefore the hacking, on her return from Dubai, it was entitled to conclude &quot;that Rebekah Brooks has lied in her evidence given on oath as she said she did not know phone hacking of Milly Dowler&apos;s voicemails until revealed by the Guardian on 4 July 2011&quot;. Saunders continued: &quot;Mrs Brooks denied telling any lies about Milly Dowler in her evidence. &quot;You will have to decide about whether she has lied to you about when she became aware of the hacking of Milly Dowler. &quot;If you are not sure then you do not need to consider this direction any further.&quot; Saunders told jurors it was &quot;not sufficient&quot; for the prosecution &quot;to prove that Rebakah Brooks knew about phone hacking&quot;. He told them &quot;the charge is conspiracy, the prosecution have to prove not only knowledge but that she agreed to continue after she knew about it&quot;. The judge also addressed the prosecution&apos;s assertion that Brooks&apos;s former PA Cheryl Carter had lied in a police interview, telling them that her boss was not in the office on 8 July 2011, the day she ordered seven boxes of notebooks to be removed from the News International offices. &quot;There is no doubt that she was wrong when she said that but there is an issue whether she was lying or made a mistake when she said that,&quot; Saunders said. He told jurors that &quot;sometimes people tell lies out of panic, sometimes people lie because they think it&apos;s easier that telling the truth, some tell lies if they think it can help someone else&quot;. Saunders also said that all of the defendants bar the paper&apos;s former royal editor were considered of &quot;good character&quot; and had succeeded in life &quot;no doubt through hard work and determination&quot;. The jury would have to consider if they would have thrown all of that away to commit a criminal offence, he added. He said Clive Goodman, the former royal editor of the News of the World, who is facing two charges, was not considered of good character because he had pleaded guilty to phone hacking in 2006 and jailed in 2007 for that offence. &quot;The mere fact of that conviction does not mean he is not telling the truth however,&quot; said Saunders. Saunders said the jury has to ignore the atmosphere around the case highlighted by defence barrister Jonathan Caplan QC on Monday, as well as the &quot;vitriol&quot; that has been levelled against Brooks and Coulson in particular. &quot;Mr Caplan said it is not the most serious of cases, and that may be, but how serious a crime is is irrelevant to your consideration&apos;, said the judge of the barrister representing the News of the World&apos;s former managing editor Stuart Kuttner,&quot; said Saunders. &quot;He suggested the case was politically charged and you should ignore the political charge behind this case, and of course that is right. &quot;He was saying do not be influenced by the trappings around the case and the media interest and the fact the case is at the Old Bailey.&quot; He told jurors that the trial was to have been at Southwark crown court but it could not accommodate the electronic equipment needed for the trial or the amount of paperwork the jury has to consider. And the trial was being heard by a high court judge rather than a district judge, rightly or wrongly, because it was deemed a high profile trial. Saunders pointed out details of the defendants&apos; personal lives have been raised in evidence, but had not been brought up simply for sympathy. &quot;Take no account of the vitriol levelled at Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson on Twitter and in other places,&quot; he said. &quot;You all feel sympathy for Rebekah Brooks who had to suffer that abuse, but that can&apos;t affect any verdict.&quot; He said Brooks&apos;s PA Cheryl Carter&apos;s dreams of emigrating to Australia had been shattered by the prosecution, Mark Hanna&apos;s life has been put on hold, and Stuart Kuttner has suffered ill-health throughout the trial. &quot;Mr Coulson has suffered a dramatic fall from a career progress as a high-flier, as he undoubtedly was&quot;, Saunders said. But he told the jury: &quot;None of this was attempting to court feelings of sympathy, that would be wrong. &quot;You have heard about it because it has some relevance to some aspect of the case.&quot; Turning to police interviews in which defendants choice not to answer questions on legal advice, Saunders said: &quot;You must decide, in deciding not to answer questions, was the defendant doing that because of a solicitor&apos;s advice or are they simply hiding behind that advice to justify the decision not to give an explanation at that time.&quot; And he also said the evidence of Clive Goodman and Dan Evans against Andy Coulson needed to be treated with care. Goodman, the News of the World&apos;s former royal editor, pleaded guilty to hacking in 2006 and Evans has pleaded guilty to hack as part of the current trial. &quot;It is suggested Clive Goodman had a reason of his own to implicate Mr Coulson on count one, the conspiracy to hack phones charge. &quot;He may be bitter at the way he was treated by News International, and may be trying to present his involvement in phone hacking in the best possible light. He told jurors: &quot;Bear in mind the possible reasons Mr Goodman may have to give evidence contrary to the interests of Mr Coulson.&quot; All seven defendants deny all charges against them.

Documents from the Dubai International Financial Centre have revealed the extent of the allegations against Haigh, who denies all wrongdoing despite being held in a Dubai police station for 18 days. GFHC, a subsidiary of the Bahrain-based investment bank Gulf Finance House, accuse the former Leeds managing director of fraud and embezzlement, with detailed documents alleging he fabricated at least 55 invoices to secure payments to five different bank accounts, two in Dubai and three in the UK. GFHC claims the financial invoices relate to four different companies whose representatives have presented affidavits to the Dubai court denying that they were aware of their existence or the relative bank accounts. Haigh, who has not been charged with any criminal offence, played a key role in GFHC\u2019s acquisition of Leeds from Ken Bates in December 2012. He left his role as the deputy chief executive with the bank in March and departed Leeds in April after the takeover by the businessman Massimo Cellino, who he had introduced to the club. A friend of Haigh\u2019s said: \u201cDavid has now been held in custody for 18 days, a lot of criminal allegations have been put to him but no charges whatsoever have been made. This matter which was heard yesterday [on Tuesday] is purely a civil claim and not a criminal matter and doesn\u2019t seem to warrant a man being held for 18 days. All the allegations put to David are vigorously denied.\u201d The court documents allege that false invoices were made for a number of financial projects. These included \u201cProject Bremner\u201d, \u201cProject Offside\u201d and \u201cProject Athena\u201d, the latter set up to complete due diligence on Cellino before Leeds agreed to sell a controlling 75% stake in the club to the Italian. The court documents also allege that Haigh created a number of \u201cfalse fee notes\u201d. Leeds were bought by Cellino for more than \u00a330m and were in severe financial difficulty before the \u201cKing of Corn\u201d secured the club in the face of opposition from the Football League. Under GFHC United were losing approximately \u00a31m a month and Cellino has since undertaken rigorous cost-cutting at Elland Road.

Once the 13-year-old&apos;s voicemails were listened to, they would become saved and been wiped by the system eventually, Mr Justice Saunders told the phone-hacking trial. In his second day of summing up, the judge told jurors that the claim by the Guardian in July 2011, that the messages had been deleted by the News of the World and given false hope to Milly&apos;s parents that she was still alive, was still wrong. In his summing up to jurors, the judge said: &quot;Mr Mulcaire&apos;s hacking into the phone could well have had something to do with the deletion of the voicemail. &quot;Once hacked into, it becomes a saved message to be deleted automatically. &quot;It could have led to it but couldn&apos;t have led to any false hope because the News of the World went to the police on the Saturday. &quot;The actual hacking into someone&apos;s voicemails could lead to it being deleted.&quot; However, he repeated the admission that had been given during the trial: &quot;They, the Guardian, were wrong and they have accepted it.&quot; The judge said the News of the World delayed telling police about Dowler&apos;s possible whereabouts for at least 24 hours. Evidence to the phone-hacking trial shows the paper had a message suggesting she was in Telford in the morning of Friday, April 12, but waited until the following afternoon to contact Surrey Police. He said managing editor Stuart Kuttner may have been complicit in the delay, an allegation he strenuously denies. In the second day of his summing up, the judge said: &quot;It is perfectly clear the News of the World did not inform the police straight away about the information got from the voicemail.&quot; Outlining the evidence, the judge said chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck had sent a team of reporters to follow up a lead from a voicemail that had been mistakenly been left on Dowler&apos;s phone suggesting that the schoolgirl had been contacted by a recruitment agency in Telford. Monday&apos;s Recruitment Agency was contacted by Thurlbeck on the morning of Friday, 12 April, 2002 with the paper&apos;s investigation already in full swing. However, it was 3.11pm on April 13 when Kuttner called police to reveal the hacked message which he said might assist them with their investigation. &quot;It must have been at least 24 hours after the News of the World first heard of the voicemail,&quot; said the judge. &quot;The prosecution suggest the News of the World kept the information on the voicemail to themselves in the hope of finding her in time to announce it in the newspaper. &quot;When it became clear they were not going to find Milly, it is suggested they decided they had no alternative but to contact the police. &quot;Were it to emerge at a later stage that the News of the World had information and didn&apos;t disclose it, and something happened to Milly thereafter, you may think it would have been very serious indeed for the News of the World &quot;Who made the decision and who was party to it?&quot; The judge said Kuttner, 74, was implicated in the delay by the evidence of Mark Hancox, from the recruitment firm, who said he took a call from a senior figure at the paper on the morning of Saturday, April 13. &quot;He recognised the voice of Kuttner as the man who spoke to him on the phone&quot;, he said of Mr Hancox, who was played tapes of Kuttner and others giving evidence to the Leveson Inquiry. &quot;He said the voice was very distinctive and self-assured, like one of my headteachers. &quot;He said he would never forget his voice, and immediately recognised the voice as the same one who phoned him in 2002. &quot;He said when given the name of the man on the tape, he remembers the same name \u2013 Stuart Kuttner \u2013 that he had been given in 2002. &quot;The evidence that was read to you is Stuart Kuttner must have known about the voicemail in the morning because he is ringing Mark Hancox, but didn&apos;t contact the police until the afternoon.&quot; He said Kuttner&apos;s barrister, Jonathan Caplan QC, had submitted that the former managing editor rang the police as soon as he knew about the hacked voicemail. &quot;The evidence on which that is based is he doesn&apos;t remember it but that&apos;s what he would have done&quot;, said the judge. &quot;He said if told about the voicemail, he would immediately have rung the police.&quot; The judge said the jury must decide which evidence they prefer when deciding whether Kuttner delayed contacting police. Editor Rebekah Brooks was on holiday at the time of the Milly Dowler hack, and did not return until after that week&apos;s paper being overseen by deputy editor Andy Coulson had gone to press. &quot;You will have further assess how important this story was to the News of the World in deciding whether Andy Coulson would have known about it, and known information was obtained by hacking voicemails,&quot; Saunders said. &quot;The police knew it as the News of the World told them, but did the deputy editor know? &quot;If he knew, would the information have been shared with the editor in one of the conversations she undoubtedly had while in Dubai.&quot; The judge told the jury they will have to assess evidence that Brooks said while on holiday she was taking a call about the &quot;missing Surrey schoolgirl&quot;. He also said the affair between Brooks and Coulson, as shown in the love letter she wrote to him, was &quot;clearly relevant&quot; to their decisions. Saunders said the News of the World would have incurred the wrath of press regulators and rival papers if they had revealed the hacking of Dowler&apos;s phone. Coulson claimed in his evidence that once Surrey Police had decided not to take action over the interception of the voicemails, the paper may have included its actions in the subsequent story. However, Saunders said others may have taken a dim view of their activities even if the police had not investigated. He said: &quot;Police did not take any action, and it is suggested if they knew the News of the World had accessed the voicemails but no action was taken, the article itself would have made it clear they had hacked the voicemails. &quot;Even if the police had taken no action, there might have been some interest to the Press Complaints Commission to whether there had been a breach of their code. &quot;It doesn&apos;t sound like other newspapers were very friendly about the activities of their rivals.&quot; The judge continued his summing up by looking at the evidence of some of the celebrities that were targeted by the newspaper. Former England manager Sven Goran Eriksson was in Mulcaire&apos;s notes in 2002, though there is no evidence of a hack at the time when Brooks was editor. The judge said there was &quot;clear interest&quot; in him in April 2002 over his affair with TV presenter Ulrika Jonsson, but &quot;no evidence of a story coming from phone hacking&quot;. He said the hacking took place in 2005 and 2006, and a voicemail left by Bill Kenwright for Eriksson about striker James Beattie was found in Mulcaire&apos;s house in August 2006. Saunders pointed out Coulson was involved in the buy-up of Eriksson&apos;s affair with FA secretary Faria Alam in July 2004. The judge had to stop his summing up early as one of the jurors was suffering from a migraine and was unable to continue. She was allowed to wear sunglasses in court to try to continue, but the judge opted to stop just before lunch to give her time to recover. Brooks, Kuttner and Coulson have all been charged with a conspiracy to hack phones, a charge they all deny. Brooks denies three other charges, while Coulson denies a second charge related to the alleged purchase of royal phone directories.

And now, California Chrome is less than two-and-a-half minutes away from solid-bronze immortalization alongside the greats. Having ticked off wins in the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes and with the Belmont Stakes a day away, California Chrome&apos;s chance of lifting the Triple Crown is tantalisingly within reach. The mile-and-a-half around Belmont Park\u2019s deep, stamina-sapping dirt oval, however, is a no-mans-land of tattered Triple Crown dreams. What is more, his likely opposition will test every ion of his grit and resolve. Ride on Curlin, who made striking headway down the Pimlico straight to get within one-and-a-half lengths in the Preakness, is back for more, with the added distance of the Belmont looking tailor-made for this relentless galloper. Tonalist, a late gatecrasher to the Triple Crown party and the easy winner of the Grade II Peter Pan Stakes last month, arrives as a fresh recruit to the weary ranks. Commanding Curve, the Kentucky Derby runner-up, watched the Preakness on television and turns up at New York somewhat re-energised after a five-week siesta \u2013 as do other Derby also-rans: Wicked Strong, Medal Count and Samraat. Trainer Todd Pletcher, whose Palace Malice lifted the Belmont last year, sends out a two-pronged attack with Matterhorn and Commissioner. General A Rod reappears after a good fourth in the Preakness; outsider Matuszak rounds out the field. If California Chrome succeeds, he will achieve what only 11 horses have before. Here\u2019s a look at some of the most memorable of Triple Crown victors, and some of those cruelly denied the accolades as the last swish drew the curtain closed. Affirmed (1978)           The 1978 Belmont Stakes.      Affirmed was the last horse to claim the Triple Crown, and his win in the Belmont Stakes set a high benchmark. Affirmed and his old sparring partner, Alydar, headed into the race with a whisker between them. And while Affirmed was two-for-two after the initial legs, the margins of victory were a diminishing one and a half lengths and a neck. What is more, the Belmont trip was expected to play triumphantly to Alydar\u2019s galloping strengths. The gates opened and Affirmed, with teenage wunderkind Steve Cauthen aboard, headed straight to the lead. At the top of the back stretch Alydar cruised along side the leader, and there they remained, glued at the shoulder. At the top of the home stretch, it looked as though Alydar might banish the dark memory of Churchill and Pimlico, only for Affirmed\u2019s resolve to prove unbendable.  The two greats flashed past the post, separated by a flaring of the nostril. Racing just doesn\u2019t get any better. Secretariat (1973)         The 1973 Belmont Stakes    Secretariat\u2019s Belmont win was every bit a cardiac-stopper as Affirmed\u2019s \u2013 for very different reasons. While Affirmed\u2019s victory was a dogfight to the wire, Secretariat\u2019s Belmont romp was a showcase of ruthless destruction. Initially, it looked as though the race might prove a match between Secretariat and Sham, with the two locked together for the first half-mile. By the middle of the backstretch, though, Sham was cooked quicker than a bag of microwavable rice. Jockey Ron Turcotte sat motionless on Secretariat.  By the middle of the home turn, Turcotte and Secretariat were 12 lengths clear of the chasing bunch. By the wire, they were 31 lengths clear. Secretariat produced an iconic performance that still carries with it a mythical air of disbelief. War Admiral (1937)           War Admiral wins the Triple Crown.      Man o\u2019 War is frequently ranked as the greatest American racehorse of all time, and \u201cThe Mighty Atom\u201d War Admiral was Man o\u2019 War\u2019s most accomplished son.  Like many sons of illustrious parents, War Admiral possessed a prickly ego that outsized his diminutive frame. As had become something of a character trait, War Admiral misbehaved in the gates before the Belmont, holding up the race by nine minutes (beating his previous record of eight minutes in the Kentucky Derby). Then, when finally underway, War Admiral lurched and stumbled leaving the gates, tearing off a sizable portion of hoof. No matter. War Admiral led from start to finish, passing the post a comfortable three lengths clear of the second horse home \u2013 a trail of blood behind him, in lieu of scorch marks. War Admiral is arguably more famous, however, for his defeat in a much anticipated match race with Seabiscuit \u2013 the horse California Chrome hopes to dethrone to become the quintessential folk hero of American racing. Count Fleet (1943)           Count Fleet wins the Triple Crown.    Secretariat isn\u2019t the only horse to win the Belmont by the length of swimming pools. While the second world war raged, Count Fleet entertained a battle weary nation with a string of imperious Triple Crown performances, the most stunning of which he saved for New York.  Only two competitors bothered to show up against him. Count Fleet handed them a contemptuous 25-length battering for their troubles \u2013 his last victory during an impeccable three-year-old season. Later that evening, he was found lame with a tendon injury, and he never raced again. Seattle Slew (1977)           The 1977 Belmont Stakes.    The Belmont Stakes of 1977 turned out to be an exercise in futility for Seattle Slew\u2019s luckless foes. Hitherto unbeaten and widely expected to follow up an easy victory in the Preakness Stakes, Seattle Slew didn\u2019t disappoint. On a day marred by a wretched maelstrom of torrential rain, wind and fog, Seattle Slew treated the crowd to a performance that shone gold through the gathering gloom. Jockey Jean Cruget swiftly settled Seattle Slew in the lead and there they stayed, cruising to a four-length victory. So easy was the win, Cruget had time in the final furlong to stand up in the saddle and wave to his folks back home in France. When Seattle Slew met Affirmed a year later in the Marlboro Cup, he handed his year-younger counterpart a three-length drubbing. Smarty Jones (2004)         The 2004 Belmont Stakes.      Ten years ago, Smarty Jones headed into the Belmont riding a tsunami of public support not unlike that which carries California Chrome. And like Seattle Slew, Smarty Jones was unbeaten heading into the race. Smarty Jones was fast, classy and game. But would the unchartered waters of the Belmont leave him paddling against the tide? In customary fashion, Smarty Jones broke sharply from the gates \u2013 too sharply, quickly embroiling himself in a game of tag up front, butting heads with Purge and Rock Hard Ten. Halfway along the backstretch Smarty Jones, choke out, dragged jockey Stewart Elliot to the front.  Rounding the home turn and entering the straight, he still looked to be travelling well. Elliot kicked for home, and for a good portion of the home stretch, it looked as though he might just make it. But Birdstone swooped like a vulture in the shadow of the wire, snatching the spoils of victory from the teeth of the valiant runner-up. As with Count Fleet, Smarty Jones never ran again. Real Quiet (1998)           The 1998 Belmont Stakes.    No matter how many times you watch the race, for a brief and all too fleetingly hopeful second it seems as though Real Quiet simply cannot lose the 1998 Belmont.  Then, as though woken with a cold wet flannel to the face, he does. Real Quiet wasn\u2019t the most gifted horse to grace the racetrack but what he lacked in talent was compensated for with a lion\u2019s heart and an irresistibly rich vein of form that almost carried him from the first Saturday in May through to the very last stride of the Belmont. Jockey Kent Desormeaux settled Real Quiet behind the heels of the leading bunch for much of the way. And when at the top of the home stretch the two kicked for home, it looked like goodnight and good luck New York. But wait \u2013 flying home under an inspired Gary Stevens was a horse called Victory Gallop.  On the nod, Victory Gallop\u2019s margin of victory may have been negligible, but the weight of the loss was crushing. Silver Charm (1997)           The 1997 Belmont Stakes.    One year before Real Quiet\u2019s agonising defeat, trainer Bob Baffert had another Triple Crown within finger\u2019s reach \u2013 this time with the steely suited Silver Charm.  After battling victories in the first two legs of the series, Silver Charm had proven his stomach for a fight, but what was the gas tank reading? Enough for the long journey of the Belmont? As the runners swept into the long Belmont straight, the race was narrowed to a trident of familiar foes: Touch Gold on the outside and perennial bridesmaid Free House in the middle, with Silver Charm under Gary Stevens on the inner. At the furlong marker, Silver Charm had the race in the bag. But 50 yards from home and with legs feeding on fumes, Silver Charm stalled under the irresistible surge of Touch Gold. Silver Charm would later go on to cement his status as one of the greatest horses of all time with a string of fine performances, including a victory in the Dubai World Cup.   Majestic Prince (1969)           The 1969 Belmont Stakes.    Majestic Prince\u2019s defeat may have been comprehensive in the Belmont Stakes of 1969, but the circumstances surrounding his valiant effort makes his story a sad and sorry one, and his effort that more noteworthy. In the immediate aftermath of the Preakness, trainer Johnny Longden urged caution about Majestic Prince\u2019s chances of making the Belmont \u2013 a tendon strain emerging on the evening of the race. For a while, the strain wasn\u2019t severe enough for connections to make an outright decision. Longden eventually waved the white flag, only to be overruled by owner Frank McMahon, swayed by a chorus of public disapproval at Longden\u2019s decision. This included a famous Sports Illustrated article headlined: &quot;The Prince Ducks the Big One&quot; In the Belmont, the tendon strain curbed the horse\u2019s slick brilliance and Majestic Prince was beaten five-and-a-half lengths into second by Arts and Letters \u2013 the horse he had trounced in the first two legs of the Triple Crown. Majestic Prince never raced again, but was saved for a career at stud.   Tim Tam (1958)           The 1958 Preakness Stakes.    In circumstances that foreshadowed Majestic Prince\u2019s eclipse 11 years later, the Belmont Stakes of 1958 proved an amphitheatre of cruel and bitter disappointment.  Tim Tam, a hugely popular winner of the first two legs of the Crown, went into the race with only one realistic challenger, Cavan \u2013 a horse who was something of an unknown quantity, but who enjoyed a groundswell of support surrounding his Irish connections. As the runners turned into the straight, the race was indeed theirs between them, with Cavan taking first run up the inner. Tim Tam loomed ominously on his outside, however. Down the stretch they came, with the race seemingly at Tim Tam\u2019s mercy \u2013 only for the horse to swerve left, then right.  Knowing something was amiss, Jockey Ismael Valenzuela slowed his horse to a jog. While Cavan whizzed past the post victorious, Tim Tam hobbled past the post a sorry second. He had fractured a sesamoid bone at the back of the fetlock joint, and while he was saved for a career at stud, his racing career came to an ignominious end.", "title": "California Chrome targets Triple Crown glory in the Belmont Stakes | Daniel Ross", "sentences": ["Silver Charm would later go on to cement his status as one of the greatest horses of all time with a string of fine performances, including a victory in the Dubai World Cup."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-06T12:00:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/06/pakistani-news-channel-geo-suspended-isi", "tags": ["Pakistan", "Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI)", "World news", "Media", "Television industry"], "article": "A leading TV news station which dared to criticise Pakistan&apos;s feared spy agency has been ordered off the air after a standoff which has further soured relations between the country&apos;s military and politicians. Pakistan&apos;s broadcast media regulator suspended Geo News&apos;s operating licence for 15 days and fined it \u00a360,000 for defaming the head of the military&apos;s Inter-Services Intelligence directorate (ISI), General Zaheer-ul-Islam. The channel&apos;s president, Imran Aslam, condemned the decision, saying the &quot;forces of might have prevailed&quot; in the seven-week row, which many analysts fear has cowed the private media, setting back efforts to curb army power. &quot;It seems that justice has bowed down to forces that are above the law,&quot; Aslam said. Amnesty International said it was a serious attack on press freedom in the country. &quot;It is the latest act in an organised campaign of harassment and intimidation targeting the network on account of its perceived bias against the military,&quot; Amnesty said. The row began on 19\u00a0April when Geo&apos;s coverage of an attempt to kill Hamid Mir, the channel&apos;s best-known journalist, enraged the military. Geo gave prominence to claims by Mir&apos;s brother that the ISI was behind the gun attack, which left the journalist seriously wounded. He claimed the hit had been ordered by Zaheer-ul-Islam, and the channel aired photographs and video of the otherwise little-seen spy chief. The hours of coverage, delivered in the tabloid style that made Geo the country&apos;s most watched private channel, represented an unprecedented public assault on the ISI \u2013 an institution described by critics as an all-powerful state within a state. It sparked a furious effort to close down a TV channel which in the 12 years since the start of Pakistan&apos;s electronic media boom has emerged as one of the most powerful institutions in the country. Geo picked fights with the government and felt secure enough to question core beliefs of the military establishment, including the ruthless tactics used to crush separatist rebels in Balochistan and opposition to a rapid normalisation of relations with arch-enemy India. Immediately after the attack, the military lodged a formal request to the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (Pemra) for Geo to be shut down because it had damaged an important state institution. An informal campaign against the station became increasingly serious as the weeks passed. Rightwing religious militants demonstrated in favour of the ISI, pressure was put on cable operations to drop Geo from its lineup and an incendiary claim was made that the channel had broadcast blasphemous material in a light entertainment morning show. Geo&apos;s outside broadcasting vans were attacked and vehicles used for delivering the company&apos;s newspapers were torched. Spotting an opportunity to bring down a competitor that utterly dominates Pakistan&apos;s private television market Geo&apos;s commercial rivals also joined in, attacking the company for being &quot;anti-state&quot;. Aslam said the company had been financially crippled and his staff &quot;harassed, intimidated and physically assaulted by shadowy forces&quot;. On Friday, before the Pemra announcement, the firm announced it was suing the regulator, the ISI and the army for &quot;defaming and maligning the group by accusing it of working on an anti-Pakistan agenda&quot;. It demanded compensation of more than \u00a3300m. Throughout the crisis, the group has shifted from angry defiance to efforts to defuse the row, even printing front page apologies on its newspapers. The affair has wider implications than just the future of the company, which is owned by the reclusive media mogul Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman, who micro-manages editorial decisions from his base in Dubai. The government has supported Geo in its fight with the army, with prime minister Nawaz Sharif visiting Hamid Mir in hospital after the attack.

Every jockey finds trouble here, the most devious and difficult venue for any major race. The successful riders at Epsom are the ones who can face any problem, keep their chance alive and emerge with their horse still running. No jockey in living memory has had more practice at that, both on and off the track, than Kieren Francis Fallon. Like the Reduced Shakespeare Company performing Hamlet in 60 seconds, the last 20 years of Fallon\u2019s life may be summarised by the two and a half minutes he spends making his way round Epsom in the Derby on Saturday afternoon. No jockey has steered a path to victory from the treacherous stall one on the inside of the track since Fallon himself did so 15 years ago on Oath, the first of his three Derby winners to date. If he is to repeat the trick on True Story, his partner in Saturday\u2019s Classic, there will be a series of ups, downs and abrupt twists of fortune on the way to the winning post. To succeed he will need to roll with the punches and escape from dead ends before ascending once again to the summit of his sport. Despite the many unexpected revivals in fortune which Fallon has achieved in the past, it would perhaps be the most remarkable of all. In the early days of his career Fallon hauled a fellow jockey from his horse after a minor race at Beverley and was banned from riding for six months as a result. He served another six-month ban for failing a drugs test in 2006, then stood trial on race-fixing charges at the Old Bailey in 2007. No sooner had the case against him collapsed than it emerged that Fallon faced an 18-month ban for another failed drugs test. He did not ride again until the autumn of 2008. Laced between the calamities, as if on a loom, are the threads of brilliance. He has been the champion jockey six times, won 16 British Classics and held three of the biggest jobs in the game as stable jockey to the late Sir Henry Cecil, Sir Michael Stoute and then Aidan O\u2019Brien. He won the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe 24 hours before he was due in the dock at the Old Bailey. At Epsom he has ridden seven Classic winners in 23 attempts, an exceptional strike-rate at this of all tracks. Yet he was in another trough barely six months ago, in its way the deepest and most difficult to escape. A total of 154 winners in 2011 had dwindled to 87 and then 62 in the space of two seasons. His old jobs with O\u2019Brien and Stoute were filled by a 19-year-old and a 30-year-old respectively. As he turned 49 in February, as old as Joseph O\u2019Brien and Ryan Moore put together, it seemed that his time had finally passed. Fallon suggested earlier this week that, when he went to ride a horse called Prince Bishop for the Godolphin trainer Saeed bin Suroor, he thought it could be his last mount in public. If the horse was beaten \u2013 or more likely when, since it was a 14-1 outsider \u2013 he would call it a day. But Prince Bishop won and four months later Fallon is back in the big time as the effective No1 rider to Suroor, whose string is one of the most powerful in the business. \u201cThat\u2019s what he thinks [that he would have retired] but I would have stopped him giving up,\u201d Suroor said at Epsom on Friday. \u201cI\u2019ve known Kieren for 20 years and he\u2019s one of the best jockeys in the world. If you give him the right horse, he will win with it. \u201cI wanted to support him and I want to bring him back to the top by supporting him with the best horses in my stable. He\u2019s very keen and very fit. I know he\u2019s 49 but he looks like he\u2019s in his 20s. So far he\u2019s done really well for us and I\u2019ve told him I will support him until his last day as a rider.\u201d Half a dozen years ago, when Frankie Dettori was Godolphin\u2019s No1 jockey and Fallon was still serving the second of his long drug suspensions, it would have been difficult to imagine the Irish rider ever appearing in the famous royal blue silks. A month after Prince Bishop\u2019s victory, meanwhile, Silvestre de Sousa won the Dubai World Cup, the world\u2019s richest race, on Suroor\u2019s African Story, and his status as the trainer\u2019s principal rider seemed secure. Fallon has seized his latest chance to revive his career so firmly, however, that by early May, he had effectively replaced De Sousa as the yard\u2019s No1. Fallon did all he could on Ihtimal, his first Classic ride of the meeting, in Friday\u2019s Oaks but it took him a furlong to get her to switch off and settle. Typically he got her into position to deliver a charge down the middle of the track in the home straight but Ihtimal\u2019s stamina \u2013 already under suspicion due to the number of milers in her pedigree \u2013 eventually ran out inside the final quarter-mile and she could finish only fifth. True Story\u2019s stamina should not be an issue, as he is by the stout German middle-distance performer Manduro. He is much better on a sound surface, however, and both trainer and jockey will hope that the thunderstorms forecast overnight avoid Epsom. \u201cKieren has won seven Classics at Epsom and many other races here too,\u201d Suroor said. \u201cHe knows it better than any other jockey.

That is the view of Dav Whatmore, the softly spoken, Colombo-born former Sri Lanka coach, who will always be most closely associated with the famous World Cup triumph of 1996 but also has first-hand experience of the major characters in this tour party and their ability to thrive off a siege mentality. Whatmore was in the first of his stints in charge of the Sri Lanka team at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Boxing Day 1995, when a young Muttiah Muralitharan was no-balled by the Australian umpire Darrell Hair for the first time. \u201cIt was very much a closing of the ranks,\u201d he recalled this week from Melbourne, after a peripatetic period in which he has been working in England, Scotland and Dubai in a new role as a coaching adviser with the International Cricket Council. \u201cWe supported Murali then and I believe a big effort was made when it happened again in Adelaide a few years later.\u201d Within three months of the first instance Sri Lanka beat Australia in Lahore to claim that landmark World Cup title, with Murali playing a key part. \u201cIn this case this boy Sachithra Senanayake, [the 29-year-old spinner who flicked off Jos Buttler\u2019s bails at Edgbaston a couple of days after learning that he was being investigated for the legality of his action at Lord\u2019s] he\u2019s only beginning his career. I know he\u2019s very popular within the group as a person who has got potential to become a very decent contributor for a period of time for the national team. They will support him, close ranks, draw this extra courage.\u201d Mahela Jayawardene had confirmed as much immediate after the Edgbaston controversy. \u201cOh definitely, it was a big motivating factor,\u201d the elder statesman said of the fresh questions over Senanayake\u2019s action, revealing that Sri Lanka had organised a \u201cspecial dinner\u201d for him to show their supportthe previous night. \u201cSachi is a fantastic young player in the group, very cheerful, he keeps everyone happy. We wanted to make sure he feels comfortable with us.\u201d Senanayake was never going to be a member of the Test squad, having been overtaken by Dilruwan Perera since winning his sole cap against Whatmore\u2019s Pakistan in Abu Dhabi over the New Year. But Angelo Mathews, the captain whose refusal to withdraw the Mankading appeal so infuriated Alastair Cookand the rest of the England set-up, will be there for the toss at Lord\u2019s on Thursdaycorrect morning \u2013 it will be fascinating to see how the reaction of the MCC members compares with the jeering he received in Birmingham on Tuesday night. Whatmore does not believe the 27-year-old Tamil, who became Sri Lanka\u2019s youngest Test captain when he was appointed in February 2013, will be unduly concerned. \u201cI worked with Angelo for a year with the Kolkata Knight Riders in the IPL and I\u2019d say his temperament lends itself to the captaincy,\u201d he added. \u201cYou can see already that his performances haven\u2019t suffered. I think the Sri Lankan Cricket Board were looking for a long-term proposition which is always preferable to chopping and changing.\u201d Of course Mathews will have those heavyweight lieutenants, Jayawardene and Kumar Sangakkara, behind him. Their longevity and excellence is now taken for granted but it is still startling to be reminded that Jayawardene\u2019s first Test in England came way back in 1998, when Sri Lanka were still deemed worthy of only a single match at the end of the summer and Muralitharan stunned Alec Stewart\u2019s team at The Oval. Sangakkara did not make his debut until 2000, during Whatmore\u2019s second spell with the team. \u201cIt was a one-day game against Pakistan in Galle and you could tell even then he had something,\u201d the former coach recalls. \u201cBoth Sanga and Mahela were at a stage then when they were beginning to shape their careers \u2013 they looked up to the seniors in the team then, although they were already in the process of becoming seniors themselves.\u201d This will be their fourth Test together at Lord\u2019s, where Jayawardene scored centuries in each of his first two appearances and averages over 75, and they are well aware that Sri Lanka have still to win there in six Tests stretching back to their 1984 debut. \u201cThey\u2019ll be excited, because now in this series they can be very confident of putting up a very competitive performance,\u201d Whatmore said. \u201cIn previous series over here England have had some terrific players and our memories haven\u2019t been great. I don\u2019t think this England team is as strong and the Sri Lankan boys have got some good experience.

Safely inside the air-conditioned Ritz Carlton, the International Air Transport Association was holding its annual meeting last week. On stage, it was gently pointed out to Willie Walsh, the boss of British Airways parent company IAG, that Qatar had built a whole new international airport in less time than he had spent vainly arguing for a new runway in London. That&apos;s why an increasing number of Britons have been travelling via Middle Eastern hubs on their journeys worldwide \u2013 and also being tempted to linger en route, as new resorts and attractions are built. On first descent through the haze over apparently limitless empty sand baking under 50C heat, airline passengers might wonder what inhospitable terrain awaits, but the volumes of traffic continue to grow. Three airlines now compete to pull Britons and millions of others travellers worldwide to their Middle Eastern operations: Emirates, the trailblazer and now elder statesman with its unparalleled fleet of giant aircraft in Dubai; Etihad, based in the neighbouring emirate of Abu Dhabi; and the ever more prominent Qatar Airways. As major airlines and airports take root in the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, so do the attractions that are persuading millions of visitors to use their hubs. In places where little infrastructure existed decades ago, the abundant oil wealth is being converted into global status symbols such as the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, alongside Abu Dhabi&apos;s planned Louvre and Guggenheim museums, and bespoke pitches by the sea for visiting Manchester City players. And in the latest sign of the region&apos;s surge to global prominence \u2013 and controversy \u2013 the 2022 football World Cup will see Qatar host an influx of vistors on a massive scale. If few but Fifa can see why football should go to Qatar, the logic for aviation to hold its annual shindig there was clear. In a few short years, the three Gulf hubs have moved to centre stage in the global air transport network, where Heathrow once resided. The Gulf is at the crossroads of Europe and Asia, but also tapping into the growing importance of China and Africa. Their associated airlines have not only grown rapidly but tied up the bulk of orders for the new generation of aircraft that the industry hopes will be transformative for fuel efficiency and range: Emirates has an unparalleled fleet of Airbus A380s, the supersized double-decker planes, with 48 of the 132 flying worldwide and 92 still to come. Qatar Airways was the first to operate Boeing&apos;s troubled Dreamliner into Heathrow, and will be the first airline anywhere to fly Airbus&apos;s nearest equivalent, the A350, now in its final trials. Last month it started an all-business class flight between London and Doha. Meanwhile, Etihad has picked up shareholdings in an abundance of airlines around the world. The UAE airline&apos;s stakes include holdings in Air Berlin and Aer Lingus, while it looks likely to make the maximum permitted 49% investment in the troubled Italian flag carrier, Alitalia. It is a strategy which divides opinion, as analysts question whether Etihad will ever be able to control these companies, but could potentially reap rewards should current restrictions on foreign ownership of airlines be relaxed in the future. In short, says one analyst, it is a long game only for investors with deep pockets and patience, which exactly matches the profile of the state-owned Gulf airlines. The airlines have benefited from the same kind of blank canvas that allows architects to throw up buildings or, indeed, build a new airport in the Gulf, which can receive the newest planes and has the newest infrastructure. And also, at the more cutthroat end, not having the &quot;legacy issues&quot;, as Etihad chief executive James Hogan has put it, of thousands of cabin crew on traditional contracts. The chief executive of Qatar Airways, the combative Akbar Al-Baker, has made no secret of his disregard for established rights. On an Iata stage this week, he described trade unions as &quot;a pain in the ass&quot;. For the unions&apos; part, the International Transport Workers&apos; Federation submitted a case against Qatar in Geneva this week, accusing it of violating United Nations labour conventions, for restricting female cabin crew from marriage and allowing them to be sacked if pregnant. The ITF has documented Qatar Airways practices including curfews, surveillance and dismissal. Acting general secretary Steve Cotton said: &quot;Qatar Airways already has an unenviable reputation for severe employment practices, even among industry professionals.&quot; Responding to those allegations last year, when they were first aired, a Qatar Airways spokesman said the union was &quot;making inaccurate allegations&quot;, adding: &quot;Candidates applying to work are fully aware of the rules and regulations prior to joining and it is entirely their choice whether to join our five-star airline or not.&quot; Meanwhile, Heathrow last month hurried to disassociate itself from outbursts by Al-Baker, who is a board member at the airport by virtue of the Qatar state&apos;s 20% stake in the business and had described west London residents as having &quot;excessive&quot; freedom to complain about aircraft noise. In Qatar, the new Hamad International airport was opened \u2013 at a substantially greater distance from Doha homes than Hounslow&apos;s are from Heathrow \u2013 in the nick of time for the aviation industry bash. Al-Baker denounced European contractors for the delay. If national carriers always matter to governments, the Gulf takes it to another level. Qatar Airways claims to count for 11% of the state&apos;s GDP, and is an integral part of the country&apos;s economy, with the prime minister and the Emir of Qatar both in attendance for the official opening of the Iata conference. Yet for all the lavish investment \u2013 Qatar served up lobster and a Kylie Minogue appearance to startled airline execs more used to a self-service buffet \u2013 the Middle East hubs have run up against an unexpected constraint: airspace. Qatar Airways has admitted its operations face regular delays as the region&apos;s airlines compete with military operations for slots in the air. Analysts don&apos;t believe it is an insoluble problem. But for now, there&apos;s a shred of hope for the likes of Heathrow and BA that the new global forces in aviation might face some capacity problems of their own.", "title": "Big three Gulf airlines brush aside obstacles in pursuit of dominance", "sentences": ["Three airlines now compete to pull Britons and millions of others travellers worldwide to their Middle Eastern operations: Emirates, the trailblazer and now elder statesman with its unparalleled fleet of giant aircraft in Dubai; Etihad, based in the neighbouring emirate of Abu Dhabi; and the ever more prominent Qatar Airways.", "In places where little infrastructure existed decades ago, the abundant oil wealth is being converted into global status symbols such as the Burj Khalifa skyscraper in Dubai, alongside Abu Dhabi&apos;s planned Louvre and Guggenheim museums, and bespoke pitches by the sea for visiting Manchester City players."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-07T23:06:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/jun/08/venice-architecture-biennale-observer-review", "tags": ["Venice Biennale", "Architecture", "Rem Koolhaas", "Design", "Art and design", "Culture"], "article": "Welcome to the Future of Air Conditioning, says a poster at Venice airport, straight after passport control. Next to the words is an image of a composite Shanghai/Dubai-like city, made of sealed towers of the kind that would be impossible without artificial air. Any association with this year&apos;s Rolex-sponsored Venice Biennale of Architecture is coincidental, but the poster is an eloquent exhibit of the event&apos;s main theme. This is: thousands of years of architectural history are being changed utterly by modern techniques of constructing and servicing buildings which, predetermined by technical considerations, make architects marginal to their making. If, for example, a fireplace was once an occasion for social gathering and ornamental embellishment, there are now sensors that can track an individual and provide heating specific to that one person. The provision of heat becomes a solitary, dematerialised and invisible affair. The point is made in the large central pavilion at the heart of the Biennale&apos;s gardens. Here, this year&apos;s director, Rem Koolhaas, together with students from Harvard and a considerable team of collaborators, has installed a series of rooms which represent the elements of architecture \u2013 doors, stairs, walls, balconies and so on \u2013 and their contemporary versions. It is a 3D Google of what buildings have been and are now. Just after entering, you reach the pavilion&apos;s domed hall, whose rich blue and gold decorations from 1909 have recently been restored. Below, Koolhaas has installed a section of ceiling such as you might find in a modern hospital, in which a layer of dumb panels separates off a zone of ducts and machinery, in volume as large as the lower space inhabited by people. The progress of doors is traced, from decorative and ceremonial frames to the disembodied beep of modern security. A marvellous wall of windows, from the Brooking Collection of such things, looks on to a testing machine borrowed from the Belgian Sobinco window factory, which, with relentless rhythm, opens and closes to infinity. There are joys: for example in a montage of film clips of the ways in which bits of architecture have been exploited by the movies \u2013 people hanging off cornices, the opening of doors to shocking discoveries, and the silver screen&apos;s never-ending fascination with smashing sheets of glass. A video follows the many miles of tunnels created by the fifth duke of Portland at Welbeck Abbey in Sherwood Forest. You can experience the nerdy delights a science museum might offer, for example in the spiral escalator installed in Holloway Road underground station in 1902, which functioned for a day (or it might have been in 1906: the not completely meticulous cataloguing gives both dates). The show is partly a celebration of what built spaces can do, but there is also an underlying pessimism. Things Ain&apos;t What They Used to Be is one message, or We&apos;re All Doomed. This is striking, coming from Koolhaas, who has usually seemed happy to embrace contemporary techniques and has never been too precious about the niceties of traditional architecture; but then, paradox has also been one of his favourite tools. The message is delivered in a different way in another Biennale venue, the long and venerable rope-making works of the Arsenale, where Italy is surveyed in all its splendour and squalor. The country, says Koolhaas, &quot;has amazing gifts, but has difficulty realising them&quot;. In this, it might stand for all developed societies. At other biennales, Italy is the uninvited host, on account of the fact that it ceded its supremacy in new architecture some time ago. Here it is laid out for inspection, like a body on a slab, in a series of exhibits arranged according to geography from south to north, starting with the modernist buildings Mussolini built in the colony of Libya. It proceeds via the contemporary arrangements for dealing with illegal immigrants on the island of Lampedusa, halfway between Sicily and Tunisia, all the way to the Sikh festivals that now take place in the Po valley, and ultimately to the Alps.     The Arsenale, which exhibits Italy's legacy, in all its splendour and squalor.  Photograph: David Levene    Perhaps 60% of the enjoyment of this space comes from the accompaniment of clips from great films set in Italy, by Antonioni, Rossellini, Godard and others, and the display is arguably an overload of ideas and incidents. It would take days, if not weeks, to take it all in. But every element rewards attention, and the governing themes are clear enough \u2013 the country&apos;s intersections of power, money, humanity and beauty. These are summarised by a new film by Ila B\u00eaka and Louise Lemoine, in which the architect Stefano Boeri mournfully tours the palace he was asked to design on the gorgeous coast of Sardinia, to host the G8 summit. Berlusconi didn&apos;t like it, so it was never used, leaving behind a fenced-off folly, environmental contamination and accusations of corruption in the construction process. In view of which it is particularly poignant that the mayor of the magical city of Venice could not attend the Biennale&apos;s opening party, as he and 30 others had been detained that very day on suspicion of extortion and money-laundering. Like the air-conditioning advert, this event became an inadvertent exhibit. The other main element of the Biennale is the set of national pavilions, curated by individual countries and distributed among its gardens. Koolhaas requested that they represented the ways in which they have absorbed modernity, &quot;as a boxer absorbs a blow&quot;, over the past century. Korea responded interestingly, with a display that combines North and South in a way that makes them look more similar than you might expect. The British pavilion, led by Sam Jacob of the about-to-dissolve practice FAT, shows how the transformative dreams of William Blake&apos;s Jerusalem have played out in concrete housing estates, new towns, and in music and film. It offers a series of flavourful cultural snacks, which also manage to embody something important about British culture. The Biennale is greatly enhanced by the fact that, unlike its predecessors, it does not pay tribute to the big beasts of contemporary architecture (Koolhaas excepted) and the absence of their honking and rutting adds greatly to its enjoyment. They are represented mostly by a panel of door handles, each designed by a famous name and each only slightly different from the others, a microcosm of previous biennales that is eloquent in its pointlessness. At times, this year&apos;s biennale is only obliquely about architecture (it includes, for example, dance performance), but as architecture is usually best experienced obliquely, this is a strength. Shows like this can be a wearisome tramp through information, but this one is stimulating. It doesn&apos;t offer answers, but the questions it raises are pertinent. You couldn&apos;t ask for more than this.", "title": "2014 Venice Architecture Biennale review: put yourself in their space\u2026", "sentences": ["Next to the words is an image of a composite Shanghai/Dubai-like city, made of sealed towers of the kind that would be impossible without artificial air."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-07T23:06:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/08/qpr-rio-ferdinand-harry-redknapp", "tags": ["Rio Ferdinand", "QPR", "Harry Redknapp", "Transfer window", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "Queens Park Rangers are considering making Rio Ferdinand the highest paid player at the club with a salary of up to \u00a380,000 a week. While Ferdinand, 35, is greatly attracted to joining Rangers, and working again with Harry Redknapp, the manager who gave him his professional debut at West Ham United, the former England captain has a multitude of offers to consider. As a free agent, after being released last month by Manchester United, Ferdinand has also had interest from Aston Villa, Crystal Palace and West Ham, plus clubs from Major League Soccer, Dubai and China.

In his Mail on Sunday column, Ferdinand, who will work for the BBC as an expert at the World Cup in Brazil, said: \u201cI can assure you of one thing, though: I\u2019m not quite ready to join the [Gary] Lineker-[Alan] Shearer retirement club just yet. I see myself as going to Rio very much as an active footballer with playing time ahead of me. \u201cIt is feasible that in the coming weeks, perhaps even while I\u2019m in South America, I\u2019ll make a decision about the next stage in my career, and when that happens I\u2019ll tell you about it. \u201cBut I have options on the table from several clubs in England and overseas for next season and I\u2019m intending to play on if the right situation arises. There is, in all honesty, nothing settled yet. Whatever I do next has to be right for me and my family and I\u2019m going to take it one season at a time. I\u2019m keeping myself fit and in shape, doing my running and my workouts, so I\u2019ll be ready for whatever new club I join.\u201d With QPR back in the Premier League, after the 1-0 victory over Derby County in the Championship play-off final, and the Peckham-born defender keen to relocate back to the capital with his family, the west London club could prove ideal. Redknapp believes Ferdinand would be a key asset in the challenge of ensuring QPR are not relegated straight away. Last week, he said: \u201cRio is a very good player. I signed Rio at 14 [for West Ham]. He\u2019s a fantastic player and a great pro. He\u2019s probably been the best centre-back in Europe in the last few years. What a career he\u2019s had at Manchester United. You need good lads who know the game. They can run the dressing room. It\u2019s an easy game when you\u2019ve got good players.\u201d With QPR having been relegated the season before last, Redknapp added: \u201cQPR need a bit of experience. Most importantly, though, we need players we can rely on and who are prepared to have a go. Last time there were lots of players brought in who were not really up to the job.

The club\u2019s former managing director has been held in a Dubai police station cell since mid-May and could remain in jail until 23 June after his period of detention was extended by 15 days on Monday by a judge.

He is also aware that, during the period in question, others had access to his emails and that it would have been inconceivable for the expenditure of the sort of sums of money set out in the GFH claim to have been signed off without the express knowledge of other senior people at GFH. \u201cDavid is preparing a counterclaim against GFH for monies owed to him and which are in excess of the amount of the claim made against him by GFH.\u201d Haigh played a key role in GFHC\u2019s takeover of Leeds from Ken Bates in December 2012 and also introduced Massimo Cellino, the present owner, to the club. Haigh had been in line to become chief executive under Cellino before the pair\u2019s relationship broke down. Haigh\u2019s consortium Sport Capital issued a winding-up petition against the club for a loan of \u00a3950,000 and on Monday in the high court the case was adjourned until Tuesday. Leeds are contesting the petition. Leeds were in severe financial difficulty before Cellino\u2019s takeover, the club losing approximately \u00a31m a month. Since then the Italian businessman has undergone a series of cost-cutting exercises at Elland Road and is expected to appoint a new manager this week following the departure of Brian McDermott. Haigh\u2019s statement continued: \u201cAlthough he is deeply frustrated at being held in custody for this length of time without charge, David has no quarrel with the Dubai authorities. \u201cDespite the disadvantage at which he has been put, David will continue to defend himself against all allegations and claims made against him in what he believes is an attempt to silence and discredit him.\u201d GFH Capital said in a statement: \u201cGFH Capital understands that a file has been passed to the public prosecutor in Dubai and that a judge recently ordered that Mr Haigh continue to be detained until 23 June. \u201cGFH Capital does not consider it appropriate to comment on vague and unparticularised allegations made in press announcements which Mr Haigh has not to date attempted to detail or substantiate.

It was Michael Scott, president of the Chicago Board of Education. A single, close-range gunshot to the left temple suggested foul play. That is, until a month later, when the police department revealed that pioneering data analytics had been used to sift through a haystack of video footage from the city\u2019s CCTV cameras. The all-seeing eyes had tracked Scott\u2019s blue Cadillac to its terminus on the river&apos;s east bank. He was alone: it was suicide. This harrowing story unsettled Illinois five years ago, and became an inspiration for the video game Watch Dogs, released last week. Set in near-future Chicago, it follows hacker hero Aiden Pearce as he tries to stay alive in a city where a single mainframe \u2013 the Central Operating System (CtOS) \u2013 controls the urban electronic infrastructure. \u201cWe extrapolated a bit from what was happening in 2009,\u201d says Watch Dogs creative director Jonathan Morin. \u201cBut there was a feeling that, because of the city\u2019s history, Chicago was the kind of place where the authorities might actually install something like CtOS.\u201d  Watch Dogs, which sold 4m copies in its first week, is just the latest game to thrust the player into a detailed, pulsating and populous artificial metropolis. Ubisoft&apos;s previous bestsellers, the Assassin&apos;s Creed series, modelled the cities of Renaissance Italy; Rockstar&apos;s Grand Theft Auto has given us pimped-out versions of New York (Liberty City), LA (Los Santos) and Miami (Vice City). But as these virtual cityscapes become ever more closely synced with their real counterparts, does the street run the other way, too? Can video games teach us about our cities, and how we might want them to play out?     The Willis Tower, Chicago, pictured in Watch Dogs    Bottling metropolis mojo in video games has become a painstaking artisanal labour, one that is conducted by the 21st-century equivalent of Renaissance fresco workshops. Ubisoft, for example, had more than 1,000 people working on Watch Dogs. Morin says they chose Chicago because of its reputation as a \u201ccity of crisis\u201d: the rebuilding after the Great Fire of 1871; the overhaul of the police force after Al Capone; the riots of 1919 and 1968 that caused the city to re-examine race relations. \u201cThey are proud to stand back up after big problems,\u201d Morin says. \u201cAnd they always seem to do it through innovation in terms of how the city is run. They always end up taking very ballsy moves, which is why we thought CtOS was plausible there.\u201d  Chicago\u2019s office of emergency management and communications has indeed pioneered an integrated operations centre, which unifies public and private security feeds into one of the world\u2019s largest surveillance networks \u2013 an estimated 24,000 cameras. (Ubisoft\u2019s Montreal headquarters is just a few kilometres from Genetec, whose software helps monitor the Chicago footage.) But Ubisoft didn\u2019t get any access to that network. So how exactly do you go about modelling an urban ecosystem?  If there is one man who knows what an imposing task it is, it\u2019s Will Wright, creator of 1989\u2019s seminal SimCity. \u201cCities are amazingly complex systems,\u201d Wright told me from his home in Oakland, California. \u201cMillions of autonomous agents \u2013 the people \u2013 making millions of decisions: where to live, where to work, where to eat lunch. Those millions of decisions are the city.\u201d The Watch Dogs team tried to get a handle on those millions of decisions by applying an old-fashioned technique: the field trip. They made repeated visits to take photos of different neighbourhoods and landmarks, such as the Willis tower; they recorded ambient audio and observed people\u2019s behaviour. They wanted the unauthorised tour: beyond police escorts into sketchier areas, they didn\u2019t enlist much official cooperation. Scouting out the city\u2019s deprived Englewood district, they fell victim to a case of mistaken identity. \u201cWe were in a big red van, so as soon as we got out, people starting yelling, \u2018FBI! FBI!\u2019 and running away,\u201d says level-design director Sebastien Galarneau. The team have also brought the virtual and real together, with a site that shows how much data is available right now on real cities, such as London, Paris and Berlin.      'People started yelling FBI! FBI!' ... Englewood, Chicago was one of the neighbourhoods the Watch Dogs team visited to model. Photograph: Getty    Everyone who has developed an &quot;open-city&quot; game undertakes the same trawl for authenticity. Shenmue was the genre&apos;s first modern 3D incarnation, modelling the streets of Hong Kong in 1999, while last year\u2019s Grand Theft Auto V is generally agreed to be the high-water mark: Rockstar distilled 250,000 photographs and countless hours of video into Los Santos, their version of Los Angeles and its hinterland. It isn&apos;t always easy, says Watch Dogs&apos; Galarneau. &quot;It was a stressful experience going into the back alleys taking pictures of abandoned homes, weird railings ... the dark places of the city.&quot; But developers must also strike a balance between fidelity and fun. For instance, Ubisoft tampered with Chicago\u2019s grid layout, to encourage a more stimulating (ie carnage-filled) driving experience. Sleeping Dogs (2012) crammed Kowloon and many of Hong Kong\u2019s other districts on to the main island, which is considerably less populated in real-life. \u201cSome of the alleys are very tight,\u201d says lead designer Mike Skupa. \u201cThe organic nature of the city is just incredible \u2013 it keeps on getting built on top of itself.\u201d The Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise, a Ubisoft titan that towers over the field alongside Grand Theft Auto, has mocked up 14 cities across four different time periods. For Assassin&apos;s Creed: Brotherhood, set in 1499, Ubisoft figured players wouldn\u2019t stand for a virtual Rome bereft of the dome of St Peter\u2019s, on which work only began in 1506. So they finagled it in \u2013 the only significant deviation from scrupulous historical accuracy (with respect to the architecture, at least) that made an archaeologist out of lead designer Patrick Plourde. \u201cWe had to break the whole present-day city down. We had a historian who would say: that\u2019s baroque \u2013 no good. That\u2019s medieval \u2013 you can use it. Early Renaissance \u2013 good. Late Renaissance \u2013 no good.\u201d     'The organic nature of the city is just incredible' ... Kowloon was merged with the main Hong Kong island for the 2012 game Sleeping Dogs. Photograph: Paul Hilton/EPA    In this increasingly crowded field, each virtual city has its own style: Assassin\u2019s Creed uses a \u201csocial-stealth\u201d system that relies on sophisticated crowd dynamics; Sleeping Dogs emphasises pedestrianism; Watch Dogs, surveillance. By encompassing all these different facets of city living, open-world game development is approaching a form of urban planning \u2013 albeit a fantasy version, in which the designer has near-godlike agency. They&apos;re not quite free of budgetary restrictions, perhaps, but they&apos;re unencumbered by local politics, and can cut and paste neighbourhoods, orchestrate traffic flows and command the weather.  SimCity, of course, handed this panoply of powers to the player. Will Wright, was inspired, among many things, by the work of JW Forrester \u2013 whose 1969 book Urban Dynamics [PDF], a collaboration with a former Boston mayor, pioneered a computer model for a simulating city environments. By breaking down social and economic forces into 118 equations, it encouraged people to stop thinking passively of urban problems as sculpted by external forces, like rural-to-urban migration, and start envisioning a more dynamic, adjustable ecosystem. With SimCity, planners got their first taste of play; and thousands of players later became planners. Wright now thinks we may be on the verge of another breakthrough. \u201cI\u2019ve always like the metaphor of the city as a body \u2013 the roads are the circulatory system, the nervous system is communication,&quot; he says. &quot;In some sense we are now overlaying a whole new nervous system on our cities, with new information flows and feedback. For the first time, through social networks, we have real metrics about the things that happen thanks to the millions of individual agents in the city.\u201d With the digital and the physical finally speaking the same language, there&apos;s surely never been a better time for games to reshape our cities. *** Wright lives in the hills of Oakland. He digs the ocean view, but says it\u2019s one of the \u201cmost dysfunctional\u201d Bay Area cities. He admires neighbouring Emeryville: \u201cThey\u2019ve taken a totally different approach to zoning and governance, and they\u2019ve been extremely successful. It\u2019s a very small area, but that\u2019s where a lot of the new development in shopping areas and office space has gone.\u201d  Lined up side-by-side, the Bay Area cities are a perfect illustration of the unpredictability of actual cities. As he puts it: \u201cWhen you throw humans in the mix, things become very, very counterintuitive.\u201d But though cities have a way of outgrowing any model, video games are starting to provide tools to keep ahead.      'When you throw humans in the mix, things become counter-intuitive' ... Will Wright, creator of the seminal SimCity. Photograph: Ryan Anson/Getty    Second Life and Minecraft have been used to visualise built environments, such as the Blockholm project, a state-funded recreation of the Swedish capital using the Minecraft engine. Based on official land data, the simulation allowed players to propose future buildings; the best 10 were publicly exhibited and put up for planning consideration. Meanwhile Block by Block, an initiative by the UN human settlement programme UN Habitat, used Minecraft to involve residents in shaping community spaces around the world, like redesigning football fields in Nairobi\u2019s Kibera slum. For more finessed-looking 3D world-building, there are commercial programs like CityEngine, which was used to remake a section of Marseille for a significant redevelopment project and to create a futuristic cityscape for a Ministry of Sound commercial. For civic organisations, however, such programs remain expensive (if not quite in the $265m league of Grand Theft Auto V). Chris Haller, founder of Urban Interactive Studio, also experienced his \u201cbig a-ha moment\u201d playing SimCity. His company now applies game mechanics, such as interactive visual elements and a scoring system, to public-engagement projects like surveys. \u201cWe often see this vicious circle in the typical town hall meeting,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople yell and start demanding certain things. And the planners go into defensive mode, because they think the ideas are pie-in-the-sky. It becomes very unproductive.\u201d      'Big a-ha moment' ... SimCity inspired countless planners, and led Chris Haller to apply game mechanics to public projects like town hall meetings    His &quot;gamified methodology&quot; seeks to open up the planning process for all parties, by drawing more people out and giving equal weight to all voices, not just the loudest. Bannock county, Idaho used the studio\u2019s BrightPages app to liven up four alternative scenarios for its transportation system; the participants opted for one that adapted existing infrastructure, to minimise additional public spending. Eric Gordon, director of Emerson College&apos;s Engagement Lab in Boston, takes a more purist approach. He says gamification does a good job of getting people to talk about pre-defined goals, but true games have other advantages. \u201cThey\u2019re not about making a process more efficient \u2013 a game is probably the least efficient method of doing anything. There are goals, but you have obstacles in your way that aren\u2019t necessary. You agree to be part of that system, and you play towards your goals without taking the most efficient route. A game gives people a chance to imagine things in a different way, not just get there faster.\u201d In 2010, he devised Participatory Chinatown, a role-playing game in which Bostonians were invited to play one of 15 fictional residents, and complete missions like finding a job or a place to hang out. \u201cPeople said they appreciated the perspective of this other person they got to play,&quot; he says. &quot;They told the story of what was happening in a very different way \u2013 much more personalised.\u201d But the method has its limitations: \u201cThey might play, say, an immigrant who couldn\u2019t afford to buy a coffee at Starbucks every morning. But if they wanted a Starbucks on every corner in real life, that was still the case [after they finished the game]. Playing Grand Theft Auto doesn\u2019t make me want to shoot people, so why would playing a pro-social video game make me more pro-social?\u201d     'People appreciated the perspective of this other person they got to play' ... Participatory Chinatown, in which Bostonians were invited to play one of 15 fictional residents    Gordon hopes for a more subtle effect \u2013 to exploit the play-centric space of video games to challenge people\u2019s moral frameworks, to get them to give answers they didn\u2019t know they would, to obtain more nuanced findings for the planning process. He calls it \u201caugmented deliberation\u201d. His ideas had their biggest trial in 2012 during a three-week series of games, involving over 1,000 players, that fed recommendations about transport and zoning into Detroit\u2019s Future City study, which maps out the next 50 years for the embattled metropolis. Social experiments like this could just be the start, Gordon thinks: \u201cGames are inevitably going to reshape what cityscapes look like.\u201d He compares their potential impact to the development of New York\u2019s Times Square in parallel with the early urban films of Thomas Edison: their primitive tracking shots fostered a new conception of the &quot;moving&quot; city that also found expression in the square\u2019s illuminated advertising, known as \u201csky signs\u201d. \u201cPeople would stop and watch [the ads] for minutes at a time, and bask in the kinetic energy of that space,\u201d says Gordon, \u201cThe idea of the ur-city, [ultimate city] became the city in movement. Times Square was considered the centre of New York, and New York the centre of world urbanism.\u201d He thinks that video games could now have a similar effect on how we think of cities, born out of countless Xbox rampages. Pursuits like parkour \u2013 physically moving through a city like an obstacle course \u2013 could be seen as analogues of untrammelled video game freedom, and better ones than clunky transpositions like Pac-Manhattan (though location-based games, such as the popular geo-tagging &quot;wargame&quot; Ingress, are undeniably getting more sophisticated). The whole idea of the &quot;smart city&quot;, networked up to deliver all services conceivable, is a sublimation of the gamer\u2019s bottomless inventory and notion of place as malleable to their every need. The global fantasy architecture of places like Dubai, Shanghai and even the new London skyline, elasticating the limits of spatial feasibility, seems to have been pulled direct from the digital realm.     City as obstacle course ... a map of Chicago in Watch Dogs    All very exciting for any Google Glass cyborgs keen to lord it over the Tron boulevards of the future. But the danger is that the human element gets sidelined. On one level that just means forgetting that cities are, in fact, the people who live there: for example, the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute (UMTRI) and Xerox are building a 32-acre simulated city, with buildings, benches, intersections, street lights, traffic signals, signs, construction barriers and, as Fastcompany puts it, &quot;every other complication of city life that a driver might encounter ... except wayward pedestrians&quot;. On a deeper level, Watch Dogs aims to flag up the perils of data centralisation, such as Rio de Janeiro\u2019s 2016 Smart Cities pledge, which feeds off citizen-sourced data and occupies a perilous zone between civic empowerment and Orwellian control. \u201cCentralising information so you can better dispatch civic resources is an inevitable need in the evolution of our society, but we need to be cautious about the consequences,\u201d says Watch Dogs&apos; Morin. \u201cWe all love our phones, put a lot of information on them. But we sometimes fail to step back and look at the big picture. That\u2019s why we give the power of hacking to the player \u2013 all the temptation and desire to exploit the weaknesses around them.\u201d Gordon and Haller are similarly concerned that citizens win out in the great tech march forwards. The former says he is aware that co-opting video games into public engagement could be \u201cused to pacify people into a haze of fun\u201d. In his eyes, it\u2019s vital that game-driven urban planning delivers tangible results for citizens, and doesn\u2019t slip into the kind of trendy &quot;participative&quot; marketing more likely to serve business interests. You could question other gamified projects: London\u2019s Oystercard game Chromaroma, which awards points for different journeys, could be useful for amassing travel data, but might equally be rattling the can to get more money for TfL. Is Ingress a canny way of co-opting people into urban mapping or, just a giant Google advert? \u201cI want to see responsible use of games that deploys what they\u2019re good at \u2013 creating a context of play that allows people to experiment safely with possibilities in the civic realm and ultimately empower them,\u201d says Gordon. On the other side of the looking glass, games developers have their own version of the problem. Their clockwork cities are ever more immaculate, but Morin admits they fall short on the people front: the sense of a city as a wondrous, unconducted symphony of individual minds. Games are struggling to move beyond the looped dialogue and behaviour scripts of the past; Watch Dogs hints at the idea of citizens having inner lives, but mostly to deliver the game\u2019s satirical slugs about privacy.  Plourde dwells similarly on the strengths and limitations of the first, Crusades-set Assassin\u2019s Creed. \u201cIt was the best one in terms of low-level immersion: being able to walk around and watch what people were doing. But it was not well-realised in terms of making the crowd an active element in the gameplay.\u201d He says that the sequels were a constant struggle to maintain the illusion of a spontaneous city \u2013 ensuring that a player never rounded a corner to find no one there, or a Matrix-like glitch in the system. Wright believes open-world developers are taking the wrong approach entirely. \u201cYou look at GTA, and this amazing world Rockstar have created, and it\u2019s all hand-built,&quot; he says. &quot;An evolutionary process didn\u2019t lead to Los Santos: it was 300 artists studying pictures, building models. They\u2019re just painting a portrait of a neighbourhood. It only gets you so far.\u201d That way of thinking, he says, hinders developers from bridging the gap between static (if beautifully rendered) city backdrops and true, dynamic simulations. Rather, he envisions games that work like evolution: an open-ended, unpredictable system. The challenge is how to make such a thing compatible with the personalised drama, all those sagas of rogue gangsters, cops and assassins so crucial to drawing in the player. We\u2019ll carry on inching our way towards the ultimate sim city. Playing it, detached from the real world, could be the ultimate exercise in cynicism. Or perhaps our playful instincts really can be meaningfully unleashed on our streets. Wright has made a brilliant career in the gap between sim and reality, between the model and the mortar, but even he stresses that the impulse to sculpt cities has natural limits. \u201cUtopia is always finite. The agenda changes all the time. I don\u2019t think there ever will be a utopian city.\u201d Digital or otherwise.  \u2022 Which are the best video game cities?

A good coach will develop each player along natural lines.\u201d The audience listened in appreciative silence, appropriate for a man of his skills and standing. There had been controversy when he was first selected for England, but he had quietened it when, in his first series, he scored that brilliant 150 in the fourth innings against Australia. Now, most accepted that he was the best batsman in the country. Or at least the most brilliant, capable of incredible shots of his own design, the likes of which other, more orthodox, more English, batsmen, scarcely imagined, much less attempted. He continued. \u201cIf a young player showed a particular knack for a dangerous stroke, then he shouldn\u2019t be discouraged from playing it, far less forced to abandon it. But he should be shown how to make it safer.\u201d He spoke in particular of the pull, and the hook, which he had used so wonderfully well against the Australian quicks. There were mutters of disagreement at that. And if the murmurers were too polite to raise their voices, they were gratified to read a rebuttal of his words in The Times the next day. \u201cHis play, as everyone who has seen him knows, is not English play,\u201d the paper said. The pull and the hook, the paper advised, \u201care dangerous eccentricities which should not be recommended to the young.\u201d Furthermore, \u201ca lad may excuse himself for ending a pentameter verse with an adjective by the plea that Ovid sometimes does the same, and the master\u2019s well-known answer is \u2018when you have written as many and as good verses as Ovid, you may imitate him in breaking the rules.\u2019 A cricket coach should in our opinion say much the same to a boy who tried to pull an off-ball or hook a straight one.\u201d Which is the giveaway, if you hadn\u2019t yet twigged, that this conversation took place a long time ago; 117 years back, to be exact, when Ranjitsinhji published his Jubilee Book of Cricket. But it echoed again this week. Among the many little insights included in Kevin Pietersen\u2019s debut column in the Daily Telegraph were a couple of snippets about the academy he is planning to open in Dubai. These were, presumably, included at his behest, part of the voracious PR campaign being waged by his management team, but they still contained a few pithy observations about English cricket. \u201cMy guiding principles are that I want to coach kids the way they play and not from a textbook. You want kids to grow up believing in their own natural talent and strengths,\u201d Pietersen explained. \u201cI have seen how coaching is now, especially for kids. Ball on a cone, high elbow and hit through the ball. In my opinion that is not the only way to coach and it\u2019s holding back some natural talent. The game has changed and coaching has to change too.\u201d The comparison he made was with Lasith Malinga. \u201cHow the hell does he get wickets bowling like that? But his technique works for him. If he was a young England player he would probably have drifted out of the game.\u201d Which is not such a piece of what-iffery as it first appears. Perhaps the last really unorthodox English bowler to appear on the county circuit, the off-spinner Maurice Holmes, is now playing for Cannock in Division Three of the Birmingham Premier League, far away from the county scene. \u201cThere will always be the English view, that something different is not necessarily something good,\u201d Holmes told me in 2012. \u201cThere are people who tend to take the traditional view that things can and should only be done in one way.\u201d He too has his forebears. Bernard Bosanquet, who perfected the googly, said that his delivery had been \u201csubject to ridicule, abuse, contempt, and incredulity\u201d in its early years. When he bowled the great Arthur Shrewsbury with one, the batsman told him the delivery was \u201cunfair\u201d. \u201cNot unfair, Arthur,\u201d Bosanquet said with a grin, \u201conly immoral.\u201d Curiously, Kumar Sangakkara has also compared Pietersen to Malinga, telling Wisden Extra: \u201cFor us, it\u2019s been like that with Lasith Malinga. He is very different in the way he looks, and as a person. Not everyone gets on well with each other in a team. There are certain people you might not have dinner with, but that doesn\u2019t take away from the fact they will be valuable players in a national cause, going out trying to win matches.\u201d Sri Lanka, of course, have done a far better job of nurturing, and integrating, players with unorthodox techniques, from Malinga to Murali to Ajantha Mendis, even Sanath Jayasuriya. Too many people in English cricket tend to criticise unorthodox players for what they don\u2019t do, rather than celebrate them for what they can do. Hence the recent fuss about Saeed Ajmal\u2019s action, though the rest of the world has long since accepted him. Some seem to think that anyone who bowls with a bent elbow is a villain, regardless of whether or not they straighten it, and even though we now know that all bowlers flex their arms, which is why we have the 15 degree rule. But then, on these shores even traditional leg-spin still seems to be an unfathomable and alien skill. The question of English approach towards unorthodox talent is growing more pressing. The current generation is the first to have grown up playing, and watching, T20, a format that encourages an irregular, even radical, approach. And yet we seem reluctant to embrace our most luminous talents. Alex Hales is, incredibly, unable to get into the ODI side. We dither about whether Jos Buttler\u2019s wicket-keeping is up to snuff, worry whether Eoin Morgan has issues with his defence outside off-stump. Moeen Ali is yet to even use the doosra, which he says he has learned, in a match. Not all young players have the bullet-proof self-belief that enabled Pietersen to overcome the doubts, the disapproval, and forge his own way ahead. They need to be fostered, supported, by those around them. But Buttler, for instance, even seems to have swallowed the idea that he\u2019s not yet good enough to play Test cricket. As Pietersen says, \u201cthe game has changed\u201d, but have our attitudes? \u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

The 26-year-old is the only one of the three uncapped players in England\u2019s squad for the first Test against Sri Lanka who was born in this country, having grown up in the Sparkhill district of Birmingham and attended Moseley School. He discussed his unusual route to the England team, and his close friendship with Pakistan\u2019s mystery spinner Saeed Ajmal, with grace and humour \u2013 although Alastair Cook will be much more concerned about his ability to score runs in the lower middle order, and possibly even to become the first England bowler to deliver a doosra in Test cricket. \u201cIt\u2019s something I feel like I\u2019m ready for,\u201d Moeen said of his impending Test debut, having played three one-day internationals and six Twenty20s during the winter. \u201cI have played quite a few Test matches in the back garden with my two brothers. This one is slightly different \u2013 obviously more exciting.\u201d One of those brothers, Kadeer, has played first-class cricket for three counties and the other, Omar, is currently with Shropshire, while a teenage Moeen went to watch his cousin Kabir, now at Lancashire, winning his sole Test cap against South Africa at Headingley in 2003. \u201cMy two brothers and parents are coming down, and my wife and my little boy,\u201d Moeen said with a smile. \u201cThey\u2019ll be very proud, my two brothers, and my dad will be very, very happy because he\u2019s obviously worked hard on us also. I am more happy for them than I am for anything else.\u201d He was also happy to accept responsibilities as an ambassador for his faith and his community, a willingness which was already manifest in his approval of Worcestershire\u2019s marketing of his \u201cBeard that\u2019s feared.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very important part of myself and the community I\u2019m from and I\u2019m very proud,\u201d he added. \u201cIn terms of trying to inspire other people with faith to play and stuff I am very proud of that. I remember seeing Muslim athletes or guys with other faiths performing and still carrying the label of being a religious person and it does inspire people.\u201d Does the beard ever cause any practical problems, he was asked \u2013 a tricky question, but valid nonetheless. \u201cOnly when it is a little bit windy and it sort of blows up,\u201d Moeen answered with a grin. \u201cI trim it quite a bit otherwise it would be down all the way to my knees I reckon. It is a label for us to show that we are Muslim just how it is when you wear a uniform in school and stuff. It represents that we have to be on our best behaviour all the time. So it means a lot and it means a lot to other people as well. I enjoy it. It\u2019s nice.\u201d But it is not only Moeen\u2019s facial hair that marks him out as a ground-breaking England cricketer. This was certainly the first time a home bowler at Lord\u2019s had been asked to dwell on his doosra \u2013 the Urdu term for \u201cother one\u201d that was originally introduced into the cricketing lexicon by Saqlain Mushtaq late in the last millennium, and has since become a staple for many (mostly subcontinental) spinners. Moeen still regards himself primarily as a batsman, a left-hander stylish enough to have earned the odd comparison to David Gower. But it is the ability he has already shown as an off-spinner, and his potential to improve, that has thrust him above the other batting candidates, as England reshape their team following the retirement of Graeme Swann. \u201cI\u2019ll be ready,\u201d Moeen said. \u201cI bowled quite a bit for Worcester last week and over the last two or three years I\u2019ve bowled a lot for them.\u201d He struck up an instant rapport with Ajmal, the world\u2019s leading spinner who wrecked England in Dubai and Abu Dhabi in early 2012, when he had a first spell with Worcestershire the previous year. But since the Pakistani returned to New Road in April, Moeen has been seeking more specific advice. \u201cI asked him \u2018Just teach me the doosra\u2019. He saw me bowl it and he said \u2018look, you definitely can do it\u2019, which was quite nice. \u201cI have been working on it for a couple of years but really getting my head down in the last two or three months. I\u2019ve actually needed Saeed there. I\u2019ve been doing it away from Saeed in the winter and stuff with England but I wasn\u2019t sure what was going wrong at the time, and then once he had a look at it and he gave me that confidence, I was ready to push the training further and do it every day. \u201cThe difficulty is the grip at first, because you use muscles that you don\u2019t really use for a normal off-spinner. Now it\u2019s coming on well. I bowled about eight in the last Championship game and in Twenty20s I\u2019ve been bowling five or six each game. So far every one\u2019s landed. So hopefully if I feel confident and get a couple of good days in practice then I\u2019ll be ready to bowl it.\u201d Has it yet yielded him a wicket? \u201cNo. A few plays and misses and I had a close lbw that bounced a bit high. I can\u2019t wait to get that one wicket with it first and then hopefully that will give me a lot of confidence. I was speaking to Saeed about that and he says once you get one or two wickets with it you start bowling it a lot more. \u201cHe\u2019s helped me loads. He\u2019s pushed me, given me a lot of confidence, because it does take a bit of time for the first two weeks because you bowl a lot of full tosses in practice, it\u2019s embarrassing at times. But he said he did exactly the same thing so that gave me confidence to just keep trying to do it. \u201cMy grip is slightly different to his. He uses all three fingers, I still use my index finger, but in terms of action like the front foot and being a bit open and stuff, he\u2019s given me a few tips. But I think he gets a lot more pace off his, a bit more bounce maybe, but he said mine will come as I keep bowling it. The last week or so I think I\u2019ve got a lot more pace out of it.\u201d Sri Lanka are not exactly quaking in their boots. When asked about the fresh circumstances of England, rather than Sri Lanka, going into a match with a mystery spinner, the opener Lahiru Thirimanne said: \u201cWho are you talking about?

About 40% of votes opposed the company&apos;s remuneration report, its remuneration policy and changes to its 2008 share plan. Lamprell suffered the revolt at Monday&apos;s meeting in Dubai even after it claimed to have consulted its shareholders on pay. Announcing the vote, Lamprell said: &quot;In light of the vote at the AGM, our remuneration committee will re-engage with our shareholders on the company&apos;s remuneration policy. &quot;We are committed to ensuring that our remuneration policy (and in particular the long-term incentive plans) takes account of shareholders&apos; views and at the same time enables the company to implement its strategy through an appropriately incentivised management team.&quot; The revolt centred on shares awarded to James Moffatt, the chief executive, when he joined last March. Moffatt was meant to get the shares, worth $753,000 (\u00a3449,000) at the time, before 21 March but because the company was in a long restricted period when awards could not be made this was not possible. Lamprell has now granted Moffatt the shares and they will be tested over the three years to March 2016, according to the company&apos;s long-term incentive plan. Moffatt also got a $208,000 signing on payment to compensate for payments he missed out on at his former employer. The company had a 41% vote against its pay policy. That vote is binding and a slightly bigger rebellion would have forced Lamprell to rewrite its pay plans. Some 41% of shareholders also voted against last year&apos;s pay report and 39% against changes to the performance share plan. The pay rebellion follows a rocky period for Lamprell. The Financial Services Authority fined it \u00a32.4m last March for failing to tell shareholders promptly about problems that led to five profit warnings. As the warnings mounted up, its former chief executive Nigel McCue was ousted in October 2012 followed by the finance director and chief operating officer. There were pay protests at each of its previous two annual meetings as financial problems mounted. There has been a series of rebellions at this year&apos;s AGMs with Standard Chartered, Barclays and HSBC hit by shareholder disapproval on pay. The company now has a new management team and financial performance has stabilised under chairman John Kennedy, who joined two years ago. However, the remuneration committee failed to quell shareholder unease over pay after previous rebellions. In its annual report, the company said: &quot;During 2013, the committee conducted a review of the company&apos;s remuneration policy, which took into account feedback from the 2013 AGM. A new policy was developed, which sought to address these concerns and this was shared informally with major shareholders and governance bodies in late 2013. The majority of those consulted indicated their support, although a few did not respond. One governance group reverted with several suggestions for further revisions and the committee incorporated most of these suggestions into the final policy.&quot;", "title": "Oil rig builder Lamprell sees shareholders revolt over pay again", "sentences": ["Lamprell suffered the revolt at Monday&apos;s meeting in Dubai even after it claimed to have consulted its shareholders on pay."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-10T15:53:29Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/10/pat-cosgrave-british-horseracing-authority-dubai-ban", "tags": ["British Horseracing Authority", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "  Pat Cosgrave, who faced missing much of the remainder of the Flat season following a four-month suspension imposed in Dubai earlier this year, will be free to ride at Royal Ascot next week and beyond after his application to the British Horseracing Authority that it should not reciprocate the ban was upheld by the BHA\u2019s disciplinary panel on Tuesday. Cosgrave, who has ridden more than 400 winners including three in Group One events, was initially banned for six months by the Emirates Racing Authority after he was found guilty of improper riding in the Group One Jebel Hatta. Cosgrave\u2019s mount Anaerobio, an outsider for the race, drifted off the rail, allowing Vercingetorix, the favourite and a stablemate from the Mike de Kock yard, a trouble-free run around the home turn on the way to victory. The ban was later reduced to four months on appeal, but Cosgrave can now continue riding without the threat of a long suspension hanging over him. The disciplinary panel\u2019s reasons for its finding will be published at a later date, but it is the second such decision in recent times, following the ruling in October to uphold an appeal by Martin Dwyer that a ban from India in February 2013 should not be reciprocated. As he left a four-hour hearing at the BHA\u2019s offices in London, Cosgrave expressed his relief at the outcome. \u201cIt\u2019s been a rocky few months,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I\u2019m pleased with the result.

Riding was good for me, I think if you are just sitting at home it would probably play on your mind more, but when you\u2019re busy driving up and down the country, it keeps your mind off it.

Without the likes of Paul and the PJA, this would have been very hard to get sorted.\u201d The Emirates Racing Authority has requested written reasons and a transcript of Cosgrave\u2019s appeal hearing. John Zucal, chief steward for the ERA, said: \u201cI have got the decision of the BHA and I have asked for reasons and a transcript of the hearing, which I am sure I will get.

Estimate will attempt to repeat that success next Thursday, having not won a race since and without a racecourse appearance since October. \u201cShe\u2019s a filly that is not straightforward,\u201d Stoute said on Thursday. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy. She had a muscle problem in her right hind leg and that\u2019s why she hasn\u2019t had a preparatory run, so we\u2019re under pressure. She\u2019s made good progress in the last month. It\u2019s a tough assignment but I think we\u2019re going to run well and we\u2019ll have her in good shape by next week.\u201d Stoute acknowledged that next week\u2019s Gold Cup is a strong race and indeed it has been described as significantly tougher than last year\u2019s, with the St Leger winner Leading Light as the 15-8 favourite, having been beaten only in the Arc in his past seven outings. Estimate is available at 8-1, putting her behind Brown Panther and Tac De Boistron in the betting, even though the latter is not a certain runner with the ground likely to be on the quick side. But it appears that Stoute has been able to manage the expectations of Estimate\u2019s owner. Asked if she was excited by the possibility of another Gold Cup success, the trainer replied: \u201cShe\u2019s had so many losers in her life, she doesn\u2019t get carried away.\u201d Stoute was speaking at a pre-Ascot press conference here before dashing to Lord\u2019s cricket ground to watch England\u2019s Test match against Sri Lanka. He gave a brief outline of the rest of his team for next week\u2019s action but indicated that it is not likely to include Dank, a winner at last year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup. The mare will be left in Wednesday\u2019s Prince of Wales\u2019s Stakes at the next entry stage but Stoute said her owner, James Wigan, preferred a tilt at Ireland\u2019s Pretty Polly Stakes 11 days later. It is a state of affairs that appeared to leave the trainer rather wistful. \u201cIt would be nice to have a crack at the Prince of Wales,\u201d he said, \u201cbut we\u2019ll decide when we see the opposition. I think she\u2019ll get her ground.\u201d Snow Sky, which Stoute was forced to withdraw from the Derby at a late stage because of a sprained joint in his near-fore, is being aimed at next Friday\u2019s King Edward VII Stakes. \u201cHe\u2019s back on track, back cantering,\u201d reported the trainer, sounding hopeful of at least getting the three-year-old to the races this time. Stoute said Telescope would have \u201ca good chance\u201d in the Hardwicke Stakes a week on Saturday and said that the likely fast surface would suit him much better than the soft on which he has been twice beaten by Noble Mission this season. He also plans to run Integral in the Duke Of Cambridge and gave a positive mention to Abseil, the 6-1 favourite for the Royal Hunt Cup, while noting that the horse might yet miss the cut-off point for being too low in the weights. \u201cI just hope he gets in because I think he\u2019d have a great chance and I think the track would suit him ideally,\u201d Stoute said. This press conference is normally used to introduce connections of foreign raiders to the British media but they are in short supply this year and Australian sprinters will be a notable absence next week. Representing the southern hemisphere, however, will be Mike de Kock, the South African trainer, who plans to run Soft Falling Rain in the Queen Anne and Shea Shea in the King\u2019s Stand Stakes, the two races that open the meeting on Tuesday. Shea Shea came within inches of winning last year\u2019s King\u2019s Stand but was mugged on the line by Sole Power, finishing strongly on the opposite side of the course.

Ketan Somaia, who is now based in London, presided over the collapse of an African bank and is best known for his involvement in the Goldenberg affair, a corruption scandal that helped wreck Kenya&apos;s economy and implicated its former president. But it was through the British courts, in what is thought to have been the largest ever British private prosecution brought by an individual, that the two-times Miss World sponsor was finally brought to book. He was convicted of nine counts of obtaining money by deception, totalling $19.5m, from two separate victims, and acquitted of two counts of obtaining money by deception totalling $3.5m. Somaia, 52, claims to have been a friend of the billionaire Hinduja brothers. His companies were chaired by Parkinson for eight years, and he is now involved in a takeover of London&apos;s biggest Asian radio stations, acting as a consultant to Lyca Mobile, a firm which helped fund Boris Johnson&apos;s re-election campaign. &quot;Mr Ketan Somaia was what is sometimes called a confidence trickster, but on a grand scale,&quot; said William Boyce QC for the prosecution. His lavish lifestyle was being paid for by people whose money was &quot;taken and not given back&quot;, in a &quot;systematic series of frauds&quot;. In a single year, he was accused of extracting a total of $23m (\u00a314m) from another entrepreneur, Murli Mirchandani, after promising him stakes in his ventures. Aside from some money for interest, Boyce claimed: &quot;Not a penny of the $23m capital advanced to Mr Somaia has ever been repaid.&quot; Mirchandani, who made his fortune in food and chemicals, pursued Somaia for more than a decade and was the primary complainant in the successful Old Bailey trial. When Mirchandani refused to keep lending, Somaia approached the Hindujas for loans. The jury found Somaia had also defrauded a London businessman, Dilip Shah, of \u00a3200,000. Before meeting Mirchandani, Somaia was said to have fleeced a third man, Surajit Sen, for $2m in 1997. Sen shared an office in Dubai with the accused, and said in evidence that he believed himself to be Somaia&apos;s business partner. Somaia&apos;s victims were not all wealthy. His personal assistant, Arifa Parkar, said in evidence that she had eventually left Somaia&apos;s employ, exhausted by fielding calls from unpaid creditors, after he failed to pay her wages. &quot;How could I survive without money?&quot; she told the trial. Even as his hotels, media and banking empire began to crumble, Somaia continued to host lavish parties in Dubai, where his group had offices, and at a mansion with an indoor pool and a helipad in Hadley Wood, a London suburb where his neighbours have included Cheryl Cole and Lennox Lewis. According to the prosecution, Somaia served only &quot;cases and cases&quot; of Dom P\u00e9rignon 1984 champagne. The cost of a single one of Somaia&apos;s parties, said Boyce, would have paid his secretary&apos;s salary for a year. Somaia was said to have lured his victims by claiming that he had a personal fortune of $100m and that his companies were worth $500m. He laid on all-expenses-paid trips to Africa and Dubai, where the visitors, accompanied by hired musicians, travelled in chauffeur-driven cars and on a private jet, and stayed at luxury hotels. Somaia&apos;s Dolphin group included the Treetops Lodge in Kenya, where the young Queen Elizabeth spent her honeymoon. The accused built up a feeling of &quot;fevered excitement&quot; in his victims with false opportunities of being his business partner, said Boyce. But in the case of Mirchandani, the only surety given for the loans was his word. To Shah, he issued a fraudulent share certificate for one of his banks. In Somaia&apos;s defence, barrister James Woods QC claimed Mirchandani had given the money knowing there was a risk it might be lost. &quot;We suggest Murli Mirchandani, rather than the weak man portrayed, is more likely a hard-nosed business entrepreneur. It was he who looked at Mr Somaia in order to try and embark upon a business partnership. &quot;He was prepared to pay out big money to secure that business relationship. He gambled his money on Ketan Somaia. You win some and you lose some but you take it in your stride. This was no fraud.&quot; Somaia, who is of Indian origin but was born in Kenya, made his money from government contracts issued during the era of Kenya&apos;s longest-serving president, Daniel arap Moi. Under one of these contracts, he was paid to import hundreds of secondhand black cabs from the UK to Nairobi, but a judge found that while 500 had been paid for, only 300 were delivered. Somaia was sent to prison for the alleged scam in 2004. But his conviction was quashed in 2005 and he was set free, having spent much of his sentence in the private wing of a Nairobi hospital. When the Bank of Credit and Commerce International collapsed after an international corruption scandal in 1991, Somaia bought a number of its branches and changed the name to Delphis. But a decade later the bank collapsed, with its branches in Mauritius, Tanzania and Nairobi closed or bailed out, after allegations that they had been plundered by related third parties for loans that were not repaid. In 2003, after Moi&apos;s 24 years in power came to an end, Somaia was ordered to give evidence to an inquiry into the Goldenberg scandal. In an export scam sanctioned at the highest levels of Moi&apos;s government, a company called Goldenberg International claimed to be selling Kenyan gold and diamonds to companies abroad. To encourage exports the government at the time paid Goldenberg and other firms big bonuses for foreign sales. In fact, Kenya has no diamonds and produces only a tiny amount of gold, and subsequent inquiries found its exports were fictitious. Huge payments associated with the scam were said to have passed through Delphis. Proceeds from the scam were used for foreign currency speculation, which sent the Kenyan shilling into freefall and national inflation soaring. By 2002, Somaia had been arrested by Hertfordshire police for allegedly taking \u00a3500,000 from a local entrepreneur. He fled to Kenya, and the Crown Prosecution Service was not able to secure his extradition. But in 2008 he was arrested in India while attending a wedding, and extradited to the UK. The Hertfordshire case was dropped, on the grounds the money had been repaid and Somaia was in ill health. Speaking after the verdict, Mirchandani said: &quot;Securing a conviction against Mr Somaia will not undo the harm he has caused and the pain he has inflicted upon me and my family, but knowing that he has been brought to justice helps bring us some closure.&quot; Concluding the trial, Judge Richard Hone QC said: &quot;This case has been exceptional for a number of reasons \u2013 the sums involved, the extraordinary lifestyles, the famous names, the world of international businessmen and the outpouring of $23m simply relying on the concept of &apos;My word is my bond&apos;.&quot; Somaia is due to be sentenced this month after a medical report.", "title": "Tycoon Ketan Somaia guilty of $19.5m swindle", "sentences": ["Sen shared an office in Dubai with the accused, and said in evidence that he believed himself to be Somaia&apos;s business partner.", "Even as his hotels, media and banking empire began to crumble, Somaia continued to host lavish parties in Dubai, where his group had offices, and at a mansion with an indoor pool and a helipad in Hadley Wood, a London suburb where his neighbours have included Cheryl Cole and Lennox Lewis.", "He laid on all-expenses-paid trips to Africa and Dubai, where the visitors, accompanied by hired musicians, travelled in chauffeur-driven cars and on a private jet, and stayed at luxury hotels."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-13T18:28:36Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2014/jun/15/carlos-queiroz-iran-world-cup", "tags": ["World Cup 2014", "World Cup", "World Cup 2014 Group F", "Iran", "Football", "Sport"], "article": "A kit that shrinks in the wash, 11 players reporting for a training camp and matches cancelled due to a lack of funds \u2013 it was never like this for Carlos Queiroz at Manchester United or Real Madrid. He has faced all this and more in the buildup to Brazil as manager of Iran, plus other trappings of the job that were beyond him at Old Trafford and the Bernab\u00e9u \u2013 acclaim, authority and a respect bordering on reverence from players and supporters alike. Every cloud, as they say. The widely experienced Portuguese coach has approached the World Cup with an air of defiance and exasperation since guiding Iran to the finals 12 months ago. The highest-ranked Asian team in the tournament are the third nation Queiroz has taken to a World Cup, following South Africa in 2002 and Portugal in 2010, and history suggests they have done well to keep him at the helm forMonday\u2019s opener against Nigeria. He quit South Africa before the 2002 finals over a dispute with the country\u2019s football association (who reportedly want Queiroz back when his contract with Iran expires this summer) but has stomached much more to fulfil his duties with the side known back home as Team Melli. Maybe he has mellowed with age at 61. Then again, consider his reaction when Iran clinched first place in their Asia qualifying group at South Korea\u2019s expense last June. Queiroz celebrated that crucial victory on South Korean soil with a clenched-fist, up-yours salute to his opposite number Choi Kang-hee, sparking outrage among the home crowd in Ulsan, who pelted his team with water bottles, an attempted rush on the visitors\u2019 bench by Choi\u2019s players and official condemnation from Korea Football Association officials. Perhaps we should discount mellowing. An alternative theory for Queiroz\u2019s resolve in the face of Iran\u2019s farcical World Cup preparations is that he has attained the level of control, success and credit denied him in previous high-profilepositions. He has the authority that was never available as assistant to Sir Alex Ferguson at United, where Roy Keane was among those who questioned the coach\u2019s input, or while working under Real president Florentino P\u00e9rez in Madrid. His disciplined, defensive coaching is more suited to upsetting the odds with Iran than realising the expectations of Portugal\u2019s entertainers and individuals.And, in delivering World Cup qualification to a fanatical football nation during a time of economic turmoil wrought by international sanctions, while taking a hard-line stance with dissenting players and clubs, he has achieved hero status among the fans. Enhancing that status in a group containing Nigeria, Argentina and Bosnia-Herzegovina appears a forlorn hope but Iran \u2013 who lost only twice in their qualifying campaign and conceded two goals in their final eight matches \u2013 may not be prised open easily. Queiroz has drilled his team into a supremely well-organised, diligent defensive unit. Outside of his orderly bubble, unfortunately, there is only chaos. Iran have played only five warm-up matches since qualifying 12 months ago and no one of the calibre they will confront in Group F, with all due respect to Guinea, Belarus, Montenegro, Angola and Trinidad &amp; Tobago. They have qualified for the 2015 Asian Cup in the meantime, however, against Thailand, Lebanon and Kuwait. If there is sympathy for the government-funded Iran football federation over attracting international teams to Tehran amid US sanctions and an EU embargo \u2013 a consequence of the country\u2019s uranium-enrichment programme \u2013 then it evaporated over the fiasco of the team\u2019s kit. The federation claims it has been unable to collect approximately \u00a3180,000 owed by international sponsors due to the sanctions. Its response, it has been alleged, was to order poor-quality kit that the federation president, Ali Kafashian, has advised players to wash in cold water to prevent shrinkage. Players have also been asked not to exchange shirts with the likes of Lionel Messi because replacements are in short supply. \u201cBefore crucial qualifying games against Qatar and South Korea, which were played in extreme conditions of humidity, the equipment delivered was not proper. This could have put Iran out of the World Cup,\u201d claimed Queiroz. The striker Karim Ansarifard elaborated: \u201cThey give us large-size socks and after two days and being washed they shrink to a small size.\u201d The supplier, German manufacturer Uhlsport, understandably defended its credibility and Queiroz was forced to deny claims his criticism stemmed from a financial dispute with a Dubai-based kit distributor. Whether Iran have been wearing bona fide Uhlsport gear has also been open to question. \u201cThe gear that we have now, we really don\u2019t know what it is,\u201d said the striker Mohammad Reza Khalatbari. The make and eventual size of the Iran shirt that Messi hangs on his wall is notthe only problem. A training camp in Portugal last September that included a friendly against fellow World Cup qualifiers Ghana was cancelled due to a lack of funds, while the decision to hold a get-together in South Africa in April prompted a fierce row between clubs and country. The timing clashed with four teams\u2019 involvement in the Asian Champions League. They refused to release their employees, the camp went ahead with only 11 players and Queiroz, who had successfully appealed for the domestic league to finish early, threatened to omit the no-shows from the World Cup before eventually backing down. Javad Nekounam, the Iran captain, lamented: \u201cNone of the promises turned into realities. If we did not have good preparation games until the games start, there shouldn\u2019t be any expectations. Whatever happens, the authorities must be held responsible for the results.\u201d Such distractions would be infuriating at the best of times. For a country that desperately craves the release of a World Cup and is passionately behind Queiroz\u2019s team, as shown by the mass celebrations that erupted in Tehran upon qualification, they are lamentable. The starting gun cannot sound quickly enough and Iran must hope a siege mentality has replaced the internal squad divisions that marred previous tournaments. This will be Iran\u2019s fourth World Cup and their record reads three group exits with only one win; albeit the momentous scalp of the USA in 1998. The prospect of Iran reaching the second round for the first time is remote. But low expectations will suit the defensive approach of their manager whose team is designed to absorb pressure, not concede many and has an experienced central-midfield core of the former Osasuna veteran Nekounam plus Andranik Teymourian, of brief Bolton and Fulham fame. Their problems, on the field at least, rest on their potency when they do have the ball, with the squad lacking a proven goalscorer. Ansarifard\u2019s equaliser in a recent 1-1 draw with Angola was Iran\u2019s first goal in three friendly matches. Queiroz has scoured the Iranian diaspora for players to join a predominantly home-based squad. Two, Fulham\u2019s German-Iranian Ashkan Dejagah and Charlton Athletic\u2019s Dutch-Iranian Reza Ghoochannejhad, may carry the responsibility up front along with Ansarifard, the more established but hardly prolific threat. Ghoochannejhad only made his international debut with the qualifying campaign under way, and with Iran in trouble, but his nine goals in 11 appearances underpinned an impressive recovery. \u201cGucci\u201d, as the 26-year-old is known to his friends, sparked delirium with a confident finish in that win over South Korea. Another upset on the biggest stage of all and we may witness another defiant gesture from Queiroz, with his employer at the Iran football federation on the receiving end.", "title": "Carlos Queiroz retaining order amid chaos of Iran\u2019s World Cup buildup", "sentences": ["The striker Karim Ansarifard elaborated: \u201cThey give us large-size socks and after two days and being washed they shrink to a small size.\u201d The supplier, German manufacturer Uhlsport, understandably defended its credibility and Queiroz was forced to deny claims his criticism stemmed from a financial dispute with a Dubai-based kit distributor."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-15T14:34:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2014/jun/17/the-digital-arms-race-and-what-is-being-done-to-fight-it", "tags": ["Technology", "Surveillance", "Software", "Encryption", "Internet", "Hacking", "Computing"], "article": "In March, the world\u2019s biggest surveillance-technology providers gathered in the pristine corridors of the JW Marriot Hotel in Dubai. The occasion was the three-day ISS World conference, the middle east\u2019s largest \u201clawful interception\u201d event. Rooms there cost just under \u00a3200 a night, small change to those business leaders earning significant sums by providing the code used to spy on internet denizens. The following month, fusty halls in Farnborough were filled with many of the same companies at Security &amp; Policing, a Home Office-sponsored event. These firms believe they are supplying tools to the defenders of the free world. Yet the Guardian has been handed evidence their technology and vast numbers of other espionage tools are increasingly being used in countries with questionable human rights records, where activists and media organisations, among others, are under attack. Software for monitoring and accessing victims\u2019 computers Hacking Team was one of the companies expected to attend both events. This Italian outfit has been accused of selling its malicious software to the UAE and Morocco, where an activist and a media organisation were targeted. Its Galileo tool can monitor Skype calls, emails, keystrokes and webcams while allowing remote control over victims\u2019 machines. Research released in February indicates the company\u2019s surreptitious software has been operational in a significant number of nations that civil rights organisations deem repressive. Citizen Lab, a group based out of the University of Toronto consisting of security researchers keen to expose malware used by repressive regimes, details in its Spy Another Day report (previous studies have been given Bond-themed names) several months of internet-mapping efforts. The researchers discovered servers running the malware in as many as 22 countries, including Mexico, Colombia, Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Oman, Sudan, Malaysia, Ethiopia and Saudi Arabia. Of particular concern is Ethiopia. In the second half of last year, Ethiopian Satellite Television (ESAT), a politically focused media outlet, was targeted by Hacking Team malware. Claudio Guarnieri, a security researcher who contributed to the Citizen Lab report, suspects the Ethiopian government adopted Hacking Team technology to replace a suite of tools known as FinFisher, created by British company Gamma International, which is now exporting tools out of Switzerland. \u201cMy assumption is Hacking Team is getting a lot of customers FinFisher lost,\u201d Guarnieri says. Documents seen by the Guardian show that an ESAT contributor found FinFisher malware on their computer in mid-2013. They claimed a subsequent investigation detected FinFisher had been activated on their PC in mid-2012. Hacking Team and Gamma are just two of many European and US companies that make up the $5bn digital surveillance industry. Gamma\u2019s pricey FinFisher tools, costing as much as \u20ac255,000 (\u00a3215,000) for use of the FinSpy tool with support, were previously found by Citizen Lab in use in a wide range of countries, including Bahrain, Egypt, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Pakistan, Turkmenistan and Vietnam.  \u2022 Is the global cost of cybercrime really \u00a3266bn a year? No, it isn\u2019t\u2022 US accuses Russian hacker Evgeniy Bogachev of $100m fraud\u2022 Chinese military group linked to hacks of satellite companies  Human rights activists aren\u2019t impressed. \u201cWhat is worrying is that much of this offensive digital capability is being sold as lawful intercept software in countries where rule of law is not robust,\u201d says Citizen Lab researcher Morgan Marquis-Boire. Gamma has not responded to a request for comment. But legal counsel for Hacking Team, Eric Rabe, says over email that the company stops supplying its services when they are used for \u201cgross human rights abuses\u201d. Nor does it \u201csell products to governments or to countries blacklisted by the US, EU, UN, Nato or Asean\u201d. Yet when asked what blacklists Hacking Team uses, Rabe does not respond, nor does he reply to questions about the additional customers identified by Citizen Lab. Hacking Team has previously told the Guardian that \u201cHacking Team complies, in all its dealings, with all relevant UK legislation and regulation\u201d. Smoking out RATs Governments also have many of their own bespoke capabilities, creating highly sophisticated offensive software. The Stuxnet malware, uncovered in 2010, is the most infamous. Believed to have been the work of US and Israeli agents, it disrupted centrifuges at an Iranian nuclear plant. Few similar examples been uncovered since. But other government attacks have not been so well hidden, especially those using commonly available remote access Trojans, less sophisticated versions of Hacking Team-type technology. The Guardian has learned of many such attacks ostensibly launched by repressive regimes in the past two years. In the UAE, activists were repeatedly targeted by the SpyNet RAT in 2013, according to Bill Marczak, another member of the Citizen Lab team, who is based out of the University of California, Berkeley. They were sent a video of a fake protest via email. Once clicked on, the videos played, but the RATs were silently downloaded on to victims\u2019 PCs. The video even mentioned Ahmed Mansoor, the UAE activist targeted by Hacking Team malware in 2012. Marczak believes the UAE administration has moved away from using costly Hacking Team kit to this \u201coff-the-shelf\u201d software. Among recent victims was the wife of a political detainee in the country, Marczak says. Eva Galperin, security expert from the Electronic Frontier Foundation, was recently targeted by similar malware, along with an Associated Press journalist and a Vietnamese pro-democracy blogger. She is convinced the Trojan sent to her via email, purporting to come from charity Oxfam, actually came from Vietnamese government hackers. Tibetans continue to be battered by such attacks too. Security firm AlienVault\u2019s own research has been used as a lure to convince email recipients into clicking on links that lead to infection, says the company\u2019s research director, Jaime Blasco.  Previously undocumented attacks stemming from 2012 hit a range of targets, including the Tibetan government in exile, the Tibetan People\u2019s Mass Movement and the Bureau du Tibet in Brussels. The same hackers went after Voice of America, the official broadcaster of the US government, according to Blasco. Elsewhere, the Guardian has learned that in in January, a number of Ukrainian websites disseminating information on the protests against former President Viktor Yanukovych\u2019s regime were taken down with distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, which use infected machines, known as bots, to flood web servers with traffic to force them offline.  Access to botnets is sold on underground forums, or they can be created by infecting large numbers of machines, which are tied together with attackers\u2019 command and control systems. Fighting digital arms Governments\u2019 arsenals are replete with hacking tools then, some sophisticated, others blunt. And they are regularly used the world over, often by repressive regimes. But the fight against the use of digital arms on citizens is gathering steam. While Citizen Lab and the EFF are shining a light on the wide-scale use of government-controlled malware, others are taking action at both technical and political levels. In Europe, MEP Marietje Schaake has launched the Stop Digital Arms Trade initiative, supported by UK-based non-profit Privacy International. She is lobbying hard on acquiring legally binding agreements across member states to enforce export controls on the likes of Hacking Team and Gamma. Currently, \u201cthey are doing very little\u201d to address the issues, Schaake notes. \u201cWe have to preserve and defend our values and that\u2019s why it\u2019s even more surprising is that there is basically no regulation on the production or export of what I call digital arms. Often people do not realise the EU is not seeking to curb this trade,\u201d she says. There has been one notable political success in the fight against this software. Thanks to recommendations from the UK and French governments, the Wassenaar Arrangement, a multilateral export regime controlling weapons, accepted two new categories. One covered \u201cadvanced persistent threat software\u201d and offensive cyber tools\u201d, the other \u201cIP network surveillance systems\u201d. It remains to be seen which signatories adopt export controls, but activists are upbeat. Privacy International is taking the fight to Gamma too. Following official complaints about the export of the technology, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development is currently deciding whether or not its rules have been broken by Gamma\u2019s exports. The German National Contact Point for the OECD decided not to investigate, but the UK side is continuing to look into the matter. For technical assistance, Netherlands-based Digital Defenders, founded in 2012 by international development organisation Hivos, offers recourse to those under attack from governments. It stepped in to help those Ukrainian sites hit by DDoS attacks, which wished to remain anonymous. A Digital Defenders consultant acted as a middle man to help bring in Google\u2019s new Shield offering, part of the internet giant\u2019s altruistic efforts to protect activists, to prevent future DDoS strikes. Founder Fieke Jansen says the organisation, which has secured financial support from the US, Dutch, Estonian, Latvian, Czech and Swiss governments, now has its own DDoS-mitigation service, which can be used for free. Over in the US, a crew of security professionals are establishing a \u201cpeace corps for hackers\u201d, as one of the founders, Josh Corman, describes it. Currently called I Am The Cavalry, it will look at helping citizens on a range of security issues, focusing on public safety and making it more difficult for any kind of attack to take place, especially ones that have a physical impact. Corman believes the rush to connect everything to the internet, from medical devices to cars, is leaving people vulnerable and no one, especially not government, is coming to save them. Finding common ground Though these groups agree citizens need greater protection from the myriad threats facing them, they do not agree on how to secure it. Any kind of regulation is likely to be met with scepticism from the security community, largely because governments are the biggest buyers of legally accepted offensive tools. An outright ban of exploit code might have negative consequences.

The global body, Fide, now has official world rankings for one-hour rapid games and for 10-minute blitz. This week the Fide world rapid and blitz championships surged to a new level of high-class participants, as a $400,000 prize fund attracted the elite headed by the world champion, Magnus Carlsen, to Dubai. Most major nations were represented in the 15 rapid rounds spread over three days. However, the English Chess Federation omitted to send anyone. In contrast France, our main rivals in western Europe, had three of its best players in Dubai, while Spain, Germany and the Netherlands were also represented by leading grandmasters. Carlsen was seeded only No4 at rapid, and said before the start that he felt \u201cbothered\u201d to be below No1. His top-seeded arch-rival, Hikaru Nakamura of the US, was beaten in the very first round, and by the end of the first day Italy\u2019s Fabiano Caruana had 4.5/5. Caruana used to have a reputation as a poor speed player but realising that rapid and blitz are now major disciplines he worked on it, and this smart fifth-round win put him top of the\u00a0rankings.

Instead, it allows him to explore in a commendably high-minded fashion the topic on hand, with a curatorial bent: Here Be Dragons examined Albania&apos;s under-assault film heritage, The Story of Children and Film disinterred a number of forgotten works from Iran and eastern Europe, and What Is This Film Called Love? evokes Eisenstein&apos;s trip to Mexico in the early 1930s. However, what marks Cousins&apos; films out are their self-reflexive bent, the sense that he is working out ideas in front (or, just as frequently, behind) the camera as he communicates an intensely felt passion. Its this quality \u2013 of unabashed quasi-literary expressiveness and highly personalised reflections \u2013 that allows Cousins to connect so strongly with a proportion of the audience, those thirsting for cinema to reverse its flight towards lowest common denominator. That said, it also conveys a sense of self-advertisement \u2013 you won&apos;t catch Slavoj Zizek stripping naked and coyly covering his genitalia with a laptop, as Cousins does here. (And after Cousins&apos; impassioned, outraged defence of &quot;naked rambler&quot; Stephen Gough, it&apos;s a bit of a cop-out, no?) Cousins is also obviously rather good at conveying flatteringly high-grade praise and love for those in his sights, another quality that rubs off on the audience. Be that as it may, Life May Be is an enterprising double film, couched in the form of a series of video letters \u2013 the letter being another favourite Cousins device \u2013 between him and Iranian actor-director-artist Mania Akbari. Akbari was the performer in Abbas Kiarostami&apos;s car-bound Ten; after directing her own films, she left Iran for London in 2011. Commissioned to write the sleeve notes for a DVD release of Akbari&apos;s directorial debut 20 Fingers, Cousins&apos; contribution (in the form of a letter, unsurprisingly) triggered the dialogue between them.  In his missives, Cousins sticks to his now-characteristic meld of travel photography, aesthetic analysis and meandering philosophising. Some of it is brilliant \u2013 an extended opening shot records, in real time as Cousins recites his DVD sleeve notes in full, the mist slowly clearing from a Scottish valley; another segment shows his approach to the gigantic memorial to victims of Nazi massacres in Kaunas in Lithuania. Akbari, in contrast, has taken a much less whimsical approach: her first &quot;letter&quot; is composed of snapshots of her former home in Iran and of temporary stopovers in Dubai and Malmo; her second, a record of the rather more joyless exile existence she has established in London as well as the after-effects of breast cancer.  You also get a clear sense of how Akbari works her life experiences into her creative work; something that distinguishes her from Cousins who, for all his eloquence, is essentially strip-mining a film-festival-and-hotel-room lifestyle. On the other hand, that could be the source of his charm, spinning elaborate ideas and shooting idiosyncratic film in environments where others are content to sit on their hands. For that Cousins certainly deserves admiration.", "title": "Life May Be: Edinburgh 2014 review \u2013 intensely felt passion with a sense of self-advertisement", "sentences": ["Akbari, in contrast, has taken a much less whimsical approach: her first &quot;letter&quot; is composed of snapshots of her former home in Iran and of temporary stopovers in Dubai and Malmo; her second, a record of the rather more joyless exile existence she has established in London as well as the after-effects of breast cancer."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-21T08:00:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/jun/23/investment-property-boom-house-price-warning", "tags": ["House prices", "Investment funds", "Investing", "Money", "Business", "World news"], "article": "Global investors are betting on a substantial property boom despite warnings that housing in many countries is already overvalued. According to a large study, sovereign wealth funds are seeking to boost returns by placing a larger proportion of their funds than last year in property, infrastructure projects and emerging markets. More than half of respondents said they increased their property portfolios to benefit from a long-term rise in land and real estate values in developed- and developing-world markets. The survey, by fund manager Invesco, found that while safer assets in the west remained the first choice of investors, the demand for bigger returns had accelerated investments in riskier assets. Fifty-two funds worth more than $5.7tn (\u00a33.4tn) responded to the survey, which tracks the investment preferences of the world&apos;s largest government-backed investment groups. Norway&apos;s $878bn pension fund is the most valuable. Alongside an increase in funds for property investment, sovereign wealth funds also spent 2013 pumping more money into private equity, hedge funds, infrastructure projects and commodities to offset low returns on sovereign bonds and move away from volatile equity markets. Among western nations, funds said Britain&apos;s political stability and welcoming attitude to foreign investment made it the first choice. Latin America, Africa and China were among the developing regions to benefit from sovereign wealth fund investments. The funds have seen their coffers swell in recent years following a recovery in stock markets and a huge influx of cash from their sponsoring nations, which have channelled trade surpluses in their direction. Total fund assets are understood to be in excess of $30tn, though much of it is held in offshore tax havens where assets remain cloaked in secrecy. Invesco said the sharp increase in cash, mostly generated by selling oil and gas and other commodities, has forced sovereign wealth funds to look at longer-term strategic investments for more sustainable profits. The report found that 51% of respondents increased their exposure to real estate relative to the rest of their portfolio and 29% increased the proportion invested in private equity. Investments in infrastructure, hedge funds and commodities were also projected to increase this year by more than investments in equities or bonds, it added. The findings come despite warnings from the IMF that house prices are well above their historical average in many countries. The global lender of last resort said this month that the acceleration in global house prices from already high levels is now a threat to economic stability. It cited Australia, Belgium, Canada, Norway and Sweden as some of the countries that have failed to bring down prices to historic norms. Dubai is among several emerging nations to experience 20% or more house price gains in the last year. Nick Tolchard, co-chair of Invesco&apos;s global sovereign group, said fund managers were limiting the risk of a housing crash by looking beyond property hotspots to cheaper cities and regions. &quot;These types of fund don&apos;t have fixed liabilities and so can take a longer view and take more risks. Property represents a good long term capital return and consistent yield. Our sense is that funds are not investing in areas at risk of a bubble, but a more diversified portfolio,&quot; he said. The survey found global infrastructure was particularly popular, with 47% of sovereign investors increasing their exposure in 2013 compared to 22% in 2012. &quot;Britain came out top among the top 10 funds as a target for investment and clearly real estate is a part of that. But they are also looking at infrastructure, especially now that investment vehicles backing individual projects are becoming more available,&quot; he added.", "title": "Investors counting on property boom despite house price warning", "sentences": ["Dubai is among several emerging nations to experience 20% or more house price gains in the last year."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-22T23:02:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2014/jun/23/world-cup-itv-bbc-tv-studios", "tags": ["World Cup 2014", "World Cup", "Football", "Sport", "Sport TV", "Adrian Chiles", "ITV channel", "BBC", "Television"], "article": "\u2018NO! YES! GET IT! WHOA!\u201d I can hear the shouts before I reach the studio. When I then do walk into ITV\u2019s World Cup base in Rio, it feels a lot like arriving at a mate\u2019s flat and finding him on the sofa with three blokes, all screaming at the football on TV. \u201cOh my GOD! Look at THAT!\u201d It\u2019s early Saturday afternoon and Adrian Chiles, Fabio Cannavaro, Patrick Vieira and Martin O\u2019Neill, all wearing the requisite sports commentator uniform of a buttoned-down long-sleeve shirt and smart trousers (often too tight on the English commentators, for some reason), are supposed to be researching the Argentina v Iran match for their upcoming live show. But they are all just bellowing at the telly. \u201cI hope Iran win or draw. It would be such a great story,\u201d says Chiles. Vieira looks at him as if he\u2019s the biggest dork he\u2019s ever encountered: \u201cNo! Argentina, of course!\u201d he says with an extreme \u201clike duh\u201d expression on his face and hammily rolls his eyes at me. Therein lies the difference between the newsman and the athlete: one\u2019s looking for the story and one\u2019s looking for the best sportsmen. \u201cOh my GOD!\u201d All four men make shouts of varying volume (Chiles is, unsurprisingly, the most voluble) and reel back in their chairs as Lionel Messi saves his country\u2019s honour in added time. And then they all lean forward to make notes. Stretching across the lovely Copacabana beach boulevard is a gigantic metallic structure, interrupting the road like a belch. This monstrosity is the somewhat unlikely base for some of the biggest TV networks covering the World Cup, including the BBC and ITV. Those familiar slick studios that you see on TV are housed inside a giant carbuncle that, until I went in, I assumed was a half-finished building site. And until you get to the studios, that\u2019s pretty much how it looks on the inside, too: when Tom Jenkins, the Guardian\u2019s photographer, and I visit the BBC studios, we ride with a larky Alan Hansen and a cool and silent Thierry Henry in a lift that looks more like a safety hazard on a construction site than something befitting Mr Va-va-voom (Hansen, on the other hand, doesn\u2019t look wildly out of place among loose cables and metallic rafters.) By the time I visit the TV studios in Rio, a week into the World Cup, stories generated by the presenters have included ITV\u2019s studio being shot at by protesters, Phil Neville\u2019s monotone, Henry\u2019s cardigan, Hansen\u2019s retirement, Ian Wright\u2019s family being burgled, Jonathan Pearce\u2019s difficulty in comprehending goalline technology, Glenn Hoddle\u2019s camel toe (don\u2019t ask) and various alleged spats among them all. Many papers have already published lists rating the presenters, much as they\u2019ve done of the teams. Sports presenters in England have always attracted cheers and jeers from audiences, but never before have the commentators been quite so commentated on, thanks to an increasingly celebrity-led approach by the TV stations and newspapers, and, of course, the internet. Where once TV viewers would mock the presenters to their friends on the sofa, now they do so to everyone on social media, and the TV people listen: at the BBC and ITV producers mentioned to me, through gritted teeth, what people on Twitter are saying about their shows and presenters. I\u2019m not sure when Brussels issued a decree saying that British coverage of sports events must always consist of one host and three guests (men, ideally, and, in the case of the World Cup coverage, only) sitting round a low table, and the men must always wear the previously mentioned uniform, but rest assured, EU bureaucrats: the BBC and ITV adhere to that law religiously in their World Cup coverage. Yet despite the surface similarities, there are definite differences between them, and I wondered if this just came down to a difference between the hosts: self-consciously everyman Adrian Chiles on ITV and boyish smoothie Gary Lineker on the BBC. Walking into ITV\u2019s studio, that supposition appears to be accurate \u2013 it is as scruffy and relaxed and, yes, blokey as Chiles. They haven\u2019t even replaced the bullet-scarred glass. They did order a special pane of replacement glass and had it transported all the way from S\u00e3o Paulo, shut off the road beneath the studio so the work could be done \u2013 and then someone dropped the glass and it shattered. \u201cSo we now see it as a battle wound,\u201d says Niall Sloane, ITV\u2019s controller of sport. \u201cWe\u2019re showing the people at home, look how we suffer for you.\u201d     Adrian Chiles enjoys a cuppa next to Fabio Cannavaro in the ITV studio. Photograph: Tom Jenkins    When Tom and I arrive, Martin Keown has popped downstairs from the BBC studio to visit his former Arsenal team-mate Vieira. \u201cWe have a healthy rivalry, but it\u2019s all very friendly. All the pundits know each other,\u201d one BBC employee tells me later. So do they all stay in the same hotel together? \u201cEr, no. That would be going a bit far.\u201d In terms of ratings, ITV is winning the rivalry this time: their screening of England versus Uruguay got a peak of 20m viewers whereas the BBC\u2019s screening of England-Italy got 15.5m. This is really because of the timing of the games \u2013 the Italy game kicked off at 11pm (BST) \u2013 and, after the BBC got first dibs on which game it wanted it to cover in the European Championship, it was ITV\u2019s turn to baggsie the best game first this time. There is a loosey-goosey air inside the ITV studio, and not just from the busted window pane. Tom is asked not to take a photo of Keown in the ITV studio, but other than that we\u2019re allowed to climb all over the place and do as we please. O\u2019Neill intently watches the Argentina v Iran match and does his best to pretend we\u2019re not there, Vieira and Cannavaro gleefully tweet away on their phones and Chiles beckons me over for a chat. So that must have been pretty scary when protesters shot at him the first night? \u201cOh yeah, for sure. We could see them coming down the street and I thought they were just going to be waving banners, but then there was a bullet! Then I was led away to make-up.\u201d Even offscreen, Chiles talks in that studiedly blokey tone that seems to afflict English male TV presenters when they move into football coverage. Viewers can be cruel about Chiles (Stewart Lee memorably described him as a talking Toby Jug full of steaming hot piss), but he seems relaxed and open. He jokes about how Vieira and Cannavaro like to tweet but he never does and, considering some of the things I\u2019ve seen written about him online, that may be for the best. \u201cYou want to have a bit of fun \u2013 you don\u2019t want it to feel like a royal obit. It\u2019s a mix of analysis and punditry, and you have to enjoy it and take it seriously. It\u2019s like being a football fan, really. You know it doesn\u2019t mean a hill of beans but West Brom governs my life, my relationships \u2013 GET IT!\u201d Speaking of relationships, does he think there might ever be a woman on the panel? He blinks before answering: \u201cDepends how big the team is. I don\u2019t think you could replace any of the pundits \u2013 maybe you could replace me! Certainly some of the most knowledgeable football fans I know are women. But there are only so many seats round the table and you wouldn\u2019t drop any of the pundits. WHOA!\u201d When I ask Sloane about the lack of women, he says they\u2019d \u201cconsider\u201d having a female pundit. The BBC later answer this question a little better, saying that they want pundits who have had experience in the sport, and this being men\u2019s football, that means men. But it\u2019s still ridiculous, of course, that neither ITV nor BBC have any female commentators for the whole of their World Cup coverage. But then, I am the only woman from the whole of Fleet Street who was sent out to Brazil so it\u2019s not like TV is the only one with a gender bias when it comes to sport.     Patrick Vieira, left, and Fabio Cannavaro enjoy the Argentina v Iran match in the ITV studio. Photograph: Tom Jenkins    Chiles runs out for a pre-show loo break and I settle into his chair (turns out a woman can fit round the table, even with my enormous child-bearing hips and all.) Vieira tries to tease O\u2019Neill into joining the conversation but he\u2019s having none of it. Cannavaro\u2019s English can generously be described as patchy \u2013 \u201cI learned three years ago, and in Dubai!\u201d \u2013 and he is sweetly nervous, deferring frequently to Vieira who he describes as \u201cmy best friend\u201d: \u201c[Commentating] is tough sometimes, because of the language, and it\u2019s strange because we were once on the pitch but now we\u2019re outside it. But for [Patrick and me], it\u2019s important because we want to be coaches so we can learn a lot doing this,\u201d Cannavaro says. So coaching is his real ambition? \u201cYes, certainly.\u201d Is he competitive with the other footballers-turned-commentators on the BBC? \u201cOh no, not competitive \u2013 they can\u2019t compete with us!\u201d Vieira is the more practised hand at this World Cup commentating lark and is more confident for it. He looks for all the world like a man who can\u2019t believe that he somehow lucked into this job: \u201cAm I enjoying this? Are you kidding? It gets easier [with time] because I\u2019m getting more comfortable in myself and can find my own space. Having Fabio here makes it more fun.\u201d And the two return to tweeting. If walking into the ITV studio felt a bit like coming on to the set of Men Behaving Badly, then entering the BBC\u2019s is like approaching the Death Star. It is slick, black and absolutely enormous. There is none of the sense of relaxed fun found in the ITV studio \u2013 it\u2019s all deeply serious tunnel vision and I am strictly forbidden from talking to what is referred to as \u201cthe talent\u201d and, no, talking to them the following morning isn\u2019t really possible either so don\u2019t bother. (In fact, Lineker comes over and engages in a bit of friendly chat with Tom before going on air, but that, apparently, is a one-off.) The aforementioned talent \u2013 in this case, Lineker, Hansen, Henry and Clarence Seedorf \u2013 sit silently and stare at the TV that\u2019s weirdly embedded into the table, making them look even more remote and internalised (at ITV, the TV is set up beneath one of the cameras, so the four men stare in front of them, like normal TV watchers). Maybe it feels more serious up here because we\u2019re closer to transmission time. But it wouldn\u2019t have made any difference if I\u2019d come to the studio earlier as the men don\u2019t arrive until the very last minute, so there is none of that sense of camaraderie found downstairs (indeed, in the lift Henry didn\u2019t even look at Hansen). Whereas ITV let me listen in on a headset to the planning of the show and stay around while Chiles talked with the guests about the running order, Tom and I are firmly ushered out of the BBC\u2019s studio as soon as all four men are in their seat, as though we were going to leak details of their tactics. There is an edginess to the BBC visit besides the issue of whether or not I can chat with the talent. Questions about any dismay in the corporation about the (extremely overblown) reaction to Neville\u2019s appearance are dealt with sensibly (\u201cbad night\u201d, \u201cTwitter frenzy\u201d, etc) Yet it is stressed repeatedly that the only reason that the BBC have a bigger and much better studio is because they claimed it from Fifa first. It is also most insistently repeated that the reason the BBC have more than twice as many people in Rio as ITV (272 to ITV\u2019s 125) is because ITV are \u201cjust producing television\u201d, whereas the BBC have online, news and so forth.     The BBC TV World Cup studio at Copacabana beach with (from left) Clarence Seedorf, Thierry Henry and Alan Hansen preparing for Germany v Ghana. Photograph: Tom Jenkins    So maybe the BBC have just been burned by stories in the past about how many people they bring to these events, and how much money is spent. Or maybe their nerviness stems from the fact they\u2019ve received the brunt of the criticism this time. Or maybe this seriousness is what it takes to make a slicker programme, and the BBC\u2019s coverage is definitely slicker, and probably better.

Tahir-ul-Qadri, the Canada-based leader of a moderate Islamic party in Pakistan, refused to disembark from the Emirates airliner after the government forced the plane to divert from Islamabad to Lahore, 150 miles to the south-east of the capital. The cleric, whose army of supporters brought Islamabad to a standstill last year, remained on board issuing demands by phone from his business-class seat for the army to come and rescue him. Qadri claims his life is in danger following the killing of eight activists from his Pakistan Awami Tehreek (PAT) party last week by police in Lahore. That incident, triggered by police attempts to clear security barriers from around his office complex, increased the importance of a man who had otherwise been regarded by most observers as posing little threat to the government. Shahbaz Sharif, chief minister of Punjab, was forced to sack the provincial law chief over the incident and promised a full investigation. The ruling faction of the Pakistan Muslim League (PML-N) led by the prime minister, Nawaz Sharif, appears alarmed by Qadri&apos;s potential to cause trouble at a time when tensions with the country&apos;s army are running high and the opposition politician Imran Khan is challenging the government&apos;s mandate. Prior to his scheduled arrival, roads from the airport were blocked off with shipping containers, and mobile phone services were suspended in places. The flight from Dubai circled Islamabad for more than an hour while Qadri&apos;s supporters clashed with police outside the airport. After the army failed to respond to Qadri&apos;s demands for senior officers to come and meet him at Lahore airport, the situation was eventually defused by Mohammad Sarwar, a former Glasgow Labour MP who now serves as governor of Punjab, who boarded the plane to talk directly with Qadri. The cleric agreed to accompany Sarwar in an armoured vehicle to the Lahore hospital where his injured party workers were being treated. &quot;I fear Shahbaz Sharif&apos;s terrorists will try to attack me and I want the governor to embrace martyrdom with me,&quot; Qadri told local television. He described the diversion of the plane as a &quot;hijacking&quot; by the government. Qadri, 63, runs not only the PAT, which has never won significant numbers of seats in parliament, but also the Minhaj-ul-Qur&apos;an (MQI), an international charitable foundation rooted in Barelvism, an Islamic sect generally thought to be relatively liberal. Many commentators are puzzled by what he hopes to achieve, believing he has little chance of achieving his stated desire of sparking an Arab spring-style revolution in a country that went to the polls less than a year ago. In January last year, months before general elections, he marched on Islamabad with tens of thousands of his supporters to demand fundamental reforms to an electoral system he claimed was rotten. Despite camping out for days on the capital&apos;s main avenue in a specially constructed bomb-proof metal box, none of his demands were met, although the government agreed to a sign a list of promises that helped him save face. Qadri&apos;s rhetoric echoes recent claims by Imran Khan, the former cricketer turned populist politician, that last year&apos;s election was rigged in favour of the PML-N.", "title": "Pakistani cleric claims government 'hijack' after flight diverted from capital", "sentences": ["The flight from Dubai circled Islamabad for more than an hour while Qadri&apos;s supporters clashed with police outside the airport."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-23T17:12:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jun/23/small-print-public-land-infrastructure-bill-lords-uk", "tags": ["Planning policy", "Politics", "UK news", "House of Lords"], "article": "Planning laws inhibit prosperity. That&apos;s what we&apos;re told by almost everyone. Those long and tortuous negotiations over what should be built where are a brake on progress. All the major parties and most of the media believe that we would be better off with less regulation, less discussion and more speed. Try telling that to the people of Spain and Ireland. Town planning in those countries amounts to shaking a giant dustbin over the land. Houses are littered randomly across landscapes of tremendous beauty, and are so disaggregated that they&apos;re almost impossible to provide with public services. The result, of course, is a great advance in human welfare. Oh, wait a moment. No, it&apos;s economic collapse followed by mass unemployment. Spain and Ireland removed the brakes on progress and the car rolled over a precipice. Their barely regulated planning systems permitted the creation of property bubbles that trashed the economy along with the land. Needless to say, we have learned nothing from this. Our lords and masters still whip the buttocks of the Gaderene swine. When the infrastructure bill was\u00a0discussed in the House of Lords last\u00a0week, our unelected legislators rained curses upon peace and quiet, beauty and stillness. Lord Adonis, a Labour peer, complained that &quot;for the first time in 350 years, Britain will no longer have the world&apos;s largest port or airport. That accolade will pass, symbolically, to Dubai&quot;. The shame of it \u2013 to have some\u00a0upstart petro-city making more noise and pollution than we do. For the government, Baroness Kramer boasted that &quot;we are making the biggest investment in roads since the 1970s&quot;. The Conservative peer Lord Jenkin, in discussing the new freedoms for frackers the government proposes, celebrated what he called a &quot;drill, baby, drill bill&quot;. All this, we are assured, will enhance the life of the nation. Since the 1980s, the Department for Transport has consistently forecast traffic growth along a steep trajectory. But the distance covered by car drivers in England is now 7% lower than it was in 1997. The total volume of traffic has flatlined since 2002, nixing every prediction the department has made. Last year, 32 transport professors wrote to the secretary of state pointing out that, in the absence of traffic growth, &quot;the basis for major infrastructure spending decisions appears to be changing&quot;. The only thing likely to induce more traffic growth, they argued, is building more trunk roads, and that would put intolerable pressure on the city streets into which they feed. The facts might have changed, but the policy\u00a0remains the same. The department continues to make the same failed\u00a0forecasts, using the same failed model. The desire to build \u2013 and to appease the construction industry and motoring lobby \u2013 comes first, and the forecasts are made to fit. So is the planning system. The government&apos;s draft national policy statement for major roads weakens the protection of wildlife, ancient woodlands and treasured landscapes. It forbids any consideration of climate change during planning inquiries: motorways will officially produce no more carbon dioxide than cycle paths. Not a word of this was heard in the chamber last Wednesday. No one questioned the need for the road-building programme of which the government boasted. The peers, an unlikely club of boy racers, stood only to demand that we should go further and faster, on a journey without purpose or destination. If they have their way, we will become the proud recipients of a new network of roads to nowhere. Like Benidorm&apos;s In Tempo towers, the tallest residential buildings in Europe, they will be commissioned in a convulsion of optimism and greed, before becoming monuments to bad debt and human folly. &quot;Round the decay of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare\u2026&quot;. Campaigners and opposition peers fear that the bill could also licence the government to sell off any public land it chooses, while cancelling, without process or debate, public access and use. Clauses 21 and 22 allow it to transfer property from other public bodies to the Homes and Communities Agency and permanently to extinguish easements (rights of use), public rights of way, and the protections afforded to consecrated ground. The HCA can then sell this land to developers, free from public rights.The news site  Schnews reveals that during the great battle over the coalition&apos;s attempt to sell off the public forest estate, which resulted in the government&apos;s first\u00a0major U-turn, one\u00a0of\u00a0the campaigners received an anonymous call from a civil servant. &quot;The forests are just the start,&quot; he warned. &quot;They are absolutely determined to sell every scrap of public land\u00a0\u2013 beaches, parks, the lot.&quot; Is that what this is? I don&apos;t know. During the Lords debate, Baroness Kramer insisted that this measure applies only to &quot;surplus land&quot; and &quot;applies only to private rights and not to those that are public&quot;. Just one problem: there are no such safeguards in the bill. The word &quot;surplus&quot; does not occur anywhere, and the bill creates specific powers &quot;to extinguish public rights of way&quot;. Yes, public \u2013 not private. Had Kramer read the bill she moved? Or was she making it up as she went along? In either case, until this is either clarified or struck out, the forests for which we fought so hard and, perhaps, all other state-owned land could be at risk.

Crisford, 52, joined Godolphin when the global operation was founded by Sheikh Mohammed al-Maktoum, the ruler of Dubai, in 1994, and was a key member of its team as it rose to become one of the dominant powers in world racing. In addition to sharing in Godolphin\u2019s many successes Crisford was also the public face of the operation in the spring of 2013 when Mahmood al-Zarooni, who trained for Godolphin at Moulton Paddocks in Newmarket, was found to have doped at least 22 of his horses with anabolic steroids. In the aftermath of the Zarooni scandal Lord Stevens, a former commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, conducted an inquiry into Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s global equine operations, which decided that Zarooni had acted alone but also identified \u201cmanagement failings, insufficient oversight and a sense of complacency\u201d in the organisation. Crisford, who initially recommended Zarooni to Sheikh Mohammed as a potential employee, relinquished his role as Godolpin\u2019s racing manager a fortnight later. \u201cI am very excited to be setting up my own training business,\u201d Crisford said on Tuesday. \u201cIt is something I have always wanted to do and I am delighted to have the opportunity to realise that ambition now.

Australia and Kingston Hill, first and second in the Derby at Epsom, were among 11 confirmations for the Classic on Tuesday but, while Australia would prefer good ground or faster, Kingston Hill\u2019s connections would like to see some rain before committing to run. \u201cWe\u2019ve had the same protracted dry spell as the UK,\u201d Hensey said, \u201cand the ground was good to firm this morning. We\u2019ve watered lightly to maintain that and put on four millimetres, but we\u2019ve been cautious because we are expecting some rain over the next few days. \u201cThere seems to be a difference of opinion on what we might get. There is a band of rain across the south of the country and there seems to be two schools of thought about how far north it will come [but] it is not just the amount, it\u2019s also the timing. \u201cThe initial forecast was that the weather would break from Wednesday night into Thursday, but this morning that has changed, and the rainfall may now be late on Thursday and into Friday.\u201d Australia is odds-on at 2-5 to confirm his Epsom superiority on Saturday while Kingston Hill is a 3-1 chance.

It was unusual in its sheer scale: more than three years of police work; 42,000 pages of crown evidence; seven months of hearings; up to 18 barristers in court at any one time; 12 defendants facing allegations of crime spreading back over a decade.  But what made it most unusual was what it represented. First, this was a long-delayed showdown between the criminal justice system and parts of Fleet Street, in which the reputations of both was at stake. Beyond that, however, this was a trial by proxy, in which Rebekah Brooks stood in the dock on behalf of a media mogul and Andy Coulson acted as avatar for the prime minister, with the reputations of Rupert Murdoch and David Cameron equally in jeopardy. Officially, the trial was all about crime; in reality, it was all about power. And just as the main players were absent from the court, so the real issues which for years had inflamed public opinion were not mentioned on the indictment \u2013 the perception that some news organisations were all too happy to invade privacy and ruin lives in order to sell more papers; that they regarded themselves as not only above the law but above the government, which would do their will or suffer for it; that they had poisoned the mainstream of public debate with a daily drip-feed of falsehood and distortion. On the afternoon of 30 October 2013, as the prosecuting counsel, Andrew Edis QC, first rose to his feet, I looked across at the 12 jurors who had just been empanelled \u2013 mixed gender, mixed race, mixed age \u2013 and thought that they represented arguably the most ancient form of democracy (centuries older than the idea of voting); that this was the moment when all the wealth and influence of the Murdoch network finally confronted a form of popular will which they could not compromise. It was not as simple as that. Somebody called it the trial of the century. That worked well enough as an indication of its scale and of the highly unusual status of some of those in the dock. But it was more accurate in another sense, that, as the weeks went by, this trial came to embody the peculiar values of this particular century \u2013 its materialism and the inequality which goes with it, the dominance of corporation over state. The judge, Mr Justice Saunders, was outstanding \u2013 clever, considerate, surprisingly funny, displaying never a flicker of fear or favour towards the ambassadors of the power elite who sat before him in the dock. The jurors were a tribute to the jury system. Their facial reactions each day showed that their concentration scarcely wavered during the marathon (though one had the initially alarming habit of listening with her eyes shut). Often, they sent written notes to the judge which were extraordinarily astute, spotting glitches in the evidence which had been missed by every single one of the highly paid counsel in front of them. But ...  Rolls-Royce defence Rupert Murdoch\u2019s money flooded that courtroom. It flowed into the defence of Rebekah Brooks, because he backed her; and to the defence of Andy Coulson, because Coulson had sued and forced him to pay. Lawyers and court reporters who spend their working lives at the Old Bailey agreed they had never seen anything like it, this multimillion-pound Rolls-Royce engine purring through the proceedings. Soon we found ourselves watching the power of the private purse knocking six bells out of the underfunded public sector.     Rupert Murdoch: the Sun and ex-News of the World owner's money flooded the courtroom. Photograph: Facundo Arrizabalaga/EPA    In the background, for sure, there was a huge publicly funded police inquiry, forced by the stench of past failure to investigate thoroughly the crime which had been ignored and concealed for so long. But when it came to handling the police evidence in court, Brooks and Coulson had squads of senior partners, junior solicitors and paralegals, as well as a highly efficient team monitoring all news and social media. The cost to Murdoch ran into millions. Against that, the Crown Prosecution Service had only one full-time solicitor attached to the trial and one admin assistant. They worked assiduously. One prosecution source said it was surprising they had not simply collapsed under the strain. The effect was clear. Defence barristers would pause, turn and find a solicitor to feed them information while crown counsel often found an empty seat. The defence produced neatly laminated bundles of evidence, while the crown hastily photocopied material into files which sometimes proved to be incomplete.  Towards the end of the trial, Edis decided the jurors needed an electronic index to be installed on a computer in the jury room to help them find their way through the avalanche of paperwork which had descended on them. With the CPS struggling for cash, Edis offered to pay for it out of his own pocket, and, in the absence of CPS manpower, two junior crown counsels had to create the index themselves. Over and again, the defence teams had the resources to find some helpful stick with which to beat a potentially dangerous witness \u2013 a misremembered date, a forgotten detail, even on one occasion the fact that the witness had once had coffee with Nick Davies from the Guardian. So they were able to create complication, confusion, doubt. An expert witness claimed to be able to track the movements of defendants by analysing their use of mobile phones: the prosecution failed to notice that his conclusions were contradicted by his own data; he was chopped to pieces by the defence and admonished by the judge. The jury was told that the News of the World had hacked phones to obtain a story about Paul McCartney having a row with his then wife Heather Mills and throwing their engagement ring out of a hotel window: the prosecution failed to take account of evidence in the possession of the police which indicated the paper had bought the story from someone who worked in the hotel. These weaknesses were exploited by the kind of high-octane cross-examination which could raise reasonable doubt about whether the witness is breathing. (\u201cWhen did you start this breathing? \u2026 You can\u2019t remember?! \u2026 How often do you breathe? \u2026 You don\u2019t know?!\u201d). Here the disparity in funding was striking but not so important. There were masterclasses in the skills of advocacy from Edis as well as from some of those acting for those in the dock. It simply stuck in the craw that Edis was earning less than 10% of the daily fees enjoyed by some of his opponents.     Andrew Edis QC: the lead prosecutor earned less than 10% of some defence barristers' daily fees. Photograph: Andy Rain/EPA    Finally, the crown was hampered by the rules of court that allow it to make an opening statement but require it then to present items of evidence without any comment as to why they matter, a rule policed with ferocious efficiency by the Rolls-Royce defence teams. In a normal case, where the prosecution might spend only three or four days presenting its case, that would not matter: the evidence would be relatively simple; it would be clear how each piece fitted into a picture. In a seven-month trial, the rule combined with the crown\u2019s scarce resources to produce a kind of chaos. When Brooks\u2019s barrister, Jonathan Laidlaw QC, rose to open her defence after nearly four months of prosecution evidence, he told the jury with his trademark combination of gentle delivery and vicious effect, that it had not been \u201cthe easiest case to follow\u201d. The crown had jumped from topic to topic, he said. It had made \u201csomething of a mess\u201d of timelines for the key hacking victims, which were incomplete and potentially misleading. It had flashed up documents on the courtroom screens and forgotten to give them to the jury: \u201cIf there is a sense of confusion about the evidence and what it is supposed to relate to, that would be entirely understandable \u2026 There are categories where we simply don\u2019t know or understand the point that is being made.\u201d Unpredictable contest It may have been patronising, but he had a point. The crown had spent months effectively throwing random bricks at the jury with little or no explanation as to how they fitted together. Laidlaw set about building the prosecution\u2019s house for them, attempting to persuade the jurors that, when they saw it in its final form, they would see it was full of holes. This is not to say that the defendants had no problems. In pre-trial hearings, Brooks lost her lead barrister, John Kelsey-Fry QC, because the former royal editor, Clive Goodman, said he wanted to call him as a witness to the cover-up at his own trial for hacking in 2007. The judge agreed to delay the trial for seven weeks while she instructed Laidlaw \u2013 and that meant Coulson lost his barrister, Clare Montgomery QC, because the new timing overlapped with a case she had to conduct in Hong Kong. The trial opened against a backdrop of public hostility to Brooks and Coulson, not only because of the high-profile hacking saga, but also because of their careers. Brooks\u2019s lawyers tried and failed to persuade the judge to ban all trade union members from the jury on the grounds that they were bound to be antagonistic.  Throughout the trial, the defendants were thrown off-course as the crown, struggling to keep up, served new evidence that should have been presented before the trial started. Even as the final evidence was being put to the jury in April, the prosecution suddenly announced it had 48,000 email messages which the FBI had obtained from News Corp in New York; they had been with police in London for 16 months.           Rebekah Brooks and Andy Coulson arrive at the Old Bailey to begin their defence    All this made the trial a peculiarly unpredictable contest. From the start, the crown case was weak, particularly against Rebekah Brooks. There was no direct evidence at all to implicate her in phone hacking. Indeed, there was simply a lack of any direct evidence about her of any kind. That was partly because of the passage of time: she stopped being editor of the News of the World in January 2003, so naturally paperwork and other evidence had been lost. Some had been destroyed. Over the years, News International had deleted some 300m emails from their systems, only 90m of which were retrieved, including only a handful from Brooks\u2019 editorship. The hard drive had been removed from her computer for safe keeping then lost.  But there was no doubt at all that the News of the World had been involved in crime on a massive scale. Before the trial opened, three former news editors and the specialist phone-hacker Glenn Mulcaire had pleaded guilty to conspiring to intercept voicemails. By the time it finished, News International had paid compensation to 718 victims of the hacking \u2013 an average of nearly three agreed victims for every week during the five years for which patchy evidence of Mulcaire\u2019s work has survived. Hundreds more alleged victims were still being identified by police. Platform of inference The hacking case against Brooks and Coulson was based on a platform of inference. How could they not have known about the beehive of offending around them, the crown asked. How could they not have known about Mulcaire\u2019s speciality when he was one of only two outside contributors with a full-time contract and was being paid more than any reporter, at one point more even than the news editor? How could they not have known the origin of all those stories whose accuracy they had to test? How could they have been ignorant when a humble sports writer described Mulcaire, a former footballer, as \u201cpart of our special investigations team\u201d in a story published by the News of the World when Brooks was editor? Brooks and Coulson insisted they had known nothing of Mulcaire\u2019s criminality. They had not even heard his name until he was arrested in August 2006, they told the jury. The attack on this platform of inference included a striking example of the impact of Murdoch\u2019s money. The evidence which lies at the core of the hacking scandal is the collection of notes found by detectives when they first arrested Mulcaire in August 2006: 11,000 pages of his barely legible scribble and scrawl and doodle. The original police inquiry took one look at it and decided it simply did not have the resources to go through it all. When Operation Weeting in 2011 finally did the job properly, it took it the best part of a year. Brooks\u2019s Rolls-Royce did it in three months and then had the resources to produce a brilliant analysis.     Glenn Mulcaire: the phone hacker was tasked 2,255 times in five years by the News of the World. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images    The notes showed that Mulcaire was tasked some 5,600 times during the five years that he worked on contract for the News of the World, an average of more than four for every working day. As a crude average, that would imply that between September 2001, when he was contracted to work for the paper, and January 2003, when Brooks left, he was commissioned around 1,400 times. But Brooks\u2019s legal team set aside all those notes where it was not 100% certain they had been written during that time; and all those where it was not 100% certain that Mulcaire had been tasked to intercept voicemail as opposed to \u201cblagging\u201d confidential data. Since a considerable mass of his notes were incomplete and/or ambiguous on either date or task, this allowed Laidlaw to tell the jury that there were only 12 occasions when it was 100% certain that Mulcaire had hacked a phone while she was editor \u2013 an eye-catching point to be able to deliver in answer to the crown\u2019s inference. Where Brooks was concerned on the hacking charge, there was very little extra evidence to add to that platform of inference. Three witnesses came to court and recalled social occasions when she had discussed hacking with apparent familiarity. Brooks told the jury that she had read about hacking in newspaper stories; she had talked about it casually because she had not realised it was illegal; but she would never have sanctioned it because it was such a severe breach of privacy. One of these three witnesses \u2013 the former wife of the golfer Colin Montgomerie, Eimear Cook \u2013 was cut to pieces by a particularly destructive cross-examination. Cook told the jury she recalled a conversation at lunch in September 2005, when Brooks had not only warned her that her own phone might be hacked but had described the ease with which it could be done. Cook added that during the same lunch, she thought Brooks had discussed the famous incident when she had been arrested for assaulting her then partner, the actor Ross Kemp. Laidlaw gently pawed her into position, confirming without doubt the date of the lunch, challenging the strength of her memory until she insisted she was absolutely certain and then, like Hannibal Lecter in a horsehair wig, softly and courteously, he cut out her heart: the incident with Kemp had happened six weeks after the lunch. Her story could not possibly be right. Then there was Milly Dowler. This was almost spooky. It was the Guardian\u2019s disclosure of the hacking of the missing Surrey schoolgirl\u2019s phone that finally broke open the scandal. That was purely about the emotional impact of the story \u2013 that this was no celebrity victim, but an ordinary civilian, a child, and one who had been abducted and murdered by a predatory paedophile. Now, in court, once more, it was Dowler who presented the threat, not because of any emotional impact, but because it just so happened that this was the one example of hacking under Brooks\u2019s editorship where there was some hard evidence. This was, as the judge said in a ruling, \u201cthe high point of the prosecution case\u201d.     Milly Dowler investigation: the News of the World hid information from police. Photograph: John Stillwell/PA    Having picked up a voicemail which seemed to suggest that Dowler was alive and working in a factory in Telford, the News of the World not only hid that information from police but later, when they had failed to find her, they contacted Surrey police and demanded that they confirm the story for them \u2013 and quoted the voicemail, in phone calls and even in email. The records of those calls and messages survived in the Surrey police archive. Brooks must have been consulted about the high-risk decision to hide information from the police, the crown argued.  She must have been told about this potentially huge scoop \u2013 and about its origin, they said. She must have known that seven journalists were working on it, including her news editor, Neville Thurlbeck, and her managing editor, Stuart Kuttner, who had both personally contacted Surrey police and quoted the intercepted voicemail. If it was not secret from the police, why would it be a secret from the editor? From the editor who was running a national campaign to protect children from predatory paedophiles? Brooks\u2019s answer was that she had been on holiday that week, in Dubai, and simply had not been told about any of this. Even here, the Dowler case proved special. She had been using a News International phone, and the itemised bill had survived in the company\u2019s vaults. If she had been in London, there would have been no record of her conversations, but the phone bill showed she had called the desk occupied by her deputy, Coulson, for 38 minutes on the Friday of that week, as reporters crawled over the big story, and again for 20 minutes on the Saturday, as they pressed the police to confirm it. She had texted him too. However, the prosecution had failed to realise that the records of some of those calls and texts were linked to the time in Dubai, not London, a three-hour difference which allowed Laidlaw to pour justifiable confusion over the evidence. In addition, she and Kemp had been joined on the holiday by a British tourist, William Hennessy, who told the jury that she had spent a lot of time on the phone, explaining on one occasion that she had to make a call \u201cabout the missing Surrey girl\u201d. Hennessy was sure of the timing: he had bought a watch in Dubai and kept the receipt, which was dated. Brooks said she had no memory of that. She had remained oblivious to the whole saga, she said, even when she returned to the office the following week, never reading the story which the paper had published quoting the voicemail verbatim, never knowing that managing editor Stuart Kuttner was still hectoring Surrey police to confirm the tale. Kuttner, also on trial, was himself found not guilty of conspiring to hack phones. Close to the action Coulson always had more to deal with. While evidence of his three years as Brooks\u2019s deputy was hard to find, there was a wealth of phone records, emails, voicemail recordings and Mulcaire notes about the hacking that happened when he was in charge, from January 2003 to January 2007. And Coulson had got himself dangerously close to the action. Searching Mulcaire\u2019s home and the News of the World office, police found hundreds of voicemails left by David Blunkett for his lover, Kimberley Quinn. Coulson startled the court by admitting that his chief reporter, Thurlbeck, had played some of them to him. He had then personally confronted the then home secretary with the allegation of his affair, telling him: \u201cI am certainly very confident of the information ... It is based on an extremely reliable source.\u201d Blunkett taped that meeting, and the tape survived. Coulson argued that this might show that he was aware of one instance of hacking but not that he was part of the conspiracy to make it happen.      David Blunkett was confronted by Andy Coulson  over his affair after the News of the World hacked his phone. Photograph: PA    Mulcaire then hacked the voicemail of a Labour special adviser, Hannah Pawlby, attempting to prove a false allegation that she was having an affair with the next home secretary, Charles Clarke. Coulson personally called Pawlby, saying he needed to talk to Clarke about \u201cquite a serious story\u201d. Mulcaire actually hacked his own editor\u2019s message from Pawlby\u2019s phone, and the recording was found by police when they searched his home. Coulson said simply that he wanted to talk to Clarke about a different story which was also serious; he had known nothing about the hacking of Pawlby\u2019s phone. When they were investigating Calum Best, News of the World executives feared that one of their journalists might be leaking information to him, warning him about what they were planning. Coulson sent an email: \u201cDo his phone.\u201d Mulcaire\u2019s notes showed that he did then target Best, though it was not clear whether he succeeded in hacking his messages. Coulson said his email was an order to pull the itemised phone bills of the journalist who was suspected of leaking, to see if he had been calling Best. Unlike Brooks, Coulson also faced two live witnesses who claimed he had known about the hacking. A showbusiness writer, Dan Evans, who had become a specialist hacker, told the jury that Coulson had hired him from the Sunday Mirror explicitly because of his hacking skill. He claimed that one day in the newsroom, he had played Coulson a tape of a voicemail hacked from the phone of the actor Daniel Craig in which Sienna Miller said she was in the Groucho club with Jude Law. Coulson\u2019s counsel, Timothy Langdale QC, a model of old-school courtesy built around a core of steel, released a swarm of questions around Evans. He stung him into describing his own criminality, his deal with the police, his history of cocaine abuse, finally pushing him into claiming to be sure of the date when he had played the Craig voicemail to Coulson \u2013 and then revealed that the editor had not been in the office on that day. When Langdale went on to query whether Miller and Law had been in the Groucho during that timeframe, the prosecution was left floundering: it had failed to get evidence from the club to prove their point.     Timothy Langdale: old-school courtesy built around a core of steel. Photograph: Mark Thomas/Rex Features    Similarly, Coulson\u2019s former friend and royal editor, Goodman, went into the witness box and told the jury that Coulson had personally approved his hacking of royal phones, for which Mulcaire was paid in cash with a false name and address on internal paperwork. He added that hacking was going on on \u201can industrial scale\u201d at the time and was often discussed in meetings with Coulson until he banned any further open mention of it. Langdale pushed back hard, confronting him with evidence to suggest he had lied about the extent of his own involvement in the royal hacking. Unheard evidence A trial deals with only a limited amount of information, considering only the evidence which is available and also admissible and which relates directly to the charges on the indictment. As in any case, there was a great deal which the jury did not hear information which could have tipped their judgment for or against the defendants. Some 30 News of the World journalists provided information which helped the Guardian uncover the scandal. But almost without exception, they spoke off the record. One of them \u2013 Sean Hoare \u2013 spoke openly, but he died in July 2011. A senior former executive and two of those who had pleaded guilty before the trial \u2013 Mulcaire and Thurlbeck \u2013 had discussions with the police about giving evidence for the prosecution. All three negotiations failed. Evans and Goodman were alone. The jury heard nothing about earlier police inquiries into allegations of the News of the World\u2019s involvement in blagging confidential records and bribing corrupt police for information, which occurred in the late 1980s and 90s. They heard nothing of the 3,000-word feature in the Guardian that described in detail the alleged involvement in this blagging and bribing of a senior executive from the paper. Similarly, they were told very little of the paper\u2019s use of Steve Whittamore, who blagged information illegally, culminating in his conviction in court in April 2005. The jury was told in detail about the information which Brooks said she had been given by an officer from the original inquiry, DCI Keith Surtees, who met her in September 2006 to tell her that her own phone had been hacked by Mulcaire. An internal email written at the time reported that, according to Brooks, police had found \u201cnumerous voice recordings and verbatim notes of his accesses to voicemails\u201d and that they had a list of more than 100 hacking victims (as distinct from the eight who were later named in court) and that they came from \u201cdifferent areas of public life \u2013 politics, showbiz etc\u201d (as distinct from the royal victims who were of interest to the only News of the World journalist they had arrested). This information was shared with Andy Coulson.     Rebekah Brooks told MPs in 2009 that the Guardian had 'substantially and likely deliberately misled the British public' over phone hacking. Photograph: Rex Features    However, the jury was not then told of the letter which Brooks wrote to the media select committee in July 2009, after the Guardian first reported the true scale of the hacking, in which she said that the Guardian had \u201csubstantially and likely deliberately misled the British public\u201d. Nor were they shown Brooks\u2019s famous evidence to that committee in March 2003 when she said that her journalists had paid police for information in the past. Select committee evidence is not admissible in court because of rules around parliamentary privilege. Beyond all that, the jury was specifically not invited to consider behaviour which may not be criminal but have most offended public opinion. Breaking boundaries As tabloid newspaper bosses, Brooks and Coulson ruined lives. They did it to sell newspapers, to please Murdoch, to advance their own careers. One flick of their editorial pen was enough to break the boundaries of privacy and of compassion. The singer\u2019s mother suffering from depression; the actor stricken by the collapse of her marriage; the DJ in agony over his wife\u2019s affair: none of their pain was anything more than human raw material to be processed and packaged and sold for profit. Especially, obsessively if it involved their sexual activity. With all the intellectual focus of a masturbatory adolescent, their papers spied in the bedrooms of their targets, dragging out and humiliating anybody who dared to be gay or to have an affair or to engage in any kind of sexual activity beyond that approved by a Victorian missionary. They did it to friends \u2013 like Blunkett, for example, sharing drinks and private chats with him and then ripping the heart out of his private life, sprinkling their story with fiction as they did so. And to Sara Payne: befriended by Brooks in her campaign to change the law about publication of the home addresses of sex offenders; investigated by her paper on the false suspicion that she was having an affair with a detective. But above all, they did it to their enemies. Among the politicians who they exposed for being gay or for having affairs, the leftwingers easily outnumbered the occasional stray rightwinger. In among them were the special enemies who dared to challenge News International. In the early stages of the hacking story, there was only one frontbench politician from any party who was willing to attack the News of the World \u2013 the Lib Dem home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne. In June 2010, when Brooks was chief executive of News International, it was her News of the World which exposed Huhne\u2019s affair.     Chris Huhne was targeted by the News of the World. Photograph: Stefan Wermuth/Reuters    The News of the World also targeted the private life of its most outspoken critic in parliament \u2013 Tom Watson. Brooks had loathed Watson since he took part in the \u201ccurry house\u201d plot in 2006, attempting to engineer Gordon Brown into Downing Street at the expense of her favourite, Tony Blair. News International reporters say that during the hacking saga, she called in reporters to ask if they had any dirt on Watson. The News of the World put a private investigator on his tail, hoping to catch him having an affair. They did all this with breathtaking hypocrisy. While Coulson and Brooks were using their front pages to expose public figures for having affairs, they were themselves having an affair and keeping that information very private. Behind the scenes at the trial Brooks took the hypocrisy a step further. Although her newspapers had frequently attacked the Human Rights Act, she tried to use Article 6 \u2013 on the right to a fair hearing \u2013 to prevent her \u201caffair\u201d letter to Coulson being put before the jury.  Before the trial started, Laidlaw attempted to get the whole case against Brooks thrown out on the grounds that prejudicial newspaper coverage meant she could not get a fair trial. The crown replied by citing the case of Abu Hamza, who tried and failed to stop his own trial in 2006 because of prejudicial publicity in the Sun, then edited by Brooks. Laidlaw went on to complain about the scrum of press photographers waiting to pounce outside the Old Bailey door. Power games Their willingness to ruin lives was directly linked to their political power. MPs feared that they might find their own private behaviour being monstered on News International\u2019s front pages. This is the power of the playground bully: he has only to beat up one or two children for all of them to start trying to placate him. Beyond that, government collectively feared having its agenda destroyed, its daily activity destabilised, its future terminated if Murdoch\u2019s editors turned against it. Former ministers and senior Whitehall officials all tell the same tale \u2013 that as Murdoch increased the size of his empire, governments became obsessed with newspaper coverage, particularly that of the Sun. The power which Coulson and Brooks enjoyed delivered the kind of access for which unscrupulous lobbyists will pay large bundles of cash. As a tabloid editor, she was courted by ministers. At the Leveson inquiry, Brooks disclosed 185 meetings with prime ministers, ministers and party leaders while apologising that her records were incomplete. At the News of the World, Coulson showed little enthusiasm for politics, according to former Downing Street officials, one of whom remembers him being invited for breakfast with Gordon Brown and showing so little interest in policy that the two men ended up talking about newspaper circulations. Brooks, however, was a different story. Far more than Coulson, she played the game of power, exploiting her extraordinary social skills to build an unrivalled network of connections. Backed by fear of what her journalists could do, Brooks used her access to get her way. She could do it over small things: \u201cIf she was going to the US and she realised she had no visa, all she had to do was to make a phone call to a minister, and they\u2019d sort it out for her,\u201d according to one former official. She used it to get stories. An adviser from the Ministry of Defence recalls the government being under pressure about British soldiers being killed and maimed by roadside bombs in Afghanistan: \u201cWe were told we couldn\u2019t release all we were doing for opsec reasons, yet the MoD went ahead and gave the information to the Sun.\u201d     Sharon Shoesmith was unlawfully sacked from Haringey council after a campaign by the Sun and others    More than that, she used her influence to try to change government policy, not simply and legitimately by publishing stories but privately with ministers by cajoling, insisting, playing on their fear. This might be aimed at scoring a victory for her newspapers \u2013 persuading the government to order a police review of the Madeleine McCann case as part of her strategy to encourage the toddler\u2019s parents to let her newspapers serialise their book; pushing hard to end the career of Sharon Shoesmith, head of children\u2019s services in Haringey, whom the Sun blamed for the death of Baby P. Shoesmith was sacked, a decision which was later described by the court of appeal as \u201cintrinsically unlawful.\u201d Or Brooks aimed at larger policy which suited the ideology of the Sun and of its owner \u2013 over crime, immigration, public spending and notoriously over Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union and its potential involvement in the euro. This exercise of power reached a peak with the sequence of events surrounding Murdoch\u2019s attempt to buy BSkyB: the Sun turning on Gordon Brown in September 2009; the sustained campaign of hostile reporting apparently calculated to ensure that the electorate would force him out of office; the parallel campaign in all the Murdoch titles attacking the BBC and Ofcom; the announcement of the BSkyB bid within a month of David Cameron\u2019s election; the Cameron government imposing drastic cuts on the BBC and Ofcom; Cameron\u2019s culture secretary, Jeremy Hunt, allowing his special adviser to act as a back channel to the Murdochs while he considered the bid. Hunt duly gave a green light to the deal, which was within days of being confirmed in July 2011 when the hacking scandal erupted and moved parliament to denounce it. Political distortion And in all of this, Brooks consistently injected a highly contentious political ideology into the arteries of public debate, a toxic cocktail of crude populism and intellectual confusion. They demanded lower taxes and then damned public services for the failures inflicted on them by lack of funding. She led the cheers for stripping regulation out of the financial sector and then blamed Brussels for the ensuing crisis in the eurozone. She attacked the state when it inhibited corporate power and then promoted it when it engaged in military violence. She insisted on wars and then dared to claim to be the protectors of the soldiers who died in them (while Mulcaire, without her knowledge, hacked the phones of some of their families). She was a leader of opinion who had thought no further than the bland and self-serving simplicity of James Murdoch\u2019s theory about free media, that the only guide to independence is profit. As a single example of the distorting impact of their work, YouGov in December 2012, working for the TUC, found that the average public perception was that 41% of the welfare budget was spent on the unemployed. The reality is 3%. And that 27% of that budget was eaten up by fraud. The reality, as far as official figures can detect, is 0.7%. So the simple, beautiful idea of all citizens voting for government became an exercise in the bland leading the blind. And while Operation Weeting succeeded in bringing cases to court, these &quot;crimes&quot; remain unchallenged. The power remains. Leveson\u2019s attempt at independent media regulation was throttled at birth, not simply by the genuine concerns of those who care about a free press but also by a Fleet Street campaign of aggressive falsehood and distortion of precisely the kind that had made the Leveson inquiry necessary in the first place. Police officers resigned and politicians were embarrassed as the scandal erupted, but Scotland Yard \u2013 with dazzling cynicism \u2013 has reacted by trying to silence the kind of police whistleblowers who helped to expose the failures of their leaders; and ambitious politicians continue to dine with Rupert Murdoch. How long before News Corp\u2019s famous summer party is revived as a compulsory opportunity for political genuflection? It seems to have become forgotten, conveniently by some, that before the Old Bailey trial two former newsdesk executives, Greg Miskiw and James Weatherup, pleaded guilty, as did the phone-hacker Glenn Mulcaire and a former reporter, Dan Evans, who confessed to hacking Sienna Miller\u2019s messages on Daniel Craig\u2019s phone. Neville Thurlbeck, the News of the World\u2019s former chief reporter and news editor, pleaded guilty after the police found the tapes he had of Blunkett\u2019s messages in a News International safe. In the trial, Coulson was convicted of conspiring to hack phones while he was editor of the News of the World. The jury was discharged after failing to reach unanimous verdicts on two further charges of conspiring to commit misconduct in a public office faced by Coulson and Goodman. But Brooks was found not guilty of four charges including conspiring to hack phones when she was editor of the News of the World and making corrupt payments to public officials when she was editor of the Sun. She was also cleared of two charges that she conspired with her former secretary and her husband to conceal evidence from police investigating phone hacking in 2011.

It is quite a puzzle, but Dubai Dynamo (3.30) may well emerge victorious. Ruth Carr\u2019s gelding is nine years old, but has shown no sign that his competitive spirit may be diminishing this season, with two wins already and a close second last time out. He can race off the same mark of 88 here, just 4lb higher than when successful at Chester last month and one which he has defied twice in the past. Khelman (8.50) is worth an interest at Hamilton this evening. This trip is a minimum for him but he got home by a short-head over track and trip earlier in the season and was staying on strongly when second here last time out. There should be enough pace in the race to give him a decent tow. Saint Thomas (7.40) and Maria Bella (7.10) are the picks on the card at Leicester, while Dumbfounded (5.20) should take the last at Yarmouth.

Under a tougher regime on the use of performance-enhancing drugs developed in the aftermath of two high-profile doping scandals in 2013, the BHA will ban the administration of an anabolic steroid to any thoroughbred even for therapeutic reasons. Any horse which tests positive for a steroid once the new regime is in place will be banned from racing for 14 months, a significant increase on the six-month suspensions imposed on horses doped by Mahmood al-Zarooni in the Godolphin scandal which emerged in April 2013. The new rules will also require all thoroughbreds foaled in Britain to be registered within 12 months of birth, a period which will be cut to six months from 2017. Once registered, horses must be available for testing at any time, regardless of physical location and whose care the horse is under, while horses imported by British trainers must be registered within three months of arrival in Britain and provide \u201ca sample which shows no sign of anabolic steroid administration\u201d. Runners arriving to compete from France, Ireland and Germany, where similarly strict anti-steroid regimes are in place, will not be subject to any additional scrutiny under the new rules, but all other foreign-trained runners, including from the United States where the use of steroids is not banned, must arrive in Britain at least 14 days before they are due to race \u201cto facilitate post-arrival sampling and analysis\u201d. The BHA\u2019s policy on anabolic steroids has been developed over a seven-month period after two major and otherwise unrelated doping scandals in 2013. In April last year, Mahmood al-Zarooni was banned from racing for eight years after he was found to have doped at least 22 of the horses at Godolphin\u2019s Moulton Paddocks stable in Newmarket with either stanozolol or ethylestranol. Eight months later, Gerard Butler, also a trainer in Newmarket, was banned for five years after a long investigation into the use of the drug Sungate, which contains a banned anabolic steroid, at a number of yards in Britain\u2019s biggest training centre. \u201cThe enhanced, zero-tolerance policy announced today, which exceeds the international minimum standard, has the objective of ensuring that British racing remains at the forefront of tackling an issue that ranks amongst the biggest threats faced by any world sport,\u201d Paul Bittar, the BHA\u2019s chief executive, said. \u201cIt is intended to ensure that the industry, racing and betting public can be reassured that all races which take place on British soil do so on a level playing field.\u201d In addition to standard sampling of body fluids, the BHA also plans to introduce hair sampling, which can reveal historic use of steroids long after the substance itself has left a horse\u2019s system, to its testing regime at some stage. Hair sampling will not be used until the Authority has confidence in the results, however. \u201cIt won\u2019t be there from day one,\u201d Bittar said, \u201cbecause we\u2019re not yet confident that we can use that for prosecution purposes.\u201d Britain is the latest major racing nation to strengthen its anti-steroid rules since the Zarooni scandal, and once the new regime comes into force, it will be broadly similar to those already in place or scheduled for introduction in France, Ireland, Germany, Dubai and Australia. Internationally, however, efforts to tackle the threat posed by steroids, which can improve a horse\u2019s performance long after it tests \u201cclean\u201d, may be as strong as the weakest link. The United States, the world\u2019s largest racing industry, has little or no effective regulation of the use of steroids either in or out of training, and Bittar conceded on Thursday that unless or until hair sampling is introduced, there is nothing in the new rules to prevent a US-based trainer running a horse in Britain less than a month after it had been administered with a steroid. Bittar believes that the United States may become increasingly isolated from the world\u2019s other major racing nations if it does not address its attitude to performance-enhancing drugs such as steroids. \u201cIt\u2019s not part of our policy,\u201d Bittar said, \u201cbut I suspect that as you see international jurisdictions lift the bar continually, certain jurisdictions will look at whether they allow horses to run in races, and actually set it into the race conditions if jurisdictions don\u2019t comply with an international minimum standard.\u201d Asked if he could imagine a time when Britain would refuse to accept entries from American-trained horses, Bittar said: \u201cI don\u2019t think that\u2019s a decision that Britain will take alone, but I think you will find that there will be a number of jurisdictions, that if certain other major racing jurisdictions didn\u2019t fall into place, they would be concerned about the global brand risk to racing. \u201cWe have no intention of implementing that now, but do I think it\u2019s a possibility down the track? Yes, but it\u2019s probably not a unilateral decision that Britain will take.\u201d", "title": "BHA introduces zero-tolerance policy towards anabolic steroids", "sentences": ["\u201cIt won\u2019t be there from day one,\u201d Bittar said, \u201cbecause we\u2019re not yet confident that we can use that for prosecution purposes.\u201d Britain is the latest major racing nation to strengthen its anti-steroid rules since the Zarooni scandal, and once the new regime comes into force, it will be broadly similar to those already in place or scheduled for introduction in France, Ireland, Germany, Dubai and Australia."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-26T17:43:42Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/27/media-briefing-friday-27-june", "tags": ["Media"], "article": "Top eight stories on MediaGuardian     The former News of the World editor Rebekah Brooks gives her first statement after being acquitted of phone-hacking charges Photograph: Justin Tallis/AFP/Getty Images    Rebekah Brooks: I feel vindicated by trial verdictFormer NoW editor says she has &apos;learned some valuable lessons&apos; after ordeal of trial in which she was cleared Pinewood Shepperton to triple profitsFilm studio, which is home to latest Star Wars movie, is about to build a \u00a3200m project to double its spaceBBC Trust chair hours reduced leading to claims that it encourages Lord CoeAdvert for \u00a3110,000-a-year role amended to attract candidates who cannot give three to four days a week David Wolfe to chair press regulation recognition panelBarrister specialising in judicial review challenges will now help to select board membersTom Watson: I was wrong about Brooks and hackingLabour MP says he wishes former NoW editor well in life, but does not regret standing up to News International Peter Greste devastated by seven-year jail sentenceThe Australian al-Jazeera journalist says he will consider all possible measures to have his conviction in Egypt overturned  BBC too &apos;squeamish&apos; and &apos;simplistic&apos; in its rural news coverageIndependent review says corporation&apos;s reporting on countryside issues can have &apos;metropolitan bias&apos; Viral Video Chart: One Direction, Luis Su\u00e1rez and Harrison FordHarry Styles and Co sing with Bert, Bruce Springsteen attacks biter and what if Alan Bennett had commentated on World Cup Top comment on MediaGuardian Phone-hacking: newspapers fail to report the real storyRoy Greenslade: Why the coverage of the News of the World crimes has been distorted and replete with falsehoods Today&apos;s headlines The Guardian Jimmy Savile inquiry news.

It was the clue left in a hotel room that led police to Wojciech Janowski, Poland&apos;s honorary consul to Monaco and the dead woman&apos;s son-in-law, who appeared before a judge on Friday accused of ordering her murder. Janowski, 64, a Cambridge-educated Polish businessman who had lived with Pastor&apos;s daughter Sylvia for 28 years \u2013 the couple had never married \u2013 confessed to being &quot;implicated&quot; in the killing of Pastor and her chauffeur. Sylvia Pastor, 53, who was arrested at the same time but later &quot;totally exonerated&quot;, was said to be in a state of shock. Six others accused of involvement in the murder in May are being held in police custody. Prosecutors say Janowski admitted giving his sporting coach \u20ac200,000 &quot;as well as presents including holidays and a car&quot; to organise the killing that he had been planning for &quot;a long time&quot;. &quot;Janowski felt rejected by the rest of the Pastor family in general and by H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Pastor in particular. Janowski says he wanted to put an end to his wife&apos;s suffering at the hands of her mother, but Sylvia Pastor contests this entirely,&quot; the public prosecutor in Marseille, Brice Robin, told a press conference. Two men, carrying a hunting rifle and a sawn-off shotgun, ambushed Pastor&apos;s Lancia Voyager car on 6 May as she left a Nice hospital where her son Gildo, 47, was recovering from a stroke. After firing twice into the vehicle and checking that both Pastor, 77, and her chauffeur of 15 years, Egyptian-born Mohamed Darwish, 64, had been hit, the men ran off. Darwish died in hospital after four days and Pastor 15 days later. Before succumbing to her injuries, she told police she had no idea who might want her dead. Robin said Janowski had obtained \u20ac8.4m from H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Pastor via her daughter in the past year. The prosecutor said he had no idea where that money had gone but it was not in Janowski&apos;s bank account. He said Janowski had specified that he wanted Darwish dead &quot;as a diversion and to muddle things up and make people question who was the real target&quot; of the attack. The cold-blooded assassination of Pastor, who boasted an estimated \u20ac20bn property empire in Monaco established by her grandfather, an immigrant Italian stonemason, shocked the principality where she was known as the &quot;princess&quot; and had links with the royal family. Using images from video cameras, phone taps and satellite information from the suspects&apos; mobile phones, police traced the two men who attacked Pastor to a \u20ac90 hotel room in Nice that they had rented and taken a shower in before carrying out the killing. The turning point in the inquiry was the discovery of DNA from one of the suspects in shower gel in the room. Police later found a sports bag containing the guns used in the attack and a &quot;large sum of money&quot;. Detectives arrested Janowski for questioning about certain bank transactions on his account after discovering he had withdrawn \u20ac250,000 from an offshore account in Dubai. Pastor&apos;s daughter Sylvia, known as &quot;Sisi&quot;, and son Gildo received generous allowances reported to be up to \u20ac500,000 a month and lived in luxury apartments owned by their mother. Janowski, the Polish honorary consul in Monaco since 2007, is known in the principality for his charity work, particularly with the organisation Monaco Against Autism (MONAA), which he co-founded and which boasts Princess Charlene of Monaco as its honorary president. He was given the National Order of Merit of the French Republic by Nicolas Sarkozy in 2010 for his charity work and has a master&apos;s degree in economics. In the past he ran a chain of hotels and casinos in the principality. In the end, the killing of H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Pastor and her chauffeur turned out to be as the French press had suggested from the beginning \u2013 a &quot;crime crapuleux&quot;, a criminal act sparked by a motive as old as the Monaco hills: money.", "title": "Monaco billionaire's son-in-law accused of ordering her murder", "sentences": ["Detectives arrested Janowski for questioning about certain bank transactions on his account after discovering he had withdrawn \u20ac250,000 from an offshore account in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-27T17:19:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jun/27/us-seventeen-charged-global-khat-trafficking-ring", "tags": ["Drugs trade", "Drugs", "US news", "UK news", "World news", "Khat"], "article": "Seventeen people have been charged with running an international khat dealing operation that allegedly made hundreds of thousands of dollars by shipping several tons of the plant, a stimulant illegal in some countries, to the US. The group is accused of importing African khat into Manhattan for sale on the streets of New York and Massachusetts, in packages sent from overseas by its alleged British-based leader. Yadeta Bekri, a 23-year-old man operating from England, is facing a potential life prison sentence in the US after being charged with trafficking large quantities of the plant that were obtained from Yemen, Kenya and Ethiopia. Bekri is accused of sending the packages via UPS from Britain, China, Holland and Belgium for collection by a pair of colleagues, who then distributed the khat for sale, before sending the proceeds back to Bekri via his fiancee in Minnesota. Bekri was indicted in New York on Friday on charges of \u201coperating as a major trafficker,\u201d a felony carrying a potential life sentence; money laundering; and possessing and selling illegal drugs. The other 16 members of what prosecutors described as a \u201cglobal khat trafficking ring\u201d were indicted on charges including money laundering and possessing and selling khat. Eric Schneiderman, New York\u2019s attorney general, said in a statement that \u201ca sophisticated operation accused of bringing drugs into the United States and sending the profits overseas has been shut down\u201d. Describing khat as a \u201cdangerous and illegal drug,\u201d Schneiderman added: \u201cTrafficking often funds other criminal activity\u201d. Bill Bratton, the commissioner of the NYPD, said in a statement that the alleged dealing operation showed that \u201cillegal drugs can find their way into our city from any corner of the world via organised criminal networks\u201d. The plant, which is cultivated largely in eastern Africa, contains stimulants that are released when its stems and leaves are chewed. It has long been popular among some communities of Somali, Yemeni and Ethiopian descent. However, it is illegal in the US and became a banned class C drug in Britain on Tuesday. It contains cathinone, which is a Schedule I controlled substance in New York, and cathine, a schedule IV controlled substance. Theresa May, the British home secretary, introduced the ban against the advice of her official advisory committee on the misuse of drugs. The ban was also criticised last year by the home affairs committee of MPs, which warned it would create tensions between police and immigrant communities and was not based on evidence that using khat caused medical or social harm. According to a 215-count indictment unsealed by New York prosecutors on Friday, Bekri \u2013 who was allegedly known to his co-conspirators as Murad \u2013 obtained large quantities of khat from Ethiopia, Kenya and Yemen, and shipped it to the US from Britain, China, Holland and Belgium. Prosecutors allege that his two New York \u201cmanagers\u201d, Bayan Yusuf and Ahmed Adem, collected the packages from UPS stores and sold the khat on to customers and dealers in Brooklyn, Rochester and Buffalo in New York, and in Everett, Massachusetts. Yusuf and Adem are accused of delivering tens of thousands of dollars in cash collected from khat sales by car to Ibsitu Hashi, Bekri\u2019s fiancee, who was based in Minnesota. She then wired money back to Bekri in England via Dubai, the prosecutors said. Prosecutors said on Friday that the dealers were placed under surveillance as part of a nearly year-long investigation by state and local law enforcement agents led by Schneiderman\u2019s organised crime task force and the New York police department\u2019s intelligence division. The indictment details a series of apparently intercepted telephone calls and text messages between the defendants, in which they allegedly organised khat sales and revenues while also \u201cusing codes and speaking in a guarded, cryptic manner\u201d. They allegedly discussed transporting cash in amounts of up to $143,000. Two defendants were \u201cobserved on several occasions via electronic surveillance\u201d bringing several 25-pound boxes of khat into the Islamic Society of Flatbush in Brooklyn, the prosecutors said, while others were watched using rental storage facilities in Brooklyn and Queens. Prosecutors said that Bekri was based in England but did not offer more specifics. Lawyers for Bekri and his co-defendants could not immediately be reached on Friday. \u201cThe charges against the defendants are accusations and the defendants are presumed innocent until and unless proven guilty in a court of law,\u201d Schneiderman\u2019s statement said.", "title": "Seventeen people charged in US with running global khat trafficking ring", "sentences": ["She then wired money back to Bekri in England via Dubai, the prosecutors said."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-27T19:14:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jun/27/magnus-carlsen-blitz-rapid-titles-dubai", "tags": ["Magnus Carlsen", "Chess", "Sport"], "article": "Magnus Carlsen badly wanted more titles in Dubai last week after finishing only second on his Norwegian home turf in Stavanger a few days earlier and the 23-year-old world champion did just that in capturing the global crowns in both rapid and blitz, both against very strong fields. Carlsen led or was close to the lead for most of the marathon blitz course of 21 rounds, and his only major setback came\u00a0when careless defence allowed the little-known Chinese teenager Lu Shanglei to trap the champion\u2019s king in mid-board. It was the shock of the tournament but it was Carlsen\u2019s only\u00a0defeat. Garry Kasparov compared Carlsen\u2019s feat to a tennis player winning grand slam events on hard courts, clay and grass. Although the rapid games with a time limit of 15 minutes per game plus 10 seconds for each move were sufficiently slow for the leading grandmasters in classical chess, it was harder in blitz where each player had only three minutes for the entire game plus two seconds per move. The gold standard for blitz is Bobby Fischer\u2019s performance in Yugoslavia in 1970, where the time limit was five minutes per player per game with no increment. That was an elite double-rounder of 12 players, including four world champions, and Fischer scored 19/22, winning some impressive games en route, whereas Carlsen\u2019s 17/21 against slightly weaker opposition had a few rocky moments. But a decade earlier, at the 1960 Leipzig Olympiad, I saw Fischer playing blitz every night in the hotel lounge with Mikhail Tal, Viktor Korchnoi and Tigran Petrosian and he was not then their superior. Carlsen wants to keep his triple crown and repeat at rapid and blitz in 2015, so he may yet win his legends match with\u00a0Fischer. He is also No1 in the classical and blitz ratings but No2 to Italy\u2019s Fabiano Caruana at rapid. Judit Polgar was the only woman among the 120 players in Dubai and the all-time No1 female produced her usual entertaining performance.

After the delays, delirium, as Serena Williams, the five-times Wimbledon champion, was downed 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 in a wildly thrilling match by Aliz\u00e9 Cornet. Cornet, the 25th seed, had never beaten a top-20 player at a grand slam in 13 attempts. Yet somehow she found the magic and resolve to recover after Williams had swatted her aside in the first set. Not so long ago Cornet, a 24-year-old from Nice, hated playing on grass. Now, in the epicentre of the greatest triumph of her career, she kissed it. \u201cI cannot believe it,\u201d she said. \u201cA few years ago I couldn\u2019t play on grass but now I have beaten the world No1. It\u2019s the biggest upset of the tournament. A dream. I cannot believe I did it myself \u2013 me! \u2013 but the tournament is not over for me.\u201d In the last 16 Cornet will play the exciting 20-year-old Canadian Eugenie Bouchard, who reached the French Open semi-final earlier this month. But for the next 24 hours she wants to savour her brilliant victory. \u201cI know the next one is going to be very tough because Eugenie is playing incredible, but right now I want to enjoy my win,\u201d she said, revelling in the moment and the attention. Many players are beaten against Williams before they step on court. Not Cornet. She had won their last meeting, in Dubai earlier this year, in straight sets \u2013 and she carried exactly where she had left off by breaking in the opening game. Perhaps Williams\u2019 forehand was a little overenthusiastic and the first serve had not quite found its range, but a statement had been sent. Cornet did not intend to go quietly. But the break was not consolidated as, after several long rallies, Williams pulled it back to 1-1. The rain was starting to fall and attentions were wavering, Williams\u2019s included. She double-faulted to give Cornet two breakpoints only to recover before, at 1-1, deuce, the umpire called them off. It took four and a half hours for them to come back, but when play finally resumed just before 6pm, Williams rushed into her groove. She held her service game to go 2-1 up and then broke to 30 after Cornet double-faulted. Cornet thumped her racquet bag in frustration but Williams\u2019 winners kept coming. She showed she had touch as well as power in the next game, urging a drop shot to float in, before smashing another forehand winner to break for a 4-1 lead. The points and games were going by in a flash. Winner after winner crashed by. And they were all from Williams\u2019 racket. She finished the first set with an ace. She had won six games in a row \u2013 and the five games since the resumption in just 14 minutes. As Williams walked to the chair an American voice shouted out: \u201cIt\u2019s been a pleasure, Serena!\u201d Indeed it had. But no one could foresee what would happen next. Cornet won the first game of the second set and, having rediscovered her rhythm and confidence, then broke to go 2-0. Soon it was 3-0. Then 4-0. And then, incredibly, 5-0. Everything Cornet hit seemed to be going in. At one point Williams hit a cutting slice at her opponent\u2019s bootlaces, yet she picked it up for an exquisite drop shot winner. The American was close to being bageled but she held her serve and then broke back as Cornet sent a forehand long. Suddenly the momentum was shifting again. But at 5-3 Cornet held her nerve and sealed the set by smashing a short ball away. Grass is Williams\u2019 domain, whereas Cornet had won just 10 of her 25 matches on the surface. You expected that at some point the world No1 would assert her dominance. But Cornet was going nowhere. In the opening game of the third set \u2013 which turned into a 15-minute epic \u2013 she attacked relentlessly and had four break-points. But Williams, despite hitting three double faults in the game, held on. At 2-2 Cornet again had more breakpoints. Three came and went before Cornet finally got the break and after that she never looked back. She held with an ace \u2013 only her second of the match \u2013 to go 4-2 up and then broke Williams again to make it 5-2. Yet the American wasn\u2019t done. She broke and held her serve to make it 5-4. But while Cornet\u2019s nerves must have been break-dancing around her body she didn\u2019t show it. She was helped by Williams, who made a series of errors before slapping a drop shot into the net at match point. \u201cAfter the break because of the rain I was so slow,\u201d Cornet said. \u201cI thought this is going to be tough. But she helped me a lot with a few mistakes. \u201cOn Saturday morning I watched our match in Dubai,\u201d she said. \u201cIt helped me especially when I had to serve at 5-4 because I knew I had done it before. It\u2019s amazing to beat Serena two times in a row but she is just a human, like everybody.\u201d It has not always seemed that way over more than a decade of brilliance at Wimbledon. But for once Williams was not able to impose her will, or pull victory out of the fire, and after two hours and four minutes of tennis, Court One stood to applaud a French woman called Aliz\u00e9 who truly was in wonderland.", "title": "Serena Williams suffers shock Wimbledon defeat by Aliz\u00e9 Cornet", "sentences": ["She had won their last meeting, in Dubai earlier this year, in straight sets \u2013 and she carried exactly where she had left off by breaking in the opening game.", "\u201cOn Saturday morning I watched our match in Dubai,\u201d she said."], "publicationDate": "2014-06-28T19:53:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jun/28/phone-hacking-trial-has-anything-changed-rebekah-brooks", "tags": ["UK news", "Rebekah Brooks"], "article": "Over the course of 138 working days in court number 12 of the Old Bailey, Mr Justice John Saunders proved himself a man of enormous patience, great stamina and not a little dry wit. The judge&apos;s epic five-day summing up of the hacking trial was a model of rigour and rectitude. He led the jury through the scree of documentary evidence \u2013 thousands of printed emails and transcribed conversations, bills and accounts and witness statements accreted over eight months and piled up in box files and binders \u2013 like a seasoned mountain guide, pressing on as the light was failing, always making sure no one was left behind. Just occasionally, to keep spirits up, he ventured a lawyerly joke. When the end was in sight, for example, and he was addressing again News International&apos;s initial strategy to confine the hacking scandal to the &quot;rogue royal reporter&quot; Clive Goodman and his private investigator accomplice Glenn Mulcaire, Saunders noted that this had proved, perhaps, on reflection, and with the benefit of hindsight, &quot;not the most successful damage limitation exercise ever\u00a0undertaken&quot;. The atmosphere of the longest completed criminal trial in recent British legal history (beating the Angry Brigade by 13 days) was often one of hyperbole, but in terms of understatement that particular judicial observation was hard to beat. News International&apos;s efforts to manage the scandal had, you imagined, back in 2006, seemed like a costly undertaking. One that involved, among other things, paying for the continued employment and legal fees of Mulcaire and Goodman after they were charged. Over the years since, however, as something like the whole truth has slowly emerged, that failed damage-limitation exercise has resulted in the conviction of six senior journalists \u2013 including one editor and three news editors \u2013 with trials of 12 more journalists scheduled. It has seen News International \u2013 now News UK \u2013 pay millions of pounds of compensation to more than 700 victims of hacking, with several thousand more potentially able to sue. It has shut down the most popular Sunday newspaper in the world and prevented Rupert Murdoch&apos;s companies taking a virtual monopoly of satellite broadcasting in Britain. And it has engendered one of the largest police investigations in Scotland Yard history at a cost of \u00a332.7m so far, plus a trial that will cost \u00a3100m. As damage limitation goes it was about on a par with the burghers of Hamelin trying to short-change the pied piper. The very public courtroom drama that resulted from this explosion of email and document has uncovered many facts but one of the more insistent, over the course of the trial, has been this: newspaper journalism, both at its best and at its worst, is an obsessives&apos; occupation. The desire to get at the truth of complex human behaviour, to be the one who can declare &quot;I know what you don&apos;t&quot;, requires the sort of mind that always sees &quot;no&quot; as fighting talk. In the press seats of court 12, in the press overflow room downstairs, in the dock and in the witness box, that obsessiveness, the best and worst of it, has been on vivid display. On the side of the angels, and in court daily, was Nick Davies of the Guardian, (&quot;Saint Nick&quot; as his former editor Peter Preston has, with some equivocation, dubbed him) whose indefatigable digging set a good deal of this process in motion. In a recent interview Davies observed that at the &quot;posh public school where he did his A-levels&quot; he got &quot;mildly bullied&quot; for reading the Guardian but &quot;he was very happy being weird&quot;; his plan even then was to utilise that sense of weirdness &quot;to go out with just a notebook and a pen and expose abuse of power&quot;. Over the past eight months, 40 years on, he has seen that wish come true. The substance of the abuse exposed was rooted in an equally obsessive but very different form of journalism. The flashbulb detail of the News of the World&apos;s methods revealed in court showed a level of intrusion in the private lives of individuals that often seemed disturbed or pathological. You were reminded, watching on, at various points, of the words of Greg Miskiw, a news editor of the paper under Brooks and Coulson, who was among those who pleaded guilty to the charges prior to proceedings: &quot;That is what we do,&quot; he infamously said to one reporter. &quot;We go out and destroy other people&apos;s lives.&quot; In the pursuit of this goal whole support networks of &quot;dark arts&quot; practitioners were available to reporters \u2013 not for just phone hacking and blagging, but also for around-the-clock surveillance and as specialist &quot;followers&quot;. As Mark Oaten, the former Liberal Democrat leadership candidate explained, the attempt to stand up a story about him hiring male prostitutes involved not just the hacking of his own phone, but the phones of all of his family, including his 84-year-old father and his sister-in-law in Denmark, accompanied by the staking out of all of their houses, and a sustained impersonation of him to gain phone records and other details. This was a procedure, it emerged, that the News of the World applied pretty indiscriminately against everyone from the home secretary to bereaved families of soldiers, concocted celebrities and royal princes, rival journalists (including those in different departments on their own paper, and even Rebekah Brooks, who the jury exonerated of all knowledge of illegal practices). In one of the more telling pieces of evidence Mulcaire, on a salary, unbeknown to his editor, of nearly \u00a392,500 to work day and night to get into other people&apos;s phones, complained by email to the news desk of the repetitive strain of their demands: &quot;Overload! NO MORE PLEASE!&quot; In the context of such wall-to-wall compulsive behaviour \u2013 which included the unprecedented reporting mania of the &quot;crowdfunded&quot; hack Peter Jukes, who heroically tweeted to his followers every single exchange of the trial: that&apos;s 24,000 tweets, 450,000 words, 2.5m keystrokes, two knackered keyboards \u2013 it was impossible not to feel something of a hopeless journalistic lightweight in attending very far from all of the 138 days, in trying to pick my moments, in doing other stuff at the same time. The strange thing about dipping in and out of the trial in this way, however, was that whenever I did turn up in court I rarely felt I had missed much. In some ways the trial was the diametric opposite of the Leveson inquiry that had preceded it. The broad focus of Lord Justice Leveson&apos;s trawl through the inboxes of the most powerful people in the land \u2013 the LOL text messages of serving prime minsters, the loan of police horses to tabloid editors by Met chiefs, the humbling of media moguls \u2013 was replaced here by a narrowing concentration on ever finer detail of certain events in the working lives of the defendants often a decade and more ago. It was, at the outset, the prosecution&apos;s stated purpose to show that the principal defendants, Rebekah Brooks, Andy Coulson and Stuart Kuttner, the veteran News of the World managing editor, &quot;must have known&quot; about the hacking and payments to public officials that happened in their newsroom. Andrew Edis QC, leading for the crown, then devoted eight months to the attempt to change that passive formulation to the active one that they &quot;did know&quot; in the minds of the jurors. In the case of Andy Coulson, there was something of a paper trail (&quot;do his phone&quot;, he once memorably demanded of a reporter believed to be leaking information to a paid celebrity stooge, Calum Best). There was also Coulson&apos;s under-oath admission that he had heard the taped voicemail of David Blunkett, which made his guilty verdict all but inevitable. (No unanimity could be reached about his knowledge of payment to public officials, and a decision will be made about a retrial in the coming days). In the cases of Brooks and Kuttner, those two phrases \u2013 &quot;must have known&quot; and &quot;did know&quot; \u2013 were never conclusively elided for the jury, and both were found not guilty of all\u00a0charges.     Brooks outside the Old Bailey, 25 March 2014: \u2018She gave from time to time the convincing appearance of vulnerability, taking the stand generally without makeup.\u2019 Photograph: David Thompson/Rex Features    Brooks&apos;s legal team, led by Jonathan Laidlaw QC at an estimated cost of \u00a330,000 a week, employed what Rupert Murdoch&apos;s authorised biographer Michael Wolff has called an &quot;American-style defence&quot;. This Wolff defined in a blog contentiously titled &quot;How Rupert Murdoch won the hacking trial&quot;, as the manner by which &quot;captivating and theatrical lawyers overshadowed the crown&apos;s straightforward prosecution. They showed great flair and style, addressing the complicated charges with inundating detail and great confusion. It was certainly the most dizzying defence money could buy\u2026 &quot; I&apos;m not sure &quot;captivating and theatrical&quot; are the words I&apos;d always have used. And, though there was a persistent sense that Brooks in particular got what she paid for, for &quot;dizzying&quot; you could often read &quot;numbing&quot;. Whole mornings would pass on the question of who might have said what to whom around a swimming pool at a hotel no one quite remembered in Dubai a dozen years ago (when Brooks was holidaying during the Milly Dowler investigation); there was a long and unproductive exchange at one point on the precise semantic difference between the words &quot;storage&quot; and &quot;archive&quot; alluded to by Brooks&apos;s assistant Cheryl Carter on a long-lost Post-it note; days passed in which the annotations on editorial budgets were examined in forensic detail; and much was made by the defence of the dimensions and even the location of the courtroom itself, which was considered far too &quot;criminal&quot; and imposing a stage for what had become a &quot;pantomime&quot; in which the prosecution was &quot;chasing thin air&quot;. It sometimes seemed, during the more arcane argument, that the life of the trial aspired to the condition of Dickens, sprawling, shocking and ludicrous by turns. A couple of times, at lunch breaks in the case, I found myself rereading Bleak House in a coffee shop just up the road from where old Tom Jarndyce blew his brains out, looking for fictional precedents of the characters who had come and gone that morning \u2013 the fastidious News of the World archivist, the wronged ex-wife of the international golfer, the pizza-delivery operative, the grubbing and desperate tabloid hack. In the days wondering when the Jarndyce-and-Jarndyce-like trial might ever end \u2013 forecasts slipped quietly from Easter to May to June; one juror (unwell) and one defendant, Ian Edmondson (&quot;unfit&quot;), disappeared; hospital appointments and holidays and funerals and seasons passed by \u2013 it was tempting several times to speculate when exactly it had all begun. The prosaic answer to that question lay in an insignificant diary item written by Clive Goodman which carried the news in November 2005 that Prince William had strained a tendon in his knee playing football. That story \u2013 because so few people knew of it \u2013 alerted the palace to the likelihood that voicemails were being intercepted, and the police were called. If you really wanted to find other beginnings though, you could keep going, back through another generation of royals, through the outlandish taboo-breaking phone-tapped revelations of &quot;Squidgygate&quot; and &quot;Camillagate&quot;. Those extraordinary invasions of privacy had allowed certain journalists to believe that any intrusion at all might be possible and even legitimately in the public interest (a mindset that Paul McMullan, former features editor of the News of the World, has justified in these terms: &quot;Privacy is the space bad people need to do bad things in. Privacy is for paedos. Privacy is evil, it brings out the worst qualities in\u00a0people&quot;). Those competing narratives about the marriage of the Prince of Wales and the Princess of Newspaper Sales coincided with a shift in British tabloid culture in which it was tacitly acknowledged there was no profit to be made, in a ever-more crowded media market, in old-fashioned news, and therefore cults of celebrity (Charles and Diana were the blueprint) had to be invented to fill the gap. One result of this at Rupert Murdoch&apos;s red-tops was the sudden elevation of gossip columnists and showbiz editors to the top jobs. Piers Morgan became editor of the News of the World in 1994 at the age of 29 straight from editing the Sun&apos;s Bizarre column. At a stroke almost, in a culture already high on gossip, the traditional dividing lines between news and features, politics and entertainment were recast. In the early days the confected tales of infidelity and kiss and tell, the production-line creation and destruction of celebrities supplied by the soaps or sports or reality TV, were known as fairy stories. As those celebrities became ever more protected by concentric rings of PR, access to intimacy was at a premium. The celebrated &quot;binologist&quot; Benjamin Pell, doing his covert nightly refuse collections from entertainment lawyers and agents, for a while supplied a steady stream of such gossipy secrets to the tabloids. Pell was a couple of times the subject of wry smiles in the court, as if listening to someone&apos;s phone calls or catching them undressing with a telephoto lens was any less grubby an\u00a0occupation. From the late 90s phone hacking promised to provide the access-all-areas pass to lives that were in every other respect gated. It allowed the hacker not only behind the roped-off cordon into the VIP area, but also into the most private details of the lives of politicians and anyone else briefly in the public gaze. The appetite for such access was a growth industry. The snatched phone message was often the nugget of fact around which a whole destructive fantasy world could be created. As the former News of the World showbiz reporter Dan Evans, another who has pleaded guilty to hacking charges, observed in court, once you had the killer detail \u2013 in this case Sienna Miller signing off a message to Daniel Craig with the words &quot;I love you&quot; \u2013 then you could fill the story out with &quot;the kind of imaginative detail that tabloid reporters use on such occasions&quot;. As in all fairy stories worth their poisoned apples this one, of course, required a wicked queen. In the first days of the trial Saunders noted a copy of that week&apos;s Private Eye, which featured Rebekah Brooks, in her Salem-collared black-and-white dress, with the heading &quot;horror witch costume withdrawn from shops&quot;. He instructed the jury to ignore its &quot;bad taste&quot; connotations. In the mythology surrounding the case, however, Brooks was always its inbuilt Maleficent. Nick Davies argued last week, properly, that the trial had not been &quot;about Rebekah&quot;; rather, it had been about the out-of-control newspaper practices and levels of fawning and fear that characterised the relationships between politicians, the police and the Murdoch press. (The knowledge as Ian Hislop noted to Leveson that &quot;it [the News of the World]\u200b could get away with whatever it liked because it was so embedded in our political culture&quot;.) Even so, in the confines of the courtroom, it was all but impossible to separate those two narratives. Brooks was, after all, the embodiment of that sometimes cosy and potentially corrupting collusion, the intimate of three successive prime-ministerial suitors. The first, Blair, giving her that advice, astonishingly, of how to manage the allegations against her \u2013 with a &quot;Hutton-style&quot; inquiry, with &quot;sleeping pills&quot; and by toughening up. The second, Brown, attending her wedding and providing sleepovers at Chequers even as her newspaper was splashing with details of his four-month-old son&apos;s medical records; and Cameron, of course, saddling up with her in Chipping Norton.     Brooks at Cheltenham races in 2010 with, from left,  Matthew Freud, husband Charlie and Rupert Murdoch.  Mark Stewart/Camera Press Photograph: Mark Stewart/Camera Press    There were seven defendants in the dock but most of the time, in moments of drama, all eyes were on Brooks. Over the course of her 13 days in the witness box she barely deviated from her chosen narrative \u2013 that she trusted her journalists and never pressed them on where exactly their stories came from; that she was as shocked as anyone about the revelations of the hacking of the murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler&apos;s phone (\u200bshe was \u200bin the middle of an \u200bappointment at a fertility clinic\u200b, she said,\u200b when the Guardian broke the story); that she wasn&apos;t much use when it came to technology or finance; that her primary interest as an editor was in campaigning against paedophiles (Sarah&apos;s law was never far from her answers); and that it was all quite a long time ago. In attempting to deflect her from these themes Brooks was asked many questions, but as the days wore on, and she hardly put a foot out of place, the question you really wanted the answer to was: how did she get here? Which is to say, how exactly did Brooks transform herself from being the daughter of a tugboat worker who died of liver disease aged 50; from being the girl who was state-educated in Warrington, and who had no formal journalistic training, to becoming perhaps the most powerful woman in the country in the space of around 15\u00a0years? One answer, in court, was provided by Brooks&apos;s mother, whose appearance in the witness box revealed the source of some of her daughter&apos;s ambitious charm, as well as a formidable steeliness under pressure. Another answer is provided by Piers Morgan, who in his memoir, The Insider, suggests himself, with typical humility, as the man who discovered and created her. The young features assistant first came to Morgan&apos;s attention when, cheque-book to hand, she broke the story of Paul Gascoigne&apos;s abusive relationship with his wife Cheryl, and not only made the story a focus for a campaign highlighting domestic violence, but also kept both parties onside (a trait that came to characterise her editorship). Subsequently she assisted Morgan in bugging the hotel room in which &quot;royal love rat&quot; James Hewitt was to be interviewed, and then proved to him she was up for anything by dressing as a cleaner and talking her way into the Wapping printing silo so that they could scoop the Sunday Times&apos;s lead story, excerpts from Jonathan Dimbleby&apos;s book about Prince Charles. On this somewhat flimsy basis, Morgan made her his deputy. From there, as Murdoch explained to Michael Wolff, approvingly, she &quot;social-climbed through his family&quot;, befriending first his daughter Elisabeth, then his son James, and along the way establishing a relationship with the old man in which, as Vanity Fair suggested, she became the daughter he&apos;d always wanted: intensely loyal, obsessed with print journalism, ruthlessly ambitious. It is a loyalty he could hardly have valued more highly; not least in the reported \u00a316m severance payments which have been used in part to fund her defence. Not all of these qualities were on display in court 12. Brooks gave from time to time the convincing appearance of vulnerability, taking the stand generally without makeup, dwelling on the emotional pain of her inability to have children (which resulted in her surrogate daughter being carried by her cousin), the one-time &quot;car-crash&quot; of her personal life (characterised in the infamous unsent email to her lover Coulson, apparently written when he was trying to end their affair; &quot;I tell you everything, I confide in you, I seek your advice, I love you, care about you, worry about you. We laugh and cry together... in fact without our relationship in my life, I am really not sure how I will cope.&quot;). It was impossible, in particular, to see that aspect of her character that one of her former reporters, Graham Johnson, in his book Hack, described as &quot;cold-eyed corporate killer. Supreme top operator&quot;, though you could just about imagine Johnson&apos;s impulse of &quot;being consumed with an unstoppable and irrational craving to give her only good news&quot;. Brooks concentrated in court on doing what she was told, trying to find her way through the mass of evidence in front of her, mostly resisting any flicker of annoyance or frustration, just occasionally allowing herself the flirtatious half-smile by which, as one former colleague observed, she always &quot;gives the impression of knowing more than she is letting on&quot;. If she never betrayed it in person, the evidence itself was conclusive that she wielded her Murdoch-given power with all the hypocrisy and flexibility of conscience that her role demanded. The evidence dwelt in some detail on the exposure in Coulson&apos;s News of the World, and Brooks&apos;s Sun, of the affair between David Blunkett, then home secretary, and Kimberly Quinn. Blunkett was described by Brooks as a friend, someone &quot;she had worked closely with on Sarah&apos;s law&quot;, but that did not stop her being the first to publish the name of Quinn, and assuming correctly that the home secretary, though &quot;devastated&quot;, would remain an ally. Enemies were treated with far less kindness. There was the sense by the end, despite the unanimous not guilty verdict, that the trial itself had been a form of rough justice for Brooks. It treated her own privacy with the same level of respect as she routinely treated the &quot;targets&quot; of the News of the World&apos;s journalism. Which is to say that, over the course of several months, everything she wanted hidden was dragged blinking out into the sun. She got to know how it felt to be the subject of an adulterous &quot;sex scandal&quot;, in the exposure of her on-off six-year affair with Coulson. She got to know what it was like to have her own phone hacked, her own movements tracked, her own home staked out. She understood only too well the importance of trying to evade the pack and the paparazzi as they sought to secure the one &quot;killer photo&quot; of the moment of her arrest, the photo as she said &quot;from which you can&apos;t recover&quot;. And, courtesy of her husband, Charlie, whose defence in the botched plan to dispose of his laptop computer rested mainly on his insistence that he wanted to hide his &quot;Lesbian Lovers&quot; porn videos, she got her own &quot;Jacqui Smith moment&quot;. (Charlie Brooks&apos;s barrister emphasised in summing up that his client was many things but &quot;academically gifted&quot; was not one of them; in this sense the Old Etonian horse trainer&apos;s defence essentially boiled down to the proposition that he was a stupid wanker. The jury clearly found that entirely plausible.) In all these ways, in the parlance of her journalists, Rebekah Brooks was &quot;monstered&quot; and, though on hearing the verdict she had to be helped from court by the Old Bailey&apos;s resident matron, over the 138 days when it mattered she barely flinched. Which probably answers the insistent question of how she came to be here. You don&apos;t have to read Michael Wolff or Wolf Hall to know that in a culture of fear to show no fear yourself is always one path to\u00a0power. The ultimate source of that power \u2013 Rupert Murdoch \u2013 was largely absent from proceedings, by name at least. You rarely felt sympathy for Andy Coulson, who hardly changed an expression of embattled seriousness from opening comment to verdict, but one occasion when it was hard to avoid a pang was when the former News of the World editor and Tory spin doctor was questioned about having to make a particular phone call. The phone call was to Murdoch, and was to relay the &quot;tricky&quot; news of the arrest in 2006 of Clive Goodman and a police raid, the first of many, at his newspaper&apos;s office. Murdoch was most often referred to in the course of the trial, particularly by Brooks, simply as &quot;New York&quot;. New York was where you went to have your budget finalised, New York was not infrequently on the phone. The euphemism felt appropriate; speaking with Murdoch, in the minds of his editors, seemed roughly comparable to dealing with a city that never sleeps. When Coulson delivered his bad news about Goodman, &quot;Mr Murdoch was concerned&quot;, he recalled. &quot;He, [Mr Murdoch] said the most valuable thing a newspaper has is the trust of its readers, and that&apos;s something that stayed in my mind.&quot; You might imagine that New York, never shy with its opinion, had slightly more to say about the Metropolitan police storming through his London offices than that. Tight-lipped was unusual. As Brooks said in her unsent love letter to Coulson as she sought to reassure him about a period of radio silence from New York, &quot;On KRM [Keith Rupert Murdoch], when he&apos;s not bollocking you must not brood on lack of calls.&quot; Bollockings passed inexorably down that executive chain of command at the News of the World. Brooks rarely administered them herself, but she relied on men \u2013 her news editors, Miskiw and the rest \u2013 who did. Clive Goodman and Dan Evans, the only two journalists giving evidence, spoke wearily of the culture of constant harassment. Goodman, who in the heady days of Diana&apos;s indiscretions had broken five consecutive front-page splashes, a newspaper record, had turned in desperation to Mulcaire&apos;s little black book of hacking contacts as his own sources of stories dried up, as the demand for them only increased (he was known to the news desk as &quot;the eternal flame&quot; because despite their &quot;encouragement&quot; he never went out of the office). In his book about the ongoing nightmare of satisfying the News of the World&apos;s (and its readers&apos;) appetite for lurid exposure, Graham Johnson observed, &quot;if you had a story to feed the bosses, they&apos;d get off your back for a week. That&apos;s all that mattered.&quot; It didn&apos;t, Johnson claimed, crucially, matter at all how those stories were obtained. &quot;In truth, executives rarely challenged the integrity of reporters because it was a no-go area. Simply because many of us had no integrity at all. We lied for a living, cheated members of the public and broke the law routinely. Direct questions threatened to penetrate the Chinese walls that were supposed to protect executives from contamination\u2026&quot; In the case of Brooks those &quot;Chinese walls&quot; \u2013 what Brooks repeatedly called her trust in her journalists \u2013 did their jobs extremely well. The defence proved beyond reasonable doubt that Brooks had risen too quickly past them, climbed too high up beyond them to need or want to know exactly what happened in the murkier depths of her paper&apos;s muck-raking. The methods may have been the basis on which the paper&apos;s power-giving, story-getting success was based \u2013 but it all occurred a long way from &quot;country suppers&quot; with the prime minister in Chipping Norton. Rupert Murdoch has so far resisted making any comment at all about the proceedings against his executives in this trial. Any comment, that is, except perhaps one. On the first of the nine days that the jury took to reach its verdict I returned home from a visit to the Old Bailey at exactly the time the postman was delivering the mail. I received my free World Cup copy of the Sun by hand. The timing may have been fortuitous, but the symbolism of 22m households (minus those in Liverpool) receiving a copy of the Murdoch paper seemed clear enough. The front page, at first glance, to anyone who had followed the trial looked like a group portrait of every phone the News of the World had hacked: Wayne Rooney was there, as were Charles and Camilla, the royal princes, Paul McCartney\u2026 along with the proprietorial reminder &quot;THIS IS OUR ENGLAND&quot; (that phrase of Rebekah Brooks&apos;s, &quot;my Tony&quot;, in reference to the then prime minister, came to mind). As well as effectively ending the particular dark arts in question, the trial has, you trust, altered for ever the instinctive fear and favour that our political leaders and the police have demonstrated towards News Group. Still, both David Cameron and Ed Miliband remained happy enough on this day of all days to do Murdoch&apos;s advertising for him, gurning with a front page. I don&apos;t know for sure of course, but despite everything, you imagine New York allowed itself a little smile at those images, before trying to get back to business as usual. Trial timeline November 2005 News of the World journalist Clive Goodman publishes information that could only have been found by intercepting the royal family&apos;s communications. August 2006 Goodman and private investigator Glenn Mulcaire are arrested for accessing voicemails; both admit the charges. Andy Coulson states that as editor he takes ultimate responsibility, but that the incident was down to a &quot;rogue reporter&quot;. He resigns a few months later. July 2007 Coulson is appointed director of communications for the Conservative party. July 2009 The Guardian&apos;s Nick Davies reveals that Murdoch&apos;s News Group Newspapers have paid over \u00a31m to phone-hacking victims in legal settlements, in return for their silence. The News of the World protests its innocence; in November the Press Complaints Commission states there is &quot;no evidence&quot; of phone hacking beyond that by Goodman and Mulcaire. September 2010 Former journalists at the News of the World tell the New York Times that hacking was &quot;industry-wide&quot;; reporter Sean Hoare says Coulson &quot;actively encouraged&quot; him to hack phones. 5 July 2011 The Guardian reports that murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler&apos;s voicemails were intercepted during her disappearance in 2002. It is later revealed that other targets of phone-hacking include relatives of British soldiers killed in Afghanistan and Iraq, and relatives of 7/7 victims. Rebekah Brooks denies any involvement in the hacking. 7 July 2011 The 168-year-old News of the World announces that the issue of 10 July will be its last. On 8 July, Clive Goodman and Andy Coulson are arrested. 13 July 2011 David Cameron appoints Lord Justice Leveson to inquire into the culture, practice and ethics of the British press. NewsCorp withdraw their bid to take over British satellite broadcaster BSkyB. 15-19 July 2011 Brooks resigns as News International&apos;s chief executive; two days later she is arrested. Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson resigns due to links to the News of the World. Sean Hoare is found dead at his home in Watford: police say his death is &quot;unexplained but not suspicious&quot;. 14 November 2011 The Leveson inquiry opens in London. May 2012 Brooks and her husband Charlie are charged with conspiring to pervert the course of justice. 4 November 2012 Private text messages between Brooks and Cameron are made public. Brooks wrote of Cameron&apos;s address to the Tory conference: &quot;Brilliant speech. I\u00a0cried twice. Will love &apos;working together&apos;.&quot; 5 June 2013 Brooks pleads not guilty to all charges. 28 October 2013 The trial &quot;R v Brooks, Coulson and six others&quot; opens at the Old Bailey. 31 October 2013 It is revealed that Brooks and Coulson had an affair from 1998 to 2004, when much of the phone hacking is alleged to have taken place. 11 June 2014 The jury deliver their one guilty verdict: Andy Coulson is guilty of phone hacking.

Thistle Bird seemed to have run her last race before retirement to the paddocks when she finished third in the Group One Prix de l\u2019Op\u00e9ra last October but Roger Charlton talked Lady Rothschild, her owner, into one more season of competition and the gamble was richly rewarded in Sunday\u2019s Pretty Polly Stakes. Marvellous, O\u2019Brien\u2019s Irish 1,000 Guineas winner, was a non-runner in the Group One contest due to the fast ground but Venus De Milo, the runner-up in last year\u2019s Irish Oaks, was a useful deputy and eased into the lead a quarter of a mile from home. George Baker was clearly going even better on Thistle Bird, however, and quickened to lead approaching the final furlong before staying on strongly to win by nearly three lengths. It was Baker\u2019s second Group One success after his win on Seal Of Approval in the fillies\u2019 and mares\u2019 race on Champions Day last October and Charlton\u2019s second Group One win at The Curragh in successive seasons after Al Kazeem\u2019s defeat of Camelot in last year\u2019s Tattersalls Gold Cup. \u201cShe\u2019s tough and she\u2019s improved and it says a lot for keeping horses in training,\u201d Charlton said. \u201cA Group One is the ultimate, and to find one, and somehow avoid Aidan O\u2019Brien beating us, is very satisfying. \u201cShe was going to retire and I persuaded the owner that she didn\u2019t have any other horses with me that were going to win good prizes and that we could delay putting her in foal for another year. She paid her way by winning a Group Three at Epsom and this has hugely paid off now. If she never runs again, she\u2019s done it. \u201cYou\u2019ve only got to look at the December Sales for Group One-winning mares to see what they\u2019re worth. There\u2019s a lot of new breeders coming into the business. She will never be sold but tough horses are important. \u201cShe was a handicapper and she\u2019s developed into a Group One performer. I think she\u2019s run 20 times and won eight races, and those are the ones you want to breed from, not the ones that win once or twice.\u201d O\u2019Brien\u2019s 389-1 four-timer in the previous races on the card opened with the victory of Gleneagles in a seven-furlong maiden which the trainer has won in the past with subsequent Group One winners including Rip Van Winkle, Duke Of Marmalade and Roderic O\u2019Connor. Australia, who on Saturday added the Irish Derby to his success in the original at Epsom, was a beaten even-money favourite in the same event on his racecourse debut here last year but Gleneagles, also an even-money chance, had the benefit of a previous run, and travelled smoothly before showing plenty of finishing speed to win by two and a half lengths. \u201cLooking at him today, he wasn\u2019t short of pace,\u201d O\u2019Brien said. \u201cHe travelled strong and quickened, so I\u2019d say anything from six [furlongs] up is not going to be a problem for him.

There\u2019s the Fes festival, a leading world music festival, and the snappily named Jazzablanca in Casablanca. But the biggest ones are the funkier Gnaoua festival in Essaouira on the coast, the massive pop Festival Mawazine in Rabat \u2013 which has starred the likes of Rihanna and Stevie Wonder \u2013 and Timitar in Agadir. Each attracts crowds of up to 500,000 people (that\u2019s three times the size of Glastonbury). All of them, too, are not just music festivals \u2013 they have specific social and political agendas as well.   Timitar, which I went to the weekend before Glastonbury, is a case in point. That was where I saw a rapper called Muslim \u2013 a great name if you don\u2019t want to be Googled \u2013 appearing at an event that is at root a celebration of Berber culture.  Muslim\u2019s best-known song, which he delivered to a crowd of more than 100,000 at the \u201curban\u201d stage in Place Bijawane near the beach, is Al Rissala (The Letter) a fiery anti-authoritarian condemnation of corruption and ignorance in high places. On another stage, Alpha Blondy\u2019s 10-piece reggae band was singing about \u201cspiritual terrorists\u201d who think it\u2019s OK to kill in the name of religion. The next night, local heroine Najat Atabou was singing songs in support of women\u2019s rights in a more traditional style, while Mehdi Nassouli was positively postmodern, almost Prog Berber. In previous years at the festival I&apos;d caught Marcel Khalife, a Palestinian who sings rousing revolutionary songs, and the rock band Hoba Hoba Spirit, whose Will To Live \u2013 a setting of a poem written in the 1930s \u2013 became an anthem for the demonstrations in Morocco a couple of years ago.             \u201cIt\u2019s a good way of letting off steam,\u201d Reda Allali, the lead singer Hoba Hoba Spirit, told me of Timitar. \u201cIt\u2019s a step in the right direction anyway \u2013 although there are many steps ahead.\u201d Berber culture has been historically oppressed in these parts, even though Berbers make up nearly half of Moroccans and are the indigenous population; the origins of their music go back millennia before the arrival of the Arabs.   Some, like the Saharan-Berber singer Malika Zarra, now based in New York, see Timitar as a &quot;bread-and-circuses&quot; distraction from the issues that have caused Berber uprisings across North Africa (\u201cThey had to do it,\u201d asserts Zarra), but it\u2019s also true the Moroccan authorities are cannier and more flexible than more blatantly repressive regimes elsewhere, which may be one reason the country is more stable than its neighbours. Another reason is the unifying force of the seemingly universally revered king, Mohammed VI, whose picture was on the side of Timitar\u2019s main stage. The authorities have also taken practical steps to reduce Berber unrest in the last few years, setting up a Berber TV station and introducing the teaching of the language in schools. The word Berber, a foreign-imported word derived from barbarian, is also falling from use, being replaced by Amizagh, which means free man (we&apos;re using it in this article simply for clarity). The oldest of the big four Moroccan festivals is the Fes festival of World Sacred Music, which has a different political agenda and marked its 20th anniversary last week. Fes was the destination for many of the Muslims and Jews who were kicked out of Spain in the 15th and 16th centuries, and the festival represents a kind of nostalgia for the great days of the old Andalucia, where Christians, Jews and Muslims lived more or less in harmony. The festival was set up in the wake of the first Gulf war as a \u201cbeacon of tolerance\u201d and has a policy of inviting top-notch performers from different faiths and of no faith. There\u2019s usually a leftfield western star like Bj\u00f6rk, who appeared a couple of years back, or Patti Smith, who appeared last year. This year\u2019s big performer was Iraq\u2019s top pop star Kadim Al-Sahir.            There are plenty of countries, from Abu Dhabi to Singapore, who put money into the arts for political or economic reasons \u2013 in the case of Singapore, it\u2019s to attract foreign companies to set up their offices there, for Abu Dhabi it is partly to distinguish itself from its racier, naughtier sister Dubai. For Morocco, the main reason, apart from bread and circuses distraction and creating employment, it\u2019s to rebrand the country as a whole a more tolerant, open Islamic country.

He may not have been many decades off. Since 1970 this ancient, continent-straddling city \u2013 the Bosphorus Strait bisects Istanbul and divides Europe and Asia \u2013 has blossomed from a quiet burg of 2 million to a vast, confident megalopolis of 16 million, stretching across 2,060 square miles: four-and-a-half times the area of New York City. The engine for Turkey\u2019s booming national economy, Istanbul represents 20% of the country\u2019s population and more than 40% of its tax revenues. Economic production has more than doubled since 2004, and now Erdogan is pushing more than $100bn worth of construction projects to the city where he grew up and, in the 1990s, served as mayor. In the shadow of an iconic, minaret-spiked skyline, ageing districts are being rebuilt. Luxury hotels and massive, billion-dollar hunks of infrastructure are rising all over town. Arab sheikhs and other flush foreigners are snapping up million-dollar apartments along the Bosphorus, some overlooking a manmade party island pulsing with revellers into the wee hours. Innovative art, design and dining scenes attract international tastemakers and a travel website recently named Istanbul the world\u2019s top destination for 2014. In competition with the likes of Rome, Dubai, Rio and Shanghai, Istanbul is doing just fine. Yet it\u2019s also seething. Many locals feel overwhelmed and shunted aside by the ongoing makeover, which they view as focusing on profit for the privileged while ignoring the majority. They see disappearing green spaces, overpriced apartments, forced evictions, endless commutes, vast corruption and \u2013 in contrast to America \u2013 the sudden ubiquity of that 1980s retail relic, the shopping mall. It was a proposed mall, to be built on a razed Gezi Park in the centre of Istanbul, that initially sparked protests just over a year ago, which spread nationwide after an aggressive government crackdown and transformed into a fight against authoritarianism. Mass, often violent protests have since waxed and waned, resulting in at least 11 dead, hundreds injured and many more on trial.     Protesters outside Gezi Park. Photograph: Murad Sezer/Reuters    Rather than quell the antipathy by altering his plans or softening his language, the prime minister has pressed the gas. In 2002, Turkey\u2019s cities issued building permits for 36 million square-metres of space. In the first three months of 2014, that number was 43 million, at a cost of $24bn \u2013 more than double the total spent just a year prior. Erdogan has also sharpened his rhetoric; these days one either supports Turkey\u2019s rise and the remaking of Istanbul, or works to undermine it. \u201cThose who cannot accept [Turkey\u2019s] government want to carry out a coup by using the streets,\u201d the prime minister said recently. \u201cErdogan\u2019s strategy is to consolidate his supporters by making it a black and white discourse,\u201d Yasar Adanali, who studies Istanbul development and teaches urban planning at Stuttgart University, explained during a recent interview at his office in Istanbul\u2019s Karakoy district. \u201cIt\u2019s capulcu versus milli irade \u2013 the \u2018looters\u2019 versus the \u2018national will.\u2019\u201d This dynamic has sharpened to a knife\u2019s edge in Okmeydani, a working-class district near the city\u2019s Golden Horn estuary. In centuries past, Ottoman officials enjoyed various sports in the district\u2019s open meadows, took target practice (Okmeydani means archery field), and held grand public events including circumcisions. Today, the old playground of the ruling elite is densely populated and a bit rough round the edges. On a cloudy, breezy June afternoon, its dusty streets were abuzz with activity \u2013 children kicking a football down a narrow alley, a mussel-seller hawking his wares on the corner, and several open-air markets offering cut-rate clothes on the main drag. Down the street, 37-year-old Zafar Ciger sat in a small teashop overlooking a busy green park and recalled when the government first announced plans to rebuild his neighbourhood, back in 2005. Transformation efforts began that year in Istanbul\u2019s Sulukule neighbourhood, where Roma were forced from homes they\u2019d lived in for centuries. But in Okmeydani, residents united in protest and halted the work shortly after it began. Years of community-municipality meetings followed.     The Zorlu Centre under construction in Istanbul's Zincirlikuyu district. Photograph: Bloomberg via Getty Images    Then, two years ago, the government raised the stakes, launching a national $400bn plan to knock down or reinforce all buildings found to be at risk of earthquake damage. The initiative would involve hundreds of thousands of buildings across dozens of Istanbul neighbourhoods, including some 70 hectares of Okmeydani. \u201cOkmeydani will be the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es,\u201d the mayor of Beyoglu municipality, Ahmet Demircan, said in April. Years ago he made a similar remark to promote renewal efforts in Tarlabasi, an Istanbul neighbourhood near Taksim. That area is undergoing renewal today after dozens of low-income families were forced from their homes, according to Amnesty International. Okmeydani is diverse, but its sense of solidarity is strong. At street level, most concrete apartment blocks are spray-painted with phrases in Turkish: \u201cshoulder to shoulder against demolition\u201d; \u201ccome together against fascism\u201d; and the most common, \u201cBerkin Elvan is immortal\u201d, which refers to the 15-year-old who died months after getting hit by a police teargas canister while going to get bread during the protests last June. \u201cThis is a neighbourhood of others: Alevis, Kurds, socialists,\u201d explained Ciger, an accountant and long-time member of a local environmental advocacy group, referring to Turkey\u2019s two biggest minority groups. Okmeydani\u2019s demolition day seemed to inch closer in June, when the municipality declared a vast swathe of the district an earthquake risk zone, paving the way for the destruction of 5,600 buildings. Areas that receive this designation can be redeveloped without the consent of homeowners. \u201cThe most important issue for us is not to lead people to suffer from these projects,\u201d Demircan has said of the neighbourhood transformation plan. \u201cWe have held hundreds of meetings, explained to them our projects and gotten their opinions.\u201d Yet community organisations have filed nearly a dozen lawsuits against the municipality over the years because it has failed to follow the laws on urban transformation. \u201cAfter transformation, where will I live?\u201d said Ciger. \u201cThey are not telling us. They are not following protocol. Nothing is clear about what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d Many question the rigour of the risk zone designation. Turkey&apos;s highest court recently found that the designation of another Istanbul district, Tozkoparan, had been based on the inspection of just 14 of the area\u2019s 5,500 buildings, and that these were \u201cvisual inspections, not scientific\u201d.     Turkish prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan after laying the first stone of the new Istanbul airport. Photograph: Ozan Kose/AFP/Getty Images    A pro-government newspaper provided an alternative justification for the designation, which now applies to 25 Istanbul districts. \u201cThose districts host shanty neighboruhoods where houses and other buildings lack building permits,\u201d wrote Daily Sabah. \u201cAnother common characteristic of many areas in those districts is that they provide recruitment for terrorist organisations which find support amid impoverished, unemployed youth and children of migrant families.\u201d Whatever the accuracy of this view, in the long run, a certain amount of reconstruction and beautification is probably unavoidable in many of Istanbul\u2019s older neighbourhoods. So too is some demographic change, as central Istanbul districts become increasingly desirable. But Turkey is undertaking gentrification by fiat and force \u2013 a top-down, lightning-fast version of a process that in mature cities happens more organically, and even then often leads to tension and reluctant relocation. \u201cIt is easy for us to pontificate about the beauty, or the horror, of what is taking place in those neighbourhoods,\u201d said Kaya Gen\u00e7, a Turkish novelist who grew up in Istanbul and now lives in the expat-heavy district of Cihangir, which has witnessed some western-style gentrification in recent years. \u201cI think it is for the people living there to decide about the kind of environment they want to live in. If they want transformation, you can\u2019t accuse them of having false consciousness, and if they are against transformation, you can\u2019t just force it on them.\u201d Actually, there is a precedent for precisely that. In the American boom years after the second world war, the US government went on a national crusade of urban renewal, forcing some 300,000 families to relocate and rebuilding more than 2,000 neighbourhoods in dozens of cities. A 2011 study by two Vanderbilt University professors somewhat revived the legacy of these initiatives, finding that urban renewal cities saw greater relative increases in income, population and property values. But there\u2019s little doubt that during the 1950s and 60s the mostly minority residents of these purportedly blighted urban areas were herded like cattle. \u201cSan Francisco is engaging, as most northern cities now are engaged, in something called urban renewal, which means moving the negroes out,\u201d the novelist James Baldwin said in a 1963 interview. \u201cIt means negro removal, that is what it means. The federal government is an accomplice to this fact.\u201d Similarly, Turkey\u2019s government is today bulldozing through many of its less fashionable, minority-dominated urban areas. And just as urban renewal in the US sparked animosity and a reappraisal of city living \u2013 which ultimately led to Jane Jacobs and the urbanist movement that has come to dominate the urbanisation discourse in the west \u2013 Turks are dealing with considerable bitterness, and could be on the verge of similar revelations. More creative responses, however, can be found in innovative organisations such as Design Atelier Kadikoy (TAK, after the Turkish initials). Founded in April 2013 in a smartly renovated former storage depot at the end of a quiet street in Kadikoy \u2013 a lively, liberal district on the city\u2019s Asian side \u2013 TAK is an unprecedented collaboration between a planning consultancy, the local municipality and a cultural and environmental foundation.     A TAK meeting discusses concerns related to Kadife Sokak, widely known as 'Bar Street' on account of its rowdy nightlife    On a recent afternoon, volunteer designers tapped away at laptops in a simple, open-plan office space overlooking a central, skylit auditorium. Over tea in a small conference room, TAK\u2019s two coordinators \u2013 Sila Akalp, an urban planner, and Omer Kapinak, an architect \u2013 explained that TAK aims to improve local quality of life through innovative, collaborative projects. In one initiative, TAK brought nearly 30 designers together to come up with a modern cart for selling simits, Turkey&apos;s famed sesame-encrusted bagel. In another, TAK sought to address concerns related to Kadikoy\u2019s Kadife Sokak, which is widely known as Barlar Sokak (Bar Street) on account of its rowdy nightlife. Locals complained of late night noise, increased petty crime, trash in the streets and heightened tensions between different social groups. After bringing residents, bar owners, street users and officials together for a discussion, TAK designers visited the street then proposed better cleaning and monitoring from the municipality, public art to increase awareness of locals\u2019 concerns, more events along the waterfront to draw people away from the area, and new landscaping, lighting and infographics to foster a more civil public setting. After 15 months, Akalp and Kanipak have learned that working with bureaucracy can be slow-going and that fundraising will be a significant part of their job. But they feel they have begun to make an impact, and after several meetings, are looking forward to working with the new Kadikoy administration, which took over in April. \u201cI feel really positive about this mayor,\u201d said Akalp. \u201cHe consults with people rather than taking his own decisions.\u201d That\u2019s music to the ears of many residents of Istanbul, or any city where domineering officials send locals into the streets with their abrasive, top-down plans. Little surprise, then, that the concept has begun to resonate. \u201cTAK is becoming a model,\u201d said Kanipak, pointing to several more Istanbul districts and other major cities such as Gaziantep and Konya. \u201cOther municipalities, other groups are coming to visit us and study us in order to open their own TAKs.\u201d So will a few more TAKs change the way Istanbul is planned? And ultimately, could it improve outcomes for the residents of urban transformation areas such as Okmeydani? In truth, with so much of Istanbul doing so well, any change is likely to be slow. Erdogan\u2019s party, the AKP, feels comfortable enough to use harsh laws and aggressive force to silence dissent, and looks set to rule for some time, with presidential (this August) and parliamentary elections (scheduled for June 2015) likely to go in its favour. \u201cGezi was an awakening, but not a magic wand,\u201d said Imre Azem, an Istanbul filmmaker who directed Ekumenopolis, the prescient 2011 documentary about Istanbul\u2019s unchecked growth. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a long struggle, but last year showed that people have the will, the creativity and the courage to get there.\u201d \u2022 Tijuana: life on the political equator", "title": "Istanbul\u2019s gentrification by force leaves locals feeling overwhelmed and angry", "sentences": ["In competition with the likes of Rome, Dubai, Rio and Shanghai, Istanbul is doing just fine."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-02T09:39:50Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/04/american-expats-fourth-of-july-abroad", "tags": ["US news", "British identity and society", "Society"], "article": "The Fourth of July \u2013 a day to drink a beer, grill a burger and light a sparkler for the Land of the Free. Right? Alas, to far-flung Americans who have declared their own independence, the question of whether and how to celebrate their homeland&apos;s liberty and justice is not so easily answered for all.  We asked American expats from around the world how they&apos;ve chosen to celebrate the national holiday, whether the out-of-country experience has changed their feelings, and how non-Americans react to their patriotism \u2013 or lack thereof. Their responses were at once skeptical and wistful, but many came back to the same remembrance: America sure does celebrate itself with unparalleled zeal ... on its own birthday, no less. In the Netherlands: a &apos;love exile&apos; no more, an American always  Each Fourth of July barbecue, I can never escape the question: &quot;What do you celebrate, exactly?&quot; I have my stock answer: to celebrate freedom and liberty, and to enjoy some good BBQ with friends. What&apos;s funny is that I left the US because I didn&apos;t have the freedom to marry my now-Dutch husband of 10 years. I&apos;m what is considered a Love Exile, one of thousands of LGBT Americans who moved abroad to countries where those laws do exist. Now that Doma has been struck down, this marks the first year I can celebrate my true freedom and liberty as a gay American. This hasn&apos;t changed my patriotism for America or love of country, though. Just like my parents needed time to come around after I came out, I expected the US to eventually come around for the millions of Americans coming out for their freedom. \u2013David N Torres, Sluis   In New Zealand: ideas of national pride are &apos;just ... different&apos;     New Zealand \u2013 a place to relax.

But generally, New Zealanders do not seem to understand patriotism the way Americans celebrate it. To me, patriotism is being very proud of one&apos;s country \u2013 getting dressed up in red, white and blue or saying the Pledge of Allegiance is nothing strange. But I have never seen my husband (or anyone in New Zealand) celebrate patriotism with outward pride, like dress up in a flag and proudly point out that he&apos;s a New Zealander. Americans seem to &quot;celebrate&quot; a bit better, while Kiwis ten to &quot;relax&quot; a bit better. We have parades to celebrate America and being American; we have huge firework displays that everyone goes to; we have massive parties that entire towns attend. Yanks look at America differently than Kiwis look at New Zealand. It&apos;s not better or worse \u2013 just ... different.\ufeff \u2013Meagan Wairama, Auckland   In England: &apos;it&apos;s all tongue-in-cheek over here&apos;  I usually celebrate Independence Day by playing the national anthem first thing in the morning ... through my computer speakers at work! I then refuse to drink tea for a day in support of the Boston Tea Party. This year, however, I will be celebrating by marrying an English girl on the Fourth! What better way to keep up foreign relations? It&apos;s all tongue-in-cheek over here. I jest about our war for independence, and the English try to tell me certain words aren&apos;t spelled with a &quot;zed&quot;. All in good fun! \u2013Kevin Hall, London   In order to respect the British fine art of understatement, I normally only wave a tiny American flag at work when colleagues mention the holiday to me on the day. Then I go eat burgers with my token expat friends. It has to be done. Most of my non-American friends and family here treat my nationality as a light-hearted aside. I am often teased as being from &apos;The Colonies&apos; by my father-in-law. People here just want to know where I&apos;m from and why would I choose to live here in rainy and cold London, when I could live somewhere like New York or Los Angeles. \u2013Lindsay Faller, London   I spent the formative years of my childhood in the US. But the Fourth of July was a non-event for us \u2013 I literally have no memories of it. Even if American society can be very exclusive in so many ways \u2013 it doesn&apos;t always celebrate difference or non-conformity at its conservative core \u2013 these holidays help immigrants and old Americans feel emotionally tied to and invested in a cultural identity forged by immigration. \u2013Sinead Galvin, London  In Germany: a patriotic attitude is &apos;rather unwanted&apos;     Revelations last year that the NSA had been eavesdropping on German Chancellor Angela Merkel's mobile phone for years caused an uproar in Germany and strained US-German relations. Photograph: Sean Gallup / Getty Images     I have chosen not to celebrate this year. I must admit, it is simply not the same without the fireworks and the family members I&apos;ve left in California. In addition, the overall patriotic attitude seems rather unwanted here given the recent NSA debacle. In Germany, many people seem to have an opinion on the USA, and I have spent past holidays arguing with people about America rather than celebrating. I try to urge people to know what we as citizens can and can&apos;t do to change our image in the world. I think more about this holiday than ever. I am an African-American, and the Founding Fathers did not extend this notion of freedom to my ancestors. I have started to have mixed feelings about why I should be celebrating something that was not meant to truly benefit me. \u2013Kimberly Butler, Berlin  In Italy: substituting America for the good life and fries for ... fries  All expats are like heat-seeking missiles \u2013 we tend to find our likeness wherever we land. For the Fourth, we usually gather like heathens around whatever BBQ-looking device we can find and grill anything we can get our hands on. Living in Italy, where the food is part of la dolce vita, I have substituted hot dogs for salciccia, steak for bistecca fiorentina and fries for, well, fries. I am not a god-fearing, gun-toting, flag-waving, red-blooded American but a world citizen, and always have been. For myself, holidays such as Fourth of July and Thanksgiving are always celebrated for what they mean to me: a time for friends and family to share a wonderful meal and a beautiful moment in time together. Italy is a place you come for redemption of sorts, where sins of the past are washed away. Most questions asked are about wages, cost of living, if we can cook anything but hamburgers and why I would leave Los Angeles to live in this messed-up place. I just tell them how lucky they are to have a quality of life, and that&apos;s why I chose to be here instead of there. \u2013Lynn Cole, Italy  In Mexico: &apos;is it true everyone has guns?&apos;  We&apos;ve been in three different countries on the Fourth. In a couple of them, there was absolutely no recognition of the holiday. In Mexico, it depends where you are. It&apos;s a bit odd to see another country&apos;s interpretation of how you might celebrate in the US. When we were in Australia, July is winter, so a BBQ wasn&apos;t practical at all, and they didn&apos;t have watermelon, berries or other things we would normally eat. Made it feel even more weird! I think most of the non-Americans we&apos;ve come across have been surprised that I&apos;m not jingoistic. I&apos;ll readily recognise the things that are wonderful about my country and its culture as well as the things that I feel could be greatly improved. And the main question we usually get asked is, &quot;Is it true everyone has guns?&quot; \u2013Talon Windwalker, Playa del Carmen  In the United Arab Emirates: unsettled by &apos;blind patriotism&apos;     Americans are certainly known for their patriotism. Photograph: Richard Levine / Demotix / Corbis     I did celebrate the Fourth of July once, while living London. I must admit, I couldn&apos;t help but laugh at the irony of it all as we donned our red bandanas and downed cheap beer out of red Solo cups while listening to Bruce Springsteen in the middle of Hyde Park. Before leaving the US, I was certainly convinced that every country had an Independence Day that they, too, celebrated with such ferocity. But it wasn&apos;t until I left that I realised this isn&apos;t the norm everywhere else. Now, I look at the holiday with a bit more scepticism. I am grateful for the country I grew up in and the freedoms I was allotted; however, there is something slightly unsettling about this blind patriotism that seems to follow along with holidays like the Fourth. The most common questions I get are typically to do with guns (&quot;Do you feel safe walking down the streets?&quot;), life in an American high school (&quot;So, is it really like what&apos;s shown in films?&quot;) and whether I&apos;m from the &quot;Tony Sporano or Snooki&quot; part of New Jersey. \u2013Ashley Lane, Dubai  \u2022 From the other side: Emma Brockes on the funhouse mirror of Independence Day as a British expat in America", "title": "'I am not a gun-toting, flag-waving, red-blooded American but a world citizen': US expats on the Fourth of July abroad", "sentences": ["\u2013Ashley Lane, Dubai  \u2022 From the other side: Emma Brockes on the funhouse mirror of Independence Day as a British expat in America"], "publicationDate": "2014-07-04T04:00:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/jul/04/live-racing-friday-4-july-2014", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "11am Toast Of New York drawn in stall one for Belmont Derby Tony Paley: Toast Of New York has been drawn in stall one for the Belmont Invitational Derby on Saturday evening. Trainer Jamie Osborne has been reporting of his UAE Derby winner\u2019s excellent work in preparation for the race and is hoping his runner can confirm his position as the current Team British Racing Champion, a Great British Racing International award to showcase the array of talent within the domestic training ranks. \u201cToast Of New York has been working really well, he is going into the race in the form of his life and we\u2019re hopeful and looking forward to a big run,\u201d said Osborne. \u201cI\u2019m delighted that Toast Of New York is a part of Team British Racing. It is a great way to highlight British-trained runners and their connections racing overseas and the whole. The Toast of New York team and I are proud to be a part of it.\u201d The horse\u2019s owner Michael Buckley said: \u201cIt\u2019s thrilling to own a lovely colt such as Toast Of New York, and it is a happy coincidence that after I named him after the Cary Grant movie, he is good enough to contest a race in the State which gave him his name,\u201d he said. \u201cIf we are lucky enough to win the Belmont Derby, we might consider going for the Pacific Classic at Del Mar towards the end of August.

It goes against the grain to side with the favourite when so many alternatives are available, but after sifting through the field for quite some time yesterday, I kept coming back to Tagula Night (2.00) as the most obvious winner by some way. This track brings out the best in him, with three victories over track and trip to date, and the latest of those a couple of weeks ago was up there with the best runs of Tagula Night\u2019s extensive career. Odds of 9-2 may not look too generous, but could look like a shrewd investment a furlong out when Ryan Moore winds his partner up for the charge to the line. Educate (3.35), last year\u2019s Cambridgeshire winner, was stepped up to Group One and Group Two company at Meydan earlier this year but returns to a more realistic level today, while Air Pilot (4.10) and Whipphound (5.25) at Warwick also have a good deal to recommend them.

This week\u2019s prize is a pair of tickets to Newmarket for the July Cup on Saturday 12 July (a week on Saturday). Newmarket\u2019s July Course is among the most pleasant of Britain\u2019s summer tracks and a visit to the tree-shaded pre-parade ring is a must for any first-time visitor. The action on the track includes the famous sprint and the Bunbury Cup. It\u2019s the third and final day of the famous July meeting, for which you can buy tickets here if you don\u2019t win.

But she is\u00a0also the writer of Inanimate Alice, an\u00a0online work of digital fiction for young adults whose protean form continues to evolve but is pitched somewhere between a graphic novel and a video game.     To order Landing Gear, go to katepullinger.com.    Pullinger runs a course in creative writing and digital media at Bath Spa University, so it follows that her latest work should be spread across a bewildering number of formats. If you want to\u00a0read it on paper, it helps to live in Canada, as it is only available as a self-published ebook in the UK. Yet it seems slightly reactionary to insist on\u00a0an analogue version, given that the\u00a0text has emerged from a\u00a0separate online project entitled Flight Paths, a\u00a0&quot;networked novel&quot; in\u00a0which short excerpts of text are accompanied by graphics and music. But there&apos;s more: Landing Gear also exists as an API (application programming interface), which gives programmers the ability &quot;to extract meta-data from the novel in\u00a0XML or JSON format&quot;, though it sounds as if this option may be of interest to geeks only. The story was inspired by a Guardian report from 2001 about the mysterious frequency with which bodies were being discovered in the car park of a\u00a0superstore in Richmond, west London. The store was on the flight path to Heathrow, and it transpired that these were the remains of immigrants so desperate for\u00a0a new life as to risk clinging to the undercarriage of an aircraft. Though most died of shock or\u00a0exposure, there are a few remarkable instances of\u00a0stowaways surviving the ordeal: which is how Harriet, a\u00a0suburban housewife, comes to emerge from her weekly shop\u00a0to witness a\u00a0dark-skinned figure plummeting towards her car. It\u00a0is\u00a0an improbable episode, yet\u00a0Pullinger presents it as curiously beatific: &quot;He looked perfect lying there,\u00a0the roof\u00a0of my car crumpled like a\u00a0velvet blanket.&quot; Though he has literally fallen out of\u00a0the sky, the man, whose name is Yacub, has a well-developed backstory. Born into a desperately poor Pakistani family, he pays an enormous amount of money to a middleman who first promises work on a building project in\u00a0Dubai that mysteriously goes bankrupt, and then supplies the false information that there is a means of accessing a\u00a0Boeing&apos;s cargo hold via a\u00a0hatch in the\u00a0wheel housing. Harriet enjoys a more privileged, though hardly happy existence. A former local television presenter who lost her job after an unfortunate election-night meltdown, she is married to Michael, an unfaithful Canadian banker who takes her for granted, and mother to Jack, a freakishly tall teenager whose contempt for the technologically challenged older generation many parents will recognise: &quot;\u2026 after all, his mother grew up before the internet and therefore knew nothing&quot;. In fact, Harriet is rather more internet-savvy than her family gives her\u00a0credit for, setting up false Facebook accounts to spy on what her son is doing (dabbling in marijuana, as it turns out), as well as to keep tabs on a young woman named Daisy, a television researcher who was adopted as a child and is now also using online sources to\u00a0trace her birth mother. It is a novel about secrets, in other words; the greatest secret of all being\u00a0that Harriet has installed an illegal immigrant in her spare room on\u00a0the fairly safe assumption that her family will be too absorbed in their own lives to notice. The genial satire about the munificence of being born in\u00a0Richmond is neatly handled: &quot;If she didn&apos;t get to\u00a0the supermarket, Harriet&apos;s family would starve. Well, not starve exactly \u2026 &apos; And Pullinger&apos;s empathy for\u00a0the characters makes them hugely likable \u2013 even the truculent streak of\u00a0adolescence that is Jack, and his corpulent dad, a Canadian expatriate who is, yes,\u00a0struggling with his sense of displacement. But, perhaps inevitably for a project of this type, the flaws in the conception are most noticeable at the point where the digital and analogue worlds align. It would be absurd for novelists to fail to acknowledge the impact of social media, yet it equally leads to passages in which all that seems to occur is that characters log in to keep a surreptitious eye on what the other characters are doing. It may be a reflection of how we\u00a0live today, but as a plot device computers have become a marvellous convenience.

I ask, in part, because of the character of the guest list at their parties. Last year, the venue for the Tory summer fundraising dinner was the old Billingsgate fish market, this year a grand private members&apos; club. Russian property developers, a Greek shipping tycoon, an Iranian investment banker, a Slovenian private equity magnate, Bermudan and Dubai-based financiers mingled with a medley of their British counterparts and stars of the Tory party. Guests worth together a cool \u00a311bn were gathered to be tapped for cash, a skill at which the party has become a dab hand. The organising committee of the events is chaired by passionate Eurosceptic Howard Shore, founder of Shore Capital, a private investment company. The model is American fundraising dinners. Someone rich, usually on the organising committee, sponsors a table and then persuades very rich friends or part of the committee&apos;s network to pay typically a \u00a31,000 a head to join the table, which will be graced by a member of the cabinet or the London mayor. Billingsgate, for example, raised \u00a3250,000 in table charges before the event even began. Altogether, around \u00a3500,000 this year was raised by the auction alone. Auction proceeds and table charges will bring in directly around \u00a31m, but after Billingsgate last year another \u00a31.1m was registered as donations in the week after the event. A useful return for one dinner. But money never comes completely free. Although there was the usual kerfuffle about whether some donations conformed to electoral commission rules, you can be sure that the donors will have taken care to be on the British electoral roll and donations made within the albeit not very strict rules. Both the donors and the Tory party would be crass to try and dodge them. As for direct influence, many of the donors want no more than to keep the Labour party out of government and to use part of their fortune to support what they would characterise as the party of liberty, freedom and enterprise. They are not directly lobbying any particular policy concessions, although the access and private mobile numbers could one day be helpful. To be part of the Tory conversation with the possibility of influence is enough. (Nor can the Labour party, with its own summer fundraising event coming up this Wednesday at London&apos;s Roundhouse, cry foul too loudly: its supporters will want to be part of Labour&apos;s conversation in a very similar way.) Even if there were public funding of our political parties, be sure they would still hold such events to raise additional funds. The concern is much more deep-seated and profound than whether party fundraising rules have been broken \u2013 or whether the events and their guests are sufficiently transparent, important though both questions are. What is striking about the invitation lists for both the Billingsgate and Hurlingham events is who is not on them. Mainstream business and finance were conspicuous by their absence. The big money guests are people from the darker side of global capitalism, using the leverage available in the shadow banking system over the last two decades to make fortunes in property and private equity. I could spot no great innovators or business builders. They are almost entirely populated by the new seekers of risk-free profit, congratulating themselves on their entrepreneurial acumen when in truth their skill has been to borrow aggressively as private or family-owned companies at a time of rising asset prices away from the prying eyes of public shareholders or regulators. And then to use the many unregulated and untaxed gaps in the new global economy to hide the financial results from the authorities. Too many for my taste have toppled over the edge and are embroiled in battles with varying authorities in their former homelands for alleged fraud or tax evasion. Small wonder Central Office was so reluctant to confirm the guest lists. Their wealth seems proof positive in their own eyes of their genius, as well as in the eyes of uncritical members of the Conservative cabinet who bait the tables at which they sit. Nor is it any surprise that in the main they should be enthusiastic libertarians impatient not only of the state but of loyalty to country. Some sponsor exclusive US-based libertarian business associations such as the Milken Institute or Concordia Summit. They perch temporarily in Britain because it has both a hyper-relaxed attitude to &quot;wealth generation&quot; and is a very agreeable place to live \u2013 you even get invited to Tory fundraising events. Paying taxes is optional, regulation is cursory, the chance of prosecution minimal and in any case eminently defensible by Rolls-Royce lawyers against an under-resourced Serious Fraud Office and Crown Prosecution Service. The Tory party invokes its great tradition with portraits of Disraeli and Churchill, both of whom would turn in their graves at the new company their heirs are keeping. The aim is to complete &quot;the project&quot; with the 40:40 strategy : hold 40 marginals and win 40 more to win a parliamentary majority in 2015 to press on with dismantling the state, the social contract and Britain&apos;s EU links. In this, the party will be backed by our overwhelming centre-right press. Constituency associations, rarely more than a hundred strong, will nominate Eurosceptic libertarians as their standard-bearers \u2013 a brand of conservatism philosophically very distant from what their constituents believe Toryism is about \u2013 but disguised by the legitimising, comforting mantle of apparently being a commonsense Tory. This is a party on its way to becoming a multinational libertarian sect, whose preoccupations are no longer those either of much of its electorate or of the business community \u2013 wrestling with how genuinely to innovate, invest and motivate workforces in a world of increasingly amoral, ownerless companies so beloved and promoted by the sect. Nor would the task of building businesses be made easier by departure from the EU, promoted passionately by prominent sect advocates such as Howard Shore or MEP Daniel Hannan. David Cameron, at bottom a one-nation Conservative, is yoked to a monster. He has kept his impossibly riven party together, for which he is given too little credit. His successors will find the task very much harder, perhaps impossible.

The wall of Barry Huggett&apos;s office is lined from floor to ceiling with neat rows of files \u2013 one for each of his 460 children. They&apos;re packed with letters from staff detailing students&apos; needs: reports from occupational therapists, educational psychologists and speech and language therapists, to name a few. The school, which Huggett has led for some 20 years, only admits students with language-based problems such as dyslexia though, as he points out, teachers rarely refer to a child&apos;s label. &quot;We&apos;re interested in what their needs are, and it&apos;s likely that those needs will change significantly with time,&quot; he says, adding that many are actually comorbid, meaning that they have aspects of more than one learning difficulty. &quot;You&apos;re not stuck with one thing forever. If you label children there&apos;s a danger that you teach to the label: &apos;He&apos;s one of those, so I&apos;ll teach him this way.&apos;&quot; At More House, teachers focus on finding students&apos; strengths as well as supporting their weaknesses. This means paying close attention to pupil progress, and providing a diverse curriculum \u2013 the sixth-form offers around 20 different qualifications to a year group of just 60 students. Huggett, who has been awarded an OBE for his services to education, joined the teaching profession after a brief spate in pharmaceutical and actuarial businesses. On his first day working in life insurance he realised that office life wasn&apos;t for him. &quot;I&apos;d dash out into St James&apos; park every lunchtime and say &apos;I&apos;m free, I&apos;m free,&apos;&quot; he laughs. Teaching offered a much more fulfilling career choice, and after working in state primaries and prep schools he took his first headship at More House. &quot;I came here very naive and not really knowing very much about special needs at all. It wasn&apos;t the opportunity to make a difference that appealed to me,&quot; he recalls. &quot;The main thing was that it looked like a challenge.&quot; The quality of education available to students with learning difficulties has developed a great deal since Huggett joined the school in the 1990s, when \u2013 as he puts it diplomatically \u2013 provision across the country &quot;probably wasn&apos;t desperately good.&quot; But there are still children who fall through the cracks. A lot of students join More House because they haven&apos;t had a positive experience of schooling elsewhere. &quot;It might be that the child is not progressing as they should and is maybe being turned off school,&quot; he says, adding that some students have been school phobic when starting More House. &quot;That doesn&apos;t mean that we are better than the schools that they&apos;ve come from, it just means that we&apos;re able to offer things in a different way.&quot; As an independent school, More House has the ability to deliver a curriculum in a way that suits its children&apos;s needs \u2013 a freedom now also granted to academies and free schools. The range of qualifications on offer helps it secure above average results: between 70 to 75% of students get five A* to C passes at GCSE. School leavers&apos; employment records are equally impressive \u2013 after studying the outcomes of a group of 200 former students aged 22 to 35, More House found that only two were out of work. Schools shouldn&apos;t be discouraged from offering vocational options, according to Huggett, who fears that such subjects are being downgraded. &quot;Fine yes, we want our education system to be as good as Singapore&apos;s, but the country doesn&apos;t just need people who can do history, geography, a language and a bit of maths and science. Some students would be better off learning how to weld or make things out of wood \u2013 society needs these people too.&quot; Getting a place at More House isn&apos;t easy. Almost half of parents manage to secure local authority (LA) funding, while the rest have to pay the school fees themselves. It&apos;s also oversubscribed and only takes a very specific group of learners. Those hoping to enter have to sit an admissions assessment to test whether or not they will benefit from the type of teaching on offer. Too often, explains Huggett, special education needs (SEN) students are incorrectly assessed or clumsily put alongside children who have very different needs. &quot;I&apos;ve known children who&apos;ve been labelled as something that they&apos;re not, simply to fit the criteria of the school.&quot; The acute shortage of specialist schools does not help the situation. &quot;There is a huge need for places in schools like this,&quot; he explains. &quot;There aren&apos;t many schools like More House around \u2013 we&apos;re the largest, but we&apos;re small.&quot; Years have passed since the Bercow report highlighted the paucity of provision for children with language-based learning difficulties, but little has changed. Although the green paper on special educational needs and disability offered hope, the lack of funding available to local authorities means reforms are unlikely to live up to expectations, says Huggett. He feels that an opportunity has been lost: &quot;It seems that the whole thing has been downgraded. It will be delivered by local authorities who do not have the funding. It doesn&apos;t feel like authorities know how it&apos;s going to work. There&apos;s a lot of misinformation out there.&quot; And while the introduction of education, health and care plans (EHCP) will benefit children with more severe disabilities, it is unlikely that they will help the type of young people who attend his school. He suspects that in future years, fewer of his students will be LA-funded. &quot;There&apos;s less money to go around, and \u2013 for the children we deal with \u2013 I think parents will find it harder to get an EHCP for their child. I&apos;m intrigued to see how it will turn out.&quot; In the meantime Huggett is taking his own steps to tackle the shortage of special school places. He has ambitions to open a school similar to More House in the north of England, where there are very few opportunities for students with language-based learning difficulties. Huggett hopes that by helping to open an SEN school in Dubai in September 2015, he will raise enough money to fund the project. And, given the lack of specialist provision in the English-speaking world more broadly, he thinks there may be opportunities for expansion elsewhere. &quot;We&apos;re having nothing to do with the Dubai school financially, an investor is taking care of that side of it. But we will, by helping to run the school, get a fairly reasonable fee which we&apos;re using to set up another school here. &quot;Up beyond Leeds, or even below Leeds, there is very little provision of this sort.

A damaged collar bone and torn ligaments, self-inflicted in a crash during the desperate final metres of stage one, had ended his Tour de France and left him \u201cabsolutely devastated\u201d. Worse still, an Omega Pharma-Quick-Step doctor later revealed that his injuries were \u201cvery likely\u201d to need surgery, which would keep him off the bike for six weeks and rule him out of the Commonwealth Games. Cavendish will know for sure after a further MRI scan but for now the unwelcome title of being the first man out of the 2014 Tour hurts enough. \u201cI held a bit of optimism that it was maybe just swelling and would go down overnight but it\u2019s actually worse,\u201d he told the scrum of reporters gathered outside his team bus. \u201cIt\u2019s not possible to start from a medical point of view.\u201d His words were pained but philosophical. \u201cWe kind of knew on Saturday night,\u201d he said. \u201cI normally bounce back from some crashes quite well. I assessed my body and for the first time in my career I knew something was wrong.\u201d Cavendish admitted he was at fault for leaning into the Australian rider Simon Gerrans as they charged for the line and he later apologised. \u201cI tried to find a gap that wasn\u2019t there,\u201d he said. Gerrans was able to start the second stage and finished 1min 45sec behind Vincenzo Nibali but said he was struggling too. \u201cYou know those double-decker buses they have here in the UK? I woke up feeling like one of them drove on me during the night,\u201d he said. At least Chris Froome, one of only three Britons left in the race alongside Geraint Thomas and Simon Yates, warmed locals\u2019 hearts as he briefly surged into the lead up Jenkin Road in Sheffield, shortly before the finish. But there was no disguising the loss Cavendish\u2019s swift departure means for the Tour. Everyone was relishing his head-to-head contest with the German Marcel Kittel, yet it ended before battle was ever truly joined. In last year\u2019s race Kittel won four stages to Cavendish\u2019s two \u2013 including victory along the Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the Manxman\u2019s domain. This was supposed to be the rematch. That the pair had barely raced against each other since only heightened the intrigue. In February Kittel beat Cavendish in a sprint finish in the one-day Dubai Tour and, though Cavendish won two stages at the Tirreno-Adriactico in April, Kittel was not overly exerting himself. Now the dynamic changes and the path clears for Kittel to win the Tour\u2019s flattest stages. As the Irish sprinter Sean Kelly, the British Eurosport commentator who won five stages of the Tour and four green jerseys in the 1980s, put it: \u201cIt is a huge disappointment for the race. I can\u2019t see who can now challenge Kittel on the flat stages in these early days.\u201d Who else is there? Andr\u00e9 Greipel is a very talented sprinter whose legs, like Kittel\u2019s, need time to wind up to full speed- but Kittel is faster than him. Peter Sagan is a brilliant all-rounder, who can climb mountains and contest sprints, but he is not a thrash-metal merchant. Cavendish offered something different: a sudden burst of power that when perfectly timed earned him victory so many times in this race. Without him around, Kittel will fancy his chances of winning Monday\u2019s flattish 155km third stage from Cambridge to London and Tuesday\u2019s almost replica 163.5km fourth stage from Le Touquet to Lille. Stage 15 from Tallard to N\u00eemes, stage 19 from Maubourguet to Bergerac and the final stage into Paris will also be on the German\u2019s wish list. The five tour wins he has could soon be pushing double figures. Next time Cavendish and Kittel meet at the Tour the Manxman will have turned 30. Once that might have been seen as a death sentence for a top-level sportsman but no longer. The Australian Robbie McEwen \u2013 a small and nippy sprinter, not unlike Cavendish \u2013 won 10 of his 12 Tour de France stage victories after he turned 30. Mario Cippolini won eight of his 12 victories after that, including four in a row in 1999, when he was 32. Thor Hushovd won half his 10 victories after his 30th birthday. There is one difference, of course. They never had a young Kittel in their slipstream scenting blood and venting thunder. Cavendish knows what awaits when he returns.    #OPQS #TDF update: @MarkCavendish will not start Stage 2 today.

The revelation by French investigators adds a new twist to the murder mystery, which has thrown up a series of false leads since Hilli, his wife, Iqbal, and mother-in-law, Suhaila-al-Allaf, were shot dead along with a passing cyclist. Hilli&apos;s two daughters survived the attack at a layby on a wooded mountain road near Annecy on 5 September 2012. &quot;We have found out some surprising things about Iqbal, and we still don&apos;t have answers to some of the questions,&quot; said lead investigator Lieutenant-Colonel Benoit Vinnemann. Before marrying Hilli, Iqbal had never told her family about a US visit between February 1999 and December 2000 in which she married a dentist who was 13 years her senior. They divorced soon afterwards. Iqbal was herself a dentist. She met her second husband in Dubai a couple of years later. The former husband, known only as James T, died on September 5 2012 in Natchez, Mississippi. The official cause of death was a heart attack. &quot;Is there a family secret that we haven&apos;t found? Does it concern Saad, or his wife Iqbal?&quot; said Vinnemann. In a further twist, the Annecy prosecutor, Eric Maillaud, said on Monday that a 35-year-old Iraqi had been placed under investigation last month on suspicion of carrying out a contract killing against Iraqis. However the man, who was not identified, had been released. &quot;He denied taking part in any contract whatsoever. He even denies the existence of this contract,&quot; Maillaud said. He added that investigators had been unable to establish any link with the Hilli family. The Iraqi was the third person to be arrested in connection with the murders. Hilli&apos;s brother Zaid al-Hilli was arrested by British police who suspected a possible dispute with Saad over a family inheritance. However, he strongly denied any role in the murders and was subsequently released. Then last February, French police appeared to have made a breakthrough by announcing the arrest of a 48-year-old Frenchman suspected of being the motorcyclist who had been spotted near the scene of the shootings. But he too was released although he continued to be questioned on unrelated arms possession offences. The police have been puzzled by the weapon used in the shooting, which would appear to rule out a professional killing: a 7.65mm Lugar PO6 handgun, issued to the Swiss army and police in the 1920s and 1930s. Hilli was staying in a caravan site in Annecy with his family when they decided to go on the fatal excursion to the village of Chevaline. One of his daughters was seriously hurt in the attack, while the other survived by hiding under the skirt of Iqbal al-Hilli, who was sitting in the back. The bodies were discovered by a British cyclist, Brett Martin.", "title": "Alps shootings: murdered woman's 'secret' ex-husband died on same day", "sentences": ["She met her second husband in Dubai a couple of years later."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-08T16:38:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/architecture-design-blog/2014/jul/09/worlds-first-indoor-city-dubai-mall-of-the-world", "tags": ["Architecture", "Culture", "Dubai", "Dubai holidays", "United Arab Emirates", "Cities"], "article": "For the desert city-state that has the tallest building in the world, as well as the biggest flower garden and largest aquarium on the planet, plus islands shaped like palm trees, buildings in the shape of sails, and an entire archipelago shaped like the world itself, there was only one obvious next step: building an entire city indoors.

After Holland failed to qualify for the World Cup final following penalty shootout defeat to Argentina, the 62-year-old will now end his tenure coaching the side with Saturday\u2019s third-place play-off game against Brazil. Van Gaal is then expected to travel straight back to Amsterdam, attending an official World Cup reception on Monday, and so may arrive in Manchester as early as Tuesday. The hope at Old Trafford is to have Van Gaal\u2019s unveiling on Wednesday or Thursday \u2013 he is yet to have one due to the World Cup \u2013 before the club take an early afternoon flight to Los Angeles on Friday. There, United begin the two-week tour with a training camp before the opening match, against LA Galaxy at Pasadena\u2019s Rose Bowl on 23 July. Defender Chris Smalling says the tour will be vital to the new manager\u2019s preparations: \u201cPre-season is always massively important and the tour gives the manager an opportunity to get all the players together and drill home his ideas that will last for the rest of the season. It\u2019s a crucial period.\u201d Van Gaal, who has been in regular contact with the United executive during the World Cup, will step up his efforts to strengthen the squad next week, with Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Mats Hummels, Real Madrid\u2019s \u00c1ngel Di Mar\u00eda and Juventus\u2019s Arturo Vidal high on his list of priorities. Meanwhile, United are yet to decide whether to play any lucrative friendlies next season to ease the \u00a335m-plus loss of having no European football for the first time since 1989. The club have been considering whether to do so since the spring when the prospect of finishing outside a Europa League place under the former manager, David Moyes, became apparent. However with Van Gaal having replaced Moyes the plans are now in the balance, with nothing finalised. United do not need permission from the Premier League or any other governing body to arrange the games, so the decision will be taken on a logistical basis. Van Gaal may decide that after Liverpool finished second last term having had no European football, he wants his new team to focus solely on challenging again with no distractions. As United are constantly offered multi-million-pound deals to play around the world in exhibition and testimonial games, the club hierarchy would be confident of filling the financial shortfall created by being out of European competition. Last season United turned down a sizeable offer to play a friendly during a warm-weather break in Dubai, and potential opposition could be against sides from the Middle East, China or America. United played a testimonial in Saudi Arabia, in January 2008, for the former Wolverhampton Wanderers reserve team player Sami Al-Jaber. The team jetted out to the Middle East directly after a Premier League game against Reading on a Saturday for the friendly two days later in what was a 6,000-mile round trip. While that exercise yielded the club around \u00a31m, during the six intervening years the increase in social media and new pay-per-view models means they could expect to earn considerable sums from other friendlies, beyond any appearance money offered by the hosts. United made last August\u2019s pre-season friendly with the Swedish side AIK available on pay-per-view for \u00a35.95. With the club\u2019s huge global fanbase, the earnings from matches sold in this way next year are potentially lucrative.", "title": "Louis van Gaal to officially join Manchester United after Holland exit", "sentences": ["Last season United turned down a sizeable offer to play a friendly during a warm-weather break in Dubai, and potential opposition could be against sides from the Middle East, China or America."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-10T10:44:48Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/10/rory-mcilroy-cards-opening-round-64-scottish-open", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Rory McIlroy\u2019s second-day syndrome has been suitably prevalent already this year to add intrigue to what already promises to be a fascinating Friday at the Scottish Open. From Dubai to Dublin, Ohio, and a few places in between \u2013 including Augusta National \u2013 McIlroy\u2019s curious round-two affliction has undermined hopes of victory. During a meeting between the pair, even the great Jack Nicklaus admitted bemusement about the source of McIlroy\u2019s fluctuating fortunes. When McIlroy did win, at Wentworth in May, he was charging through the field rather than leading from the front. At Royal Aberdeen, McIlroy flew out of the traps once again, in a style reminiscent of his two major victories to date. An opening round of 64 \u2013 a course record \u2013 placed him at the summit of the Scottish Open leaderboard and made a mockery of the blustery conditions. As the 25-year-old knows all too well, focus is firmly fixed on what happens next. \u201cI think it is a mental thing more than anything else,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cTrying to keep yourself in the lead or trying to keep yourself up there. I think every time that I\u2019ve played well or had success in a tournament, my mind hasn\u2019t been too much on the leaderboard or too much on my position in the tournament. \u201cI feel like sometimes this year when I\u2019ve gotten myself into the lead or I shot 63 in the first round [at the Dubai Desert Classic and Memorial Tournament], I focused too much on where I was on the leaderboard or where I was in the tournament instead of just going out and trying to play another solid round of golf.\u201d McIlroy is currently a picture of contentment on and off the course, which renders him a live danger wherever he plays. The box office moment from day one here was the Northern Irishman\u2019s drive at the 436-yard 13th, which found the green. \u201cIan Poulter was in the group in front; I told him I hit a three-wood,\u201d McIlroy smiled. When asked where the round ranked amongst his best on links courses, the two-time winner admitted it was \u201cright up there\u201d. McIlroy added: \u201cI\u2019m confident in my ability and I\u2019m more confident than ever in my ability to hit the shots I need to in winds like this, to control my ball flight. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m as prepared as I have ever been to play this sort of golf.\u201d Which contrasts sharply to 12 months ago, when McIlroy was regularly cutting a dispirited figure and struggling to adapt to both the pressures associated with a stunning 2012 and change in equipment. \u201cIt\u2019s chalk and cheese,\u201d he acknowledged. \u201cI mean, it\u2019s just polar opposites. This time last year I was searching for things, trying to get the ball under control, working on a few things in my swing and not really too confident with anything. \u201cObviously this year is a little different. I\u2019m really confident with what I\u2019m doing with my swing. I\u2019m controlling my ball flight really well. And that translates into going out on the course and shooting good scores.\u201d McIlroy\u2019s Royal Aberdeen record was briefly under threat from the Argentinian player Ricardo Gonz\u00e1lez, who reached eight under through 13 holes. Gonz\u00e1lez stumbled, but only slightly, to card a 65. He has his eyes fixed on a dual sporting success this weekend. \u201cI\u2019ve got my son, Santiago, caddying for me,\u201d said Gonz\u00e1lez. \u201cWe had a nice dinner last night \u2013 a steak \u2013 and watched Argentina win the football. What would be great would be if I could win this tournament and Argentina could beat Germany 3-1 on Sunday.\u201d Luke Donald has similar aspirations, if not including the football, after his bogey-free opening round of 67. The Englishman has endured a strangely poor run in majors since last year\u2019s US Open but believes he is coming back to form with the Open Championship a matter of days away. \u201cI\u2019m here to try and win this tournament,\u201d Donald said. \u201cI had three weeks off. That was really the preparation. It\u2019s nice to see the preparation pay off with 67 today. So things are heading in the right direction. \u201cThis course is a gem.

On the\u00a0title page, the word &quot;Not&quot; looked as though it had been added at the last minute in handwriting. More recently, there was a popular blog called birminghamitsnotshit.co.uk, the aim of which was to offer a counter-narrative to those who believed otherwise. But in both cases there was a\u00a0problem: each made it look like the city had a case to answer. Really, they suggested, there was more to Britain&apos;s second city than a risibly depressive adenoidal accent, a road system that Jeremy Clarkson alleged was diabolically devised to take you away from the cheerlessly brutalist post-industrial city, and a culinary speciality whose name was Urdu for bucket. But the counter-narrative often only served to highlight the original narrative. Birmingham&apos;s problem? It protests too much. This year, though, it&apos;s got bigger problems. Thanks to the Trojan horse row and the investigation into the suspected hoax letters alleging that some city schools had been taken over by Islamist extremists, Birmingham schools have been made to seem a hotbed of Islamic fundamentalism. Thanks to the failings of the council&apos;s children&apos;s services department, which led Ofsted&apos;s chief inspector, Michael Wilshaw to call Birmingham &quot;a national disgrace&quot;, the city seemed to have betrayed its responsibility to its most vulnerable. Thanks to Benefits Street, Channel 4&apos;s TV series widely derided as &quot;poverty porn&quot; and filmed in Winson Green, Birmingham seemed a magnet for economically unproductive burdens on \u2013 what&apos;s the Cameroonian expression? \u2013 hard-working Britons. All three of these elements have added up to a picture suggesting that if Britain is broken, Birmingham is more so \u2013 it&apos;s not so much the great heart of England (as the marketing people once styled the city) as a catastrophe of 1.1\u00a0million people. Birmingham&apos;s 2014 is about to get worse. The council leader, Albert Bore, tells me that he has to make a further \u00a3159m cuts for 2015/16 from the council&apos;s already decimated services. &quot;There&apos;s no more scope for salami slicing,&quot; he says ominously, &quot;we&apos;re going to have to cut in ways we haven&apos;t yet done.&quot; In October, he and his Labour colleagues will announce a list of the cuts they think the least damaging. Bore argues the city is hard done by, not just by a coalition government that has imposed an austerity agenda on finances, but also from a media whose distortions have made life more difficult for its communities. &quot;We&apos;re either trashed or ignored,&quot; he says. &quot;It&apos;s just that for the past few months it&apos;s been the former.&quot; He wanted to tell different stories: such as eulogising one of the most ethnically rich cities in the world with its Bangladeshi, Irish, Pakistanis, Caribbeans, Chinese, African communities, all rubbing along with white Britons; or that of a council creatively responding to the central-government strictures with private sector partnerships, to ensure that the impoverished are least hit by cuts. Such stories don&apos;t get traction in the national media, though. There&apos;s more mileage in presenting Brummies as benefits scroungers lying sofa-bound in their own filth and/or terrorists who won&apos;t rest until the black flag of an Islamic caliphate flies over Joe Chamberlain&apos;s Victorian Council House. Bore can&apos;t bear his city being traduced thus. &quot;Take diversity. If Birmingham does not celebrate the diversity of the city, then it&apos;s in trouble. This is why, for us, Trojan horse is such a tragedy. What we&apos;ve got is the whole of this city tarred with this Muslim extremism brush.&quot; But aren&apos;t there problems with some Birmingham schools \u2013 isn&apos;t that why six of them have been put into special measures? &quot;I can pretty reliably tell you that what&apos;s going to come from these new investigations is not that we&apos;ve got\u00a0Muslim radicalism in schools. This is\u00a0not about extremism in schools. It&apos;s governors doing things they shouldn&apos;t have been doing. Is it organised? Not to a major extent.&quot;     'If Birmingham does not celebrate the diversity of the city, then it\u2019s in trouble' \u2026 Birmingham council leader Albert Bore.  Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian    Bore goes on: &quot;Out there in the Muslim community it&apos;s bloody difficult because they feel they&apos;re being pilloried, they feel they are being treated very differently from the rest of society.&quot; And they&apos;re not wrong to feel that way, he suggests. &quot;I have a case in a very white area of the city where evangelical Christians tried to do something very similar \u2013 tried to change the ethos of the school from within by putting governors in there.&quot; But Christians aren&apos;t being castigated by the media, education secretary or Ofsted for infiltrating school governing bodies. Muslims are. Birmingham Ladywood MP Shabana Mahmood says that her old school in Small Heath is one of 21 under investigation by Ofsted. &quot;Most of the pupils at the school are Muslim, which is probably the sole reason it got dragged into the whole Trojan horse debacle in the first place.&quot; Like Bore, Mahmood doesn&apos;t buy the\u00a0Islamic extremist conspiracy line: &quot;If\u00a0there was really evidence that the central charge laid at the doors of these schools \u2013 that there was an organised and successful attempt to radicalise the\u00a0children of this city \u2013 then don&apos;t you\u00a0think Ofsted would have found it?\u00a0Twenty-one inspections and the central charge remains unproven.&quot; In\u00a0lieu of evidence for radicalisation, she\u00a0says, is a\u00a0lazy interchange in public discourse between the words &quot;Muslim&quot; and &quot;extremist&quot;. Imran Awan, a criminologist at Birmingham City University, is examining the real-world consequences of this semantic slippage. He&apos;s poised to publish research into how the Trojan horse affair has made different ethnic groups in the city mutually suspicious. &quot;I&apos;ve found from my interviews Muslims whose neighbours no longer talk to them, and others who have had rubbish dumped in their front gardens. All because of Trojan horse.&quot; The comedian Jasper Carrott recently worried about ethnic tensions in his native city in an interview with the Birmingham Mail: &quot;Ten years ago we didn&apos;t have racial problems in Birmingham because different communities have always got on. I am starting to see that change now, which is very sad. Communities are becoming more enclosed in themselves. If we are not\u00a0careful, the city might start to get ghettoised. That&apos;s the great danger.&quot; Awan similarly worries that the demonisation of Muslims will make them turn away from the city and become more enclosed in themselves. &quot;Muslims are feeling increasingly like the Irish did in the 1970s \u2013 they&apos;re treated as a suspicious community.&quot; In\u00a0Birmingham, history repeats itself depressingly: its Irish population was, as I remember from living in the city during the 1970s, subject to racist attacks following the 1974 pub bombings. Many demonised Muslims live in Sparkbrook, the same inner-city district where the demonised Irish lived 40 years ago.     The new Library of Birmingham, the largest in Europe and a major source of civic pride.  Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian    Awan argues that Trojan horse was used politically to smear the city, and its Muslim community in particular, nowhere more clearly than when the government appointed former national head of counter-terrorism Peter Clarke to investigate the claims of schools being taken over by an extreme Islamist agenda \u2013 a move that even the West Midlands police chief constable Chris Sims called &quot;desperately unfortunate&quot;. &quot;We need,&quot; says Awan, &quot;a counter-narrative to all that.&quot; In arguing thus, Awan is a true Brummie. Brummies have always sought counter-narratives as redress against an outside world that misrepresents and misunderstands them. Awan&apos;s view is echoed by Birmingham council&apos;s chief executive, Mark Rogers, who says the city needs to\u00a0&quot;take on those who talk us down without doing anything to help&quot;. In his blog, Rogers tries to do just that. Did you know, for instance, that Birmingham was recently named the most entrepreneurial city in the UK outside the capital, and a &quot;start-up hotspot&quot;, by StartUp Britain? That Birmingham attracted more international visits last year than ever before according to the latest figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with almost one million visits (941,000)? That this year Birmingham was ranked as having the highest quality of life of\u00a0any UK city outside London by the Mercer Quality of Living report, proving Birmingham is as nice to live in as Rome, and better than Los Angeles or Dubai? Such civic tub-thumping is a traditional Brummie vice (or maybe a virtue); one that the city has indulged since Chamberlain was the mayor from 1873 to 1876. It was in those Brummie wonder years that sections of the second city began a hubristic strut that has never ceased. Chamberlain imposed on the city\u00a0then the Civic Gospel that non-conformist preacher George Dawson had\u00a0extolled from the pulpit. Dawson said that &quot;a town is a solemn organism through which shall flow, and in which shall be shaped, all the highest, loftiest and truest ends of man&apos;s moral nature&quot;. What that meant for Chamberlain was clearing slums, hostile takeovers of gas and water companies and building schools, swimming pools and libraries. The result? His biographer Peter Marsh wrote: &quot;Under his guidance Birmingham was known as the best-governed city in the industrial world.&quot; It isn&apos;t now, but could it be again? Echoes of that Civic Gospel can be heard in the pride with which Brummies speak of the new library of Birmingham, which opened last year to great acclaim, the biggest in Europe; or in the prospects for the city&apos;s ability to draw manufacturing and digital industries if the HS2 rail link to London opens at the currently derelict Curzon Street station in 2026.     'Let this be a turning point, a brand new year/ The city all around us, these pillars/ The mosaic spectacle of tower block/ The city a kaleidoscope, a daring embroidery' \u2026 Birmingham poet Joanna Skelt.  Photograph: David Sillitoe for the Guardian    Here, then, is the most bravura counter-narrative of all. Bore thinks that Birmingham&apos;s Civic Gospel can be revived for the 21st century even as the council is getting a public drubbing for poorly managing education, children&apos;s services and keeping the streets clean. Speaking at a conference earlier this\u00a0month, which marks the 100th anniversary of Chamberlain&apos;s death, Bore said: &quot;What I do think we can resurrect from the Civic Gospel is the idea of the city as a community and a driver of national prosperity, and the idea that the city must have a powerful, autonomous government that actively seeks to improve the lives of its citizens.&quot; But the autonomy Chamberlain had that enabled him to fashion Birmingham according to that gospel is\u00a0something that eludes Bore. Another counter-narrative comes from Jon Hickman, one of the clever media studies theorists whose birminghamitsnotshit.co.uk blog recently mutated into paradisecircus.com. Why the name change? &quot;Well, the original site was a response to the official story of Birmingham \u2013 you know, the marketing one where people are always saying it&apos;s got more miles of canals than Venice and there are pictures of men in crisp, white shirts drinking Peroni and girls eating salad al fresco in luxury apartments. Then we got co-opted \u2013 the people we were satirising started linking to us, so we had to change the name.&quot; Now, Hickman often satirises journalists on day trips from London who come to write articles about the city, countering their narratives about a city they don&apos;t get. &quot;They always start with that Jane Austen quote: &apos;One has no great hopes of Birmingham. I always say there is something direful in the sound.&quot; And go on to say how pleasantly surprised they were to find out it&apos;s not as shit as they thought. Patronising bastards.&quot; But if Birmingham isn&apos;t shit, what\u00a0is\u00a0it? &quot;A bit more gentle and accommodating at best. We were once asking what it is to be Brummie. The answer, I think, is inclusive. It&apos;s like: &apos;If\u00a0you want to be a Brummie that&apos;s all right with us, bab,&apos;&quot; Hickman says. &quot;Nowhere else is that inclusive.&quot; There is one final counter-narrative to the woeful story of Birmingham in 2014. Joanna Skelt emails me some poems she&apos;s written about the city during her year as Birmingham&apos;s poet laureate. One\u00a0of them, Connected Journeys, which she wrote for National Holocaust Day on 25 January, and which will be\u00a0published in September, begins indicting the city for once colluding in\u00a0the making of &quot;slave chains and armaments&quot;. But then she goes on to\u00a0write about the city&apos;s diversity in a\u00a0way Albert Bore might like: Each December inhabitants from every creed/And quarter marvel at the German market/All of us making what we can of it, of this time/Our mixed-race, mixed-heritage children/A testament to the glorious and extraordinary/Merging and transcending of difference/A testament to peace/Which must surely be the kernel that drives us on. In the final verse, standing below the city&apos;s ferris wheel, Skelt writes: Let this be a turning point, a brand new year/The city all around us, these pillars/ The mosaic spectacle of tower block/The city a kaleidoscope, a daring embroidery/Spread out like spokes, a web, itself a giant wheel/Encompassing, each of us carrying/Wrapped inside ourselves/Our own threads and journeys/Each one of us an infinitesimal part/Such that every wrong, tear or break is ours too/Stitched into the very tapestry of us. She&apos;s writing a series of poems about the representation of the Muslim Pakistani community in Alum Rock. Just\u00a0a little thing, a stitch, to keep her city \u2013 that &quot;daring embroidery&quot; \u2013 from unravelling. Perhaps in such gestures, as\u00a0much as grandstanding libraries and high-speed rail links, is the kind of Civic Gospel Birmingham needs today. \u2022 This article was updated on 12 July 2014.

The garden is a testing lab for Grove Labs, a company designing an appliance to grow leafy green vegetables indoors. Its two founders, who conceived of the business while students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, envision people\u2019s homes having \u201cgroves,\u201d or spots to grow their own fresh food. The company, which recently raised $2m in \u201cseedling\u201d funding, says it intends to help people grow food productively at home using sensor-controlled gardens and smart phone apps. The Grove Lab founders are among a growing number of entrepreneurs who are getting a green thumb. They\u2019re using information technology and new lighting techniques to advance the field of \u201cbuilding-integrated agriculture,\u201d or growing food in structures such as warehouses, rather than greenhouses.  Proponents contend that indoor farming and urban farming are necessary to feed a growing global population. Urbanites could potentially purchase locally grown, pesticide-free food year-round, lowering emissions associated from tractors and shipping products. Producing food indoors also means that consumers are shielded from disruptions in the food supply caused by natural disasters and that farmland could be restored to ecosystems, such as forests, that could absorb greenhouse gases. Growing food indoors uses 98% less water and 70% less fertilizer than traditional methods, and has a higher yield, according to the Association for Vertical Farming. So far, indoor farms still contribute little to the global food system because production costs are higher than conventional growing methods. And they tend to use more electricity. But businesses are starting take advantage of new technologies, including energy-efficient LED lighting and automated systems, to bring down costs. As these technologies become standardized, indoor farming will make sense in more locations, says Chad Sykes, CEO of Indoor Harvest, which builds custom indoor farms for professional growers. \u201cThere are lots of interesting technologies that will come out to automate indoor farming and make it even more efficient than it is now,\u201d Sykes says. \u201cCompanies are getting into it because they see a niche they can fill.\u201d Over time, he predicts robots will seed and harvest food and software systems will control every aspect of production, from growing conditions to sales.      PodPonics, based in Atlanta, Georgia, is one of a growing number of startups using technology to bring farming indoors. Photograph: PodPonics    Cultivating plants in an enclosed space, obviously, is nothing new. With hydroponics, plants grow in nutrient-enriched water, rather than in soil outdoors. Some growers use variations on this basic approach to improve productivity. FarmedHere in Chicago, for instance, grows greens, such as lettuce and basil, using aquaponics, in which the waste from farmed fish is used as fertilizer for plants in a closed system. With today\u2019s plumbing and filtration systems, these combined systems can recycle virtually all their fresh water and avoid the use of pesticides, the company says. Some of the most innovative vertical farming projects are using aquaponics, which proponents say allows them to generate more food in less space. New technologies allow indoor farms to improve the productivity of existing hydroponic growing methods. Atlanta, Georgia-based PodPonics has developed a system to grow greens in shipping containers using custom-built software that controls when water cycles through its plant trays and nutrients are applied. It also schedules the proprietary LED lights to run during off-peak hours to save money on electricity bills, says Adam Johnston, a high-tech farmer at PodPonics.  The company ships its produce, which is grown in dozens of its shipping container-size \u201cpods,\u201d to local supermarkets, which keeps transportation costs relatively low. About 40% of the cost of food is associated with transportation, Johnston says. To expand to other locations, the company would build farms near those end markets. \u201cWe can go to a place like Dubai where they can\u2019t grow food,\u201d Johnston says. \u201cWe have the technology to make that happen.\u201d Another company called Freight Farms is selling its systems to growers to encourage local food production, rather than selling food itself.     PodPonics grows produce directly in shipping containers, making it easier to transport it to local markets. Photograph: PodPonics   LED lights, which are energy-efficient, have come down in price to the point where more farmers can replace traditional grow lights to save money on energy. The light from LEDs can also be precisely controlled, including the amount of light that\u2019s applied, how evenly it\u2019s spread on a plant, and even the portions of the light spectrum that maximize plant growth. By fine-tuning growing conditions, farmers can boost productivity and adjust light output to encourage different traits in food, says Paul Gray, senior horticulture scientist at lighting startup Illumitex. In one case, a vertical farm was able to more than double its plants\u2019 productivity, Gray says. \u201cWe get calls every day, everyone from people who want to grow more at their house to investment firms who want to start a company by taking over an abandoned warehouse and converting it to an indoor grow space,\u201d he says.  Even with more high-tech growing gear, though, indoor farmers face commercial challenges. Food is a low-margin business and indoor growers have higher operating costs \u2013 after all, they\u2019re paying for light to grow food rather than relying on the sun. That\u2019s why many producers sell their goods as premium organic products to high-end restaurants and supermarkets, which is a small market in the global food system. Also, indoor growing is largely limited to greens and mushrooms farms and isn\u2019t suitable for some other crops grown outdoors.  It remains to be seen whether indoor farming can displace a significant portion of the current food production or serve consumers who can\u2019t afford more expensive produce. But many indoor-farming entrepreneurs say their technology can serve to diversify the current food system, allowing food to be consumed where it\u2019s produced. \u201cThere has to be a fundamental change in how we grow food,\u201d PodPonics\u2019 Johnston says. \u201cGrowing food and shipping [it] across the country or the world doesn\u2019t make a whole lot of sense.\u201d Martin LaMonica is a Boston-based reporter covering energy, technology, business and the environment.

They have built a gargantuan conference centre in China that looks like a teetering stack of mirror-clad Jenga blocks, an enormous concert hall in Singapore in the shape of a crumpled beetle, and over 9.3m sq metres (100m sq ft) of shops, offices and hotels in variously sculpted towers across Asia and the Middle East. Now Aedas, one of the largest architecture practices in the world, plans to bring its flashy brand of mixed-use huge projects to London. And there is very little to stand in their way. \u201cOur Chinese clients have their sights set on London, and they know what they want,\u201d says Keith Griffiths, the Welsh-born chairman of Aedas, who presides over the 1,400-strong practice from its Hong Kong headquarters. \u201cThey are used to high rise, high density, truly mixed-use developments \u2013 having everything on one site, so you can live, work and play without ever leaving the building. We think that&apos;s the way London needs to densify.\u201d Based in Hong Kong since 1983, when he worked on the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank headquarters with Norman Foster, Griffiths has built up an empire of offices across Asia, with bases in 13 cities, from Shanghai and Singapore to New Delhi and Dubai. Last week Aedas announced a demerger from its European offices, where the scale of work was on a &quot;different trajectory&quot; (i.e. too small), but it has already set up a new base in London with the aim of importing its high-octane brand of gigantic Asian projects to Europe. The company has come to specialise, Griffiths says, in a particular kind of urban development that has grown out of these fast-paced emergent economies. It is a design philosophy that conceives chunks of cities like self-contained ocean liners: clusters of high rise buildings that are \u201cglued together\u201d at their bases on podiums that brim with retail and leisure, usually perched on top of major transport nodes.     The Star Performing Arts Centre in Singapore. Photograph: Aedas    \u201cThe closest London has come is Canary Wharf, but that&apos;s just a shopping mall servicing office blocks,\u201d he says. \u201cIt dies when the offices turn their lights off. We&apos;re talking about full 24-hour occupation, with a continuity of excitement between all the different floors, and blocks linked by elevated walkways above the streets.\u201d It is a form of mall urbanism that is now ubiquitous across Asia, as urban street patterns are trampled beneath galumphing glass behemoths. The city&apos;s ground level is surrendered to cars, while pedestrians scuttle between air-conditioned retail hubs overhead. They are self-contained commercial ecosystems, built and managed by single private interests, on a scale that makes London&apos;s biggest developments look like tiny specks on the planner&apos;s map. Such projects, says Griffiths, are usually between 465\u2013930,000 sq metres (5-10m sq ft) in China. Westfield Stratford City, London&apos;s Olympic shopping Mecca whose developers claim is Europe&apos;s largest such complex, is just 177,000 sq metres (1.9m sq ft). On the edge of Beijing&apos;s Olympic site, Aedas has completed the North Star mixed-use development, comprising a six-storey podium of swooping shopping arcades, from which 100m-tall towers rise into the smoggy skies. It is built on a plot measuring 200m x 200m, which the company&apos;s design director, Andrew Bromberg, describes as an \u201cextremely small site\u201d. By no means the worst of its kind, it is one of many such generic developments that are increasingly defining the nature of the Chinese capital: hermetic indoor worlds sprouting above stations, with little connection to the life of the street outside \u2013 because the street is usually a six-lane motorway.     The six-storey North Star development in Beijing.

Opposite the world&apos;s largest conference centre, it&apos;s a pair of hulking towers of staggered blocks that look like the result of a glitch in the computer modelling programme. \u201cPeople see the photos of the project and say, &apos;Where&apos;s the humanism in this?&apos;\u201d he admits. \u201cBut when you see it in China, you realise it&apos;s actually very contextual.\u201d He flicks through more slides of wide-angle photos and dazzling renderings, showing floor plates stretched into ever more unlikely shapes and cladding systems wrenched around twisted lumps, as different global cities merge into one free-form soup of contorted mirror glass. There is Centre 66 in Wuxi, a 372,000 sq metre (4m sq ft) complex of shops and office towers clustered around a Ming dynasty hall, and renderings for Xihongmen in Beijing, a 465,000 sq metre (5m sq ft) development on the Fifth Ring road, shaped like a troupe of streamlined golden tanks ready to charge at the city. Each sculpted carapace contains interiors of sparkling shopfronts arranged around swirling atria, visions of economic growth and prosperity, unperturbed by the fact that the country&apos;s largest mall still stands empty almost a decade after it was completed. Such inward-looking buildings, which often span several city blocks, may be \u201ccontextual\u201d to the new cities of China in some architects&apos; eyes, but how such ambitions translate to London remains questionable, where news of 230 new towers planned across the city has renewed scrutiny of the skyline.     Plan for the Xihongmen development in Beijing. Photograph: Aedas    China&apos;s biggest developers \u2013 from Greenland and Vanke, to Dalian Wanda and ABP \u2013 are already flocking to the capital in response to demand from the country&apos;s burgeoning billionaire class, looking to park their money overseas. Last year ABP signed a \u00a31bn deal to transform the Royal Docks into an Asian business district, while Greenland bought Wandsworth&apos;s Ram Brewery, slated for a 36-storey tower, and a site in Canary Wharf, where it plans the tallest residential building in Europe. In 2013 the Chinese were granted the most tier-one investor visas for the UK (which fast-tracks the immigration process for those investing more than \u00a31m in the country), overtaking Russia for the first time. In 2003 there were no dollar billionaires in China; this year, the Hurun Global Rich List recorded 358. With the slowdown in the Chinese economy and the strength of the renminbi versus the pound, London is an increasingly attractive proposition \u2013 and practices like Aedas are only too ready to provide the same services their clients are used to back home. But at what cost to the city? \u201cLondon can&apos;t continue just putting these towers up everywhere,\u201d says Griffiths. \u201cThe city&apos;s infrastructure can&apos;t cope with densification across the board. It needs to densify at nodal points, and we think these big integrated mixed-use developments, connected around stations at first and second-floor level, are the answer.\u201d It might sound like a vision from Blade Runner, but it is a proposition that dates back more than half a century, to a grand plan for a future London connected by elevated walkways. In 1947, in a wave of postwar optimism, Charles Holden and William Holford developed a plan for a network of routes at first-floor level that would connect buildings across the City. Most extensively completed around the Barbican estate, the Pedway scheme was abandoned by the 1980s, incomplete and partially demolished, as the tide turned against the idea of separating pedestrians from the streets below. (Its history is loving documented in the film Elevating London). The same happened in many US cities that had adopted elevated skywalks, from Milwaukee to Minneapolis to Cincinnati, where raised walkways resulted in empty pavements and deserted downtowns, forming cities that were physically separated by economic class, socially stratified in concrete and steel. After 30 years in Hong Kong, the spiritual home of the elevated walkway and urban escalator, Griffiths is optimistic that its lessons can be transferred. \u201cIf you have enough pedestrian activity, then the street doesn&apos;t die,\u201d he says. \u201cThere are three levels of the city in Hong Kong, and they&apos;re all flourishing.\u201d As London&apos;s increasingly international development market brings not only overseas investment, but the physical realities of urban forms spawned in the high-speed laboratories of Asia&apos;s developing cities, the skyline debate might end up being the least of our worries. The next frontier will be a wave of ground-scraping mega-buildings looking to gobble up our streets, making an ever more privatised, polarised city, all conveniently swept indoors.", "title": "China town: meet the architecture giant with Asian designs on London", "sentences": ["We think that&apos;s the way London needs to densify.\u201d Based in Hong Kong since 1983, when he worked on the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank headquarters with Norman Foster, Griffiths has built up an empire of offices across Asia, with bases in 13 cities, from Shanghai and Singapore to New Delhi and Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-15T14:29:32Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/16/henrik-stenson-tiger-woods-the-open-golf", "tags": ["The Open 2014", "Tiger Woods", "The Open", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Henrik Stenson, the world No2, is hoping to \u201chave a laugh or two\u201d playing alongside Tiger Woods during the opening rounds, although the joker in the Open pack turned deadly serious when discussing his dream of securing a first major title. Stenson tees off on Thursday alongside Woods and the former Masters champion \u00c1ngel Cabrera but, despite having yet to win a major, the Swede begins the tournament in finer fettle than either of his playing partners and is regarded as a contender for the title. No Scandinavian has lifted the Claret Jug but Stenson\u2019s form over the past year has been hugely impressive. He finished second at Muirfield last summer and third at Oak Hill in the PGA Championship, ending the year as the first player to win the FedEx Cup and Race to Dubai in the same season. His career trajectory has taken a drastic upward surge but the 38-year-old is aware that the majority of spectators at Hoylake following his three-ball will have eyes honed on Woods, who returns to a major championship for the first time after a lengthy lay-off following back surgery. When asked if he was ready for any extra pressure that came with playing with Woods, Stenson joked that it was the American who should be feeling the heat lining up alongside himself. Stenson said: \u201cI think it would have been a lot of sleepless nights for him of late. When did the draw come out? He looked tired, didn\u2019t he? \u201cNo, we have played a lot, but, yeah, I\u2019ve had some good success playing against him and managed to beat him a couple of times. So I\u2019ll try to play my game and play it as well as I can, and a few times it\u2019s been good enough to beat him. He\u2019s just one of the guys I need to beat if I want to do well this week but it\u2019s a good start if you know you can beat him. \u201cI think potentially the tough draw is the group ahead, because everyone [spectators] is searching for position. Whenever he\u2019s finished on the hole, they\u2019re trying to get into a good position to watch the next hole. That could be probably tough for them to play in that group.\u201d Asked how he liked to approach tournament golf, Stenson said that, at times, it is beneficial to lighten the mood on the course. \u201cYeah, we\u2019ll have a laugh or two. It kind of depends on how someone is playing and how the whole thing turns out. Every now and again we get the opportunity to socialise or small talk a little bit. I\u2019ll just fire away tomorrow and see what comes at him.\u201d Stenson was in prime position to secure a first Open title in Scotland last year but was undone by Phil Mickelson\u2019s late charge down the back nine, finishing three shots behind the American and ending the tournament on even par. For a player whose form had nosedived at the beginning of 2012, it has been a startling turnaround. Stenson started that year ranked 230th after a decline fuelled by injury and illness \u2013 coming after he lost a significant sum of money in Allen Stanford\u2019s Ponzi scheme \u2013 but he has clawed back to within touching distance of the summit. A victory here would see him usurp Adam Scott at the top of the rankings, providing the Australian slumps, but it is an elusive major title that Stenson craves the most. \u201cThe Open Championship is a highlight of any season for any player and I think especially European born ones,\u201d he said. \u201cI started playing golf in \u201988 and I watched the Ryder Cup and the Open Championship in \u201989. So I got some of my early junior memories from watching golf on television from this championship. It would mean the world to me to win. \u201cSo just because I\u2019ve had some great success, I don\u2019t think that dream has gone away. It\u2019s the last thing on my CV to make it complete, more or less, in my eyes. So I will try my hardest to make it happen. \u201cMotivation is always a factor and you\u2019ve got to have that drive if you want to make those things happen. I feel like I still have that.\u201d", "title": "Henrik Stenson quips that Tiger Woods should be feeling the Open heat", "sentences": ["He finished second at Muirfield last summer and third at Oak Hill in the PGA Championship, ending the year as the first player to win the FedEx Cup and Race to Dubai in the same season."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-16T15:15:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jul/17/history-of-airlines-shot-down-malaysia-airlines-mh17", "tags": ["Malaysia Airlines flight MH17", "Air transport", "Ukraine", "Europe", "World news", "Russia", "Malaysia", "Airline industry"], "article": "\u2022 On 20 April 1978 two Soviet fighter jets intercepted Korean Air flight 902 near Murmansk after it veered off course.

The beefed-up teams at major airports and border crossings in the UK are on alert for the start of the summer holidays, when experts say girls are at the highest risk of being taken out of the country. Specially trained Border Force agents will be working with police forces, which will receive new advice telling officers to put aside cultural sensitivities and fears of being branded racist in order to pursue investigations into FGM. The first guidance for the police on how to tackle FGM has been drawn up by the College of Policing and is being put out for consultation on Tuesday \u2013 as the prime minister, David Cameron, launches the Girl Summit, which is aimed at mobilising domestic and international efforts to end FGM and child marriage within a generation. As the summer holidays begin, an 80-strong team of specialist officers at Heathrow, 65 at Gatwick and 21 at Manchester will be on the lookout for at-risk children. The port of Harwich also has a new team, while specialised FGM training is also planned at Birmingham, London City and Stansted airports and the ports of Calais and Dunkirk. Flights to countries that practise FGM \u2013 including Kenya, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Dubai, Egypt and Turkey \u2013 will be targeted, said Ingrid Smith, assistant director of Border Force at Gatwick. &quot;The message we are sending with this intensification of operations is that the practice of FGM will not be tolerated in this country,&quot; she said. &quot;Police, border forces agents and social services will act together to stop this and people attempting to take children out of the country will be caught.&quot; James Brokenshire, the immigration and security minister, said border police were well-placed to gather intelligence on possible perpetrators and prevent FGM from being carried out. &quot;The school summer holidays are a time of particular risk for many girls,&quot; he said. &quot;Which is why we have teams of specially trained officers at major airports with the skills to identify and protect potential victims and stop the perpetrators.&quot; The guidance drawn up by the College of Policing is the first dealing with female genital mutilation and reflects growing public and political concern over the practice as well as the lack of prosecutions of individuals in the UK. Police officers in England and Wales will be told that when investigating the mutilation of young girls in the UK they must consider all child protection measures, including removing a girl from her family if they believe she is at risk. Under section 46 of the Children Act 1989, police officers can decide to remove a child who they believe is at risk of &quot;significant harm&quot; to a place of safety for up to 72 hours. They can also apply to a court for an emergency protection order when they believe a child is in imminent danger. Officers will also be told that they should consider removal of younger sisters in a household where there are concerns that an older girl is at risk of FGM, because the younger siblings will also need protection. Chief Constable Alex Marshall, chief executive of the College of Policing, said: &quot;We want to ensure that officers have the best information possible to help them to protect the vulnerable and tackle this terrible crime. &quot;We must not let perceptions of cultural sensitivities get in the way of action against female genital mutilation. This guidance will help build our understanding and confidence in policing this crime so that we&apos;re better able to respond to victims&apos; needs and ultimately bring perpetrators to justice.&quot; It warns officers not to be put off pursuing investigations because of the &quot;cultural sensitivities&quot; involved. &quot;Female genital mutilation is the deliberate cutting of the female genitalia. It is illegal, extremely painful and a form of violence against women and girls \u00a0\u2026 Officers must not avoid tackling FGM for fear of doing or saying the wrong thing or being considered racist.&quot; FGM has been illegal in the UK since 1985, and the law was tightened up in 2003 to make it an offence for a British resident to travel abroad in order to have FGM carried out on a child. Pressure has been growing on police and prosecutors over the failure \u2013 until earlier this year \u2013 to bring a single case to the British courts. Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, announced the first ever charge relating to FGM earlier this year but the case has yet to go through the courts. It is estimated that 24,000 girls in the UK are at risk of FGM each year and the college is calling for police forces in areas with large communities that practise the cutting to set up a directory of specialist interpreters whom they can trust. The guidance says: &quot;Officers\u00a0\u2026 should not use members of a person&apos;s own family or community as an interpreter as this may result in information being fed back to the suspects, the victim or witness being ostracised from their community, pressure being applied to withdraw a statement and the traditional view of the community being relayed to the witness.&quot; The advice is being put out to consultation with interested parties in order for the police to get input from all those with expertise on the subject. It will then be issued to all police forces to highlight the key areas officers should consider when investigating cases of suspected FGM. Officers are taken through different scenarios where the crime that has been committed is highlighted. The difficulties of pursuing cases of FGM are also picked out. It states: &quot;Unlike other forms of child abuse a mother who agrees to her daughter being mutilated believes she is acting in the best interests of the child\u00a0\u2026 in some cases parents may be under considerable pressure from members of their family or community to allow their daughter to undergo FGM.&quot; The police are advised to consider child protection measures \u2013 including the removal of the child at risk and younger sisters \u2013 if they have concerns they are at significant risk of FGM. Ahead of the Girl&apos;s Summit, councils have also called for any promotion of the practice of FGM by community or religious leaders to be made illegal under new government plans to toughen up the law. The Local Government Association (LGA) \u2013 backed by the NSPCC, British Arab Federation and FGM charity Forward \u2013 said the serious crime bill being used to toughen up FGM legislation needed to go further. Ann Lucas, the chair of the LGA&apos;s afer and Stronger Communities Board, said: &quot;Local authorities are determined to work with communities to end the practice and reduce the thousands of women and girls estimated to be at risk of FGM in the UK. However, their work to change long-standing cultural practices is made more difficult when community or religious leaders continue to promote it.&quot;", "title": "FGM child protection squads to target summer flights out of Britain", "sentences": ["Flights to countries that practise FGM \u2013 including Kenya, Ethiopia, Ghana, Nigeria, Dubai, Egypt and Turkey \u2013 will be targeted, said Ingrid Smith, assistant director of Border Force at Gatwick."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-21T15:20:58Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/jul/22/parents-allow-female-genital-mutilation-prosecuted-cameron-law", "tags": ["Female genital mutilation (FGM)", "Child protection", "Child marriage", "Health", "Women", "Society", "Children", "Health & wellbeing", "Social care", "World Health Organisation", "David Cameron", "Michael Gove", "UK news", "Girl Summit"], "article": "Parents will be prosecuted if they fail to prevent their daughter being cut, and all victims of female genital mutilation (FGM) will get lifelong anonymity, David Cameron will say on Tuesday. As the prime minister hosts a Girl Summit with Unicef aimed at mobilising domestic and international efforts to end FGM and child marriage, new measures will be announced aimed at ending the practices &quot;once and for all&quot;. The announcement comes the day after it emerged that the number of women living in England and Wales who have been subjected to FGM is twice as high as previously thought. A new study reveals more than 137,000 women in England and Wales are living with the consequences of FGM. The number has significantly increased in the past 10 years as women flee war-torn countries to find safety in Britain, according to the report from City University and the human rights group Equality Now. To mark the first Girl Summit in the UK, the prime minister will announce a change to the law that will make it parents&apos; responsibility to protect their daughters from FGM or face punishment. Currently it is against the law to cut a child in Britain or take a child out of the country for the purposes of FGM, but this new law will extend sanctions. Cameron will also launch a \u00a31.4m &quot;prevent programme&quot; to help stop the practice being carried out on girls and to care for survivors, and he is expected to unveil new police guidance on how to handle new cases, and a consultation on civil orders to protect those at risk of FGM. A new specialist FGM service, which will include social services, will identify those at risk of being cut. Cameron will say: &quot;All girls have the right to live free from violence and coercion, without being forced into marriage, or the lifelong physical and psychological effects of female genital mutilation. Abhorrent practices like these, no matter how deeply rooted in societies, violate the rights of girls and women across the world, including here in the UK.&quot; The new study reveals that in England and Wales about 103,000 migrant women aged 15 to 49, 10,000 girls under 15 and about 24,000 women aged 50 or above had been subjected to FGM. The numbers of women from the Horn of Africa \u2013 where the most extreme form of FGM is common \u2013 had increased by 32,000, while the number of women from east and west Africa also increased by 10,000 over the past decade. A 2007 report using 2001 census data stated that 66,000 women and girls had been subjected to FGM in England and Wales with an estimated 24,000 girls under 15 at risk. Until now the most recent study, funded by the Trust for London and the Home Office, does not estimate the number of at-risk girls, but reveals 60,000 girls under 15 were born in England and Wales to mothers who had undergone FGM between 2001-11. Earlier this year, the then education secretary, Michael Gove, agreed to write to headteachers about the dangers of FGM after 250,000 people joined a campaign backed by the Guardian and change.org in the runup to the summer holidays when many girls are sent away to be cut. Efua Dorkenoo of Equality Now said the government had made positive steps but professionals needed clear guidance to identify at-risk girls and give them help. &quot;The government needs to get a handle over this extreme abuse of the most vulnerable girls in our society by implementing a robust national plan to address the issue,&quot; she said. &quot;There is no time to waste on platitudes as thousands of girls living in England and Wales are having their life blighted by this damaging practice.&quot; The World Health Organisation estimates that up to 140 million girls and women have been subjected to FGM, a cultural practice designed to curb female sexuality that involves the partial or whole removal of the outer sexual organs and can cause lifelong physical and psychological complications. The report states: &quot;A common-held belief in FGM-practising communities is that girls and women who have not undergone FGM have an insatiable sexual appetite, which has to be restrained to prevent bringing dishonour and shame to families.&quot; Measures to protect girls from FGM in the UK have also been announced by police and Border Force agents, who are stepping up operations as the school summer holidays begin. New Border Force child protection squads are joining with police to target specific flights in a bid to prevent vulnerable girls being taken out of the country for FGM. The beefed-up teams at major airports and border crossings in the UK are on alert for the start of the summer holidays, when experts say girls are at the highest risk of being taken out of the country.

We must not let perceptions of cultural sensitivities get in the way of action against female genital mutilation. &quot;This guidance will help build our understanding and confidence in policing this crime so that we&apos;re better able to respond to victims&apos; needs and ultimately bring perpetrators to justice.&quot; It warns officers not to be put off pursuing investigations because of the &quot;cultural sensitivities&quot; involved. &quot;Female genital mutilation is the deliberate cutting of the female genitalia. It is illegal, extremely painful and a form of violence against women and girls ... Officers must not avoid tackling FGM for fear of doing or saying the wrong thing or being considered racist.&quot; Female genital mutilation has been illegal in the UK since 1985, and the law was tightened in 2003 to make it an offence for a British resident to travel abroad in order to have FGM carried out on a child. Pressure has been growing on police and prosecutors over the failure \u2013 until earlier this year \u2013 to bring a single case to the British courts. Alison Saunders, the director of public prosecutions, announced the first ever charge relating to FGM earlier this year but the case has yet to go through the courts. \u2022\u00a0This article was amended on 22 July 2014.

What are the needs of an ex-prime minister with grown-up children, a working wife, \u00a325m in property and bodyguards costing the state \u00a31m a year? Blair protested yesterday that he is not worth \u00a3100m, \u201cnot half of that, a third of that, a quarter of that, a fifth of that, and I could go on.\u201d That gets us down to below \u00a320m. In addition, he pleaded that, \u201cI spend two-thirds of my time on unpaid work,\u201d such as bringing peace to the Middle East. How dare anyone suggest he was motivated by money? Since leaving office Blair\u2019s financial manoeuvres have become the butt of satire, not least in Robert Harris\u2019s novel The Ghost. It is not clear if his mysterious \u201cfoundations\u201d exist to sanitise the dodgy consultancies, or the dodgy consultancies to support the foundations. Nothing seems quite above board in a miasma of Windrush and Firerush nameplates, out of sight, mind and national boundary. One minute Blair is \u201cadvising\u201d in Kazakhstan, another in Columbia, Azerbaijan or Dubai. He seems to have an aversion to democracies. Blair clearly regards \u00a320m as modest. On the day when the boss of Tesco is ousted for failure and could walk away with close to \u00a310m plus \u00a311m in pension, ordinary people must wonder at the world these people inhabit. As Robert Maxwell once said when asked about his riches, making the first million is easy because you can spend it. When there is nothing left to buy you have to just want money. Blair has often opined that his apparent neediness derives from the fact that he and Cherie grew up with financial insecurity. That might explain the cheap dress, upgrade or freebie holiday, but the Blairs cannot realistically expect sympathy for a multimillion-pound comfort blanket. Their pension, not means-tested, is supplied by the taxpayer. Their children have houses of their own, unlike many young people. The Blairs seem to crave money like Maxwell, because it is there. A cardinal fact of the recession and recovery is the ever widening gap between a tiny minority of very rich and the rest. As Thomas Piketty has argued, however rooted in economic history, this gulf has no justification in political equity or social stability. It is not sensible. In the west it looks increasingly like the kleptocracy so derided in the developing world. Time was when Blair\u2019s boasts would have been regarded as inflammatory.

Thirteen novels were named on the longlist for the prize, which for more than 40 years has rewarded only Commonwealth and Irish writers. The rules changed last year, sparking fears that it would quickly be dominated by Americans. In the event, judges chose four Americans: Joshua Ferris, Siri Hustvedt, Karen Joy Fowler and Richard Powers. An almost American, Joseph O&apos;Neill, who is an Irish-born US resident, was also named one of what is known as the Man Booker &quot;dozen&quot;. This year&apos;s chair of judges, the philosopher AC Grayling, said it had been a vintage year. &quot;They are very ambitious books and some of them tackle big issues of the day,&quot; he said. &quot;There&apos;s a lot of perceptiveness and wisdom in these books, some of them are quite moving and all of them are very difficult to put down once you get into them \u2013 a feature of just how richly textured they are and what great stories they tell.&quot; Some eyebrows will be raised at only three female writers being listed. It is also striking for who is not on it \u2013 there is no Martin Amis, Ian McEwan, Sarah Waters, Damon Galgut, Philip Hensher, Will Self, Nicola Barker, Linda Grant, Christos Tsiolkas or Donna Tartt. Grayling said they had chosen the books on merit, not the nationality, gender or reputation of the writers. &quot;We said to ourselves: &apos;The past record is not going to count. We are not going to give a prize to someone who should have got it years ago. We are just looking at the quality of the books by themselves.&apos;&quot; The only former winner listed is Howard Jacobson. He won in 2010 for The Finkler Question and is included for his yet-to-be-published J, a love story set in the future, which his publishers have said will be talked about in the same breath as Brave New World. As widely predicted, David Mitchell, the author of The Cloud Atlas, is listed for The Bone Clocks. The other British writers are Calcutta-born Neel Mukherjee for The Lives of Others, the twice shortlisted Ali Smith for How to be Both; Nicholls for Us; and Paul Kingsnorth for the crowd-funded The Wake, the most leftfield of the books, set in 11th-century Lincolnshire and told in a semi-invented Old English language. Joshua Ferris, once hailed as the &quot;new Jonathan Franzen&quot;, is longlisted for his third novel, To Rise Again at a Decent Hour, which tells the story of an anxious dentist in a state of existential crisis. Completing the lineup of works by US authors are Karen Joy Fowler&apos;s We Are All Completely Besides Ourselves, a comic tale of family love with a twist; Siri Hustvedt&apos;s The Blazing World which explores themes including art world sexism and celebrity and Richard Powers&apos;s Orfeo, which the Guardian said was a fiction equivalent of reading Alex Ross&apos;s The Rest is Noise. Joseph O&apos;Neill \u2013 writer of the 2008 hit Netherland \u2013 is longlisted for his fourth novel, The Dog, not yet published and described as &quot;a tale of alienation and heartbreak in Dubai&quot;. The list includes books little noticed elsewhere. Few newspapers have yet reviewed Niall Williams&apos;s The History of the Rain, for example, and the at-a-glance review in the Sunday Times complained the book &quot;is so steeped in literary references, quirky meanderings and watery metaphors that it risks falling into the category of taxingly obscure pretension rather than sophisticated literary fiction&quot;. The list is completed by The Narrow Road to the Deep North by the Australian writer Richard Flanagan. Grayling said &quot;outstanding&quot; books had unquestionably not made it. &quot;All of us round the table would have liked the longlist to be just a tiny bit longer \u2026 but we are pretty pleased with the list from what is a vintage year.&quot; There was one debut writer this year [Kingsnorth] and, arguably, the arrival of Americans seems to have edged out non-British Commonwealth writers. Ion Trewin, the prize&apos;s literary director, said it was more to do with the quality of the books, however \u2013 &quot;I just don&apos;t think it is necessarily one of the great years for the Commonwealth.&quot; Ladbrokes straight away named Mukherjee as 3-1 favourite for the prize, followed by Mitchell and Smith at 6-1. They were offering odds of 2-1 for an American to win. Jonathan Ruppin, the web editor at Foyles bookshops, said more familiar names on the list would help sales. &quot;After a couple of years where the prize returned to its more traditional role of celebrating the novel as an artform, this year&apos;s panel seem more taken by the many ways a story can be told.&quot; Unlike previous years, when Booker judges met over lunch or dinner, Grayling said he had chosen a more &quot;austere&quot; route of afternoon tea discussions. He was joined by five other judges, Jonathan Bate, Sarah Churchwell, Daniel Glaser, Alastair Niven and Erica Wagner. They will now get the list down to six, announced in September, with the \u00a350,000 winner named at a formal black-tie dinner.

Sometimes it might amble to the local and down 15 pints of vodka and Snakebite, whereupon it turns into the sort of raconteur that makes Oscar Wilde sound like Porky Pig. Other times, the pub might come to the Fiver and over back-to-back episodes of Don\u2019t Tell the Bride and 15 pints of vodka and Snakebite, it dissects modern culture with the sort of wit that makes Porky Pig sound like Oscar Wilde. Heck of a time you\u2019ll agree, but nothing quite as adrenaline pumping as the activities of the Queen\u2019s Celtic. Actually scrap that, because there is, which might explain why they\u2019ve had to vacate Queen\u2019s Celtic Park for the opening ceremony of the Imperial Sports Day, starring cutting, edge avant garde popsters Rod Stewart and Susan Boyle (combined age: 122). Having been ejected from their own ground by the organisers of the Imperial Sports Day, The Bhoys and their boys made their way to the bright lights of Scotland\u2019s capital city, Edinburgh. As if a trip to the castle, a shopping spree at Primark on Princes Street and a pint in the world famous Dirty Dick\u2019s wasn\u2019t wild enough for them, they decided to cram in a fitba match at Murrayfield too. And not just any old fitba match, it was Big Cup stuff against Big Cup opposition, the kind of sporting event that shows the much-hyped Imperial Sports Day up for the kind of low-rent second-rate Scottish spectacular that it is. KR Reykjavik, those titans of Icelandic, nae European, football, strode onto the pitch with all their stars and all their pedigree and all their might. Their nostrils were flared, their eyes were narrowed, their shoulders were back. These looked like the type of men who shave with Ginsu and wrestle wild boars. But The Queen\u2019s Celtic had that glint in their eye, the type of glint that has not been since the Lisbon Lions roared. And thanks to some valiant fitba at either end of the pitch The Queen\u2019s Celtic persevered: 4-0. Phew! That was a close one. Of course, such courageous, gutsy fitba deserves a reward and Celtic did not go home empty-handed. Not only will they progress to the next round of the Big Cup, they will also be handed another glittering tie. Their opposition? Well that depends on who comes out on top in the big match between Irish champions St Patrick\u2019s Athletic and their Polish cousins Legia Warsaw this evening. Whichever one wins you can bet your last packet of shortbread that Queen\u2019s Celtic fans will be selling their furniture just to get a ticket for the game. After all, it\u2019s the Big Cup, the height of sport. Unless you\u2019re one of those people pretending to be excited by the Imperial Sports Day.

What these novels on the longlist have in common, therefore, is the\u00a0extent of their ambition and their\u00a0reach. It&apos;s a list for time travellers: Paul Kingsnorth&apos;s The Wake begins in the year of the Norman conquest, and is told in a bravura language unaltered by Latinate\u00a0influence \u2013 the book was crowd-funded, to boot. David Mitchell, in The Bone Clocks, and Howard Jacobson in J, lead us out into the future in very different ways \u2013 a real departure for Jacobson. In The Narrow Road to the Deep North, Richard Flanagan takes on\u00a0the legacy of the second world war for both Australians and Japanese; Neel\u00a0Mukherjee, in The Lives of Others, chooses Calcutta in the 1960s for his setting: and yet both these books cast a\u00a0sharp beam on the present, too \u2013 as\u00a0does The Wake. Vivid characters drew us back to novels as we were choosing. In David Nicholls&apos;s Us a portrait of middle-aged marriage \u2013 and its breakdown \u2013 is delineated with humour and heart; the\u00a0voices in Ali Smith&apos;s surprising, enchanting How to be both are vividly alive, whispering into our ears. Karen Joy Fowler&apos;s We Are All Completely Beside Ourselves is the compelling, sometimes shocking story of a family; it raises the question of what it means, finally, to be human. A cliche? Not this time. Trust me. Some of these books reflect, in very different ways, on art and the making of art. Siri Hustvedt&apos;s The Blazing World considers a woman artist who took on male avatars in her lifetime: like Smith, Hustvedt addresses society&apos;s interpretation of gender in\u00a0a\u00a0sophisticated and compelling narrative. Richard Powers&apos;s Orfeo begins with a burst of suspected bioterrorism, but its depiction of music and musicianship is what really makes it stand out. Niall Williams&apos;s History of\u00a0the Rain is a surge of language, beautiful and enchanting, a novel that weaves a love of literature into its own moving tale. There are four Americans on this list: Hustvedt, Fowler and Powers are joined by Joshua Ferris; Joseph O&apos;Neill is Irish American.

Some staff may be deployed to safer regions in Kenya while others will return to Australia or be redeployed to neighbouring countries. Peter Walton, head of the international program at the Australian Red Cross, wrote to volunteers saying: &quot;It is with great regret \u2026 that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has made the difficult decision to withdraw the Australian Volunteers for International Development (Avid) program from Kenya. &quot;The decision was based on the need to ensure volunteer safety and security in country.&quot; A Dfat spokeswoman said while the Australia government remained a committed partner of the Kenyan government, it also &quot;continues to monitor the security environment\u201d. \u201cThe safety and security of Australian government-funded volunteers in the Avid program is paramount,&quot; she said.

In September al-Shabaab militants attacked the upscale Westgate mall in Nairobi, killing 67 people shopping on a Saturday. Kenyan police officials said on Thursday that a female German tourist had been shot dead in Mombasa, the second foreigner shot in same area this month. Ahmed Salim, from the Dubai-based Teneo Intelligence consultancy, said insecurity and attacks were now the norm for Kenya&apos;s coast. &quot;The challenge, so far, has been to differentiate these attacks between al-Shabaab and criminal gangs or groups that seem to be targeting a specific ethnic group related to other grievances such as land.

Marcel F\u00e4ssler, Andr\u00e9 Lotterer and Beno\u00eet Tr\u00e9luyer took their third victory at La Sarthe as a squad, driving the Audi R18 prototype at Le Mans and on Saturday at 3.30pm BST they will be attempting to complete a victory at Spa driving together in the R8 LMS ultra for the Belgian Audi Club Team WRT, run by Vincent Vosse. Both races have only been won by the same driver line-up once before. The French drivers, Andr\u00e9 Lagache and Ren\u00e9 L\u00e9onard, won Le Mans in 1923 and then Spa in 1925, their feat two years apart not least because the first 24 was held at Spa only in 1924. This year is the 90th anniversary of the inaugural endurance race held at the formidable circuit in the Ardennes mountains and the 66th edition of the race itself. Formed entirely of one class \u2013 GT3 \u2013 there will be a large field of 61, competing to take the flag at a race previously won by Mike Hawthorn, Gerhard Berger, Jacky Ickx and Tom Walkinshaw. It will be a tough task for the Audi trio who won the 2102 World Endurance Championship, however. As part of the Blancpain Endurance Series and for which this race awards double points, the front end of the field competing in the Pro Cup class is fiercely competitive. WRT, are fielding two other R8s in the class which also includes runners from Aston Martin, McLaren, Mercedes, BMW and Bentley. The driver line-up is impressive as well. Last year\u2019s winners Maximilian Buhk, Maximilian G\u00f6tz and Bernd Schneider return, although in different squads. Schneider, who achieved a grand slam of GT endurance racing wins last year at Spa, the Dubai 24 hours, the Bathurst 12 hours and the N\u00fcrburgring 24 hours, stays with HRT in a Mercedes but now drives alongside Harold Primat and Nico Verdonck. Also in the top class, Guy Smith, who won Le Mans in 2003 driving the Bentley Speed 8 prototype, returns for the marque alongside an all British line-up of Steven Kane and Andy Meyrick in the Bentley Continental GT3. Individual honours are not the only prize up for grabs at Spa, should an Audi take the chequered flag on Sunday with any of the eight R8s entered, the marque itself will have achieved the remarkable feat of winning three of the world\u2019s greatest endurance races within the space of six weeks. Only a week after the victory at Le Mans the Audi of Phoenix Racing, driven by Christian Mamerow, Christopher Haase, Ren\u00e9 Rast and Markus Winkelhock won the N\u00fcrburgring 24 by the slender margin of just 2mins 59secs. The Le Mans-winning trio are hopeful that they will make history for themselves and deliver the treble for the marque. \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to the challenge of competing in this strong field. Our ambition is clear: we\u2019re going to battle for victory,\u201d said F\u00e4ssler. \u201cFrom my perspective, there are about 20 cars in contention for first place at Spa, so it\u2019ll probably be a great and thrilling race.\u201d Non-stop race commentary of the Spa 24 Hours is live at radiolemans.com,with coverage also on MotorsTV.", "title": "Audi\u2019s Le Mans 24 Hours winners look to make it a double at Spa 24", "sentences": ["Schneider, who achieved a grand slam of GT endurance racing wins last year at Spa, the Dubai 24 hours, the Bathurst 12 hours and the N\u00fcrburgring 24 hours, stays with HRT in a Mercedes but now drives alongside Harold Primat and Nico Verdonck."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-25T07:59:13Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/jul/26/talking-horses-best-bets-racing-news", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Ryan Moore, who will ride the favourite, Telescope, in today\u2019s King George, rather set the cat among the pigeons yesterday by using his Betfair column to say that punters had got it wrong and Magician should be the market-leader. Magician is a top-class horse who is arguably underrated but he does seem to have an established need for a fast surface and the 7mm of rain that fell here yesterday was poison to his chance. Telescope also has a preference for fast ground and did not appear well suited by soft when beaten in his first two outings this season. But he is much more likely than Magician to give his running if the going is good, as seems likely at the time of writing. Perhaps a better bet than either in the circumstances is Eagle Top (3.50), whose breeding suggests that a bit of cut underfoot may be a bonus. Not that fast ground is a problem for the three-year-old, as it was good to firm when he stormed home in the King Edward VII Stakes at Royal Ascot, stuffing a rival who was since beaten only a neck in an American Grade One. 1.50 York Like so many of Mark Johnston\u2019s horses, Maracuja appears to have been making steady progress over many runs this season and she finally got her head in front at Ayr a fortnight ago.

Last week, this central Virginian town was named America&apos;s happiest city \u2013 or Joy Town, USA, as America&apos;s media quickly had it \u2013 by the US National Bureau of Economic Research (NBER). It&apos;s quite an accolade. But an informal poll of residents didn&apos;t find too many who rejected the finding. &quot;I don&apos;t know about the happiest but it&apos;s certainly all right,&quot; says Jackson Greg, on Main Street late on Friday evening. While researchers recommended Charlottesville as the happiest place, they named Richmond and Newport News, both in Virginia, as the happiest cities. Bottom of the feelgood listings came Scranton, Pennsylvania, New York City, Pittsburgh and Detroit. Here in Charlottesville, many said they would not be persuaded to move even if they were offered greater material security elsewhere. They point to a sense of community, broadly liberal values, a leading university (the University of Virginia), a temperate climate, comprehensive public health facilities, good food, sophisticated cultural resources among elements that make it ideal for happy living. If there&apos;s one place in the US that has more or less everything going for it, this is it. &quot;It&apos;s small, and it&apos;s surrounded by beautiful country, but it has all the things you&apos;d want from a big city,&quot; says Donnie Glass, chef at a leading restaurant, Public Fish &amp; Oyster. For years, Charlottesville has been picking up the prizes. It&apos;s been named best town for food lovers by Wine Magazine; best college town in the country by Traveler&apos;s Today; the country&apos;s favourite mountain town by Travel &amp; Leisure; and one of the happiest and healthiest places in the US by Business Insider. &quot;It&apos;s a bastion of liberalism in the south,&quot; says building contractor Jim Raymond, who arrived as a student in the late 60s and built a life here. Just two hours from Washington DC, C-ville (as the locals call it) offers quiet country retreats and horseback rides in nearby Shenandoah National Park, the natural beauty of the Blue Ridge mountains, as well as a wealth of history that includes the homes of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison. Its array of restaurants offer exceptional gastronomic variety. The legacy of Jefferson, whose rather serious-looking statue stands at the end of West Main Street, near where he first established the University of Virginia, looms large over the town. &quot;The inalienable right to the pursuit of happiness is a uniquely American concept,&quot; says C-ville research neuroscientist Chip Levy. &quot;We&apos;re told happiness is an allowable goal and we&apos;re still trying to come to terms with it. What did Jefferson mean? I don&apos;t know. He may have been talking about the drive for a forward social progression, not happiness itself.&quot; Levy says that in C-ville \u2013 sometimes described as the northernmost tip of the south \u2013 people don&apos;t become so caught up in the pursuit of happiness, at the restaurants, walking in the mountains, drinking fine wines, that they forget, in effect, to be happy. &quot;We&apos;re happy to be happy, not just to pursue happiness.&quot; According to John F Kennedy: &quot;The natural beauty of the surrounding countryside and the manmade beauty of Charlottesvillle combine to weave a tapestry of American history few other towns or cities can boast.&quot; The concentration of restaurants \u2013 by some estimates, C-ville boasts one of the highest densities for the population in the US \u2013 has made it a draw for visitors. The historic main street is a popular destination for food, wine and music. &quot;Twenty years ago, it was mostly boarded up and dangerous at night. Now it&apos;s flourishing,&quot; says antiquarian book dealer Scott Fennessey. &quot;We&apos;ve got Bob Dylan and the Rolling Stones come through.&quot; As Kennedy found, and Jefferson before him, the region&apos;s rich farmland remains its bedrock. &quot;To know the land, you have to know the food,&quot; says Meredith Lee, who helps run a company distributing local organic produce. &quot;It&apos;s one of the best ways to support local farmers.&quot; Virginia vineyards are known for white and some surprisingly good reds, says Fennessey. &quot;It&apos;s a nice place to live, and there aren&apos;t many places like this in the US,&quot; he says. Occasionally in C-ville, there&apos;s too much of a good thing. Ten years ago, Patricia Kluge, one of America&apos;s wealthiest women, expanded her celebrated winery so aggressively that it collapsed under the burden of loan repayments. Given that the state of Virginia pulled off a happiness hat-trick with poll-topping Charlottesville, Richmond and Newport News, it should be no surprise that America&apos;s musical poster-child for happiness is a Virginian. Last week, Neptunes producer and singer Pharrell Williams&apos;s hit Happy became only the fourth single to be declared triple platinum (more than 1.5m in sales) in 20 years. The track topped the UK singles chart in December and has not left the top 20 this year. Gennaro Castaldo, of the British music body BPI, said the song has become a feelgood anthem for a generation. The singer has his own views on happiness: he believes feelings are becoming increasingly valued as other sensations become replicated by technology. Williams has said the success of the song \u2013 essentially a rewrite of the nursery rhyme If You&apos;re Happy And You Know It (Clap Your Hands) \u2013 shows people are searching for emotional connections, as an antidote to technology and virtual life. &quot;People want to feel. They&apos;re over-inundated with thinking,&quot; he said recently. &quot;We&apos;re a different species to what we were 15 years ago. The only thing we have left that reminds us that we are humans that cannot be duplicated is feeling.&quot; But the NBER study also found that\u00a0&quot;humans are quite understandably\u00a0willing to sacrifice both happiness and life satisfaction if the price is\u00a0right&quot;. It would be fair to say that Charlottesville&apos;s secret is now out, and some worry that publicity about the quality of life in C-ville might also be its undoing. &quot;Certain places become oases even as others become deserts,&quot; says Raymond. &quot;Who would want to say a thing like that? Property developers? The next thing you know they&apos;ll try to turn it into the new Dubai.&quot; For those fearing an influx of pleasure-seekers, however, there is consolation in the NBER study. Joshua Gottlieb, one of its authors, notes that people do care about more than happiness alone: &quot;The desires for happiness and life satisfaction do not uniquely drive human ambitions,&quot; the study says. &quot;If we chose only that which maximised our happiness, then individuals would presumably move to happier places until the point where rising rents and congestion eliminated the joys of that locale.&quot; Perhaps New Yorkers and others highly placed on the unhappiness index may be more wedded to their misery than they may know. One thing is certain. No one is moving from Charlottesville any time soon. &quot;It&apos;s psychologically draining to achieve even simple tasks in New York, and in LA you spend so much time in a car it sucks the life out of you,&quot; says C-ville resident Sivan Sherman. &quot;The university attracts interesting people \u2013 people following their passion \u2013 and if it all seems a bit old-fashioned, it is.

In response, some of the richest people from around the world have strode through the open doors. Oligarchs swarm to vibrant London, choosing the capital over New York as a favoured destination. The City of London is still a magnet, the 2008 crash fast becoming a distant memory. Even British politics is open for business. Election strategists from the US, Australia and South Africa wave their wands on behalf of the three main parties. Foreign donors line up to fund the Conservatives&apos; next election campaign, as a few did for Labour at the last election. In the UK all are more than welcome to run our companies, football clubs and buy our properties. Or at least they were. The familiar incantation about openness is suddenly qualified. The shooting down of Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 by Russian separatists and Vladimir Putin&apos;s response has caused a degree of ideological confusion at the top of the Conservative party. Even the most enthusiastic advocates of laissez-faire economics are thrown into a degree of farcical bewilderment in the face of Putin&apos;s assertive nationalism. Monty Python&apos;s Flying Circus might have taken a bow in London last weekend but the surreal prospect of a tennis match involving David Cameron, Boris Johnson and the wife of a former Putin ally exceeds in dark absurdity any sketch revived by John Cleese and co. Vladimir Chernukhin, a billionaire, was deputy finance minister during Putin&apos;s first term as president of Russia. Chernukin&apos;s wife bid for the match at a recent Tory party fundraising dinner. Plans for the sporting contest are not going smoothly. The Tory competitors, united in their instinctive enthusiasm for global wealth pouring into London, are troubled. After the shooting down of MH17 Cameron declared that he would consider it unthinkable to sell a warship to Russia, as France is planning to do. In contrast to such French amorality, Cameron called for the toughest possible sanctions against Russia. Yet there he is planning to play tennis with former colleagues of Putin in order to raise \u00a3160,000 for the Conservative party. At first Johnson raised doubts that the game with the Russian &quot;geezer&quot; would go ahead. Later he popped up to declare the match was on. There has been much anxious checking at the top of the Conservative party as to the relationship between the oligarch and Putin. Johnson is reassured but even now some senior Conservatives worry about the symbolism of a prime-ministerial tennis match for cash with any figures associated with Putin. The game might still not take place. The circuitous ambiguity extends well beyond a game of tennis. Cameron calls for tough sanctions, but measures being considered in response to his calls are likely to hit the UK more than any other EU countries, to the concern of UK ministers. The conflict between doing what is right and the need to attract the globe&apos;s wealthiest people was in play long before the current international crisis. Last year, after some agonising, George Osborne confirmed that foreign owners of UK property would pay capital gains tax for the first time. The move was aimed in particular at oligarchs buying up properties in London and leaving them unoccupied. On the Today programme Evan Davis of the BBC asked the chancellor why the policy had not been introduced previously. Osborne replied candidly that both Labour and Conservative governments were worried that the tax would scare off foreign investors from the London property market. That is the deal in open Britain: the very rich can make even bigger fortunes because they bring in vast amounts of cash. In Brussels, where Cameron has called for tough sanctions against Russia, the UK&apos;s capital is sometimes referred to as Londongrad. Some MPs have called for Cameron to target business figures close to Putin&apos;s regime, citing Roman Abramovich, the owner of Chelsea football club, Alisher Usmanov, who holds a stake in Arsenal, and Mikhail Fridman, who runs the \u00a318bn investment vehicle LetterOne Group, which has offices on Park Lane. Cameron hesitates much as Osborne paused in relation to capital gains tax. Cameron wants to be seen to be tough against Putin, but the oligarchs&apos; money boosts the UK economy. It is no coincidence that two of the three oligarchs are linked with football clubs. The Premier League is famously open for business. Wealthy families from the US own Manchester United and Liverpool. Sheikh Mansour, who bought Manchester City, is one of football&apos;s wealthiest owners, with a family fortune of at least $1 trillion. The wealthy foreign owners turn to the Premier League for many reasons. The most fundamental one is that the UK&apos;s light regulatory touch makes it easier for them to do so. Football highlights the contradictory feelings in the UK. Most fans do not complain when they acquire a wealthy owner. The best footballers join their clubs on fantasy salaries. The newly owned clubs start to win trophies that fans had dreamed about for decades. But the downsides are deep and work on many different levels, from astronomical ticket prices to clubs becoming no more than commodities for distant owners, a means to make easy money. In English football lines of control and accountability are narrow. Transparency is virtually nonexistent. In World Cup-winning Germany clubs allocate half their shares to fans and since the turn of the century there has been a national development scheme that trains thousands of German professional coaches. In England fans are powerless and the short term is what matters, winning the next match and the one after that. If foreign players and managers are what is required to meet immediate needs those needs must be met. Politics has followed football. Preparing for the closest election in decades, the Australian Lynton Crosby is the key strategist for David Cameron. Ed Miliband has hired President Obama&apos;s ally David Axelrod. Cameron had already turned to another member of the Obama team, Jim Messina. Nick Clegg&apos;s director of strategy is the South African Ryan Coetzee. They are hired for the same reasons the FA turned to Sven-G\u00f6ran Eriksson and then Fabio Capello. Crosby, in particular, has more power in relation to election planning than any Tory cabinet minister apart from Osborne. The policy pledges made before an election shape what happens subsequently if a party wins. There is no direct connection between the appointment of foreign strategists and the partial dependence on foreign donors to keep parties afloat. The strategist plays a direct role. The donor provides cash. But both are symptoms of the fact that political parties are dying in the UK. Memberships are falling. Fewer talented figures are attracted to politics. Leaders turn to talent from abroad and need cash where they can find it to fund their parties. Chernukin was by no means the only foreign donor at the Conservatives&apos; recent fundraising dinner and a grand private members&apos; club. Russian property developers, a Greek shipping tycoon, an Iranian investment banker, a Slovenian private equity magnate, Bermudan and Dubai-based financiers mingled with stars of the Tory party. Mahmoud Khayami, a French citizen, was one of Labour&apos;s biggest backers before the last election. Party leaders hate raising money and do it because they are too scared to call for state funding for parties, or are ideologically opposed to such a move. Quite often feeling relatively besieged and powerless, leaders do not recognise that to some business figures they seem omnipotent in their might. Some foreign donors hand over money because they enjoy the proximity to apparent power and that is the end of it. The cash is pocket money for them. But others seek influence with the access their money has purchased. &quot;Donate to the Conservative party and stop the mansion tax from being introduced&quot; is a potent message to some foreign donors at the moment. Only the Conservatives oppose the tax. How to explain the resolute enthusiasm with which the UK has embraced the openness of globalisation from the big bang in the 1980s through to Tony Blair&apos;s New Labour and now in relation to the 21st-century super-city of London? Part of the answer lies in the obvious short-term benefits. There is an injection of dynamism, energy and cultural variety as well as cash when a country is indiscriminately open. Part of the New Labour settlement was to accept with a near-Thatcherite relish the vibrancy of markets and spend the cash that flowed to improve public services. For decades, as a backlash against the stifling corporatist 1970s, momentum has been with those who argue for the lightest of light touches. But now there are wobbles even among some of the most committed free marketeers. The recent attempt by the US firm Pfizer to take over the UK drugs company AstraZeneca provoked an unusual range of dissent across the political spectrum. The three main parties discovered a passion for research and development that they feared might be undermined by the takeover. In the media the Daily Mail led the opposition. Even Osborne, a committed free marketer and the latest chancellor to stress that Britain is open for business, in his last budget, expressed doubts about the bid and sought more robust levels of commitment from Pfizer. Miliband called for a public-interest test to become law, a proposal now supported by the business secretary, Vince Cable. Meanwhile, Osborne goes ahead with his capital gains tax on foreign owners. Cameron worries about sanctions against Russia that might cost hundreds of millions of pounds, but still plans for them. Possibly Miliband will introduce state funding of political parties if he wins, ending the reliance on foreign donors. If Labour were to win the election it will not only be foreign governments that can bid to run the UK&apos;s railways, but the British one too. Such freakishly unusual interventions are signs that attitudes towards openness are changing slightly in the UK. If a slick prime minister and a popular mayor are thrown into bewildered doubt over whether or not to play a tennis match, the tectonic plates are shifting. Suddenly Britain is open for business with a few more conditions attached.", "title": "Britain is open for business, but is it still the right policy?", "sentences": ["Russian property developers, a Greek shipping tycoon, an Iranian investment banker, a Slovenian private equity magnate, Bermudan and Dubai-based financiers mingled with stars of the Tory party."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-26T23:06:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/media/greenslade/2014/jul/27/mazher-mahmood-thepeople", "tags": ["Media", "Mazher Mahmood", "The People", "National newspapers", "Newspapers", "News of the World", "Sun on Sunday", "Tulisa Contostavlos", "Robert De Niro", "Sylvester Stallone", "Leonardo DiCaprio", "Drugs", "Crime"], "article": "The devastating impact on a victim of one of Mazher Mahmood&apos;s sting operations is highlighted by the Sunday People today. The paper splashes on how the Sun on Sunday&apos;s investigations reporter, then working for its predecessor, the News of the World, wrecked the life of television actor John Alford. Indeed, it wrecked it so badly that it effectively ended his television and singing career at the age of just 25.  Alford&apos;s case in 1997, a classic example of a Mahmood sting, was one of the first fake sheikh entrapments to catch my attention. In almost every detail the subterfuge involved mirrors what happened in 2013 to Tulisa Contostavlos, whose trial on a drugs charge was abandoned after the judge ruled that Mahmood may have been guilty of lying and manipulating evidence.      Today's Sunday People front page    Alford (real name Shannon) was something of a TV star in the mid-1990s because of his role in a hugely popular ITV series about the lives of fire brigade officers, London&apos;s Burning. In a spin-off career as a singer, he also managed to get a couple of minor chart hits.  So, by August 1997, when Alford met a man he was fooled into believing was an Arabian prince with movie connections, the actor-singer was a hot item. Alford, a wiser but still angry man at 42, relates in the Sunday People interview that it all began with a call to his agent in which Alford was promised a lucrative deal. He was invited to meet &quot;His Royal Highness Mohammed Al-Kareen&quot; at London&apos;s Savoy hotel. He was completely taken in by Mahmood&apos;s disguise, which included a Rolex watch and flamboyant arrival in a Rolls-Royce. &quot;Mahmood&apos;s outfit was so convincing, I bowed when I met him,&quot; he is quoted by the People as saying. &quot;I thought I was in the presence of royalty.&quot; The &quot;prince&quot; told Alford that if he was prepared to attend the opening of nightclub in Dubai there was a chance of making \u00a31m by working alongside Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone. [The Contostavlos lure was Leonardo DiCaprio]. Far-fetched? Yes, of course it was. But this was a trap with big bait laid for an impressionable young man who, due to his fame, was being made seemingly amazing offers all the time. Then came the sting. After drinks, which Alford - like so many other of Mahmood&apos;s victims - believed were spiked, he was asked if he could obtain drugs for the prince and his cronies. Alford, like many young celebrities, had been through a drugs stage. He said: &quot;I had been on the party scene, going to clubs and taking cocaine, since I was young. But I&apos;d put the drugs behind me by that point.&quot; But he knew a friend who could obtain drugs and, as he told the People: &quot;Stupidly, I decided to do what they asked and get them drugs. I just felt I was totally in over my head.&quot; In the end, as the jury heard at his subsequent trial in east London&apos;s Snaresbrook crown court, he collected and supplied two grammes of cocaine to Mahmood plus 11 grammes of cannabis. &quot;I was wrong to sort out the deal,&quot; he says now. &quot;If it wasn&apos;t for Mahmood there would have been no drug deal. I wasn&apos;t a drug dealer, I was an actor.&quot; But Mahmood told the court he had prima facie evidence that Alford had been a drugs supplier. He told the jury he had received the tip from an anonymous showbusiness friend of Alford&apos;s. Alford, who defended himself, argued passionately that he had been set up. But he was found guilty by the jury and the judge sentenced him to nine months in jail.  In the event, he served only six weeks after agreeing to wear an electronic tag. But he had been fired from his TV role and found it impossible to get acting work afterwards. Instead, he scraped a living as a roofer, \u00adscaffolder and minicab driver. There have been just a couple of TV appearances since in attempts to revive his acting career. But, according to the People&apos;s article, he lives on benefits. There cannot be any doubt that he broke the law by obtaining and supplying class A drugs. His response to Mahmood&apos;s request is suggestive of a mixture of naivety and stupidity.  As with the Contostavlos sting, however, the carrot was so large that Alford threw caution to the wind. In both cases, as with other of Mahmood&apos;s stings, once they complied with the journalist&apos;s requests, he had a public interest justification for publishing. Mahmood said, in this recorded radio interview, that he feels no guilt because it isn&apos;t possible to encourage innocent people, no matter the amount of bait offered to them, to break the law. Unless they are &quot;at it&quot;, he said, &quot;you can&apos;t entrap them.&quot; He argued that &quot;entrapment is a lame argument&quot; against his journalistic methodology. But is that really so? Sometimes - and I readily concede, not always and, arguably not in the majority of the stories he has broken - people have not been &quot;at it.&quot; And sometimes it is clear that the instances are so minor, so marginal, as not to warrant such elaborate subterfuge and the necessity of a vast investment of resources. Alford was one. Contostavlos was another. And they are certainly not isolated instances.", "title": "John Alford: the TV actor whose career was wrecked by Mazher Mahmood", "sentences": ["&quot;I thought I was in the presence of royalty.&quot; The &quot;prince&quot; told Alford that if he was prepared to attend the opening of nightclub in Dubai there was a chance of making \u00a31m by working alongside Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone."], "publicationDate": "2014-07-27T14:00:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/jul/27/mecca-changing-muslim-pilgrims-holy-city", "tags": ["Islam", "Religion", "World news", "Saudi Arabia", "Middle East and North Africa", "Ramadan"], "article": "Ramadan, the Muslim month of fasting, is drawing to a close.

A large, Big Ben-like clock tower looms over the centre, and shopping malls and high-rise blocks are being built in a circle around the pilgrimage zone. In order to make way for these new developments, historic sites \u2013 such as the prophet\u2019s house and his wife\u2019s houses \u2013 have been razed. \u201cThe Saudis have spoiled Mecca\u201d is now a popular view, and ancient structures \u2013 most recently the oldest columns in the Mecca and Medina mosques \u2013 have been compromised to make way for accelerated construction. But it\u2019s not fair to rush to judgment, or to label the Saudis as simple philistines. Mecca is a living city. Although, according to scripture, it has a history that stretches back to Abraham, its infrastructure was never lavish. Not through any particular sense of the sanctity of\u00a0place: Saudi Arabia itself, and\u00a0the entire Gulf region, had neither the centralised government nor the assets needed to overhaul sites of religious significance before the 20th-century oil\u00a0boom. In the days before modern travel, mere thousands trickled through this tiny city. But Mecca now hosts up to 3 million visitors a year. Accommodating such a large number today is a huge logistical challenge. And these are not visitors who come for a few hours \u2013 to take a selfie, buy a rosary, say a prayer and then leave. They are pilgrims who stay for days, and who need to be fed, housed, washed and transported safely and speedily in and out of the city. Luxury flats and malls might be surplus to those requirements, but how could commercialism not creep in when the potential market is so huge? Permeating the official attitude towards the expansion is a characteristically Saudi hardline religious view, which frowns upon the memorialisation of prophets and the sites associated with them. But what we\u2019re seeing isn\u2019t really a case of ideologically driven destruction. The main considerations are practical, and there are Saudi architects and organisations that are campaigning to mitigate the effects of the city\u2019s expansion. This is emphatically not a\u00a0case of the Afghan Taliban blowing up\u00a0world heritage sites to make a religious point. The roots of concern over what is happening in Mecca at the moment are partly romantic. Today\u2019s city is not the one Muslims learn about in dramatic desert tales of the religion\u2019s inception. Some of the complaints are prompted by snobbery and disdain for the Saudi and Gulf aesthetic, which\u00a0favours the bold and the garish over the understated and unobtrusive \u2013 as seen most obviously in Dubai. But it is also about failing to understand how the difference in cultural attitudes and needs plays out. The listed-buildings protocol in Britain, for example, is a product of a whole infrastructure of preservation, and took many decades to develop. Much of it relates to religious buildings, since those make up a great deal of this country\u2019s built heritage. And, in contrast to Mecca, the demands on these buildings have diminished over the years. While Mecca is a site of great historical religious significance, it cannot be preserved in the familiar sense, as its history has not ended. You might not appreciate what it looks like \u2013 but it matches the tastes and requirements of the present, as every place of pilgrimage has done in its heyday. Who can say that in 2,000 years the Mecca clocktower that people deem so ghastly will not be treated with as much reverence as the palaces of the Vatican are today?

The Proteas have shrugged off the recent retirements of Graeme Smith and Jacques Kallis to resume the position they held from August 2012, when they won in England to knock Andy Flower\u2019s team off the top of the rankings, until May this year when their home defeat by Australia effectively cost them top spot. Michael Clarke\u2019s team, who have surged up the table since their consecutive defeats in India and England last year, will have the chance to regain the leadership when they play Pakistan in Dubai and Abu Dhabi in the autumn. But England need to come from behind to win their series against India to avoid ending a series out of the top four for the first time since 2010. Hashim Amla, in his first series as South Africa\u2019s captain since Smith retired following the defeat by Australia, again led the last-day resistance in Colombo after scoring an unbeaten 139 in their first-innings total of 282. After South Africa resumed their second innings on 38 for one, with morning rain removing any outside chance of chasing down 369 on a pitch expected to offer considerable assistance to the spinners, Amla batted for almost three hours before edging a 200th Test catch to Mahela Jayawardene at slip. That revived Sri Lanka\u2019s hopes of forcing a series-equalising victory but JP Duminy completed one of the more restrained performances in Test history with three from 65 balls to follow three from 68 in the first innings. When he was dismissed by the off-spinner Dilruwan Perera, and Dale Steyn followed nine overs later, South Africa were eight wickets down and still had eight overs to bat out. But Imran Tahir joined Vernon Philander to ensure no repeat of the near-miss which drove Jimmy Anderson to tears in Leeds last month, with Philander ending unbeaten on 27 after almost two hours at the crease to offer another example of his all-round value. Perera ended with three for 60 from 44 overs while the left-arm spinner Rangana Herath had the even more striking figures of 45-30-40-5. But Sri Lanka\u2019s failure to win leaves them sixth in the table, still five ranking points behind England. The rankings have been robbed of a large chunk of their significance by the recent decision to scrap the proposed World Test Championship for the top four in the table. But they remain a measure of a team\u2019s consistency and versatility and Clarke took major satisfaction from Australia\u2019s return to the top in May after a gap of almost five years - and had set his team the target of establishing themselves more comfortably in top spot in the coming months even before South Africa\u2019s return. If England lose by two clear Tests to India, they will slip to sixth, below Sri Lanka. They will stay in fifth evenif the series is drawn, with India fourth and Pakistan third. But a 2-1 series win would lift England to third and dump India to fifth, below Pakistan.

Perched on the cliff above was a modernist villa designed by Eileen Gray, a sleek, white ocean liner with which the Swiss-born architect had an unhealthy obsession. Gray designed it as a present for her much younger lover, the editor of an architecture magazine, and Le Corbusier was a frequent guest there. In 1939, after the relationship disintegrated and Gray moved out, he was allowed to\u00a0paint a series of erotically charged murals on its walls, which included a\u00a0figure with a swastika on her chest. There is an astonishing photograph of a bespectacled Le Corbusier at work on these seemingly pro-Nazi images, stark naked and brush in hand, his right thigh bearing a dramatic scar caused by\u00a0an accident involving a yacht&apos;s propeller blade the year before. The architect never convincingly answered accusations of fascist sympathies. Apparently Gray considered his primitivist daubings a violation of her work by a jealous rival, and campaigned to have them removed. Le Corbusier&apos;s fetishisation of the house remained undiminished, and he tried on several occasions to buy it. In 1952 he built a simple cabin for himself that offered voyeuristic views over the villa. Though his chapter about &quot;the secret sex lives of buildings&quot;, told through the tale of Le Corbusier and Gray, suggests otherwise, Wilkinson is interested in going beyond the &quot;kings and queens&quot; version of architectural history. Bricks and Mortals takes readers on a chronological tour through 10 &quot;great buildings&quot; \u2013 an unexpected selection that includes Gray&apos;s \u2013 to show how architecture shapes people&apos;s lives. The book owes a debt to Edward Hollis&apos;s The Secret Lives of Buildings; both explore the changing fortunes of notable structures, whose solid walls are the screens for mutable projections of meaning. Architecture is portrayed as the battleground of history (during the second world war, Gray&apos;s house was used for target practice by German soldiers), a rich palimpsest of ideological struggles. Each of Wilkinson&apos;s essays tackles a\u00a0theme, which provides an excuse for\u00a0numerous erudite and entertaining digressions. Case studies include the Tower of Babel (to illustrate power), Nero&apos;s Golden House (morality), the Djinguereber Mosque in Timbuktu (memory), Palazzo Rucellai in Florence (business), Henry Ford&apos;s Detroit factory (work), Finsbury Health Centre in London (health), as well as Gray&apos;s villa in Cap Martin (sex). The author allows himself a &quot;meandering path, pinballing through time and space&quot;, and compares his loose structure to a game of snakes and ladders; for all architecture&apos;s apparent solidity, there are no firm foundations \u2013 it is rather a matter of shifting sands. The Tower of Babel is one shape-shifting structure whose remains were discovered by a German archaeologist before the first world war. No one is quite sure what it looked like: Herodotus tells us it was a ziggurat or step pyramid, with eight levels capped by a temple to the patron deity of Babylon, Marduk. Nevertheless, Wilkinson notes, it &quot;haunts our imaginations in paintings, legends, wars and revolutions&quot;. The sky-scraping tower teeters between utopia and dystopia in the collective consciousness, an image either of attempted unity of purpose or\u00a0of oppression and failure. Both Nebuchadnezzar and Alexander the Great sought to rebuild Babel, and failed. Babylon became a cautionary tale of metropolitan decadence and imperial hubris. In 1789, when the Bastille fell in\u00a0Paris, parallels were drawn with its emasculated tower. Revolutionaries were disappointed to\u00a0discover that the\u00a0fortress held only\u00a0seven prisoners, including two aristocratic sex pests, but nevertheless its scattered stones were marketed as &quot;Relics of Freedom&quot;. For some, the World Trade Centre was also a Babel-like symbol of tyranny and oppression (Wilkinson reminds us that\u00a0Mohammed Atta, one of the 9/11 bombers, had studied architecture). On\u00a0the other hand, Saddam Hussein, modelling himself on Nebuchadnezzar, hoped to unite the disparate tribes of Iraq by restoring Babylon. He reconstructed the Ishtar gate and the Ziggurat of Ur, later the site of an American airfield. The remains of the Tower of Babel fester in a pit of oily water nearby. The image of the tower introduces and haunts Wilkinson&apos;s book. Cycles of\u00a0boom and bust can be predicted, he\u00a0writes, by clusters of enormous buildings. The Met Life Tower marked the 1907-10 crash; construction started on the Empire State Building just before Black Tuesday in 1929; the World Trade Centre and Sears Tower heralded the 1970s slump; Canary Wharf, the recession in the early 1990s; and the Burj Khalifa bankrupted Dubai. Bricks and Mortals leaves you with the sense that architects are not as influential as\u00a0they might like to be, or think they are.\u00a0They&apos;re rather the servants of corporate power, which has &quot;shaped the modern metropolis with the apparent inexorability of glaciers hollowing a valley&quot;. When discussing the Shard, Wilkinson pessimistically notes that attempts have been made to &quot;tame the business of architecture, but these are just pinpricks to Leviathan&quot;. Elsewhere, Wilkinson is more optimistic, offering forlorn hope that things might be different: &quot;disaster clears the ground for new beginnings, and perhaps one day soon the crash will come that sparks a real revolution in building.&quot; He paraphrases Le Corbusier, who wanted mass housing built &quot;on the same principles as the Ford car&quot;, to make a modish call for architecture and revolution. However, as his book clearly shows, one man&apos;s utopia is another&apos;s nightmare. Ford believed in, as Wilkinson puts it, &quot;permanent revolution, architecture that had to be open to change&quot;, but his assembly lines made cogs of all workers. Ford also pursued them home, instituting a sociological department that employed 50 investigators, Orwellian spies who ensured employees maintained his strict puritan values at all times. The biggest challenge facing architects today, Wilkinson writes, is housing for ordinary people, &quot;a responsibility that these days is consistently shirked&quot;. There is a corresponding nostalgia for paternalistic modernist projects, such as Berthold Lubetkin&apos;s Finsbury Health Centre (1938) \u2013 buildings that, as the architect put it, &quot;cry out for a world which has never come into being&quot;. It then seems odd not to include any examples of mass housing projects in his list of great buildings. And it seems naive to conclude, when discussing favelas and slums, that when &quot;the periphery reclaims the centre, architecture will at last be built for the people&quot;. Might history have offered more tangible clues as to how we might build a better future? For, as Lubetkin famously put it: &quot;Nothing is too good for ordinary people.&quot; \u2022 Christopher Turner&apos;s Adventures in the Orgasmatron is published by Fourth Estate.

Such was Wright\u2019s faith in the technologies of modernity \u2013 foremost among them, steel frame construction and elevators \u2013 that he naturally presumed the challenges of this extreme height could be overcome.  Almost 60 years of failure later, Wright\u2019s dream looks finally to be realised \u2013 almost. Plans for the Kingdom Tower, a mile-high skyscraper in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, were recently scaled back to a mere 1km due to \u201cunsuitable geology\u201d. Nevertheless, today\u2019s construction technology and engineering are edging ever higher, enabling a new generation of so-called \u201csuper-tall\u201d skyscrapers. The Burj Khalifa in Dubai, the tallest, stands at an impressive 829m.   But what of the lifts? Halfway up the Shard, London\u2019s tallest skyscraper, you are asked to step out of the elevator in order to switch to another. This is called the transfer floor or \u201csky lobby\u201d, a necessary inconvenience in order to reach the upper half of the building, and a symptom of the limits of elevators today. It can also be seen as evidence of the centuries-old arms race between architecture and technology.     The Shard\u2019s transfer floor is a necessary inconvenience in order to reach the upper half of the building. Photograph: Rory Hyde    The Shard is only 306m tall, and one still has to change elevators to reach the top. To ascend a mile-high (1.6km) tower using the same technology could necessitate changing elevators as many as 10 times. Waiting around on that many transfer floors may take the shine off your penthouse suite. But transfer floors are not merely inconvenient, they also take up valuable floor space that can\u2019t be let. Too much unlettable space and your super-tall skyscraper won\u2019t stack up financially.  Enter the UltraRope, a new kind of lift cable developed by Finnish elevator company Kone. Eschewing woven steel cable in favour of carbon fibre, the UltraRope is described as \u201clift-hoisting technology\u201d \u2013 a bit of a mouthful, and a sign that we don\u2019t yet have the right words for this cable-that\u2019s-not-really-a-cable. Strong and lightweight, the UltraRope will supposedly allow lifts to travel up to 1km in a single run, double what\u2019s currently possible with a steel cable. It\u2019s the weight that\u2019s the real innovation here: as lift cables get longer, the weight of cable itself can account for far more than the car and its passengers, requiring impractically huge machines to operate it. The UltraRope is 90% lighter than the equivalent steel cable, thereby reducing the load and enabling far taller continuous runs.   I have a piece of it on my desk. It\u2019s a peculiar object, very stiff \u2013 you almost think they should have called it UltraStick \u2013 and black. Looking closely, you can see it\u2019s comprised of four carbon-fibre cores, each roughly 5x3mm, encased in a high-friction coating of clear resin. When installed for real, multiple strands of UltraRope are used to hoist each elevator car, operating in parallel to share the load. The UltraRope is a peculiar and unusual contemporary object, the product of technological refinement and materials science.     The UltraRope is technically not a cable at all, but a carbon fibre core contained within a high-friction coating. Photograph: Kone    We have recently acquired some sections of UltraRope for the Victoria and Albert Museum as part of our \u201crapid response collecting\u201d strategy. As the name suggests, this is about bringing objects quickly into the museum in response to current events. We have recently opened a display featuring the first 13 such objects, including a 3D printed handgun, shoes designed in different shades of \u201cnude\u201d and a pair of false eyelashes endorsed by Katy Perry. Each object is implicated in a larger narrative, and points toward a possible future; the UltraRope sits alongside them as a signal toward the vertical future of our cities.  The UltraRope is merely the latest in a long chain of innovations, stretching back centuries, which together form the composite technology we have come to know as the elevator. The Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas dedicated a room to this history in the Elements exhibition at this year\u2019s Venice Architecture Biennale. Koolhaas describes the elevator as \u201cthe product of technological alchemy: a fusion of several boring existing innovations which had a dramatic impact on the shape of our cities and the shape of our bodies alike\u201d.      The Elements of Architecture section curated by Rem Koolhaas at the 2014 Venice Biennale. Photograph: Press Office Architecture Department    Evidence of basic hoists used to extract material from mines can be found in prehistoric sites across Europe. The ancient Greeks and Romans created mechanical platforms as devices for scenography in theatres. But the key technologies that comprise the \u201cmodern\u201d elevator \u2013 woven cable, safety brake, electric motor, core, traction and elevator bank \u2013 were all defined in the second half of the 19th century, in a period of great urban and technological transformation.   The invention of the elevator depends on external innovations, too. Steel construction, as pioneered by Louis Sullivan in Chicago in the 1880s, freed buildings from their dependence on compressive structures, allowing them to go higher still. Breakthroughs in fire safety and sprinkler systems enabled buildings to legally outstretch the height of a fireman\u2019s ladder. James Gleick, in The Information (2011), points to an even more oblique technology: the telephone. Gleick cites telephone engineer John J Carty, who wrote in 1908: \u201cTake any of the giant office buildings. How many messages do you suppose go in and out every day? Suppose there was no telephone and every message had to be carried by a personal messenger? How much room do you think the necessary elevators would leave for offices? Such structures would be an economic impossibility.\u201d   The impact these various tools, technologies and techniques had on the shape of cities was immediate. In one city in particular, Manhattan, where the new capacity of the elevator converged with real estate pressures and the egos of captains of industry, a new urban condition was born. The capacity of these buildings to concentrate a huge amount of floor space on a relatively small plot of land meant they became powerful tools of economic speculation. Cass Gilbert, architect of the Woolworth Building, one of Manhattan\u2019s first skyscrapers, completed in 1913, coined the pithy phrase \u201ca skyscraper is a machine that makes the land pay\u201d. But this wasn\u2019t always the case. The infamous \u201cskyscraper index\u201d purports to predict economic crises in the wake of frenzied construction of tall buildings, a sign the market is overheating. Indeed, even the Empire State Building \u2013 icon of American capitalism \u2013 only found enough tenants to become profitable in 1950, almost 20 years after its completion.      An invented story about an invention ... a depiction of Elisha Graves Otis showing his first elevator in the Crystal Palace, New York City, 1853. Photograph: Bettmann/Corbis     Despite the elevator\u2019s birth in \u201ctechnological alchemy\u201d, as Koolhaas describes it, our cultural demand for a singular author points to Elisha Otis\u2019s entrepreneurial performance at the 1853 Crystal Palace Exhibition in New York. To a gathered crowd of onlookers, Otis ascended into the air on his platform, then, at the apogee, had an assistant cut the rope with a dagger. Gasps were heard as the onlookers expected disaster, but the platform barely fell an inch, saved by Otis\u2019s patented safety catch. This anticlimax has become the elevator\u2019s origin myth. But as Andreas Bernard exposes in Lifted: A Cultural History of the Elevator (2014), this story of invention is itself an invention, promoted and cemented in place by the Otis company throughout the 20th century. Elisha Otis\u2019s daring performance barely garners a footnote in the newspapers of 1853, and the heroic and now \u201cofficial\u201d illustration of the performance was in fact drawn in 1978. Bernard concludes: \u201cThe teeming, astonished onlookers as well as the assistant who has just severed the suspension cable are inventions of the recent past.\u201d Despite this attempt to claim recognition, the elevator remains an anonymous product of a collaboration between various inventors, many of whom could not have known each other.   In an alternate world, where these dispersed inventions weren\u2019t brought together in sequence to form the elevator, what might life be like? The Torre David, a 47-storey tower in Caracas, Venezuela, is occupied by squatters up to the 28th floor, without the aid of an elevator. The building is home to more than 3,000 people, standing as a potent sign of resistance in a city of great disparity of wealth and equality.      Residents of the Torre David have developed their own strategies for using the lift-less building, such as this improvised rooftop gym. Photograph: Iwan Baan     Design critic Justin McGuirk spent five days in the tower for his new book Radical Cities. McGuirk describes life in the tower as \u201curban alpinism\u201d: a constant struggle against gravity and the tedium of the endless stairwell. Despite this extreme inconvenience, the residents have developed their own strategies to cope. Using the ramp of an adjacent carpark building, goods can be driven a quarter of the way up on motorcycles. And small bodega convenience stores have appeared every two floors or so, selling essentials such as tinned food, pasta and toilet paper. McGuirk writes: \u201cOnly the invention of the elevator made skyscrapers possible, and so a skyscraper without one is, theoretically speaking, a useless typology.\u201d And yet, the hybrid vertical village of the Torre David illustrates an alternative, \u201can urban laboratory for how cities might work differently\u201d.   The police finally cracked down on the squatters, evicting the residents and relocating them out of central Caracas. This episode highlights the real reason for the skyscraper: density. Faced with the alternative of living in the barrios that surround the city, these people had chosen to inhabit a centrally located tower without lifts. The vertical inconvenience of taking the stairs outweighed the horizontal inconvenience of living on the city\u2019s fringe. It goes to show how the capacity to build higher, and to concentrate more people in a smaller area, can enhance all of the benefits of urban living \u2013 employment, social networks, services, entertainment. The UltraRope, and other advances in building technologies like it, enable this urban density to be realised. Frank Lloyd Wright\u2019s seemingly impossible dream of a Mile High Tower could just be the answer for our cities after all.

I\u2019ve boxed in the UK and America, won fight of the year and moved up three weight classes. I\u2019ve achieved so much and I\u2019m still only 27.

He took fewer blows than usual when outclassing the limited but experienced Luis Collazo in Las Vegas three months ago. Khan\u2019s features were swollen after 12 rounds but he knocked Collazo down three times and resisted the temptation to engage too heavily during his first bout at welterweight. Now, just after Ramadan, Khan is in a reflective mood. His skilful display against Collazo won him widespread plaudits but he has lost the chance to fight either Floyd Mayweather or Manny Pacquiao this year. He has also become a less attractive option for fighters who would prefer to face the Khan of old \u2013 a vulnerable, big-hitting gambler. \u201cThey enjoy that,\u201d he says of opponents as well as US television executives who have always loved Khan\u2019s tendency to produce rollicking entertainment before safety-first dexterity. \u201cI still gave them a great fight against Collazo but the days are gone when I\u2019d go in there, all guns blazing, and make mistakes. I have the skills to box and not get into a war. I\u2019ve been getting punishment I shouldn\u2019t be taking because, sometimes, I\u2019m too brave for my own good. When I\u2019ve got good footwork and movement I should use them.\u201d     Amir Khan connects with a right against Luis Collazo during their welterweight bout at the MGM Grand in May. Photograph: Harry How/Getty Images    Earlier this year, when Khan was convinced he would face Mayweather, the American decided to fight Marcos Maidana \u2013 the tough Argentinian whom Khan had defeated in 2010. It was expected to be another routine victory for \u201cMoney\u201d Mayweather but Maidana startled everyone. After he had dispatched Collazo on the same bill at the MGM Grand, Khan says he \u201cstayed in the backroom and watched the fight on TV. \u201cFor the first five rounds [in a fight Maidana initially dominated and hurt the normally evasive Mayweather] I was shocked. I\u2019d expected Mayweather to win easily but styles make fights. Maidana put so much pressure on him that Floyd didn\u2019t have room to throw his punches. You have problems with Maidana if you just stand and fight. Floyd won but it wasn\u2019t easy. If I had fought Floyd it might\u2019ve been a very different story because I\u2019m so much faster. It was a strange night because Mayweather just didn\u2019t look himself. Maybe time is catching up with him or he had personal issues.\u201d Does Khan believe the notoriously tricky Mayweather when he promises that they will eventually fight? \u201cI kind of do, but I don\u2019t,\u201d Khan sighs. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough one. I know he needs me to make the really big pay-per-view numbers and money motivates him. It drives him because he can make much more fighting me than Maidana. I\u2019m big in the UK, Dubai, Asia and places where Floyd\u2019s not as well known.\u201d Maidana has been given a rematch with Mayweather on 13 September and Khan remains on the outside looking in, striving to sound positive. \u201cFloyd had a tough fight last time and the rematch might be tough too. So it\u2019s working out just right. When we do fight I\u2019ll be so much fresher. I know Floyd [46-0] wants to reach the 50-fight mark and maybe his last one will be against me.\u201d     Floyd Mayweather Jr, left, was unconvincing in victory over Marcos Maidana and has granted a rematch. Photograph: John Gurzinski/AFP/Getty Images    Khan, meanwhile, had been trying to drum up interest in a fight against Pacquiao in November. It\u2019s an intriguing prospect because they once shared a trainer in Freddie Roach \u2013 but Pacquiao has since announced that he will box the unbeaten Chris Algieri instead. \u201cThe Manny fight can still happen at some point,\u201d Khan says. \u201cMy promoters, Golden Boy, and Bob Arum [Pacquiao\u2019s promoter] are about to start working together again. Me and Manny sparred a lot, and I often went with him to the Philippines, so it would make a great fight. I\u2019ve left it with my team and my adviser Al Haymon [who also works closely with Mayweather] and I told them: \u2018I like the Manny fight.\u2019 But we\u2019ve had no response. \u201cBoxing is all about timing and Manny and Floyd are getting older. Someone has to take their place. Mayweather would be a very technical fight, like a game of chess. But I think Manny would be harder. He\u2019s much more aggressive and it would be more intense. But with my trainer Virgil Hunter I\u2019m a much better and more defensive fighter.\u201d Khan sounds slightly forlorn when considering his dwindling options this year. \u201cThe Mayweather fight has gone for now,\u201d he admits. \u201cThe Manny fight too. So I\u2019ll be disappointed because who else is there to fight? It\u2019s very hard to get a top-10 guy but I want to keep busy.\u201d It looks likely that Khan will fight next in December \u2013 with either Robert Guerrero or Devon Alexander his probable opponent. The obvious solution would have been for Khan to meet Kell Brook, his undefeated Sheffield rival, who is now preparing for a defining contest in the US. Khan has often denigrated Brook, but he sounds impressed by his fellow Briton travelling to California to fight the IBF world welterweight champion Shawn Porter on 16 August. \u201cI respect that a lot. Not many fighters would go away from home against Porter and, if Kell wins, it would put him straight in the big time. It would then definitely make sense for me and Kell to fight. We saw what Froch and Groves did at Wembley with 80,000 fans. We can also do that. But it\u2019s a big step up against Porter. Is he ready? He\u2019s been fighting C-class guys and now he\u2019s in with an A-class fighter.\u201d Khan eventually needs one of Brook, Pacquiao or Mayweather but it\u2019s important he does not become embroiled in less dignified scraps. This interview, scheduled for early July, had to be postponed because, hours before our first meeting, Khan was accused of assault by two teenage boys in Bolton. The outcome was less sensational but Khan looks mortified when asked if he had been seriously concerned. \u201cYeah,\u201d he nods. \u201cI know it doesn\u2019t look good. It doesn\u2019t help my career and if I\u2019d been charged it could have affected me going back to America. So I was concerned even if it was a misunderstanding. I had the interview in the police station and the policeman said: \u2018Look, this is nothing much. You boys can just sit down and sort it out.\u2019 On the Friday evening [18 hours after the incident] I got a call from the officer saying they were thinking of dropping the charges. I said there must be closed-circuit cameras which would show I did nothing bad. The police said there were but they weren\u2019t switched on. That would have helped me big time.\u201d What actually happened? \u201cSome kids started throwing things at my car. I got out of the car and one of them pushed me. I pushed him back and he fell on the floor. That was about it. I was on my own and there were 20 of them. It was just a case of being in the wrong place at the wrong time. So it was a huge relief the case got dropped. The boys have since apologised to me and said it was wrong. In my position people are always going to have a go at me but, even through I\u2019m a fighter, I don\u2019t want to be fighting out of the ring.\u201d It was Khan\u2019s latest brush with tabloid infamy and he still appears shaken. \u201cIt went all over the world. I was getting calls from America, Singapore, Pakistan, Asia, Dubai. I couldn\u2019t believe how big it went. It\u2019s the downside of being famous.\u201d Khan has had far happier moments since the Colloza fight \u2013 not least becoming a father to a little girl. He seems suitably besotted with his daughter and the fact that he has been able to spend the first few months of her life at home in Bolton rather than locked away in a training camp. \u201cIt\u2019s also been Ramadan and, while it\u2019s not easy, I enjoy the fasting. I\u2019ve done a lot of research and fasting is good for you. It\u2019s a sacrifice I enjoy, and my friends now understand my sacrifices as a fighter trying to make weight.\u201d He shudders and relives his hardest ordeal on the scales when, before his last fight in Britain, against Julio D\u00edaz 15 months ago \u201cI was 12 pounds over [the light-welterweight limit] the day before the weigh-in. During my training I\u2019d made sure I was rehydrating and eating small amounts and taking the protein shakes MaxiNutrition make for me. I was strong and fit but then I had to shift the weight.\u201d Khan explains the painful process in intricate detail as he starved and ran and sweated in a steaming hot bath. \u201cI made it but I was so weak. That showed me I had to move up a division and you saw how strong I was at welterweight.\u201d He has taken his hard licks and three painful losses in a nine-year career which has seen him win 29 of his 32 fights. There have been disappointments and worries and there are sure to be more letdowns before Khan gets in the ring with Mayweather but he sounds cheerful and undaunted. \u201cI\u2019m still fresh and I love the sport. It\u2019s addictive and I need to be careful I get out before too many fights. If I stay in fantastic condition and I\u2019ve got all this experience and my mind\u2019s still there I can fight until I\u2019m 30. But in another three years I\u2019ll think about calling it a day. I\u2019ve been doing it for a very long time and you can\u2019t keep on forever. I just want to make the most of the time I\u2019ve got left as a fighter.\u201d Amir Khan feeds his muscles with MaxiNutrition protein when training and competing #feedyourmuscles www.maxinutrition.com", "title": "Amir Khan: \u2018Fighting Mayweather like chess but Pacquiao would be harder\u2019", "sentences": ["I\u2019m big in the UK, Dubai, Asia and places where Floyd\u2019s not as well known.\u201d Maidana has been given a rematch with Mayweather on 13 September and Khan remains on the outside looking in, striving to sound positive.", "I was getting calls from America, Singapore, Pakistan, Asia, Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-04T11:49:38Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/07/40000-iraqis-stranded-mountain-isis-death-threat", "tags": ["Iraq", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Islamic State"], "article": "     Tens of thousands of members of one of Iraq&apos;s oldest minorities have been stranded on a mountain in the country&apos;s north-west, facing slaughter at the hands of jihadists surrounding them below if they flee, or death by dehydration if they stay. UN groups say at least 40,000 members of the Yazidi sect, many of them women and children, have taken refuge in nine locations on Mount Sinjar, a craggy, mile-high ridge identified in local legend as the final resting place of Noah&apos;s ark. At least 130,000 more people, many from the Yazidi stronghold of Sinjar, have fled to Dohuk, in the Kurdish north, or to Irbil, where regional authorities have been struggling since June to deal with one of the biggest and most rapid refugee movements in decades. Sinjar itself has been all but emptied of its 300,000 residents since jihadists stormed the city late on Saturday, but an estimated 25,000 people remain. &quot;We are being told to convert or to lose our heads,&quot; said Khuldoon Atyas, who has stayed behind to guard his family&apos;s crops. &quot;There is no one coming to help.&quot; Another man, who is hiding in the mountains and identified himself as Nafi&apos;ee, said: &quot;Food is low, ammunition is low, and so is water. We have one piece of bread to share between 10 people. We have to walk 2km to get water. There were some air strikes yesterday [against the jihadists], but they have made no difference.&quot;     Iraq isis WEB    At least 500 Yazidis, including 40 children, have been killed in the past week, local officials say. Many more have received direct threats, either from the advancing militants or members of nearby Sunni communities allied with them. &quot;They were our neighbours and now they are our killers,&quot; said Atyas. &quot;It&apos;s not like this is a one-off incident,&quot; said the Unicef spokeswoman Juliette Touma. &quot;We are almost back to square zero in terms of the preparedness and the supplies. Enormous numbers of people have been crossing the border since June. &quot;The stresses are enormous; dehydration, fatigue, people sometimes having to walk for days. The impact on kids is very physical, let alone the psychological impact.&quot; The Kurdish minority Yazidis have long been regarded as devil worshippers by Sunni jihadists who have targeted them since the US invasion. As the extremists&apos; latest and most potent incarnation, the Islamic State (Isis), has steadily conquered Iraq&apos;s north, the small, self-contained community has been especially vulnerable. Isis forces advanced across north-western Iraq almost unchecked since a small band of hardliners stormed Iraq&apos;s second city, Mosul, on 10 June, sending the Iraqi army fleeing and shattering the central government&apos;s control. Flush with weapons looted from Iraqi arsenals, Isis sacked Tikrit and advanced on Kirkuk. With new recruits lured or pressganged along the way, it has captured five oilfields and three cities, an 800-mile stretch of border with Syria. It has menaced Baghdad and is now within striking distance of Iraq&apos;s two largest dams.     An Iraqi Yazidi family that fled the violence in Sinjar take refuge in Dohuk. Photograph: Safin Hamed/AFP/Getty Images    &quot;The situation is slowly tipping in their favour,&quot; said Dr Hisham al-Hashimi, Iraq&apos;s leading expert on Isis. &quot;They won&apos;t take the dam near Mosul, but Haditha [at the centre of Iraq&apos;s water and energy supply grid] will be very hard to defend. &quot;They are very close to Baghdad airport. If they breached the perimeter, even with a symbolic attack, it would be enormous propaganda value for them.&quot; Iraq&apos;s beleaguered military has been unable to muster a meaningful push back against the jihadists and is under intense pressure to support the Yazidis with air strikes and food drops. A series of spectacular defeats has seriously eroded its credibility. Baghdad claimed on Wednesday that its military had carried out an air strike on a Mosul prison which killed scores of jihadists and freed an unknown number of prisoners. The area was impossible to access and the numbers of fatalities could not be verified. However, witnesses reported damage to the prison and relatives rushed to the gates in the hope of rescuing detained family members. Kurdish Peshmurga troops, long regarded as a more formidable fighting force, had been defending Sinjar, but they too were forced to withdraw as Isis advanced. Kurdish officials say their forces were seriously outgunned by the jihadists, who were using heavy weapons looted from Iraqi bases. The same weapons are being used to consolidate Isis&apos;s hold on much of western Iraq. The group has significantly boosted its numbers by tapping into Iraq&apos;s estranged Sunni population, which has been marginalised by the Shia majority government since the US overthrow of Saddam Hussein more than 11 years ago. &quot;I would say there are now between 30,000 and 50,000 of them,&quot; Hashimi said. &quot;Of those, I would say 30% are ideologues. The others have joined out of fear or coercion.&quot;     Yazidi members demonstrate outside UN offices in Erbil against the Isis violence. Photograph: Safin Hamed/AFP/Getty Images    The once dominant US military and powerful embassy now play next to no role in Iraq, with Iraqi militias reporting to Iranian generals increasingly taking the lead in the fight against the jihadists. &quot;Iraq is spiralling out of control,&quot; said Ali Khedery, the former longest-serving US official in Baghdad. &quot;The centrifugal forces are spinning so quickly. They are on one timeline and Washington is on another. I am beyond concerned.&quot; Khedery, who reported to five US ambassadors and three US central command generals and is now chairman of the Dubai-based consultancy Dragoman Partners, said: &quot;Everybody is retreating to their corners. And there is no credible international actor that I can see that is trying to bring it together again. &quot;It definitely is an existential threat to the Iraqi government and I think it represents yet another manifestation of the disintegration of Iraq as we know it. &quot;Iranian overreach, the genocide in Syria, [Nouri] al-Maliki&apos;s consolidation of power in a very sectarian way, have all led to the disillusionment, the disenfranchisement of the Sunni Arabs, who have fatally, but perhaps understandably, chosen to consummate a deal with the devil.

Another season that promises to, somehow, be more absurd than the last, an unfortunate trend that has blighted the Championship club ever since they fell out of the Premier League 10 years ago. David Haigh, who was pulling the strings at Elland Road this time last year, has been in a Dubai jail for three months, accused of fraud by the club\u2019s previous owners and current minority shareholders. He has been replaced by an Italian entrepreneur who has previous criminal convictions and whose first managerial appointment is an unknown coach who last worked in the Conference with Forest Green Rovers. Massimo Cellino is the latest protagonist in a saga that takes centre stage again at Millwall on Saturday and has divided opinion within supporters who thought they had seen it all. How wrong they were. Cellino, who bought Leeds in April from Gulf Finance House Capital despite opposition from the Football League, is a maverick of the highest order. He sacked Brian McDermott before re-appointing him last season, he was referred to by the new coach \u2013 Dave Hockaday \u2013 as \u201cthe president\u201d about 20 times in his opening press conference, and only last weekend climbed into his office at Elland Road through a window after being locked out. When his deal to buy Leeds was confirmed, he invited journalists to his lawyers\u2019 office in London, regaling the assembled crowd with outlandish tales of pot-washing in 1970s England and sincerely inviting a reporter to play with his rock band in Sardinia. eneath the jokes, the headline fodder, the superstitions and devilish charm, there is another side to Cellino. It is a ruthless side. He said that the Leeds workforce was bloated and, true to his word, swiftly made wide-ranging job cuts. Around 70 staff were laid off in a matter of weeks \u2013 others saw the writing on the wall and walked. Benito Carbone, appointed to work with the club\u2019s academy a few months ago, has already left \u2013 citing \u201cfamily reasons\u201d. The former Cagliari owner known as the King of Corn has a temper and those who bear the brunt of it are often sent packing or waste no time in doing the packing themselves.The question is, though, can Cellino fulfil his promise to take Leeds back to the Premier League within two seasons? His tone has already changed somewhat on that front \u2013 perhaps at the realisation of the mess he inherited \u2013 and there is little way to gauge how they will fare. For all Cellino\u2019s foibles, he is undoubtedly passionate about rejuvenating a club that in recent years has been bereft of optimism. The Italian revealed to the Guardian last week that the wheels are in motion to re-purchase Elland Road, something he wants to do by November when the price would rise, and is seemingly on a one-man mission to drag Leeds back to the top-flight while rebuilding the club from its foundations upwards. \u201cThis is a big mess. It\u2019s going to be a big war \u2013 the biggest war is inside, not outside,\u201d says Cellino. \u201cI haven\u2019t even started building this club yet. The results and the team are the smaller problems at this club. Believe me. I have to get this club ready to face the Premier League. At the moment it\u2019s not ready to face the Championship. Last year we started late because one of our players was stuck in traffic \u2013 he didn\u2019t live in Leeds. . You must be bloody joking. We need a professional mentality.\u201d The sad truth is that, without Cellino, Leeds were heading into the abyss yet again. GFHC\u2019s reign was unravelling in spectacular fashion as debts spiralled, with the Italian overturning a ruling by the league and securing the club for \u00a335m, a price that included the debt. GFHC remain 25% shareholders but have recently agreed to convert \u00a311m of the debt into equity, a move that, according to the investment bank, \u201cshould be seen as a recapitalisation of the club to put it on a firmer financial footing\u201d. Cellino, meanwhile, is due to pay GFHC the remaining \u00a36m of his initial purchase agreement by December. On the pitch the worry is goals, given Ross McCormack\u2019s \u00a311m move to Fulham, which, according to Cellino, will go a big way to securing the deal to buy back the stadium. McCormack was comfortably the Championship\u2019s top scorer with 29 goals last year, but Leeds have so far signed untested foreign players rather than replacing the Scot with a proven striker. Tom Lees, the young former England Under-21 defender, was also allowed to leave for Sheffield Wednesday on a free transfer. Alongside his sporting director, Nicola Salerno, Cellino has bought players known to him from Italy, such as the goalkeeper Marco Silvestri, the midfielder Tommaso Bianchi and the defender Gaetano Berardi. There have also been the loan arrivals of the young Milan midfielder Zan Benedicic and the striker Souleymane Doukara from Catania. This week the club also signed Nicky Ajose from Peterborough. Asked whether he would be picking the team rather than Hockaday, Cellino says: \u201cHow can you think something like that? If I did that why would I need to pay the coach? I hope to give my advice, that\u2019s my duty. I need to know what\u2019s going on and follow his work but it\u2019s not because I decide. I\u2019ve never called a coach asking who is going to play tomorrow \u2013 I don\u2019t care. \u201cI can change manager like underwear if needs be. Everyone has said Hockaday is not the right coach for Leeds, but I think he is. It\u2019s not the choice of the journalists or the supporters. If I have made the wrong choice I have to face it. A lot of presidents don\u2019t fire the coach because they are ashamed that they made the wrong choice.\u201d Leeds will hope that his choice proves wise, as they wait with baited breath ahead of what could be another turbulent year. If Cellino and Hockaday pull something off it would go down as one of the more remarkable stories in recent memory. In truth, though, nobody knows quite what to expect. \u201cNo-one is going to die,\u201d says Cellino. \u201cIf the team is not strong now, it will get stronger. I promise. We don\u2019t have time to lose.\u201d", "title": "Maverick owner Massimo Cellino admits Leeds United are still a big mess", "sentences": ["David Haigh, who was pulling the strings at Elland Road this time last year, has been in a Dubai jail for three months, accused of fraud by the club\u2019s previous owners and current minority shareholders."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-08T12:12:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/aug/08/money-bernie-ecclestone-f1-profit-rules", "tags": ["Bernie Ecclestone", "Formula One", "Motor sport", "Formula One 2014", "Sport"], "article": "This week Bernie Ecclestone gave a million dollars \u2013 exactly one per cent of the $100m he paid into a German court \u2013 to a charity caring for terminally ill children. Close observers of his career might have been thinking that the diminutive Formula One ringmaster had already done more than enough for children\u2019s charities. His two younger daughters, after all, live with their families in mansions in London and Los Angeles costing upwards of \u00a350m apiece before redecoration to suit exotic tastes that run, in the case of the elder daughter\u2019s pad, to a \u00a31m crystal bath. Both these young women briefly exercised their talents in the field of fashion, jewellery and make-up design, while one of them spent a few months as a television presenter. It is, however, probably fair to say that the opulence of their present lifestyles is funded by income from the $2bn offshore family trust set up in their name by Ecclestone, using funds accrued from his control of Formula One over the past 30 years. Ecclestone left Munich by private jet on Tuesday a free man, as few doubted he would, having found the most blackly humorous solution to a charge of bribery: the offer of a vast amount of money, to be paid in a lump sum. Invited to pay a fine, most people are asked if they need time. The standard is 28 days, which in many cases will cover the arrival of a monthly salary, but Ecclestone was asked if he could find the money straight away. \u201cThat\u2019s doable,\u201d his lawyer, Sven Thomas, told the court. This will not have amused those teams struggling for survival towards the back of the grid, forced to watch as the private equity firm that controls the sport and employs Ecclestone, having creamed off more than half the revenues over the past eight years, prepares to sell it on at a large profit. When, like Ecclestone, you are coming up to your 84th birthday and facing the possibility that a guilty verdict could mean a spell behind bars, and the sum of money involved in averting that outcome amounts to nothing more than the outlay on another mansion in Kensington Park Gardens or the Holmby Hills, who would not agree to sign the cheque without delay? The signature ensured that there would be no further risk of being found guilty but he also avoided the possibility of being found innocent, encouraging suspicions that are not entirely banished by the assurance that he wanted a swift end to the case because he was finding it \u201cburdensome\u201d. He has played the OAP card on several occasions in recent years, appearing uncharacteristically vague last year in front of a high court that concluded it was impossible to regard him as \u201ca reliable or truthful witness\u201d. He has, however, retained enough mental clarity to negotiate deals with, among others, Ilham Aliyev, the president of oil-rich Azerbaijan, where a grand prix will be held in 2016. Aliyev succeeded his father to the presidency and promptly abolished the limitation on the number of terms the country\u2019s head of state may serve. In 2010 the Washington Post reported that his three children \u2013 two daughters and a son, the oldest aged 29, the youngest only 16 \u2013 own property in Dubai worth $75m. He sounds, you might think, like a man with a place in Bernie\u2019s circle. Reflecting on the outcome of the case in Munich, Ecclestone said: \u201cThis now allows me to do what I do best, which is running F1.\u201d Those whom he has made rich, including many influential figures in the sport, would agree. Both inside and outside the paddock, however, there is an increasing clamour for change. A thrilling race in Budapest a fortnight ago \u2013 the product first of Lewis Hamilton\u2019s charge through the field after starting from the pit lane and then of a safety car intervention that thrust the top four runners back into the pack \u2013 cannot disguise the problems of dwindling worldwide television audiences and sparsely populated grandstands at many of the tracks. Since Ecclestone took control of the sport\u2019s commercial rights, he has been allowed to run the whole show. The races take place where he wants, when he wants, under regulations in which he has a large say. So he can endorse an endless list of gimmicks, such as the award of double the normal championship points to the winner of this season\u2019s concluding round, conveniently relocated from Brazil to Abu Dhabi, whose rulers can easily afford any premium for the prestige of hosting a stage-managed grand climax on top of the gigantic fee they already pay Ecclestone. When the man who takes the profit is allowed to make the rules, it is not surprising that a preoccupation with spectacle eats away at the soul of a sport. Even the venerable magazine Motor Sport, founded several years before Ecclestone was born, is campaigning ferociously for his removal. Finally bullied into admitting that all is not well, last month Bernie announced his intention to set up a commission into the future of grand prix racing. One of its members, he proposed, might be his old chum Flavio Briatore. If it is in need of \u2013 and is willing to take seriously \u2013 the advice of a figure who was banned from the sport five years ago, although later reinstated, after a race-fixing scandal, Formula One must be in even worse trouble than it thinks.", "title": "Money makes Bernie Ecclestone\u2019s F1 world go round | Richard Williams", "sentences": ["In 2010 the Washington Post reported that his three children \u2013 two daughters and a son, the oldest aged 29, the youngest only 16 \u2013 own property in Dubai worth $75m."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-08T14:14:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/aug/08/arab-gulf-states-silent-on-gaza", "tags": ["Israel", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Palestinian territories", "Gaza", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Qatar", "Saudi Arabia", "United Arab Emirates"], "article": "After hopes of a lasting truce fade again today, the intense pressure on Gaza continues.

The UAE has always stood by us,\u201d the Palestinian Authority\u2019s man in charge of reconstruction told me in 2010. True to form, through the latest period of violence, 18 Boeing 747s and C130s were dispatched from Dubai laden with meals, blankets and medicine. Saudi Arabia pledged US$80m (around \u00a348m) in aid. Yet this humanitarian effort stands in stark contrast to Gulf foreign policy. Saudi Arabia\u2019s king took three painful weeks to even criticise Israel\u2019s offensive. The UAE then concurred; its foreign minister, Abdullah bin Zayed, had earlier condemned Israel on Twitter. But not one concrete, punitive action against Israel was called for by either country. That Gulf Arab silence \u2013 in policy, thought and strategy \u2013 has not gone unnoticed. It has reverberated in the west, where Spain and Latin American nations have done more to shore up support for Gaza than their Arab counterparts. Instead of taking action, Gulf nations aimed their diplomatic guns at each other. A spat raged between Qatar, Saudi and the UAE: the Middle East Eye depicted an Israel-Saudi-Egypt troika conspiring against Gaza. The UAE denied it had ever normalised relations with Israel \u201cas others did\u201d \u2013 a dig at Qatar\u2019s now defunct 1990s relationship with Israel. What are some of the reasons for this state of affairs? Partly, fatigue has set in after a decade of pressing the Gulf\u2019s definitive position on Israel, the Arab Peace Initiative, to little avail. But domestic political concerns inevitably play a part for regimes that are constantly wary of their own populations. As Dr Kristian Ulrichsen of Rice University has said, \u201cGulf states are also caught in a difficult balancing act as their commitment to the Palestinian cause clashes with their campaign against the Muslim Brotherhood across the region\u201d. This may be the case. But it\u2019s hard to see what Gulf states could lose in the long term from a resolution of this most divisive problem. If only they attacked the problem of reaching a lasting settlement with the same vigour they show in attacking each other. The UAE has augmented its standing at the UN with time, energy and resources. In the interest of deterring Iran, the UAE now has the world\u2019s highest military spending per capita at $14bn a year and Saudi Arabia outstrips the UAE for defence imports. It is time to develop a formula for Gulf Arab intervention backed by diplomatic and defence credibility. Aid is useless if reconstruction materials cannot get through. The Gulf ought to pursue an end to the blockade, in alignment with Jimmy Carter\u2019s and Mary Robinson\u2019s recent proposal for a UN security council resolution. Saudi Arabia and the UAE could either pay for, send or politically back peacekeepers; the precedent exists in Afghanistan alongside western allies. The question of a UAE-funded Iron Dome to protect Gazans has not so far been contemplated. It should be. The US has said it will \u201cstrongly oppose\u201d a Palestinian push for an investigation by the international criminal court into Israeli actions. A credible Arab plan to back efforts at the international criminal court is overdue; Palestinians should not be going it alone. The US-Gulf relationship should also come under pressure as a result of the former\u2019s financial and military support for Israel. Oil exports should not be off the bargaining table. This could be the Gulf\u2019s smart-power moment. It must use its influence where it is needed most.", "title": "Why are the Arab Gulf countries silent on Gaza? | Habiba Hamid", "sentences": ["Upon joining the ruler of Dubai\u2019s central government office in 2007, its Palestinian head of strategy told me to steer clear of Palestinian politics.", "True to form, through the latest period of violence, 18 Boeing 747s and C130s were dispatched from Dubai laden with meals, blankets and medicine."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-08T15:03:53Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/aug/09/live-racing-9-august-2014", "tags": ["Sport", "Ascot"], "article": "Saturday\u2019s best bets, by Chris Cook It is five years since Richard Hughes became the first jockey to win a second Silver Saddle, the prize given to the leading jockey at the Shergar Cup. It is unlikely to at Ascot rank among the most notable of his achievements but it is there just the same and he has excellent prospects of winning it for a third time on Saturday afternoon, when Highland Acclaim (3.50) is among his mounts. This three-year-old has improved dramatically for David O\u2019Meara this season and looked a shade unlucky over course and distance last month when the apprentice Sam James rode him for the first time. James won on him last time at Newmarket, when Highland Acclaim\u2019s finishing effort strongly suggested that there was more to come. 12.55 Ascot O\u2019Meara has a chance in the other sprint on the card with Move In Time, who has looked a proper Group horse at times and ran respectably against Sole Power and Slade Power last summer. This campaign has been quieter but he won a small race at Newmarket last time and is on a handy mark for a winnable handicap. 1.30 Ascot When Maid In Rio pelted home nine lengths clear of a big field last month it was Hassle who chased her home. He had zero winning chance that day but he beat everything else by three lengths and the filly has not turned up this time. He seemed to prove his stamina for this trip that day and had won three of his previous four. 2.05 Ascot Twice a winner from four starts here, Charles Camoin ran well in a major Goodwood handicap at the Glorious meeting and gets to try again off the same mark. 2.20 Haydock Fast ground and the step back to a mile did for Llanarmon Lad at Newmarket last time. Back up to 10 furlongs and with a more forgiving surface likely, he can resume his upward curve. 2.40 Ascot O\u2019Meara and Hughes have yet another live runner in Ingleby Angel. His season has been unproductive so far but he has been highly tried on occasion and went close last time. 2.55 Haydock Last month Vancouverite looked unlucky in the Newbury race in which all the focus was on Al Kazeem. That was his first start since Dubai in March and there should be more to come from this four-year-old, passed on to Charlie Appleby by Andr\u00e9 Fabre at the end of last year. 3.15 Ascot South Africa\u2019s S\u2019manga Khumalo has a fine chance aboard Trip To Paris, from the Ed Dunlop yard that has recovered some form in the past fortnight. He achieved a career best when scoring over this course and distance last time. It will improve his chance if the overnight rain has not had too dramatic an effect, as several of his key rivals would prefer some cut. 3.35 Newmarket Godolphin have won this for the past five years and Winters Moon may make it six.

He set his 1991 novel, Time&apos;s Arrow, in a world where chronology runs backward, so that the Nazi death camps become places of healing and rebirth. His new novel is just as unsettling, following the progress of a love affair in Auschwitz and taking us into the minds of Germans doing their best to normalise their part in the Nazi regime. The camp, says one character, is a mirror on the soul: &quot;You can&apos;t turn away.&quot; But how to come to terms with such darkness? Time&apos;s Arrow was Man Booker-shortlisted, but this new novel hasn&apos;t made the cut. Stone Mattress by Margaret Atwood(Bloomsbury)     Stone Mattress by Margaret Atwood    Atwood&apos;s last collection of short stories was 2006&apos;s Moral Disorder, in which the history of a family is explored from the shifting point of view of one of its members. Since then, Atwood has completed the dystopian trilogy that\u00a0began with Oryx and Crake with the publication of The Year of the Flood and MaddAddam. Now comes a gathering of nine stories, including her 2012 piece &quot;I Dream of Zenia with the Bright Red Teeth&quot;, in\u00a0which she returns to the characters from The Robber Bride. Elsewhere, we encounter an elderly lady who finds a\u00a0way to accommodate the little people she has begun to see everywhere, another woman is mistaken for a vampire and \u2013 perhaps most intriguingly \u2013 a 1.9\u00a0billion-year-old Arctic stromatolite helps to revenge an\u00a0old crime. With plaudits from Alice Munro, Germaine Greer and Michael Ondaatje, this looks set to be one of the\u00a0story collections of the autumn. J by Howard Jacobson(Jonathan Cape)     J BY Howard JacobsOn    Already longlisted for this year&apos;s Booker, Jacobson&apos;s new novel promises different pleasures from the comic fury of Kalooki Nights or The Finkler Question, which won the prize in 2010. It is set in the future, after some catastrophe. The title itself is a mystery \u2013 one character&apos;s father always drew his fingers across his lips when pronouncing any word that began with the letter J. That character, Kevern, now meets a woman, Ailinn, and they fall in love. The novelist himself has confided to this writer that it is &quot;my best book&quot;. Energetically promoting the dystopian literary cred, meanwhile, the publishers invoke Nineteen Eighty-Four and Brave New World, though, oddly, not The Hunger Games. Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage by Haruki Murakami(Harvill Secker)     Haruki Murakami, Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage    The now-permanent Nobel favourite Murakami probably has the biggest following of any literary novelist on the planet. But readers who jumped on the bandwagon with his previous novel, the two-volume supernatural vigilante epic 1Q84, will here find a change of mood. As a teenager, Tsukuru is told one day by his four best friends that they don&apos;t want to see him any more, and they refuse to give any reason. Now Tsukuru is 36, a designer of railway stations, and his new girlfriend encourages him to seek out his old friends and demand to know why. Colourless Tsukuru Tazaki is a\u00a0naturalistic coming-of-age story in the vein of\u00a0his 2001 novel Norwegian Wood, sprinkled with strange images and written in a hauntingly mournful key. How to Be Both by Ali Smith(Hamish Hamilton)     How to Be both by Ali Smith    This is Smith&apos;s first venture into historical fiction and you can bet\u00a0it won&apos;t be like any other historical novels you&apos;ve read. Clues about its contents are tantalisingly oblique. Suffice to say it adopts a double timeframe, with one strand tethered to the the Renaissance art world of the 1460s and the other wrapped around a &quot;child of a child of\u00a0the 1960s&quot;. We&apos;re promised a tale that borrows from painting&apos;s fresco technique, to bend time, genre and medium \u2013 Smith is such an artful novelist that we would expect nothing less. This year, she&apos;s the only British woman on the Booker longlist. The Paying Guests by Sarah Waters(Virago)     The Paying Guests by Sarah Waters    Waters has become a\u00a0virtuoso historical novelist. Her last book, The Little Stranger, was set in the aftermath of the second world war; now she winds back the clock to an earlier period of postwar class and gender turmoil. South London, 1922: genteel Frances and her widowed mother have fallen on hard times, rubbing along in a big suburban house that used to be busy with menfolk and servants. During the war, Frances saw opportunities for freedom and love; now duty and bereavement have resigned her to confined spinsterhood and the kind of domestic hard labour previously unknown to a woman of her class. Until a couple of the &quot;clerk class&quot; move in as lodgers, and surprising intimacies develop \u2026 Waters has created both a\u00a0page-turning melodrama and a fascinating portrait of London on\u00a0the verge of great change. SEPTEMBER Outline by Rachel Cusk (Faber)     Outline by Rachel Cusk    Cusk&apos;s last novel, 2009&apos;s The Bradshaw Variations, told the story of three brothers and their families, and was set during the\u00a0course of a year; Outline, her eighth, takes place over a\u00a0few days and is concerned with characters more or less unknown to one another. In\u00a0between these novels, Cusk wrote Aftermath, a\u00a0non-fiction meditation on the end of her marriage. Here, too, the narrator has recently been through a domestic cataclysm, and perhaps as a\u00a0result she is receptive to the stories of others: the charismatic Greek businessman she sits next to on a flight to Athens, where she is going to teach a writing course, the Irish short-story writer co-teaching the course, and sundry other writers. She presents their narratives in an artless, affectless style, passing the occasional comment but otherwise fostering the illusion \u2013 for illusion it is \u2013 that she is leaving her material unshaped. It has a\u00a0mesmerising, cumulative effect, as fragments of lives and differing points of view overlap. Perfidia by James Ellroy (Heinemann)     Perfidia by James Ellroy    Ellroy&apos;s 14th novel opens in late 1941, a\u00a0decade before LA Confidential, and like that book has the LAPD at its centre. Pearl Harbour brings the US into the war, and Japanese-Americans become the focus of paranoia and hatred. In this atmosphere of rising racism, the brutal killing of a Japanese family is investigated by Captain William H Parker and Sergeant Dudley Smith, who have a Japanese chemist on their team. Also prominent is 21-year-old Kay Lake, a typical noir heroine who, like Smith, has appeared in Ellroy&apos;s fiction before. Perfidia brings the two sides of his work together: the period crime-writing of LA Quartet, with its highlighting of police misdemeanours, and the wider politico-historical concerns of his subsequent Underworld USA trilogy, a &quot;secret history&quot; of the years from 1958 to 1972. The Monogram Murders by Sophie Hannah(HarperCollins)     The Monogram Murders by Sophie Hannah    Three guests at a London hotel are found murdered, each\u00a0with a cufflink in\u00a0their mouth, on the\u00a0same evening that a woman tells Hercule Poirot she is about to be killed. In\u00a0the first ever Agatha Christie sequel, the Belgian sleuth is resurrected by Sophie Hannah, who has chosen to keep him (in contrast to Sherlock&apos;s creators&apos; updating of the rival fictional detective) in his original period, the 1920s. A crime writer herself, and a\u00a0Christie devotee since building up a\u00a0complete collection of Poirots and Marples between the ages of 12 and 14,\u00a0Hannah has talked of aspiring only\u00a0to &quot;polish&quot; her idol&apos;s shoes, rather\u00a0than step into them; and of a whodunnit&apos;s key ingredients being &quot;an\u00a0apparently impossible mystery, a\u00a0totally unguessable solution, a super-brilliant detective&quot;, and a\u00a0denouement in which a memorable motive is &quot;the last present to be unwrapped&quot;. No sweat, then. The Assassination of Margaret\u00a0Thatcher by Hilary Mantel(4th Estate)     The Assassination of Margaret Thatcher by Hilary Mantel    With only The Mirror and the Light, the\u00a0final part of her Cromwell trilogy, to put the finishing touches to and the theatrical adaptations of the first two parts successfully launched, it&apos;s no wonder Mantel has found time to write\u00a0a collection of\u00a0stories. Nor that this most fearless of\u00a0writers has given it such a provocative title, though it is\u00a0not as yet\u00a0clear to what precisely it\u00a0refers, although the late prime minister is reported to feature as a character. Aside from that, settings include Greece, London and Saudi Arabia, where Mantel lived in the 1980s\u00a0and which she wrote about in Eight Months on Ghazzah Street. The Bone Clocks by David Mitchell (Sceptre)     The Bone Clock by David Mitchell    Mitchell&apos;s most recent\u00a0book, The Thousand Autumns of\u00a0Jacob de Zoet, came\u00a0dangerously close to being a\u00a0straight historical novel. Four years later,\u00a0he lets loose with something truly fantastical: an epic in many voices featuring supernatural beings, rips in reality and\u00a0a global battle between good and evil. Yet Mitchell&apos;s superlative prose makes this much more than a tall tale:\u00a0the novel also takes in\u00a0family love\u00a0and loss, the wars in Afganistan and Iraq and a horribly plausible near-future in which the end\u00a0of oil is\u00a0catapulting the world towards barbarism. (There&apos;s also\u00a0a cheeky satirical sideswipe at the\u00a0literary world,\u00a0narrated by a Martin Amisesque\u00a0novelist whose back catalogue includes the celebrated volume Desiccated Embryos.) Through friends and lovers\u00a0we follow the life of Holly Sykes,\u00a0from runaway Gravesend teenager in 1984 to\u00a0an old woman in the west of Ireland, as she and the reader gradually discover that her mental quirks are all too real. It&apos;s a globe-trotting, mind-bending, hair-raising triumph, already sitting pretty on the Booker longlist. The Children Act by Ian McEwan(Jonathan Cape)     The Children Act by Ian McEwan    Judge Fiona Maye is\u00a0firmly ensconced at\u00a0the heart of the establishment, bringing cool rationality as\u00a0well\u00a0as down-to-earth\u00a0wisdom to the moral\u00a0and domestic dilemmas she pronounces on. (Her judgments sound rather McEwanesque: among fellow judges she is &quot;praised, even in her absence, for crisp prose, almost ironic, almost warm&quot;.) It is her duty to decide whether to overrule those who\u00a0resist life-saving medical interventions \u2013 whether they are conjoined twins or Jehovah&apos;s Witnesses who need blood transfusions. But her personal life is in\u00a0crisis, and her professional life is threatening to become personal. McEwan investigates the legal niceties and moral complexities of individual responsibility with precision-tooled prose \u2013 but has missed\u00a0out on a Booker listing this\u00a0year. Us by David Nicholls (Hodder &amp; Stoughton)     Us by David Nicholls    Us was perhaps the most surprising inclusion on this year&apos;s Booker longlist. Nicholls&apos;s fourth novel follows in the footsteps of the mega-selling One Day in the sense that it&apos;s a will-they-won&apos;t-they male-female romance, but it&apos;s located firmly in middle age, as narrator Douglas, a staid biochemist, battles to save his marriage to the more free-spirited Connie. Their response to the crisis \u2013 a drifting apart that has revealed more fundamental issues \u2013 is an ill-advised decision to whisk their moody teenage son off on a grand tour of European cities, taking in art and culture and, Douglas fervently hopes, healing all rifts in the process. Needless to say, the Eurostar has barely shrugged free of suburban London before the first cracks appear, proving that travelling hopefully is far more difficult than actually arriving. But what gives Us an extra bit of charge is the careful elaboration of Douglas and Connie&apos;s meeting, courtship and long marriage, which results in a more complex picture of chance, circumstance, social mobility and personal difference than might at first have been expected. Us\u00a0is\u00a0likely to hit the spot with Nicholls&apos;s gently maturing readership. The Dog by Joseph O&apos;Neill(4th Estate)     The Dog by Joseph O'Neill    Another Booker-longlistee, The Dog is\u00a0the first novel since 2008 by the New York-based Irish writer. O&apos;Neill&apos;s previous book, Netherland, attracted the admiration of Barack Obama (&quot;An\u00a0excellent novel,&quot; the president judged). The Dog sees a middle-aged New York lawyer, fresh from the collapse of a romantic relationship, accepting a new job in Dubai, where he will oversee some vast family fortune. This, he hopes, will be a fresh start, but\u00a0people in novels are rarely allowed fresh starts. Here, expat-infested Dubai is an &quot;abracadabrapolis&quot; observed by\u00a0a character the publishers describe as &quot;a\u00a0brilliantly entertaining antihero&quot; who is &quot;imprisoned by his endless powers of reasoning&quot;: we might hope for some Beckett in the Gulf. A critic for United Arab Emirates paper the National notes admiringly: &quot;The Dog is unlikely to have a Middle Eastern launch at our local department of tourism.&quot; Shark by Will Self(Bloomsbury)     Shark by Will Self    The followup to Self&apos;s widely admired (and Booker-shortlisted) modernist novel Umbrella features an actual incident from the second world war, when the ship that had delivered the Hiroshima bomb materials to the South Pacific was sunk\u00a0by a Japanese submarine. Nine hundred men died, including 200 victims of the worst shark attack (on humans) ever recorded. Given the cult success of Syfy&apos;s films Sharknado and Sharknado 2, Self appears to have his finger on culture&apos;s squalene pulse. Meanwhile, in the 1970s, a resident at\u00a0a\u00a0therapeutic home in north London\u00a0begins to recount visions of struggling in a shark-infested ocean. His psychiatrist \u2013\u00a0Zack Busner, who has\u00a0previously appeared in Umbrella and\u00a0The Book of Dave \u2013\u00a0must decide whether there is some truth behind his\u00a0patient&apos;s tales, or whether, so to speak, this whole imbroglio is epiphenomenal. OCTOBER The Book of Strange New Things by Michel Faber (Canongate)     Michel Faber    In Michel Faber&apos;s 2000 novel Under the Skin, now an enigmatic film, an alien comes to Earth with a mission. Faber&apos;s new novel \u2013 his first major work since the neo-Dickensian epic The Crimson Petal and the White \u2013 reverses the scenario. Evangelical Christian Peter leaves a world collapsing into environmental chaos to take the word of the Lord to a\u00a0distant planet, Oasis \u2013 and, unnervingly, the inhabitants are desperate to receive it. &quot;The book of strange new things&quot; is the Oasans&apos; title for the Bible, which Peter sets out to translate into words their alien physiognomy can cope with. As he toils to connect with them across an immeasurable gulf, he becomes increasingly estranged from his wife and his own planet, millions of miles away. Faber conjures the strangeness of an alien planet and the fervour of faith and doubt in a stunningly singular\u00a0book. Lila by Marilynne Robinson (Virago)     Lila by Marilynne Robinson    After a long absence from writing fiction \u2013 her first novel, Housekeeping, was published in 1981 \u2013 Robinson returned in 2005 with the Pulitzer prizewinning Gilead, followed in 2009 by Home, which won the Orange prize; both set in the small Iowa town of Gilead. Lila returns us there, its eponymous protagonist a young woman with an exceptionally troubled past who becomes the wife of the elderly Reverend John Ames, already well known to Robinson&apos;s readers. As in the previous books, Robinson&apos;s interest in Calvinism \u2013 she described John Calvin recently as a humanist, &quot;terrifically admiring of what the human mind does&quot; \u2013 runs through the narrative, underpinning and illuminating the characters&apos; moral dilemmas and choices. In Lila and Doll, the drifter who rescued her from childhood abandonment, Robinson creates a\u00a0duo driven by the need to survive in a precarious and unpredictable environment, which lies in stark contrast to the more stable married life\u00a0that Lila later finds; her struggle to reconcile the\u00a0two halves of her experience is what powers this intriguing novel. Nora Webster by Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn (Viking)     Nora Webster by Colm Toibin    Colm T\u00f3ib\u00edn&apos;s 2009 novel Brooklyn was a\u00a0masterful study of the mass emigrations that radically altered 1950s Ireland, as told through the story of Eilis Lacey, who travels from a small town on the country&apos;s southeastern edge to New York in search of work. Eilis recurs by mention in the opening chapter of Nora Webster, as her mother tells Nora how much she misses her daughter, now married and part of the vast Irish diaspora. For Nora, newly and prematurely widowed and with four children to look after, there is little prospect of such a transformation in her circumstances; her challenge is to make a new life under the watchful eyes of her friends, family and neighbours. Slowly, her horizons begin\u00a0to broaden \u2013 and there are glimpses too of wider changes in Irish\u00a0society. This patch of Ireland \u2013 bounded by the Wexford county lines,\u00a0with the metropolises of Kilkenny and Dublin in the distance \u2013 is\u00a0T\u00f3ib\u00edn&apos;s own, and you can feel his careful familiarity in every line, in the speech patterns and social habits of his characters, and in the half-nurturing, half-oppressive atmosphere he brings to life. Nora&apos;s story, though, remains as\u00a0much her own as Eilis&apos;s was hers, and they represent a formidable part of\u00a0T\u00f3ib\u00edn&apos;s varied and inventive body\u00a0of work. NOVEMBER Amnesia by Peter Carey (Faber)     Peter Carey    When a young woman\u00a0from the Melbourne suburbs releases a\u00a0computer virus into\u00a0the privatised Australian prison system, it not\u00a0only liberates hundreds of\u00a0asylum seekers in her own country but frees the inmates of 5,000 American jails as\u00a0well. Was it a\u00a0deliberate act of cyberwar, or an accident made possible\u00a0by a globalised jail-management system? Journalist Felix Moore is\u00a0soon on the case, tracking Gaby Bailleux&apos;s actions back to the battle of\u00a0Brisbane, a little-known incident in the\u00a0second world war, when Australian and US servicemen scrapped in the streets. Double Booker prizewinner Peter Carey draws on the troubled history of Australia&apos;s &quot;special relationship&quot; with the US to frame an\u00a0acutely topical story of cyberhackers and radicals. Let Me Be Frank With You by Richard Ford(Bloomsbury)     Let Me Be Frank With You by Richard Ford    Richard Ford had announced that he would not write any more about Frank Bascombe, protagonist of The Sportswriter and two further\u00a0novels, and possibly the most admired Everyman of late-20th-century US fiction. But some heroes are\u00a0too good to abandon for ever (as Conan Doyle and others found), and now Bascombe is back, to the probable pleasure of all who enjoy his chewy observational style. Though the novel&apos;s\u00a0title might seem to imply some\u00a0cringeworthy standup act, we are\u00a0assured that here Bascombe will confront the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy and embark upon an &quot;odyssey&quot;, if you will, through today&apos;s America. Ford himself has explained his change of heart, not very apologetically: &quot;I\u00a0always think that, when I&apos;m writing Frank Bascombe, I\u00a0have the\u00a0chance to write about the most important things I know, and that&apos;s always been irresistible.&quot; Only\u00a0a grouch would argue. The Peripheral by William Gibson (Viking)     The Peripheral by William Gibson    It&apos;s four years since we&apos;ve had a novel from the prescient pen\u00a0of Neuromancer author William Gibson, whose recent work has concentrated on branding, technology and political conspiracies. This is his first novel to\u00a0extend into the far future, with an American woman in 2020 witnessing a\u00a0murder within a video game and a\u00a0boy killed remotely on the London streets a century later. As ever, his\u00a0futuristic subjects \u2013 &quot;drones, outsourcing and kleptocracy&quot; \u2013 are\u00a0pressing concerns today. Funny Girl by Nick Hornby (Viking)     Funny Girl by Nick Hornby    In between writing the\u00a0script for the film\u00a0adaptation of T\u00f3ib\u00edn&apos;s Brooklyn, due\u00a0to be released next year, Hornby has\u00a0been hard at work\u00a0on his first novel since 2009&apos;s Juliet, Naked. That novel told the story of a musician&apos;s mysterious disappearance from public view through the prism of obsessive fandom, and this new book looks set to\u00a0take another look at the world of showbusiness and celebrity.

Boris already has an ambitious &quot;Smart London&quot; plan. Now he has to deliver all those commitments, including affordable ultrafast broadband.

That could be anything from Santander&apos;s air-quality monitors or Boston&apos;s Citizens Connect app for reporting local problems such as graffiti or damaged signs. Esther Rantzen, CBE Founder of ChildLine and The Silver Line Adopt the New York City Bench scheme , and allow 1,000 Londoners a year to choose where to place a bench paid for by the GLA and by donations. I know it works. As I wander around Hampstead Heath I always read the names carved on the backs of the benches. It may be narcissistic of me, but I would love future generations to pause as they stroll along the banks of the Thames and relax on a bench which is named after me. I hope they will be joined on the bench by other Londoners and maybe make new friends. It&apos;s one way to combat the loneliness that abounds in our overcrowded city. Satish Kumar Editor-in-chief of Resurgence &amp; Ecologist magazine Installing solar panels on every Londoner&apos;s roof, and improving home insulation, could trim 20% off our soaring domestic fuel bills, cut pollution and carbon emissions, and help boost the capital&apos;s environmental reputation, as well as that of the mayor&apos;s. Britain is facing an energy crisis which burning expensive imported gas or proposing cripplingly expensive \u2013 and politically divisive \u2013 nuclear power stations won&apos;t solve. Now that a majority of the world&apos;s population lives in cities, our capital should be leading the way in sustainable, decentralised ways of living. And while you&apos;re up there, Boris, how about some schemes to encourage rooftop gardening? We should be growing more of our own food, too. Rowan Moore Architecture critic When elected, Johnson promised he would reverse Ken Livingstone&apos;s fondness for permitting tall buildings, that he would not allow a &quot;Dubai on Thames&quot;. On this he has executed a perfect U-turn, except that it is an insult to Dubai to compare it to the mediocrity of the 200-plus towers now in the pipeline in London. His excuse is that London faces a severe housing shortage. But there is no evidence that flats in residential skyscrapers are the answer to the city&apos;s needs. In his remaining time he can enforce existing policies on the quality and location of towers more seriously. He can review London&apos;s ramshackle apparatus of planning provisions on height, with a view to their reform. He can create a digital model of the city so that Londoners can see what is proposed for it. He can appoint a commission of people who know about urban design to help him with all of the above. David Robinson Founder of Change London Create 1,000 weekend play streets and show a mayoral determination to make London the greatest city in the world to bring up a child. Astonishingly, roads make up 80% of our public space in London and we have surrendered them almost entirely to the car. Busy streets mean fewer chats over the wall, fewer impromptu gatherings and fewer children playing out and drawing adults in. It is no coincidence that cul-de-sacs sustain the highest levels of social cohesion vital to health and happiness. At 30 streets per borough, a target of 1,000 play streets is eminently achievable, as the trailblazers in Bristol and Hackney have shown. Samantha Heath Chief executive,  London Sustainability Exchange Tackle London&apos;s air pollution problem. An estimated 4,000 Londoners every year die prematurely from causes related to air pollution, which contributes to myriad health problems, including strokes, heart and lung diseases. Children are particularly at risk because of their smaller lung capacity. In parts of London air pollution can be up to four times higher than the EU limit in areas such as bus stops, built-up areas, under bridges and where traffic is often at a standstill. Meanwhile, the EU has launched legal action against both France and the UK on account of its dangerously poor air quality. London&apos;s mayor, via cleaning up taxis and buses, strengthening planning regulation and logistics centres to aid zero-emission deliveries, could help to give London much cleaner air over the next 12 months. Alison Garnham, chief executive,  Child Poverty Action Group London has the highest rate of child poverty in the UK, with almost four in 10 children in the capital living in poverty. This is partly because the city&apos;s job market is not working for mothers. Employment rates for women with children in London are 12 percentage points lower than the national average. Boris Johnson has huge influence with employers , who could be encouraged or incentivised to offer high-quality part-time or flexible jobs. He could make it easier for parents to access and afford childcare, including a pan-London information service, and help with the upfront costs and deposits. Will King Founder of King of Shaves Heathrow was in the right place, at the right time. Having flown into many airports around the world, what strikes me is how &quot;small&quot; Heathrow is, compared with the airports in, for instance, Shanghai or Hong Kong. And right now small does not attract big. Britain is great at carrying out innovative strategic infrastructure projects \u2013 Eurotunnel, for example. So why don&apos;t we build the coolest airport in the world, in the coolest city in the world, in a part of Greater London which isn&apos;t &quot;way out&quot; \u2013 as is the case with Stansted or Gatwick? Philip Colligan Executive director, Innovation Lab Nesta Offer prizes for innovation to help entrepreneurs create products and services that could be sold to cities around the world. Boris should also use the GLA&apos;s huge estate and land holdings to provide more of the flexible, low-cost space that start-up businesses need, alongside supporting the accelerator programmes that help them flourish. Duwayne Brooks Director of Active Community Engagement and Development Trust in the Met in some boroughs is at an all time low. Building on the work of the Stephen Lawrence Charitable Trust, Boris should promote local road shows with senior officers and publish regular figures on local incidents, arrests and numbers charged. I want Boris to publicly reward the great and good at the Met, to champion how this wonderful city is policed 24 hours a day, to remind the public there is no them and us.\u2022This article was amended on 11 August 2014 to correct the name of the London Sustainability Exchange.", "title": "Boris, here are 10 things you can do for London in the next year", "sentences": ["Rowan Moore Architecture critic When elected, Johnson promised he would reverse Ken Livingstone&apos;s fondness for permitting tall buildings, that he would not allow a &quot;Dubai on Thames&quot;.", "On this he has executed a perfect U-turn, except that it is an insult to Dubai to compare it to the mediocrity of the 200-plus towers now in the pipeline in London."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-09T23:05:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2014/aug/10/joseph-oneill-something-big-happens-post-9-11-novels", "tags": ["Fiction", "Books", "Culture"], "article": "Joseph O&apos;Neill is a writer of Irish-Turkish descent, born in 1964, who grew up in the Netherlands, worked for several years as a barrister in London and now lives in New York. He has written three previous novels and a family memoir. His last novel, the critically acclaimed Netherland, about cricket in New York, was praised by Barack Obama. O&apos;Neill&apos;s new novel, The Dog (Fourth Estate \u00a316.99), is about an American lawyer who, following a break-up, moves to Dubai to manage the wealth of a rich Lebanese family. It has been longlisted for the Man Booker prize.  Why did you decide to set your new novel in Dubai? I think it&apos;s my ongoing connection to England. Around 2007, every time I was talking to English people, they all seemed to be commercially orientated towards Dubai. It&apos;s on the European map in a way it isn&apos;t for Americans. And Dubai is a kind of California. It&apos;s the future for the so-called sophisticated west. We&apos;re all headed to Dubai, not just culturally but on matters such as labour organisation and the hollowing-out of the nation\u00a0state. How much research did you do? I took two trips out there of just over a week, to meet people and get some stuff I couldn&apos;t get online. Netherland was often described as a post-9/11 novel. The new book, which opens in 2007, is obliquely about the financial crisis. How conscious are you of being a writer who tackles big\u00a0events? I don&apos;t sit around waiting for these things to occur. It&apos;s not my fault if every time I sit down to write, something big happens! But I suppose I am more interested in global events than in what&apos;s happening, say, in Galway or Pittsburgh. It&apos;s my background. I don&apos;t have home turf, so I have no choice but to float around on these post-national currents. Your fiction often focuses on corporate elites. Do you feel a pressure to write about the other end of the social\u00a0spectrum? I think it&apos;s naive to say that a book which describes the situation of rich people must be a book which celebrates that situation, or that there&apos;s a path of novelistic virtue in describing what happens to the poor. My experience is that the more privileged the reader in question, the more readily they demand that people write about stuff that doesn&apos;t resemble their lives. The Dog&apos;s language is interesting. There are lengthy passages of legal/philosophical argument, in which the narrator justifies his behaviour. Then there&apos;s quite a bit of satire of Dubai-style capitalism and of social media. Why this particular collision? There&apos;s a way in which the discourse of the Enlightenment, of reason, is coming under enormous stress from technology and consumerism and the strains of self-righteousness unleashed by social media. Nowadays, if you say anything that is clearly true but upsets people, it starts to lose validity. You see this in US politics very clearly. There&apos;s a comedy in the way the narrator tries to use arguments that no longer have much value. He&apos;s tilting at windmills with his powers of reason. With Netherland, you suddenly went from being an unheralded writer to being well known. How did that affect you?Unheralded is putting it mildly. Family and paid readers came into contact with my work and no one else! But yes, the success of Netherland had a huge impact on my life because it enabled me to carry on being published. I don&apos;t know what would have happened if I hadn&apos;t found some readers. What&apos;s your writing routine? I don&apos;t have a routine. I&apos;ve got too much going on in terms of getting through life. What I do is go away for two weeks at a time about twice a year, and I do most of my writing there. This book is 60,000 words and took five years. I have no urge to write journalism; I write so slowly it makes no sense. In fact, I just wrote something for a magazine which was about 1,000 words and it took a month. And it wasn&apos;t even that good! Obama famously endorsed Netherland. Have you read his books?   I think I pretended to have read one of them at some point, but no I haven&apos;t. I felt uncomfortable with the whole Obama thing. I&apos;m sure it sold books, which I&apos;ll take. But he&apos;s now been in office for six years and they&apos;re still force-feeding people in Guant\u00e1namo Bay. So it&apos;s kind of problematic to have that name on your jacket.

McIlroy provided a superb tribute both to camera and in print towards Bill Clinton. The former president of the United States was handed a Distinguished Service award by the PGA of America, with McIlroy leading the plaudits with words of genuine warmth. Clinton\u2019s influential role in the Northern Ireland peace process, McIlroy insisted, was pivotal to the golfer\u2019s generation being able to fulfil their life objectives in peace. The boyish, bashful side of McIlroy appeared when he was informed that Jack Nicklaus had offered some weighty praise in his direction. McIlroy, Nicklaus has claimed, can win \u201c15 or 20\u201d major championships. Sunday\u2019s success at Valhalla means McIlroy is already a fifth of the way towards the latter number. As McIlroy well knows, we live in an age of constant comparison; as difficult as that is in the case of separate golfing generations. There was rising talk about where McIlroy\u2019s career will take him in the context of the greatest golfers in history before he won a second US PGA title. Since 1934, only Nicklaus and Tiger Woods had won their fourth major before the age of 26; until McIlroy reclaimed the Wanamaker Trophy in Kentucky. If he claims the Masters in April, McIlroy will hold three majors at the same time. \u201cI thought winning the Open Championship a few weeks ago had sort of put me on a higher level in this game,\u201d McIlroy explains. \u201cBut then to win a fourth, to be one behind Phil [Mickelson], one behind Seve Ballesteros, level with Ernie Els, level with Raymond Floyd \u2026 I mean, I never thought I\u2019d get this far at 25 years of age.\u201d Not that McIlroy is planning to stop here. Far from it; he has lofty and legitimate aspirations in respect of his home continent. \u201cI think I\u2019ve got to take it one small step at a time,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI think the two next realistic goals are the career [majors] grand slam and trying to become the most successful European player ever. \u201cNick Faldo, most successful European ever in the modern era, has six majors. Seve has five. Obviously with the career grand slam coming up at Augusta in eight months\u2019 time, they are the next goals. \u201cAnd hopefully, when I achieve those, I can start to think about other things. But right now, that\u2019s what my focus is. My focus is trying to complete this grand slam and then move forward and try and become the most successful European ever, and hopefully in time \u2013 if I can do that \u2013 then I can move on and set different goals. \u201cI\u2019ve got that sense of belief in myself now that I go into every tournament I play knowing that I can win. It\u2019s a great feeling to have.\u201d McIlroy is better placed to hunt down Nicklaus\u2019s majors record of 18 than a diminished Woods is, regardless of the current gap between their totals. More intriguing is the potential impact McIlroy could have on a sport which is crying out for an icon because of Woods\u2019s inevitable, if sad, demise. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to compare players,\u201d says Henrik Stenson, who tied third at Valhalla. \u201cIf he\u2019s not the same [as Woods], he\u2019s not far behind. He\u2019s got every opportunity to move on from here. \u201cIf I told you that if he were to win at least one major in the next five or seven years every year, you wouldn\u2019t be surprised, would you? He\u2019s got the opportunity to do that. It\u2019s up to him and how hard we can try to make it not happen.\u201d McIlroy is entitled to cherish his latest triumph for one reason alone; it was different. By his own admission, he was \u201cflat\u201d during the early stages of his US PGA fourth round. The 25-year-old\u2019s previous three successes on the big stage had been delivered as processions. This time he hung in, dug deep and battled back just when others had been offered glimmers of hope. There is clearly a part of McIlroy that relishes proving people wrong; this time, those who dared suggest he couldn\u2019t come out on top in scraps.     Rory McIlroy poses with the Wanamaker Trophy in fading light after winning the 2014 US PGA Championship. Photograph: Thomas J Russo/USA Today Sports    \u201cTo win it in this fashion and this style, it means a lot,\u201d McIlroy explains. \u201cIt means that I know that I can do it. I know that I can come from behind. I know that I can mix it up with the best players in the world down the stretch in a major and come out on top. \u201cPhil Mickelson is the second best player in this generation so to be able to beat him on the back nine on a Sunday \u2026 it\u2019s great to have in the memory bank and great to have in the locker going forward.\u201d Mickelson summed up McIlroy\u2019s status in the game simply. \u201cHe is better than everyone else,\u201d said the 2013 Open champion. McIlroy\u2019s coach, Michael Bannon, is worthy of praise for his influence on what is obviously a wonderful golf swing. This year, there is also a flow and rhythm to McIlroy\u2019s putting stroke which matches other parts of his game. At Valhalla, the latest indicator that he is the complete sporting package arrived by virtue of the mental fortitude McIlroy displayed over Sunday\u2019s back nine. McIlroy doesn\u2019t intend to pick up a golf club during a week off which will begin in New York. Not that his competitive year is in any way over; the lucrative FedEx Cup series is next up, with the Ryder Cup and Race to Dubai to be settled before McIlroy rounds off what is already a massively successful year in Australia. Success has energised, rather than fatigued, the man from Holywood but he is wary of the demands placed on a global superstar, as he now very much is. \u201cIt makes you appreciate more what Tiger has done in the past by getting on these runs that he\u2019s gone on and keeping it going for months on end,\u201d McIlroy adds. \u201cI think that\u2019s why off-weeks are important. I think this week for me is going to be very important just to recharge the batteries and get ready for the big stretch of golf that we\u2019ve still got coming up.\u201d How McIlroy has earned that downtime. His fellow competitors won\u2019t be upset if he chooses to enjoy some more of it \u2013 McIlroy has proved himself as close to unstoppable.", "title": "Rory McIlroy\u2019s US PGA win sets him up for career among the greats | Ewan Murray", "sentences": ["Not that his competitive year is in any way over; the lucrative FedEx Cup series is next up, with the Ryder Cup and Race to Dubai to be settled before McIlroy rounds off what is already a massively successful year in Australia."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-11T09:28:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/aug/11/pakistan-spinner-saeed-ajmal-reported-icc-illegal-bowling-action", "tags": ["Pakistan cricket team", "Sri Lanka cricket team", "International Cricket Council", "Cricket", "Sport"], "article": "Saeed Ajmal, the Pakistan spinner who destroyed England in 2012 and has long been rated one of the best bowlers in the world, has been reported for a suspected illegal bowling action for the second time in his career. Ajmal was reported during Pakistan\u2019s defeat by Sri Lanka in the first Test in Galle, where two of the match officials were English \u2013 Ian Gould, who was one of the on-field umpires, and Richard Illingworth, who was the third umpire. Gould was one of the umpires when Sri Lanka\u2019s Sachithra Senanayake was reported for a suspected illegal action during the one-day series against England in May. He was subsequently found guilty by testing, and is now in Perth attempting to remedy his action. But the reporting of Ajmal is an even bigger deal. The 36-year-old is rated eighth in the official world Test bowling rankings, and the second best spinner behind Sri Lanka\u2019s Rangana Herath. He has taken 174 wickets in 34 Tests, and would also be a key member of Pakistan\u2019s one-day team in the World Cup in Australia and New Zealand early next year. He has also been a popular overseas player for Worcestershire, and England\u2019s new spinning sensation Moeen Ali credits him with a key role in helping him develop a doosra. Ajmal was previously reported in 2009 after two ODIs against Australia in Dubai, but his action was passed as legal after extensive testing. The International Cricket Council issued a statement on Monday saying: \u201cThe match officials\u2019 report, which was handed over to Pakistan team manager Moin Khan on Sunday, cited concerns over a number of deliveries that were considered to be suspect and concluded that the bowler\u2019s action needed to be tested. Ajmal\u2019s bowling action will now be scrutinised further under the ICC process relating to suspected illegal bowling actions reported in Tests, ODIs and T20Is. He is required to undergo testing within 21 days.\u201d He will be allowed to continue playing during that period, with the second Test starting in Colombo on Thursday. Ajmal\u2019s action has caused controversy before, notably during that series against England in the United Arab Emirates when Bob Willis, the former England captain who was working for Sky, publicly questioned why he bowled in a long-sleeve shirt. \u201cNow why do all these bowlers bowl with their sleeves buttoned round their wrist?\u201d Willis said. \u201cWhy aren\u2019t they wearing short-sleeved shirts? Why aren\u2019t they wearing vests like Australian rules football? We can see their arms. The answer is clear isn\u2019t it, they are bending their elbow.\u201d Ajmal shrugged off the criticism. Speaking through a translator, he said: \u201cI am just concentrating on my bowling and it is basically up to the umpires and referees to say if there is a problem with my action. \u201cIt\u2019s no problem. Such questions were raised against Saqlain Mushtaq as well and he played county cricket for years with no problem about his action.\u201d", "title": "Pakistan spinner Saeed Ajmal reported to ICC for illegal bowling action", "sentences": ["Ajmal was previously reported in 2009 after two ODIs against Australia in Dubai, but his action was passed as legal after extensive testing."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-11T10:11:01Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/aug/11/live-racing-11-august-2014", "tags": ["Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Today\u2019s best bets, by Greg Wood The return of Fergal Lynch to a British racecourse at Ayr will be the principal focus of attention this afternoon, but the debut of the new Tapeta surface at Wolverhampton will be of significant interest to punters too. Wolverhampton decided to move onto Tapeta at almost the same moment that Meydan, the world\u2019s largest racecourse, decide to replace its Tapeta with dirt. By the time it was abandoned in Dubai, it had turned from its original mid-brown colour to black, apparently as a result of modifications to try to stave off the effects of the desert heat, but in its early days it was widely praised by jockeys and trainers alike. The Midlands climate should suit Tapeta rather better and, while many punters may take a watching brief this afternoon, the newly laid surface should produce good, competitive racing from the start. If you do have a bet, though, it will not hurt to have a jockey with Tapeta experience on your side and Free Entry (3.15) is the banker on the card with Kieren Fallon aboard. At Ayr, Jay Kay (3.30) may frustrate Lynch\u2019s attempt to return with a winner, while Saxonette (5.00) should finally get her head in front after several recent near-misses.

Watched by a modest crowd of around 1,500, Lynch steered Mr Bounty, owned by his father Charlie, into fourth place in a seven-furlong handicap, and though his mount was the subject of substantial \u2013 and misplaced \u2013 late support, Lynch went about his business in an atmosphere of widespread indifference. It was on a similar, humdrum weekday afternoon in August 2004 that Lynch ensured his place in racing infamy when he finished second in a handicap at Ripon on a horse called Bond City, a well-backed 9-2 chance. His ride attracted little attention at the time but it later emerged that Lynch had deliberately lost a race he should have won, having been asked to do so by Miles Rodgers, a gambler who had laid Bond City to lose on Betfair. Lynch, Rodgers and four other men, including the former champion jockey Kieren Fallon, went on trial at the Old Bailey in October 2007 accused of race-fixing, with Lynch\u2019s ride on Bond City a key part of the case against him. Lynch pleaded not guilty and the case against the five collapsed two months later, but the jockey later admitted to the British Horseracing Authority that he had indeed \u201cstopped\u201d Bond City. In recent years riders have been banned worldwide for 10 years or more for the same offence, but under the more generous regime in place at the time, Lynch agreed a plea bargain with the regulator, paid a \u00a350,000 fine and escaped with no formal riding ban at all. Since his admission, he has ridden in the United States, Dubai and his native Ireland, but until a sudden about-turn last week, the BHA had declined to allow him back into Britain. In the view of most punters, deliberately stopping a horse is the worst offence that any jockey can commit, one for which there is no excuse and after which there should be no second chance. If or when Lynch appears at a major meeting \u2013 such as the upcoming Ebor Festival at York, where he has a possible ride in the Gimcrack Stakes \u2013 he may hear some forthright opinions of his character from the stands. His first day back in Britain, however, passed entirely without incident.

I\u2019ve done everything that was asked to make a comeback. \u201cI\u2019ve gone away and rebuilt my career, and I feel I should be given the opportunity. I\u2019m just trying to do my job. I made a mistake 10 years ago for which I\u2019m totally regretful and I just want to move forward. If I can help one young apprentice not make the same mistake that I did, then it will have been worthwhile.\u201d Lynch insisted that the sight of an admitted cheat being given a second chance would not give the wrong impression to younger riders. \u201cI think every apprentice in there realises how tough the last 10 years have been for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt hasn\u2019t been easy, having the police knocking on your door and paying a \u00a350,000 fine, and being shamed and losing your integrity. It\u2019s something I\u2019m going to have to work hard to get back, I\u2019m not just going to be given my integrity back. It\u2019s something I\u2019m going to have to live with for the rest of my life. \u201cEven when I do finish racing, no matter what I do now, the first quote that the papers and journalists are going to say is \u2018disgraced jockey Fergal Lynch\u2019.\u201d The rush of money for Mr Bounty before the off on Monday was such that he might have started favourite had the race been delayed for a couple of minutes. As it turned out, he stood no chance against the easy winner Jay Kay, but Lynch admits he will face criticism and potential abuse whenever he is narrowly beaten on a fancied horse. \u201cWith me it\u2019s going to be an issue, I\u2019m expecting that,\u201d Lynch said. \u201cI can\u2019t go out and ride any different.

Now Flying Lotus, real name Steven Ellison, has revealed the eclectic mix of collaborators featured on his new album via his Tumblr page - with each song imagined by Japanese manga artist Shintaro Kago. The site lists songs including Never Catch Me, featuring acclaimed rapper Kendrick Lamar and Dead Man\u2019s Tetris, with Snoop Dogg appearing alongside Flying Lotus\u2019 rap alias Captain Murphy.

We\u2019ve got some different stuff that he\u2019s doing,\u201d Hancock said. \u201cI suppose people would put him in the category of electronic music. But to just describe it that way really misses the mark, there are a lot of different influences on the music he\u2019s done, and some of it\u2019s been very modern classical, some R&amp;B, some maybe hip-hop, there\u2019s a jazz influence \u2013 it covers broad territories which is one of the reasons I\u2019m interested in working with him.\u201d It looks as if there may be more news of future Flying Lotus collaborators too, as there appears to be empty containers on his Tumblr page possibly reserved for more track information.

There could be no sneering after his success in the Group Three Sovereign Stakes here on Thursday as Captain Cat was clearly going best from half a mile out and he won in the style of horse who will find further improvement as he moves up the Pattern-race ladder. James Doyle, Captain Cat\u2019s jockey, had only Anjaal, who completely missed the break, behind him through the first half-mile, but then made ground on the leaders so smoothly that he briefly took a pull about two furlongs from home. Captain Cat then put the race beyond doubt with an immediate burst of speed when Doyle asked for an effort before coasting home two-and-a-half lengths clear of Producer. \u201cThat was really enjoyable to watch, to see him cruising down the outside,\u201d Roger Charlton, Captain Cat\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cHe almost got there too easily. \u201cI thought there might not be enough pace but there was and a furlong-and-a-half out he looked really impressive. If he recovers in time, he could run in the [Group Two] Celebration Mile [at Goodwood] on Saturday week, it depends whether it\u2019s too soon or not but it\u2019s the sort of race that might have five runners in. \u201cThere are targets for him during the winter but he\u2019s going to be rated 114 or 115 after that and you suddenly move up a gear and start looking at better races. We can afford to be a bit more ambitious as he\u2019s won a lot of prize money and sometimes horses like that run better in better races. \u201cSometimes you\u2019d play for a place in a better race, but the way he travelled there and did it, he\u2019s a lightly raced horse and goes on any surface.

Sleeper was ridden by Andrea Atzeni following Beckett\u2019s abrupt separation earlier this month from his stable jockey Jim Crowley, who decided to ride as a freeleance for the remainder of the season. Beckett said after Sleeper\u2019s success that he will take his time to find a replacement for Crowley and the trainer still seems surprised to have a vacancy at all. \u201cIt\u2019s a very good question and not one I\u2019m in a position to answer,\u201d Beckett said. \u201cSimply because I don\u2019t know the answer, I don\u2019t really know why he left and I don\u2019t really know what I\u2019m going to do about it as yet. \u201cThe good thing about it is that it gives me time to work out who is going to suit me. We don\u2019t have two or three big owners with retaining jockeys, so we\u2019ll have to work something out. \u201cIt will work out, because these things always do, I\u2019ve just got a bit more on my plate than I originally bargained for.

So we&apos;re thinking that we&apos;ll choose just three countries to live in.&quot; Cantwell isn&apos;t a trustafarian or a lottery winner, she works for a living. Her business, Free Range Humans, is about helping other people to become &quot;location independent&quot;, so they can live and work just about anywhere. It may be a secret dream for lots of us \u2013 or not so secret, perhaps, after a holiday in an idyllic location, but how realistic is it? Are Cantwell and her tribe of nomadic workers the lucky ones, or is this an indication of what work will look like for more of us in the future? Statistics indicate it might be. One study of more than 45,000 UK businesses revealed a 68% rise in the number who had employed remote workers in the last 12 months. &quot;Ask anyone where they go when they really need to get something done and they almost never say the office,&quot; says Jason Fried, co-author of Remote: Office Not Required. He is CEO of Basecamp, a company that operates a remote working policy for its 45 or so employees, because he believes in hiring the right talent, wherever they are in the world. His view is that remote working is not about providing a perk for employees, it&apos;s about increasing productivity. The reality may be that not many of us make it to the beaches of Ko Tao or Canc\u00fan to run our global empire, but we will, Fried believes, spend at least a couple of days in every week working from home, or even at the coffee shop round the corner. But perhaps that&apos;s as much freedom as some of us can cope with. &quot;It&apos;s the weirdest thing, to be able to be anywhere, and I don&apos;t think anything can prepare you for that feeling,&quot; Cantwell says. &quot;The world is pretty big.&quot; Phuket, Thailand     Lea Woodward: 'It can be a lonely life, particularly if you\u2019re introverts, like we are, but having kids makes it\u00a0easier, as you get plugged into the community.' Photograph: Luke Duggleby for the Guardian    Lea Woodward is the founder of the Trivas Foundation, an online business school, and co-founder of an illustrators&apos; resource with her husband, Jonathan. They have two children.  I grew up travelling. My parents divorced when I was young and we moved to the UK with my mother. From the age of five I would fly unaccompanied with my brother to Hong Kong to see my father. When Jonathan and I took the decision to go freelance, it made sense to try living somewhere else in the world, so we could maintain our standard of living while the businesses grew. I was already doing a lot of work with clients over the phone, and Jonathan was used to working remotely, so we set ourselves a target number of clients to secure before we set off, which took about six months. I literally Googled things like &quot;great quality of life, low cost living&quot;. At that time, the place that kept being mentioned was Panama, so we rented out the house and booked our tickets. I don&apos;t think we even knew they spoke Spanish. We stayed for a couple of months but decided it wasn&apos;t for us, so from there we went to Buenos Aires, then Toronto, Grenada, South Africa, Turkey. We always aimed to stay for around three months, but it was often less. It wasn&apos;t the best planned itinerary. We were in Cape Town when we found out I was pregnant; we decided it would be more practical to come back to the UK. Then when Mali was four months old we took her to Dubai. Now, we also have Samson, who&apos;s one, and this has been his first big trip. We plan to home educate them. The ideal is to have two or three places in the world that we shuttle round every year. I do the lion&apos;s share of earning while Jonathan has more responsibility for the kids. Unless there&apos;s something urgent, we spend the afternoons together as a family. It can be a lonely life, particularly if you&apos;re introverts, like we are, but having kids makes it\u00a0easier, as you get plugged into the community. If Mali said she wanted to stay put then we&apos;d try it, but for now she loves moving around. Dordogne     Abbie Greene: 'The important thing is that the company know they can get hold of me whenever they want me.' Photograph: Laura Stevens for the Guardian    Abbie Greene is co-director of French publishing company, Com&apos;Presse. She lives in the Dordogne with her\u00a0husband, Nick, and their three\u00a0children. We aren&apos;t great risk-takers. We knew, having lived in Paris for years, that we wanted to live in the country but it was a question of how to make money. You see English people who have come down here without knowing how they&apos;ll make a living and that terrifies me. I&apos;d become good friends with the editorial director at my old company so when she set up this new agency, I went with her; that was 15 years ago. I am the only one who isn&apos;t French. Once every two months or so, we meet up for a board meeting in a restaurant and go through everything over lunch. I go to Paris every fortnight or so for a day of client meetings. Nick is a teacher and works in Paris three days a\u00a0week, but he gets nice long holidays. My days are a seamless mix of work and home. I&apos;ll go for a run, have a good breakfast. I have a desk in the living room, and the family know not to interrupt. Quite often I&apos;ll be cooking something at the same time I&apos;m working or in the summer I might take the kids to the river for a swim. The important thing is that the company know they can get hold of me whenever they want me. I\u00a0only bill them for the time I&apos;ve worked, so I never have to feel guilty about doing other things. There are a few downsides, but they are piddling. Sometimes, we stop and look around at everything we have and it can still make us laugh out loud. Mexico     Giacomo Conti: 'I realised I could do my job here \u2013 or pretty much anywhere.' Photograph: Adam Wiseman for the Guardian    Giacomo Conti owns DJ management company Clandestine Artists. He is based in Todos Santos. I&apos;ve been living out of my suitcase for two years. When I left the agency I was working for in New York to start out on my own, I moved to Berlin because that&apos;s where a lot of\u00a0my artists were based. Then, while I was in Mexico with my girlfriend, we split up. She went back to Berlin, but the winter was coming so I decided to stay here with a friend. I realised that, actually, I could do my job here \u2013 or pretty much anywhere. I stayed for the season then went back to Europe for the summer, then I went to Brazil, then back to Mexico, then to Indonesia. Where I end up depends on all kinds of things. I might need to show up at a festival for work, or I\u00a0might head somewhere for the surf, or to see friends. Right now, I&apos;m hoping to get a\u00a0short let on the place I&apos;m in. I\u00a0have\u00a0two new employees, one from\u00a0Barcelona, one in LA, and they are both relocating here. They&apos;re pretty willing to do it, and are very excited to be able to work from such a place. Last year, one of my employees brought her boyfriend and twin brother with her, and they\u00a0loved it. I put in my face time by touring with my artists, heading to most of\u00a0the festivals, and spend a long time away from home, working. Most of my artists work around the world every weekend, so we all congregate a few times a year around major festivals like BPM (Mexico), ADE (Amsterdam), WMC (Miami), or Ibiza in the summer. Then I come back home to put in all\u00a0the office hours, and balance life on the road with a much healthier way of living. When I&apos;m here I get a lot more done. I&apos;m not partying all the time. A lot of my friends are globetrotters so if I don&apos;t see them when I&apos;m travelling, they&apos;ll come and see me. I don&apos;t get lonely. My\u00a0house was full for the whole of\u00a0February. Working this way is very personal, you learn a lot about yourself, and what you really need. Living in a way that&apos;s a bit more secluded, more thoughtful, has made me feel more at peace, a lot more productive, and, I guess, a better person. Ibiza     Julian Pittam: 'I\u2019ve got an office that\u2019s away from the house, but in summer, without wishing to sound smug, I find myself by the pool with the laptop.' Photograph: Arno Lippert for the Guardian    Julian Pittam is commercial director for Disciple Media, a subscription service for music fans. He\u00a0lives in Ibiza with his wife, Ali, and their son.  It was Ali who said, &quot;Come on, if we don&apos;t do this now, we&apos;ll regret it.&quot; We&apos;d had a holiday house here, we could see that the international school would be a great fit for our son Rufus, and our daughter Tallulah was settled in her boarding school, so the timing felt right. I had been a partner in a financial research firm for about 20 years. Then the company was sold and all of a sudden, that just stopped. It gave me the opportunity to think about what I really wanted to do, but it was also quite a tricky adjustment. When a friend came to me with his idea for Disciple Media, I helped him raise money to get it off the ground and stayed on to run the commercial side. There are seven of us now, soon to be 12, so it&apos;s going well. I&apos;m in London for seven or eight days a month then follow up on everything else from here. I&apos;ve got an office that&apos;s away from the house, but in summer, without wishing to sound smug, I find myself by the pool with the laptop. The reality, though, is that you have to be disciplined. We&apos;re supposed to be going home in six months, but that&apos;s going to be an incredibly difficult sell for the rest of the family. I really don&apos;t want to spend most of my time in the UK any more. Biarritz     Mhairi Hughes: 'We have an office in Scotland.

This is a family business: my parents, who are based in Scotland, set it up, then I joined in 2007. Before that, I worked in London in recruitment. Our community manager is also here but we have an office in Scotland. When we&apos;re at our desks we&apos;re in constant contact through instant messaging and Skype, it&apos;s like we&apos;re sitting across from each other in an office. Usually, I go for a run with my dog or a surf before breakfast, and am at my desk by 9am. I&apos;ve converted a shed in the garden. If the surf&apos;s good, I&apos;ll go out in the afternoon then work till 6pm or 7pm. If one of us is going to do that, we always let the others know; we&apos;re friends so we don&apos;t leave each other in the lurch. I met my partner here and he runs his own business, so we both understand what it&apos;s like to work unconventional hours. This feels like home now. My dad was in the military so I grew up on the move. There was always a subconscious clock, I think, wanting to know &quot;when&apos;s the next adventure?&quot; but since I&apos;ve been here, I haven&apos;t felt that at all.

She and her partner Paul spend half the year in London, and their winters in different locations. They run the volunteering website globalhelpswap.com. We started travelling four years ago. Paul and I had been saving for a deposit on a house, but we had always dreamed of travelling and I was very unhappy in my job at the time, so one day we asked ourselves the question, &quot;Do we buy a house or go and see the world?&quot; Travelling won.  We didn&apos;t really work in that first year, but we spent a lot of time planting the seeds for the businesses we now run. We live in London for six or seven months of the year, then spend winters travelling. This year, we were going to go to Costa Rica but after talking to some of our other blogging friends we thought we&apos;d give Mexico a try. The town we&apos;re in now is called San Franciso but known locally as San Pancho. It&apos;s not much more than one road and a really, really beautiful beach. Wherever we are, we try to create a routine for work. We usually walk to the beach every morning and meditate, then I&apos;ll spend the time until lunch either in a coaching session or writing my coaching courses. I do all of my coaching virtually, either online or via Skype, even when I&apos;m in London, so it isn&apos;t a big adjustment for the people I&apos;m working with. I&apos;m currently coaching people in Argentina, the UK and India, and it can be a bit tricky dealing with all the different time zones; I&apos;m about to hire an assistant to help me out. We break for lunch around 1pm, and then the afternoons are ours. A couple of afternoons a week we volunteer at Entre Amigos, a local community centre for children. We love to volunteer wherever we go as it&apos;s a great way to give back to the community and form friendships. The highlight of the day is sunset.

And\u00a0it had \u2013 notably \u2013 taken him some time to get to. He was in his mid-40s when it came out in 2008, and it was already his third novel. On the surface, it looked such a straightforward book. It was narrated by a kind of millennial everyman, a Dutch-born Wall Street banker called Hans van den Broek, who was going through the death throes of his marriage in the months after 9/11, and who then learned of the mysterious death of a Trinidadian friend, Chuck Ramkissoon, with whom he had played cricket in New York. Out of seeming simplicity the novel fathomed magnificent depths. It was ineffable, moving and breezily quaffable in equal measure. As if he&apos;s been sniffing the air for where the zeitgeist might blow him to\u00a0next, O&apos;Neill has now shifted his themes of alienation and rootlessness from post-9/11 Manhattan to their most obvious contemporary setting: Dubai. The Dog is narrated by an unnamed New York attorney who has fled the US for the glittering emirate, to\u00a0work as a legal-financial factotum for the immensely wealthy Lebanese family of an old college friend, Eddie Batros. Like Netherland&apos;s van den Broek, O&apos;Neill&apos;s new narrator has a semi-exotic background (he was brought up by a French-speaking Swiss mother). He is also getting over a broken relationship. And in Dubai he is \u2013 just like Van den Broek in New York \u2013 a lonely fish out of\u00a0water. In fact, you quickly realise as you read this novel, O&apos;Neill has transplanted almost every element of Netherland to his new Middle Eastern setting. He even brings along, virtually intact, a subplot involving the mysterious disappearance of a friend of the narrator: in this case Ted Wilson, with whom our hero bonded over a shared love of \u2013 not cricket this time \u2013 scuba diving. Despite the resemblances, O&apos;Neill has clearly set out in The Dog to broaden his vision of the lost and lonely in Netherland to a much grander scale: to\u00a0the new elite of international, plane-hopping white-collar brains servicing the planet&apos;s affluent. The novel&apos;s themes are at once more expansive than Netherland&apos;s and more obvious. Servitude, as the title telegraphs, is the book&apos;s linchpin. The narrator is a self-described modern-day &quot;majordomo&quot; to the Batroses \u2013 a\u00a0clan of idle super-rich who fondly call\u00a0their family private jet &quot;l&apos;autobus&quot; and who occasionally pull up their superyacht to get their Italian deckhands to swim ashore and slaughter the nearest goat for supper. With his own manservant, Ali, at his\u00a0beck and call, the narrator suffers gruelling, comic humiliation at the hands of his masters. &quot;Let me explain something to\u00a0you,&quot; Batros senior tells him. &quot;You have one function. You know what this function is? It is to make sure nobody steals [from us]. This is your function.&quot; In reality, his functions for the\u00a0Batroses are many and ridiculous. His chores range from babysitting the family&apos;s obese, fantastically ignorant teenage scion Alain to booking Bryan\u00a0Adams for a last-minute private\u00a0party. There&apos;s a lot of this sort of high comedy in The Dog, and it&apos;s an odd tone for O&apos;Neill to inhabit. For too many passages the narrator lets loose with a kind of wordy, baroque nerdiness \u2013 as he discusses, for instance, the rights and wrongs of his spending $500 a night on prostitutes \u2013 that seems designed to signal his detachment from the human heart, but that ends up reading like knock-off David Foster Wallace. Dispiritingly, as the novel goes on, it feels more and more as if O&apos;Neill isn&apos;t even sure what tone he&apos;s going for in the book: lyrical, nostalgic, college-boy ironic? On page after page, O&apos;Neill can still dazzle as a compellingly intelligent writer. Everywhere you look, there&apos;s a\u00a0shimmering portrait of modernity waiting to be glimpsed \u2013 from Dubai&apos;s soulless civic life, adorned with its &quot;broad grey plazas and pools with charcoal or dove grey water&quot;, to its naked temple to status: the narrator lives in a condo called Privilege Bay, from where he marvels at Dubai&apos;s never-ending construction sites and &quot;the slow theatre of its years-long rising&quot;. All the ingredients of O&apos;Neill&apos;s previous novel are here, but that&apos;s just the problem. Trying to create the same magic from the same recipe, O&apos;Neill can almost see the same elements failing to cohere with the same elegance or poetry before him, leaving him to rootle around in uncertain attempts at comedy to make up for it. Dubai, superwealth, megacity anomie \u2013 they&apos;re just too easy a clutch of targets for his talents. If O&apos;Neill hadn&apos;t written Netherland, we&apos;d be raving about his many obvious strengths. But the truth is that this ambitious, lucidly thought-through novel lacks the magic that brought its predecessor alive. \u2022 Robert Collins is the author of Soul Corporation (Arrow).

The buggy and its occupants, however, belonged to Roger and Mirka Federer, their second set of twins and quickly being accommodated alongside their older siblings as the welcome baggage of the player\u2019s unconventional life on the road. Of the many things that are remarkable about Federer the fact that he can operate at world-class level at 33 in an age of strength-sapping physicality while simultaneously leading what approximates to a normal family life surely is at the top of the list. Other players complain about hotels, lack of practice courts, late shuttle buses (sharing a shuttle bus to the airport with a coughing journalist) and the general grind of the Tour. They agonise over the schedule, their back-up teams, their form and fitness. Federer hardly complains about anything, from questionable line calls to the obvious logistical challenge of moving around the world with a wife and four children \u2013 although he does have in place what is cynically referred to as \u201chis staff\u201d, especially by lampooning Tweeter, @Pseudofed (who is followed by most of the leading players, including Andy Murray; and nobody is divulging the rascal\u2019s identity). Federer is aware of the locker-room laughter behind his back. That does not seem to bother him, either. He is so in love with tennis and his family that outside considerations rarely disturb his Zen-like demeanour. \u201cI finally got a big trophy for the kids,\u201d he said on Sunday, after flirting with defeat before seeing off the hangdog David Ferrer 6-3, 1-6, 6-2 to win the Western &amp; Southern Open, placing him in the best possible place before next week\u2019s US Open. The three-month-old kids, Leo and Lenny, might be less aware of their father\u2019s deeds than Myla and Charlene (born July 23, 2009) but there is no doubt the close family unit is an important component in Federer\u2019s enduring success. He is the daddy of the Tour. \u201cI\u2019ve been bringing home some smaller ones,\u201d he adds. \u201cI keep telling them they are still trophies but this one should satisfy them.\u201d However, dad needs his rest. Ten days ago he turned 33 and, although probably in better shape than nearly everyone that age in the world, tennis is a weekly assault course on the body, hurting more as the years pass. \u201cI was considering not playing for just a day or so on Monday,\u201d he revealed later. \u201cSo just to not go crazy here; we don\u2019t need to take chances here. I need to be smart about how much I play, when I play and how I feel. So I waited for Monday, Tuesday to see how I played. In practice I felt like I was recovering quickly and gave it a go. \u201cI could have just not played here and gone into the Open feeling good about my chances; now I feel even better. On the flip coin, what was the other plan: practise, take a few days off? But then I have to grind it out in the practice. I still believe matches are the best practice right now. I\u2019m not going to fly back to Switzerland. \u201cNow I come in [to Flushing Meadows] with great confidence. I can really rest now, rather than having to work on stuff. I can just enjoy New York for what it is and go out to the practice courts and do the opposite of what I had to do last year. Last year I went out there and did three-hour practice sessions and went for extra practice sessions after matches sometimes. That I don\u2019t have to do. I know my game is where I want it to be. It\u2019s about just keeping that level up right now.\u201d As for his Cincinnati experience, in which he saw off Andy Murray and Milos Raonic before getting his hands on the trophy in a high-quality final \u2013 the first in a Masters 1000 between two thirtysomethings \u2013 against Ferrer: \u201cI\u2019m very happy about the week. Just overall it went from good to great.\u201d It surely did. This was his sixth Cincinnati Open title (as it is more widely known), the 80th overall in his career, the 22nd in a Masters 1000. His trophy cabinet is heaving again after taking a worryingly long sabbatical \u2013 his losing final against Djokovic at Wimbledon this year was his first in a slam decider since he beat Murray at Wimbledon two years ago. To extend his career he changed his racket, his training regime and his coach. Mr Nice Guy can also be Mr Pragmatic. On life with his latest coach, Stefan Edberg, he said: \u201cI don\u2019t know if you spent time with your idol but for me it was quite different in the beginning getting used to that. It was not something I ever thought was going to happen. \u201cSo I\u2019m happy that the transition is in the past now. We sort of like each other\u2019s company. We don\u2019t get bored with each other. We enjoy talking about tennis but then we don\u2019t talk tennis all the time.\u201d And then there was the weirdest conclusion to the questions by a man who, in nearly every way, shouts \u201cnormal\u201d. Reminded that he and Serena Williams now stand at 17 majors apiece, he said: \u201cI didn\u2019t know that, no. So, no, totally separate to me. I don\u2019t know if it is to you but to me it is. But it\u2019s great what she\u2019s doing, no doubt. It\u2019s great that she\u2019s still playing and winning.\u201d And that, take it or leave it, is why Federer is a phenomenon. He is so able to compartmentalise his world he admits to being unaware that one of the greatest players in the history of women\u2019s tennis shares a number with him. He is no ordinary Joe. Roger Federer by numbers Federer is the second 33-year-old to claim the Cincinnati title, joining Bill Tilden who did so in 1926. Only Ken Rosewall (35 in 1970) and Andre Agassi (34 in 2004) were older when winning the title. Federer has equalled Edberg for most Cincinnati singles finals appearances in the Open era with six. Cincinnati is the seventh tournament where Federer has reached the finals at least six times: Basel \u2013 10 finals (5-5); Halle \u2013 9 finals (7-2); Wimbledon \u2013 9 finals (7-2); Barclays ATP World Tour Finals \u2013 8 finals (6-2); Dubai \u2013 8 finals (6-2); Cincinnati \u2013 6 finals (6-0); US Open \u2013 6 finals (5-1) Federer has won 22 ATP World Tour Masters 1000 titles and has appeared in 38 finals. His win Sunday snapped a four-match losing streak in Masters 1000 finals. The title is the 80th overall in Federer\u2019s career. He is third in the Open Era, trailing only Jimmy Connors (109) and Ivan Lendl (94). \u2022 This article was amended on 19 August 2014.

Boosted by Monday&apos;s recapture of the dam, Iraqi forces launched an assault on Tikrit, 80 miles (130km) north of Baghdad, with helicopter gunships and mortar and artillery fire. When troops entered the town from near its main hospital they faced heavy machine gun and mortar fire from the militants, forcing the military to pull back. It was the third failed attempt to retake Tikrit since it fell to Isis fighters more than two months ago, when Isis made sweeping gains in five provinces. Since then Tikrit has been controlled by Sunni militants and former members of Saddam&apos;s Ba&apos;ath party. A local official and a resident told Associated Press that the clashes began early on Tuesday on the south-western outskirts of the city. Isis landmines and snipers prevented Iraqi forces reaching the town from the west, officials told Reuters. By early afternoon residents in central Tikrit told the agency Isis fighters were firmly in control. An Iraqi army spokesman, Lt Gen Qassim al-Moussawi, said a &quot;slow and gradual&quot; push to retake areas around Tikrit was under way. &quot;There are still a lot of challenges and difficulties ahead of us,&quot; he said in a live briefing aired on state TV. &quot;The war needs time, but we are determined to annihilate the Islamic State and to liberate all the areas they occupy even if we suffer heavy causalities, because we have no other choice.&quot; The failed attack came as the UN&apos;s refugee agency, the UNHCR, announced one of its biggest ever aid operations to help 500,000 Iraqis who have fled violence in Iraq in the last two months. It plans to a launch a four-day airlift on Wednesday to provide tens of thousands of tents, plastic sheets, kitchen sets and jerry cans. The Swedish furniture company Ikea is helping to provide the supplies. It has already donated $2.5m (\u00a31.5m) and 150,000 mattresses and quilts for the UNHCR relief efforts in Iraq, making it the agency&apos;s largest private sector donor. The supplies, which have also been paid for from donations from Saudi Arabia, the US and Britain, will be flown to Irbil, the capital of the Kurdish autonomous region whichthat is sheltering an estimated 200,000 people seeking protection from Isis. The UNHCR&apos;s spokesman, Adrian Edwards, said: &quot;This is a very, very significant aid push and certainly one of the largest I can recall in quite a while. This is a major humanitarian crisis and disaster.&quot; He added: &quot;Barring last-minute delays, an air, road and sea operation will begin tomorrow [Wednesday], starting with a four-day airlift using Boeing 747s from Aqaba in Jordan to Irbil, followed by road convoys from Turkey and Jordan, and sea and land shipments from Dubai via Iran over the next 10 days.&quot; There are currently eight camps for displaced people in the Dohuk and Irbil governorates with another four to six planned. The international threat posed by Isis was underlined in a new video warning in which the group pledged to &quot;drown all of you in blood&quot; if US air strikes continued. And in neighbouring Syria the group is said to have attracted a record number of new recruits. The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said more than 6,000 men joined Isis in July. Most were from Syria, but they include 1,200 foreign fighters, it said. Isis fighters are closing in on the last Syrian government-held army base in the north-eastern province of Raqqa, prompting Syrian air strikes in the area. Isis fighters are &quot;worse than Saddam&quot;, a Kurdish commander told AFP. Major General Abdulrahman Kawiri said: &quot;They use terror and chaos to force the population to flee.

Morgan, the one-day vice-captain, is likely to have a crucial role to play as Cook and the coach, Peter Moores, fine-tune the team\u2019s preparations six months out from the tournament in Australia and New Zealand. The preparations start in Bristol on Monday in the first of five one-day internationals against India, when Morgan will hope to reproduce the kind of form with the bat that has made him a mainstay of the side in recent years. Yet it was his leadership qualities that brought him to the attention of no lesser figures than the former England captains Michael Vaughan and Ian Botham when Cook\u2019s position as Test captain came under serious scrutiny following the dismal second Test loss to India at Lord\u2019s last month. The Irishman was touted as a possible replacement for Cook, despite having not played Test cricket for almost two years. However, the landscape has changed significantly since then, with Cook finding form again as England completed three successive victories to win the series in style. Now, with a World Cup on the horizon, Morgan is hoping to help England take the momentum gained over the past month into the one-day format. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be more perfect coming into the one-day series and a big six months,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see Cooky back in the runs. \u201cTo be mentioned as a Test captain was a big surprise. It\u2019s obviously very flattering to even be named as a potential replacement. I\u2019ve enjoyed the captaincy when I\u2019ve done it at Middlesex and with England.\u201d Morgan is fully behind Cook\u2019s one-day captaincy, too, despite grumbles from some that the Essex batsman is not good enough to be in the limited-overs side. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of success under Alastair,\u201d said Morgan, who was speaking to the Guardian on behalf of the England team sponsor, Waitrose, at an open day at Maidenhead and Bray cricket club. \u201cHe holds the changing room in great order with respect and performances, so there\u2019s no doubting his captaincy.\u201d England\u2019s selectors were decidedly conservative this week when choosing their squad for the five-match series against India. Nonetheless, facing opponents who won the last World Cup on home soil in 2011 will be a useful barometer of England\u2019s progress before the next tournament, which starts for England with a meeting against Australia in Melbourne on 14 February. \u201cPlaying against the world champions is going to be a great test of where we\u2019re at,\u201d Morgan said. \u201cThe World Cup isn\u2019t far away and this is a great lead into it. The fact we\u2019re not playing Test cricket means there are no distractions. It allows us to build as a team. That will be important come February.\u201d Following the series against India, England travel to Sri Lanka before Christmas for seven ODIs. Then it is on to Australia in the new year for a tri-series against the hosts and India. England\u2019s next Test match is not until April in the West Indies but Morgan is hopeful a successful six months of one-day cricket can help his ambitions of breaking back into the side. The Dublin-born batsman, who has played 16 Tests for England, the last of them against Pakistan in Dubai back in February 2012, said: \u201cI made a decision at the start of the year to miss the IPL and play championship cricket, with maybe the potential of getting back into the Test team. \u201cThat hasn\u2019t worked out but I certainly still have Test match ambitions. We\u2019ll see where we are after the World Cup and go from there but I\u2019d definitely consider missing the IPL again.\u201d For now, those ambitions can be placed on hold as England prepare to embark on a journey they hope will end with them winning a first 50-over World Cup. To that end, Morgan believes a rehabilitated Steve Finn may play a major role. Finn has not featured for England since last summer\u2019s one-day series against Australia, having been sent home early from the last Ashes tour after being branded \u201cunselectable\u201d by the then limited-overs coach Ashley Giles. Morgan, though, has seen his rehabilitation first hand at Middlesex this summer and believes the 25-year-old fast bowler is ready to return after being called into the squad for the final two Tests of the summer. \u201cFinny\u2019s been brilliant,\u201d Morgan added. \u201cI saw where he was at in the winter and he wasn\u2019t quite himself, so to see him come back and bowl with the pace, bounce and aggression he has showed in the past is fantastic. \u201cIf he gets his chance I have no doubt he will do no wrong. I think he\u2019s in a good place, having been called up into the Test match squad \u2013 that obviously gives him confidence.

Oxford Street and Piccadilly were among the areas identified as having high rates of pickpocketing, theft and fraud in maps published by the UAE foreign ministry. Emiratis said two high-profile attacks in London this year on visitors from the Gulf state had changed perceptions of London&apos;s safety. Using Google maps, areas identified as dangerous under the UAE guidance were Marble Arch tube station, running north to Edgware Road and beyond the Metropole Hotel, as well as an area including Piccadilly, Bond Street, Soho, Leicester Square, Oxford Circus and Tottenham Court Road. It describes the West End as an area of global trade, home to &quot;the famous Selfridges&quot; and frequently visited by Emiratis. Places identified as &quot;less perilous&quot; were the Shepherd&apos;s Bush market area and around Queensway tube station and Bayswater. Police made four arrests in April after three Emirati sisters were seriously injured in the middle of the night by a hammer-wielding attacker who sneaked into their room on the seventh floor of the four-star Cumberland Hotel near Marble Arch. Three children, who were unharmed, were sleeping in two adjoining rooms. Two weeks later, an Emirati couple were robbed at gunpoint in a Paddington flat. Alia Al Mazroui, a businesswoman who was one of the founders of the UK&apos;s Just Falafel restaurant chain, also told the Guardian that the brutal killing in June of a 31-year-old Saudi student near an Essex nature reserve had had a &quot;huge effect&quot;. &quot;I had a couple of friends who were in London and their families were very scared, particularly after that incident,&quot; said Mazroui, who was travelling to London on Wednesday and added that she was comfortable about coming to the city. She also said that the UAE foreign ministry had recently sent messages and emails to Emiratis advising them to avoid certain areas of London for safety reasons and that citizens could update their contact address online. &quot;There have been a couple of attacks. They wanted to make sure that the Emiratis are safe while travelling,&quot; she added, while praising the UAE embassy in London. Mazroui said that she took care to travel light and dress down when she was in the capital. She said she had not experienced crime in London, although an aunt had a watch snatched from her wrist some years ago. Obaid Alzaabi, 20, an Emirati who studied in the UK and is now at home in Abu Dhabi, had more concerns about safety in London, saying the recent attacks and robberies had caused many of his friends and acquaintances to have second thoughts about coming to the UK on holiday. &quot;Since what has happened lately I have had friends who wanted to visit the UK but they have changed their mind. Nowadays, many people who would go to the UK are going to other places such as Switzerland and the US,&quot; he said. Alzaabi said he regarded other English cities such as Bristol and Southampton as safer than London, where he felt relatively safe during the daytime but became more nervous in the evening and at night, taking care to avoid groups of people on the street after dining out. Media coverage in the UAE quoted Emiratis who said that they would be taking their government&apos;s advice on London seriously and suggested that visitors from wealthy Gulf states were being singled out by criminals in the UK. &quot;I think maybe people from the Gulf are more targeted there because of their lifestyle. They might not be too discreet with their jewellery when they travel and they wear nice clothes,&quot; Dubai resident Mona Al Ali told the National newspaper. Text at the bottom of the advice published by the UAE authorities named the Metropolitan police as a source. However, Commander Makhdum Chishty of the Met said on Wednesday that there was &quot;absolutely nowhere&quot; in London that should be avoided. &quot;We understand the incidents involving Emirati nationals earlier this year was shocking, but it was also very, very rare,&quot; he added. &quot;London is one of the safest major cities in the world and crime continues to fall and overall crime in Westminster is down by\u00a016.4%. &quot;Police presence is high and post-Ramadan, with the traditional influx of visitors from the UAE, we reviewed our policing plans so we have a strong presence from our policing teams and officers working in plain clothes.&quot; The force went on to list steps that visitors to London should follow to keep themselves and their belongings safe, including not carrying large sums of cash in public, using hotel safes, and always travelling by licensed taxi or minicab. It also said that visitors should consider carrying a personal safety alarm and urged them to &quot;look confident and walk purposefully to your destination&quot;.", "title": "Wild West End: Gulf tourists warned to avoid London's 'perilous' shopping area", "sentences": ["They might not be too discreet with their jewellery when they travel and they wear nice clothes,&quot; Dubai resident Mona Al Ali told the National newspaper."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-20T19:48:31Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/aug/21/bank-holiday-travel-road-rail-disruption", "tags": ["Transport", "Weather", "Rail transport", "Road transport", "Air transport", "UK news"], "article": "The last bank holiday before winter will see an estimated 2 million Britons head abroad, encouraged by a strong pound and a forecast dip in temperatures at home.

The coach operator National Express has cashed in with a surge in bookings for the bank holiday, it said, with Monday expected to be its busiest day. The RAC said music festivals at Leeds and Reading would contribute to busy days on the roads. The Highways Agency said it would be suspending 110 miles of roadworks over the weekend, but they will continue on parts of the M1, M5 and M25. Abta said Spain, Greece, Turkey and Tunisia were the most popular short-haul holiday destinations. Around 500,000 passengers are expected to fly from Heathrow airport, 234,000 from Gatwick and 172,000 from Manchester. British Airways alone will carry more than half a million people over the weekend.

The England team he led was crumbling to defeat against India at Lord\u2019s. This was their seventh Test defeat in nine matches, and a quiet numbness crept over the dressing room. \u201cThere was just a gradual descent into silence,\u201d recalls Cook. It was more than just losing a match. For the past year, he\u2019d had to endure a level of scrutiny and scepticism that only attaches itself to government leaders and England cricket captains. He was the first England captain to lose the Ashes in seven years, and he\u2019d done so in humiliating fashion, a 5-0 whitewash. Now he was losing matches at home, his tactical abilities were being torn apart by pundits and the public, and to make it worse, his own batting scores read like lottery numbers. Cook left the ground and drove to the Bedfordshire farm where he lives with his wife Alice. \u201cIt\u2019s quite nice to switch off and not see anything to do with cricket,\u201d he says. He told Alice he was thinking of quitting the captaincy \u2013 \u201cbared his soul\u201d, as he later put it. And Alice, the sensible, practical farmer\u2019s daughter who has been his companion since his school years, talked him out of it. Three weeks later, he is sitting in the pavilion at the Kia Oval, surprisingly relaxed while talking about his summer of horror. He\u2019s 29 and still looks youthful, although the freshly laundered whites he\u2019s wearing might play their part. His square jaw looks softer today, and the big eyes less doleful, than they can be on TV. It is just before the final Test match of the summer and England are 2-1 up, having routed the opposition in the past two games. It has been an extraordinary, and rapid, turnaround. What went right? \u201cA lot of us were fighting for our futures really,\u201d shrugs Cook. \u201cMaybe it was just a clear-out of our minds, saying, \u2018It can\u2019t get any worse.\u2019\u201d Cook looks out of the window onto the pitch, where the Indian team are practising. He knows the story\u2019s not over: his summer will be judged on the outcome of this final Test. \u201cWe have to win this series now,\u201d he says, and his face flashes serious, a hint of what it might be like to be under his command. His leadership has been the subject of speculation, ridicule and endless attacks from Shane Warne (\u201cnegative\u201d, \u201cboring\u201d and \u201chorrific\u201d are just some of the words used by Warne to describe \u201cthe worst captaincy I have ever seen\u201d). Successful sporting captains tend to have an almost psychic acumen, infectious charisma, or the kind of daring that\u2019s known in changing rooms as \u201cbloody big balls\u201d. The best combine all three. And it\u2019s true that, watching Cook courteously deliver media pleasantries at the end of each game, one might wonder which of these it is that inspires his team \u2013 there\u2019s nothing about him that suggests a killer edge. Even today he just seems too, well, nice.     A dejected Cook after the loss at the Ashes during day five of the Third Test at the WACA ground, Perth, Australia. Photograph: Anthony Devlin/PA    What is it like in those lonely moments in the field, when he knows that the eyes of the world \u2013 not to mention a vocal regiment of players-turned-pundits in the TV commentary box \u2013 are judging him? Does he feel the weight of the decisions he\u2019s making? \u201cYou feel it when it\u2019s going badly,\u201d he nods, \u201cand you feel helpless from being able to stop it, really. You try everything.\u201d He wishes, he says half-jokingly, that he had a microphone link-up to the press box. \u201cBecause you could say, \u2018Well I\u2019m trying this.\u2019 And if they understand the reason you\u2019re trying to do it, it would probably be better explained.\u201d One man who does understand, and refused to join in with the demands for his resignation, was his former team-mate, now Test Match Special summariser, Graeme Swann, who says they first met when Cook was a \u201cdrippingly wet behind the ears youngster\u201d at the national cricket academy in Loughborough. \u201cThe greatest thing I can say about him, and what makes him a good captain, is that he\u2019s got the most stubborn streak of any man I\u2019ve ever known. It\u2019s the reason he doesn\u2019t buckle under the pressure. He refuses to ever admit that he\u2019s wrong in an argument and that\u2019s where the two of us spend most of our time. We\u2019ve had huge ding- dongs.\u201d And while some have been about cricket \u2013 they once went 20 minutes without speaking, over chicken wings at an ice rink in Dubai, when England\u2019s batting collapsed against Pakistan \u2013 the most memorable, for Swann, was about Paul Gascoigne\u2019s knee injury in the 1991 FA Cup Final. \u201cAlastair and Jimmy Anderson were swearing that he immediately had to leave the field,\u201d laughs Swann. \u201cBut I knew he\u2019d collapsed at the restart. When I was proved right I\u2019ve never seen a sicker looking individual in my life,\u201d laughs Swann. The fondness with which Swann talks about Cook could also be seen in the crowds this summer. Even as his stock as captain plummeted, there remained demonstrable affection for the man himself. At the Ageas Bowl, in the Test following the Lord\u2019s disaster, Cook was cheered to the wicket. \u201cThe reception when I walked out at Southampton is something I\u2019ll remember for ever,\u201d says Cook, shaking his head in wonderment. \u201cI was surprised, to be honest with you.\u201d He ended up batting for five hours and making his highest score since May 2013, but he stalled in the 90s and was out five runs short of a century that would have been his first in over a year. Was he thinking how good it would be, to prove people wrong? \u201cI wasn\u2019t thinking of looking good,\u201d he says. \u201cI was just so desperate to finally contribute.\u201d Being a perfectionist, it still bothers him \u2013 \u201cI was just gutted for myself, on a selfish note\u201d \u2013 but it was the beginning of a turn in fortune, and opinion: from Dire Straits to AC and The Sunshine Band. \u201cI\u2019m not the first cricket captain to experience that, and I certainly won\u2019t be the last.\u201d The England captaincy has historically been something of a poisoned chalice. From the mid-1980s to 2005 what should have been the ultimate honour for any cricketer was more of a curse. Star players \u2013 Ian Botham, David Gower, Graham Gooch \u2013 found themselves on the losing side. Young bucks with big dreams \u2013 Mike Atherton, Nasser Hussain \u2013 watched their hopes steadily erode, and age quicker than a second-term prime minister. If you were Mike Gatting, you managed to win and still end up leaving in disgrace. Then English cricket changed. There were Ashes victories and open-top bus parades; England were officially ranked the best team in the world, and their exploits shamed the continuing underachievement of their footballing peers. A team that had been, for 20 years, the whipping boy of the British sports pages had become odds-on favourites in every series they began, and being their captain was a high rank indeed. So last winter\u2019s 5-0 defeat to Australia came as a brutal shock. When Giles Clarke, the chairman of English cricket, was asked to sum up England\u2019s performances that season he called them \u201cappalling\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d. But he also added an unexpected endorsement of Cook. \u201cHe is a very determined guy, a very good role model,\u201d said Clarke, \u201cand he and his family are very much the sort of people we want the England captain and his family to be.\u201d There\u2019s certainly something a bit Terence Rattigan about his background. He grew up in the Essex village of Wickham Bishops, his mum a teacher from Swansea, his dad a telecoms engineer. His parents loved sport of all kinds, and Alastair and his two brothers had a regular diet of it \u2013 badminton on Mondays, short tennis on Tuesdays, long tennis on Wednesdays. \u201cIt was my mum and dad\u2019s 40th wedding anniversary over the last weekend, and they\u2019d got a bit of old footage out of me \u2013 aged five, pads up to my chest, and gardening gloves on,\u201d smiles Cook. \u201cOlder brother bowling, younger brother fielding.\u201d He pauses. \u201cI do feel sorry for my younger brother, he used to field a lot.\u201d Until he was 13, Cook was a chorister at St Paul\u2019s Cathedral School; his musical training earned him a scholarship to Bedford School and was crucial to the development of his concentration on the cricket field. \u201cHe had to sing difficult music in an adult world where errors were devastating,\u201d says Andrew Morris, Bedford School\u2019s then director of music. He was also, adds Morris, \u201ca thoroughly decent and charming young man\u201d. He must have been the kind of pupil that makes the less gifted groan \u2013 handsome, talented and breaking all the school\u2019s batting records. His endeavours on the cricket field meant that even teams who hadn\u2019t played Bedford knew who Cook was, and what he was likely to do to them. Did he manage to keep a check on his ego? \u201cI hope I did,\u201d he says, frowning. \u201cI\u2019m sure there were times when as a growing teenager I didn\u2019t.\u201d In fact, he had no idea himself how good he could be. There was no ambition to play for England \u2013 the young Cook thought he could \u201cjust about be good enough\u201d to play professional cricket for his home county, Essex. \u201cBut you hear all those horror stories of people who are amazing at 14 but rubbish at 17, so you always think, \u2018I don\u2019t want to be that kid.\u2019\u201d Even years later, his first appearance for England came as a surprise. It was 2006; England had just won the Ashes for the first time in 18 years, and a 21-year-old Cook was in Antigua playing for England\u2019s development side when his phone rang. Injuries had hit the touring England team, and Cook and his team-mate James Anderson were needed in India, pronto. \u201cI\u2019d never really spoken to Jimmy before but we packed our bags and spent the next three hours on the beach, thinking we might as well make the most of it, because Nagpur doesn\u2019t have too many beaches.\u201d Forty-eight hours later, after three connecting flights, Cook was making his Test debut. He scored a century. \u201cYou talk about how life can change in a week\u2026\u201d Cook shakes his head. \u201cYou just don\u2019t know.\u201d     Cook celebrates with the trophy after winning the Test series, August 2014. Photograph: Jed Leicester/Action Images    After that \u201clife never looked back\u201d, which sounds like a typically Cook-ish piece of understatement. His sporting career has been record-breaking. He scored seven centuries before his 23rd birthday, the only Englishman to do so. Between 2010 and 2012 he scored so many centuries that people started comparing him to the legendary Don Bradman. The most Test runs scored by an Englishman is 8,900, a record held by his mentor, Graham Gooch \u2013 and there seems no question that Cook, currently on 8,423, will overhaul it. Wielding power has not come as naturally, however, as carrying his bat. He admits he is not a confrontational sort \u2013 \u201cmy wife finds it hard because I never really argue\u201d \u2013 and when he first took over the captaincy he found it difficult to handle differences of opinion within the team. \u201cI found dealing with my close friends the hardest bit, because I respect them and that\u2019s why we\u2019re friends,\u201d he says. He points to Swann as an example. \u201cI\u2019m not saying that we fell out or anything like that. But he\u2019s a great bowler and he had very strong opinions, so it was hard to change them.\u201d Perhaps it\u2019s the wood panelling and leather furnishings of the committee room, but there seems something timelessly English about Cook \u2013 \u00a0the inclination to kindness, the imperturbable demeanour, the quiet way he wears authority. He puts his unrufflable nature down to his role as an opening batsman. \u201cYou have to be very pragmatic, because you walk out to bat at the best time to bowl, with a brand new ball, against the best bowlers, who are fresh. And their job is to get you out, so when you fail there\u2019s no point beating yourself up.\u201d A physiological quirk that means he doesn\u2019t sweat \u2013 even under a 40-degree Australian sun \u2013 adds to the effect. As well as withstanding the heat of the past few months, he\u2019s had to handle the emotional demands of new fatherhood. Even though his two- month-old, Elsie, is \u201ca well-travelled baby\u201d, Cook has missed a lot of her early days. \u201cYou see how much she\u2019s changed every week,\u201d he says. \u201cI do feel sorry for Al because when I\u2019m at home I\u2019m trying to recover, so in the middle of the night I\u2019m not the keenest to get out of bed.\u201d Around the time of his Lord\u2019s nadir, his sister-in-law got married. Cook had been asked to play his saxophone at the wedding, and he lights up on telling the story: \u201cAll the families were there,\u201d he beams, \u201cand I\u2019ve never been more nervous, even at my own wedding.\u201d The same passion evident in his batting animates the conversation as he talks about music \u2013 practising, sight-reading, rediscovering one\u2019s embouchure. It\u2019s like there\u2019s a different Cook in the room \u2013 not the considered one who presents himself dutifully to the cameras at the end of a day\u2019s play, but the one who shares a game-playing life with 10 other blokes in a dirty, boisterous changing room. Four days after we talk, England have won the final Test, and the series. They beat India at the Oval in only three days \u2013 their third comprehensive, ruthless victory in a row. No one looked prouder, or happier, than Captain Cook. Like his namesake, he had weathered the storms, steered his team through adversity, and made it safely to new waters. \u201cIt is tough when you go through it,\u201d he says. \u201cBut even when it is going bad \u2013 and it can\u2019t have gone any worse over the last six months \u2013 you\u2019re still playing cricket for England . \u201cEven when every Tom, Dick and Harry was calling for my head, I still felt I could get better at being captain. And I still think I will get better. And that\u2019s probably what kept me going. If I went now, I\u2019d still have some burning questions in my mind. Not many people are ever called England captain, so why would you just throw it away unless you know that you\u2019ve given it everything?\u201d Investec, the specialist bank and asset manager, is the title sponsor of Test match cricket in England (investec.co.uk/cricket and @InvestecCricket)     Alastair Cook Photograph: P\u00e5l Hansen for the Observer/P\u00e5l Hansen       Cook on the Bedfordshire farm where he lives with his wife, Alice, and sheepdog, Floss.

Having opted to live at home with her parents in Pinner, Greater London, the 21-year-old languages student says her only expense is \u00a3150 a month on a travel card \u2013 about the same as her friends studying in London spend on a week&apos;s rent. &quot;I don&apos;t want to generalise, but landlords run a business so they often try and cut corners where they can \u2013 maybe by being slow to fix damp and mould in bathrooms. When I&apos;ve seen friends&apos; flats I have been very grateful that I am living at home,&quot; says Rockley, who is starting her third year at King&apos;s College London. Figures this month from Santander show that more than 22% of students still live in their family home. Of these, 66% say the cost of living is the main reason. For Rockley, there are other advantages. &quot;The one thing I love about commuting to university is that at the end of the day you get to leave everything behind. You don&apos;t have to be in the thick of it all the time,&quot; she says. With tuition fees of \u00a39,000 and the yearly cost of renting a room in London around the same, for Rockley, commuting to university is a no brainer. &quot;Maintenance loans probably only cover about three quarters of your accommodation costs, so if you want to live near university you still need to find an extra \u00a32,000 a year.&quot; Research published this month by the Money Charity highlighted the rising cost of student accommodation; average rents are around \u00a3420 a month, rising to \u00a3554 in the capital. In many cases, loans don&apos;t cover students&apos; accommodation and living costs, meaning they must seek part-time work or turn to mum and dad for support. According to the The Money Charity, parents are paying as much as \u00a3750 a month to help their child. Money is the main reason 23-year-old Scott Varnham decided to live at home. After talking to his parents, he realised at the start of the second year of his degree course that it would be cheaper to commute from his home in Slough to Bath Spa University, where he is studying creative writing \u2013 \u00a31,500 a year in train fares compared to \u00a34,000 on rent. &quot;Although my main motivation was financial I do actually appreciate the extra time,&quot; says Varnham who spends the four-hour commute studying. But to get the cheapest rail fares he has to take the late train home at 10pm, arriving into Slough at one in the morning. According to research on student finance this year by the National Union of Students (NUS), the weekly cost of a room in halls of residence has doubled in the past 10 years. And one of the most worrying findings of the NUS Pound in Your Pocket research was that 58% of students regularly feel stressed about not having enough money to cover rent and other basic living expenses. Tim Picton, a recent English Literature graduate, commuted from his home in Romford in Essex to Queen Mary University of London during his three-year course. He says this decision was not purely financial. Although he wanted to stay at home to keep his part-time job, he also wanted to help look after his disabled brother. &quot;I found it hard at first to balance everything but then you get a routine and you have to be assiduous,&quot; he says. History graduate Jessie Martin did a 120-mile round trip several times a week from London to Canterbury because she wanted to be near her friends \u2013 many of whom had stayed in her home city. She puts the higher grades she achieved in the third year of her degree at the University of Kent down to being able to concentrate better on her studies at home. &quot;My parents were really supportive with my work and helped me handling essays,&quot; she says. But not everybody thinks living at home while studying is a good idea. Paolo Ramella, principal of Sir George Monoux College, in London says it can affect a student&apos;s experience of university life. &quot;Going to university is not only about getting a qualification, it teaches you to live on a budget, to cook for yourself, to be self-reliant. It builds independent living skills and creates the chances of forming new friendships; staying at home can sometimes take away some of these learning opportunities.&quot; But fears remain that rising costs are playing a bigger factor in where students choose to study rather than the quality of their degree courses. With a record number of young people in Britain going off to university this year, including rising numbers of students from disadvantaged areas \u2013 will more students feel pressure to live at home? &quot;The choice of where to stay for many students has become more to do with the fear of the costs associated with leaving home. This means they are not always basing the decision of where to go on what is right for them academically. It becomes a decision about whether they can afford to live somewhere,&quot; says Katie Llewellin, a sabbatical officer at Birmingham City University. &quot;Lots of students are now making decisions based on locality and it is a very complicated issue. It is not just about a rise in accommodation costs but there is a general rise in the cost of living and associated costs of courses. It is something that needs to be addressed because a lot of the time the worries students have could be mitigated.&quot; Rockley predicts her decision to live at home will reduce her student debt by around \u00a320,000 overall, giving her more choice about her future. &quot;After university I would like a change of scenery and maybe move to New York, Hong Kong or Dubai. I think that living at home buys you a bit of time once you&apos;ve left university because you don&apos;t have to immediately worry about paying off your student loan. If you are dealing with \u00a354,000 debt then you are going to want to get a job as quickly as possible \u2026 Living at home gives you space to breathe.&quot; Most and least affordable places to study HSBC have just published research into students&apos; cost of living. The bank looked at the cost of renting in halls, weekly essentials (which it classed as food, activities and university supplies), five pints of beer, two bottles of wine and a bus pass. It found that the average weekly spend for first-year students was \u00a3196. But there were some surprising conclusions about which cities were the most, and least, affordable. Five most affordable: 1. University of Leicester Here lucky students pay around two-thirds of those studying in London. Renting in self-catered halls set you back is about \u00a391 a week and five beers cost just \u00a38. 2. University of Nottingham Weekly essentials cost about \u00a310 more than in Leicester but the city is still very affordable with rent in self-catered halls at just \u00a3100 a week. 3. University of Cardiff A weekly essentials shop sets most students back around \u00a392 here. But the city is slightly cheaper than Nottingham if you&apos;re renting in halls, at around \u00a394 a week. 4. University of Southampton A bus pass for a week is \u00a36.67, cheaper than most other universities. The cost of five beers is also reasonable, at just over \u00a316. 5. University of Bristol Perhaps a surprising addition to the list, Bristol is the fifth cheapest place to study. Weekly essentials come in at just over \u00a370, with a weekly bus pass a reasonable \u00a37.27. Five least affordable: 1. UCL/ Imperial It&apos;s no surprise that London is top. A weekly shop comes in at \u00a3155. A bus pass is also a huge \u00a321. 2. The University of Oxford Self-catered halls cost \u00a3137 here and a weekly essentials shop is around \u00a3120. Five beers in Oxford is around \u00a320. 3. University of Sussex It&apos;s reasonably cheap to ride the bus (\u00a37.67) but weekly essentials are \u00a3135. 4. University of Birmingham Renting in halls is about \u00a3121, with your weekly shop costing you \u00a310 more than that. 5. University of Manchester Renting a room in halls is \u00a3131 and a bus pass is just over a tenner.", "title": "Rise of the live-at-home student commuter", "sentences": ["&quot;After university I would like a change of scenery and maybe move to New York, Hong Kong or Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-26T06:29:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/aug/26/uae-boldness-libya-strains-with-west-arab-allies", "tags": ["United Arab Emirates", "Middle East and North Africa", "World news", "Libya", "Africa", "Foreign policy", "Politics", "US foreign policy", "US news", "US politics", "Arab and Middle East unrest", "Egypt", "Saudi Arabia", "Muammar Gaddafi", "Mohamed Morsi", "Muslim Brotherhood"], "article": "On the face of it, this is one of those baffling moments that seem to occur with increasing frequency in the Middle East these days: why has the United Arab Emirates, a small, wealthy Gulf state, been secretly bombing targets in distant Libya from bases in Egypt \u2013 and without telling the US, its closest ally? Looked at a little more closely, however, the news reflects wider changes in the region, and a sense that Washington is retreating from it. Shaken by the turbulence of the Arab spring, the UAE has emerged as the most assertive of the conservative Gulf monarchies. It does not share the traditional reticence of Saudi Arabia, especially when it comes to combatting what both now see as the most dangerous challenge to the status quo \u2013 the rise of Islamists at home and abroad. Countries once obsessed by the threat from Iran are now more fearful of the Muslim Brotherhood and likeminded groups. The first signs of the UAE&apos;s new role emerged in 2011, when Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed \u2013 the de facto ruler \u2013 joined Nato air operations in Libya and backed rebels fighting to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi. The UAE chose its allies on a regional and tribal basis, singling out militias in Zintan in the west. Qatar, its Gulf neighbour and rival, funnelled its support to Islamist brigades, especially in Misrata. It has been rumoured for weeks that the Emiratis have been discreetly backing General Khalifa Haftar, the renegade Libyan general who presents himself as the only man who can save his chaotic country from the depredations of Islamists he dismisses as terrorists. Haftar, like the UAE and Egypt, makes no distinction between the Muslim Brotherhood, who have taken part in elections, and dyed-in-the-wool jihadis such as Ansar al-Sharia.     In 2011 the UAE joined Nato air operations in Libya and backed rebels fighting to overthrow Muammar Gaddafi. Photograph: Alberto Pizzoli/AFP/Getty    Like Saudi Arabia, the UAE was dismayed by the overthrow and US abandonment of Egypt&apos;s Hosni Mubarak. Now it is the leading supporter of Abdel-Fatah al-Sisi, who ousted Egypt&apos;s democratically elected but unpopular Mohamed Morsi last summer \u2013 a grievous blow to Morsi&apos;s Muslim Brotherhood that delighted all the Gulf states except Qatar. The Emiratis have since bankrolled Egypt and advised it on economic reform \u2013 with the help of Tony Blair. On the domestic front, the UAE has cracked down hard on dissent, accusing members of the Islamist Islah group of plotting to seize power and last year jailing 69 of them after a controversial trial that was condemned by human rights organisations. General Dahi Khalfan, former head of the Dubai police force, has been especially outspoken about the threat of Brotherhood &quot;subversion&quot;. Anwar Gargash, the UAE&apos;s deputy foreign minister, is another hard-nosed exponent of the need to confront Islamists of all hues. The UAE backs individuals who challenge its enemies: Ahmed Shafiq, the candidate beaten by Morsi in 2012, is based in Abu Dhabi. Persistent rumours suggest Emirati sponsorship of Mohammed Dahlan, Yasser Arafat&apos;s former security chief and a sworn enemy of Hamas, the (Qatari-backed) Islamist movement that rules Gaza \u2013 Dahlan&apos;s home turf. Competition with Qatar remains an important motive, UAE-watchers say. Emiratis also point to concerns about Libyan involvement with Isis in Iraq and Syria \u2013 which these days are together an even bigger worry than the Brotherhood. Emirati assertiveness has been felt, too, in relations with its western allies, including Britain, a leading trading partner. Last year the UAE became the first Arab country to send an ambassador to Nato \u2013 not surprising for a country that spends most of its defence budget on weapons bought from the US, UK and France. UAE pressure was one of the reasons why David Cameron ordered a controversial review of the Muslim Brotherhood last spring. The work was recently completed, but has not yet been published, probably because it will be difficult to make policy recommendations. Abu Dhabi has hinted at repercussions for bilateral relations if the review&apos;s findings are not to its liking. The Libya raids look likely to trigger new strains between the west and its anxious Arab allies. Abu Dhabi&apos;s silence and Cairo&apos;s &quot;plausible denial&quot; of direct involvement convince no one. In any case, the air attacks have not been effective: Tripoli airport and the capital as a whole are now under the control of Islamist fighters. The US, UK and France went to war to overthrow Gaddafi in 2011. But now that the hopes of the Arab spring are a distant memory, they insist that military support for Libya&apos;s warring factions will not help restore desperately needed stability and that only dialogue can succeed.

The airline said its &quot;business plus&quot; fares would give customers flexible tickets, more check-in baggage, priority boarding and &quot;premium&quot; seats \u2013 in the first five rows for quick boarding, or on exit rows with extra legroom. It said business passengers already make up more than a quarter of its customers and that the new fares, starting at \u20ac69.99 (or \u00a359.99 for UK customers), were designed to get more of their business. In May, Ryanair said it was &quot;asleep at the wheel&quot; as customers got fed up with receiving bad service in return for low fares. Its rival, easyJet, moved upmarket and launched a business package while Ryanair continued to &quot;unnecessarily piss people off&quot;, in the words of Michael O&apos;Leary, Ryanair&apos;s chief executive. With O&apos;Leary taking a lower profile, Ryanair has introduced allocated seating, relaxed cabin bag restrictions, reduced charges, and loosened booking conditions. Its chief marketing officer, Kenny Jacobs, said more than a quarter of Ryanair customers were already travelling for business. He said the new tickets would not see larger seats or extra facilities, bar perhaps USB chargers on new planes: &quot;We won&apos;t be introducing a blue curtain. Customers haven&apos;t asked us for the high business fares and facilities, they just want a bit of flexibility and a better schedule. The schedule is very oriented around business travellers: places like Madrid, Milan and Barcelona have three times daily returns, so they can travel there that morning and come back the same day.&quot; Ryanair will also be flying to more city-centre airports, and signing a partnership with another global distribution system to make it easier for firms to book airline tickets for their business travellers. Ryanair&apos;s profits fell for the first time in five years last year while easyJet expects profits to rise strongly in its financial year, which ends next month. O&apos;Leary had made Ryanair&apos;s hidden charges and inflexible booking procedures a selling point to emphasise his cheap fares but consumers grew tired of his antics, forcing a rethink of strategy. Ryanair launched its summer 2015 schedule from London&apos;s Stansted airport three months earlier than last year. It announced three new routes, to Cologne, Edinburgh and Glasgow, meaning passenger numbers from the Essex airport should grow by 1.3 million to 17 million next summer. Jacobs said: &quot;What we&apos;re trying to do is get returning customers in who are thinking about next summer&apos;s holiday already.&quot; Jacobs confirmed that Ryanair would be submitting a non-binding offer this week to buy Cyprus Airways, the island&apos;s loss-making flag carrier, as it investigates expansion into the Middle East and Russia. The purchase would likely see Ryanair operate the airline&apos;s fleet of six leased Airbus planes under its existing Cypriot brand, and give it a licence to spread further. He said: &quot;It&apos;s a very strategic point in the map of Europe, a logical extension of our European route map and meets Asia and the Middle East.

The news that Godolphin has laid off staff will cause concern in Newmarket, where Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s extensive racing and breeding interests are the biggest employer and underpin the local economy. In a statement, Hugh Anderson, Godolphin\u2019s managing director, said: \u201cGodolphin today moved the horses out of one of our smaller yards in Newmarket, Highfields. \u201cThose horses have been distributed around other Godolphin or Darley training yards in the town and, as a result, a number of staff have also been redeployed within the company here or in Dubai. With fewer horses to train, there has unfortunately been a need to let a relatively small number of yard staff go.\u201d Anderson would not confirm how many Godolphin staff have lost their jobs, but later added that there will \u201cdefinitely not\u201d be any significant reduction in the number of horses Godolphin has in training. Highfields, a Grade II Listed yard, is believed to have boxes for at least 30 horses. Speculation in Newmarket on Thursday evening suggested that in the region of 20 jobs may have been lost after its closure. Highfields is one among a number of smaller stabling facilities in Newmarket which are owned by Sheikh Mohammed, in addition to Godolphin\u2019s two main training yards, run by Saeed bin Suroor and Charlie Appleby. Both trainers are believed to have between 150 and 200 horses in training and employ several hundred staff between them. Given the size of Godolphin\u2019s string in Newmarket and the scale of Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s investment in the sport, the operation\u2019s results in 2014 have been largely disappointing. Suroor saddled African Story to win the Dubai World Cup, the world\u2019s richest race, in March, but Godolphin\u2019s horses have yet to win a Group One in Europe. The operation\u2019s only Group Two successes this summer, meanwhile, were both recorded by Suroor\u2019s veteran Cavalryman, an eight-year-old. Appleby, who took over from the disgraced Mahmood al-Zarooni after the Godolphin doping scandal in spring 2013, has recorded only one European Group-race success this year, in a Group Three event at Epsom in June. Riding arrangements at Godolphin\u2019s main yards have also been in a state of flux, with Kieren Fallon replacing Silvestre de Sousa as Suroor\u2019s main rider in the spring, and Appleby adopting a policy of using the best rider available. The closure of Highfields Stable will inevitably prompt speculation in Newmarket that further changes to the Godolphin operation are imminent. The policy adopted at its main yards of separating the jobs of work-riders and grooms is thought to be under review, while Appleby is believed to be in the process of recruiting a new assistant.

An anti-bleeding medication, commonly called Lasix or Salix, it is arguably the principal drug that differentiates the US medication regime from other major racing jurisdictions. Elsewhere in the world, almost uniformly, race-day medications are banned. It is at the heart of the latest anti-medication proposal \u2013 a push to incrementally phase out Lasix in the US, prohibiting its use in two-year-old races next year with a view to expanding the ban to encompass all races the year after. The proposal was endorsed by 25 prominent trainers such as Todd Pletcher and Richard Mandella, as well as Breeders\u2019 Cup officials Bill Farish and Craig Fravel; in a call to arms to other racecourses owners, Frank Stronach, whose Stronach Group owns six US racecourses, urged a collective ban of Lasix at all tracks. Stronach subsequently announced that he would offer a series of Lasix-free two-year-old races next year at Gulfstream Park, a racecourse under the Stronach Group banner. The Pletcher-led proposal drew fire from the opposing camp. Rick Violette, president of the New York Thoroughbred Horsemen\u2019s Association, argued that \u201cthe vast majority of horses bleed\u201d and that \u201cLasix is the safest and most effective treatment we have available to treat this condition\u201d. His was not a solitary voice \u2013 the majority of horsemen\u2019s organisations in the US united against a Lasix ban. What has largely defined this long-standing tug-of-war is the belief by most on either side of the table that theirs\u2019 is the stance more aligned with horse welfare \u2013 that to ban a drug that has been proven to be effective in treating bleeders is as cruel and dangerous to racehorses as it is to administer it. But after years of intractability the latest proposal, with its ringing endorsement from so many figures in the racing war cabinet, appears to be one of the most significant pushes yet for Lasix reform. Nevertheless, with more than 90% of North American racehorses given the drug before competing, the winds of change will have to blow with some force before wholesale changes to the race-day medication rules can be brought about. Why do horses bleed? Racehorses are unique, in that they are one of very few animals known to suffer Exercise Induced Pulmonary Hemorrhage (EIPH) (more commonly referred to as bleeding), Professor Ken Hinchcliff, dean of veterinary and agricultural sciences at the University of Melbourne and co-author of a series of comprehensive studies in recent years looking into the effects of Lasix on racehorses, told the Guardian. One of the causes of EIPH is a four-fold increase in pulmonary blood pressure when horses exercise or compete. \u201cIf you take a horse out and exercise it, then the blood pressure leading from the artery on the right side of the heart to the lungs increases from about 25mm of mercury [pressure] to about 100mm of pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t see anything like this in humans, for example.\u201d  This marked increase in pulmonary pressure means that small capillaries in such horses\u2019 lungs are prone to rupture, said Paul Morley, professor of epidemiology and biosecurity at Colorado State University and co-author with Hinchcliff on a number of studies. \u201cIt\u2019s in those capillaries next to the alveoli near the bottom of the lungs that the best evidence suggests EIPH related bleeding occurs there,\u201d he said, agreeing with Hinchcliff\u2019s assessment concerning the rare biological mechanics of thoroughbreds. \u201cThrough a \u2018contraction\u2019 of the spleen, they are able to increase their numbers of oxygen-carrying red cells dramatically over what other species can do when exercising.   It\u2019s just one of many evolutionary specialisations that make the horse an exceptional athlete.   The severity by which horses bleed is graded from zero to four. At zero, an endoscopic examination (scope) of a horse\u2019s lungs shows no visible traces of blood. At grades one, two and three, the amount of blood in the lungs increases, though blood is not necessarily visible in the nostrils. At grade four, epistaxis occurs \u2013 and blood is visible in either or both nostrils. Between 0.1% and 0.2% of all starters suffer epistaxis. Those who do exhibit varying amounts of blood in the nostrils, with a few having large amounts, said Morley. He disagrees with suggestions that EIPH is painful. \u201cThere are not pain receptors of the type we\u2019re talking about in the deep portions of the lung where the bleeding occurs,\u201d said Morley. \u201cIn most EIPH events horses might have some sensation that this has occurred. For horses that have severe bleeding, they may have some sensation that there\u2019s fluid in their airways as much as if you have mucus in your airways.\u201d Nevertheless, numerous studies have linked epistaxis to sudden death in racehorses \u2013 though this is \u201cextremely rare\u201d, said Morley. According to Hinchcliff, it is very likely that all horses bleed to varying degrees, and \u201ccertainly there is evidence that most horses do\u201d. A horse\u2019s performance will be compromised if it bleeds at a level two and higher, though Hinchcliff said that the threshold is an approximate one. A 2005 study of 744 racehorses in Australia \u2013 where Lasix is banned on race-day but permitted for training purposes \u2013 found that horses that bled to a degree less than one were four times more likely to win than horses that bled to a level higher than two. Of the 415 horses in the study which developed EIPH, 273 bled to a level of one or less. These horses performed as well as a horse that had no trace of blood in their lungs, and were nearly twice as likely to finish in one of the top three positions compared with horses with an EIPH of grade two, three or four. One hundred and one horses were diagnosed with grade two bleeding, while 25 bled to grade three. Thirteen horses had grade-four EIPH. The more severe the disorder, the further behind the winner a horse was likely to place. A subsequent study of 167 South African racehorses \u2013 a like-for-like study comparing Lasix with a saline placebo \u2013 corroborated, to a certain extent, the findings of the 2005 study. Researchers found that 20% of those horses not given Lasix did not bleed, while 45% bled at level one and 25% bled at level two. Ten percent of horses examined bled to a level higher than two. Thirty-five percent of the horses bled significantly enough to impair performance, with 1% bleeding to level-four severity.  The frequency with which horses are put under the strain of strenuous exercise and the number of times they are subsequently scoped are also factors. Between 43% and 75% of racehorses exhibit signs of EIPH based on the evidence of one scope. The 2005 Australian study showed that nearly 100% of horses scoped after three successive strenuous workouts showed some bleeding by the third endoscopic exam. How does Lasix work?     Trainer Rick Violette says \u2018Lasix is the safest and most effective treatment we have\u2019 to treat bleeding in horses. Photograph: Daniel Acker/Bloomberg News    Currently, in the US, Lasix must be administered intravenously no later than four hours before a race and at a quantity no larger than 500mg. Its effects as a diuretic are swift.  \u201cA horse can pass between 10 to 15 liters of urine in the first hour after Furosemide is administered,\u201d said Hinchcliff. \u201cWhereas a horse throughout the normal course of the day would only produce about 10 to 15 liters of urine. So it markedly increases the rate of urine production.\u201d Typically, a horse given Lasix is not permitted to drink in the four hours before it races. \u201cAnd if horses aren\u2019t permitted to drink, the result in water loss is that horses are then on average 10lbs to 20lbs lighter,\u201d said Hinchcliff. \u201cIf they are permitted to drink, they rehydrate and pretty much restore their weight in a short amount of time.\u201d How Lasix is thought to work is essentially two-fold. \u201cIt results in their blood PH becoming a little bit higher so it becomes less acid, and that might be important,\u201d said Hinchcliff. The other way Lasix works, Hinchcliff said, is believed to be a consequence of water loss significantly lessening pulmonary blood pressure: \u201cIf you give a horse Furosemide, that pressure increases about three times rather than the four times as is normally the case.\u201d Lasix, Hinchcliff said, is \u201cremarkably safe\u201d for a drug administered so frequently \u2013 in the short term. \u201cWe don\u2019t see problems at the racetrack that are clearly associated with the administration of Furosemide.\u201d Rather less certain are potential long-term health consequences. \u201cThere is much speculation that Lasix might have long-term health consequences to horses,\u201d said Hinchcliff.   I\u2019m aware of no evidence that horses that have been administered Furosemide are at greater risk of any particular disease. But I think we should be cautious that there could be long-term adverse affects.   What is more certain is the drug\u2019s potency as an anti-bleeding medication. The 2009 South Africa study found that horses were three to four times more likely to have any evidence of bleeding without furosemide, and were seven to 11 times more likely to have severe bleeding without it. None of the 152 horses given Lasix bled to a degree higher than two. Is Lasix a performance-enhancing drug?     Bill Hartack rides Northern Dancer, who was given Lasix, to win the 1964 Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downs. Photograph: Jerry Cooke/Corbis    While the effectiveness of Lasix is in no doubt, question marks over exactly how it manages to improve racehorse performance lead to concerns about its role as a potential performance enhancer.  If the improvement in performance is a consequence of Lasix-induced weight loss, said Dr Richard Sams, director of HFL Sport Science, a laboratory that performs drug testing for the Kentucky Horse Racing Commission and the Virginia Racing Commission, a shadow is thrown over whether Lasix is a legitimate medication or a performance enhancer. \u201cI think the mechanism by which Furosemide allows horses to have superior performances is unclear,\u201d he said. \u201cIf the mechanism by which it allows a horse to run to its potential is because horses are running 10kg lighter, then I think the handicapper should comment on whether that\u2019s allowing horses to run to their potential, or whether it\u2019s allowing them to run beyond their potential. When you think about it, 20lbs on a horse is a big handicap.\u201d Trainers in the US have for a long time turned to Lasix to tackle the problem of bleeding \u2013 the Kentucky Derby winner Northern Dancer was given Lasix before his record-breaking performance in the 1964 race. It wasn\u2019t until the 1970s that Lasix began to fall under the jurisdiction of racing authorities, with legalisation in 14 states by the start of 1975, though with no uniformity surrounding dosage times and levels. Even back then, critics of Lasix voiced concern about its properties as a masking agent for other drugs. \u201cIn 1983, the predecessor to [the Association of Racecourse Commissioners International] adopted a resolution that banned the use of Furosemide in all of racing,\u201d said Sams, \u201cthe reason being that a lot of substances were detected with great difficulty and in some cases weren\u2019t detected at all during that period of intense diuresis [heavy urination] that followed administration of Furosemide.\u201d  Lasix works as a masking agent during diuresis, said Sams.   It dilutes the sample during the period of diuresis and makes it more difficult to find those substances that are not re-absorbed.   Opposition to the ban from trainers prompted a study that found 250mg of Lasix could be safely administered four hours before a race without affecting the detection of a list of drugs that were not permitted on race-day. This set of guidelines was subsequently adopted, incrementally, by racing jurisdictions throughout the country. \u201cWe reported back that under those conditions all of the drugs we chose to investigate were detectable in the form of our sample,\u201d said Sams. \u201cAs soon as the period of diuresis is over, the other drug or drugs are still there in the concentrations that you would find them without Furosemide ever having been administered.\u201d Since then, the permissible level of Lasix has been increased to 500mg. According to Sams, there has been no subsequent comprehensive study of the effects of Lasix on every current permissible medication; nor has there been a study determining whether the increased dosage level is similarly consequential. \u201cBut we know that with 500mg, the period of diuresis is not extended,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd since the effect is due to diuresis, I don\u2019t anticipate any substantial effect on detectability.\u201d \u2018Horses are not like fruit flies\u2019 In 1960, the average start per horse per year was 11.31 \u2013 a peak in the record books. In 1975, the year Lasix enjoyed wide introduction into many jurisdictions, the average start per horse was 10.23. In 2013, horses started on average 6.32 times a year \u2013 a statistic cited by many to prove that Lasix and other drugs are weakening the breed. Indeed, a 2004 South African study, \u201cA genetic analysis of epistaxis as associated with EIPH in the Southern African Thoroughbred\u201d, argues that EIPH is an inherited trait. Dr James MacLeod, a veterinarian and scientist at the Maxwell H Gluck Equine Research Center, urges caution before turning to genetics to produce a definitive answer. \u201cFor any given trait, one of the big questions is: \u2018To what extent are genes responsible for that issue to begin with as opposed to environmental variables?\u2019 For traits as complex as bleeding and racehorses durability, several inherited genes will likely be important, but so will a number of environmental variables. \u201cHorses are not like fruit flies that hatch and reach reproductive maturity in only 10 days \u2013 there are multiple years involved in the generation time. And so, when you think about the distribution of several deleterious genetic changes through most of the thoroughbred population, it would take much longer than the 30 to 50 years that people are saying there\u2019s been this profound drop in racehorse durability. As such, you cannot explain the drop in the number of starts strictly on a genetic model \u2013 the math just doesn\u2019t work out.\u201d     Trainer Kiaran McLaughlin is one of 25 signatories to a proposal to phase out Lasix. Photograph: Garry Jones/AP    Rather than lean towards genetics to explain the marked drop in starts, New York based trainer Kiaran McLaughlin, one of the 25 signatories on the latest proposal to phase out Lasix, believes horses are simply taking longer to recover from the diuretic effects of Lasix. \u201cI don\u2019t think like a lot of people do that [banning Lasix] will kill starts per horse \u2013 it might do the opposite actually,\u201d said McLaughlin, who in 2011 had rallied in support of Lasix.   I think people would be surprised how few horses actually bleed out the nostrils \u2013 it\u2019s really not that many. And even if some of them bleed a little bit, they\u2019re still going to perform and perform well.  For the past two years, McLaughlin has cut considerably the number of two-year-olds he runs on Lasix. \u201cOnce we know they bleed,\u201d he says, \u201cwe do obviously work them on Lasix, however, and we will sign them up for Lasix on race-day.\u201d  Only a small percentage of those which ran without Lasix bled, he said. \u201cIt\u2019s very interesting. For those two years, we scoped every horse after they ran and most horses after they worked to see where they stood, and I have to say that less than 5% of the horses we ran without Lasix bled at all,\u201d said McLaughlin, who believes his simplified Lasix programme over the past two years proves that trainers mistakenly use Lasix as a wholesale preventative rather than an imperative. \u201cI think it\u2019s abused in America to the point where 90% of two-year-olds are on it right away, so you don\u2019t know if they\u2019re bleeders or not and you don\u2019t know if they need it or not,\u201d said McLaughlin. A ban on Lasix would certainly necessitate an adjustment in the way horses are trained and raced, he said.   Maybe they shouldn\u2019t be running so often or as far or in as tough races. And if they are bad bleeders, maybe they need to be stopped on or retired.   This leads to another frequently raised comparison: that climate, training facilities and racing programmes make Lasix more necessary in the US than elsewhere.  Rick Violette alluded to the same disparity when he said \u201cto not have Lasix available for horses competing in the sweltering heat and humidity of non-winter Florida racing is a recipe for disaster\u201d. Unlike the US, where the majority of horses are trained during a short window of time in the morning within the tighter confines of the racetrack, racehorses trained in Europe are, by and large, exercised for longer and in quieter surroundings more conducive to keeping horses that bleed settled and calm.  But McLaughlin counters that the facilities used by the majority of American trainers are no different to some jurisdictions that implement a race-day medication ban. \u201cI trained in Dubai for ten years and their facilities are very, very similar to America,\u201d he said. \u201cWe trained on dirt in the heat and we went left-handed. I just don\u2019t agree with that.\u201d He said that with a known bleeder, he would try to replicate the diuretic effect of Lasix by limiting the amount of water that horse was given before a race \u2013 a practice known as drawing. \u201cWe will obviously pull their water early in the morning, try to draw them a little bit,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd at the end of the day, there are vitamins out there you can try that are legal.\u201d  According to Professor Paul Morley, however, the only proven remedy to bleeding is Lasix. \u201cThere\u2019s a whole grocery list of anecdotal testimonies suggesting what might be helpful,\u201d he said. \u201cThe only thing that really has been proven to help is Furosemide.\u201d  Nasal strips are common. You can see those in jurisdictions that allow them. There is some evidence to suggest that they maybe helpful but again, you\u2019d have to add the caveat that most of the others haven\u2019t been examined with the same level of rigor as Furosemide has.  Morley drew attention to the ethical concerns surrounding the practice of drawing a horse to replicate the diuretic effect of Lasix.  \u201cIt\u2019s possible that people could achieve a similar level of volume reduction in the vascular compartment by not watering the horses,\u201d said Morley. \u201cSo, if you didn\u2019t do that for a period of something like 24 or 36 hours, you might achieve a comparable level of volume contraction.  \u201cBut then you might ask the question, which is worse? Which would you prefer to have? Simply removing Furosemide from the field doesn\u2019t answer all the questions \u2013 it raises some as well.\u201d Lasix and British racing     British trainer Alan King, here at his Barbury Castle Stables in Swindon, has \u2018never had the need to use\u2019 Lasix. Photograph: David Davies/PA Archive/Press Association Ima    Though Lasix is banned as a race-day medication in the UK, it is permitted for use during training. Proponents of Lasix point to comments made by the trainer Nicky Henderson during his 2009 hearing for administering the anti-bleeder medication tranexamic acid, that \u201cplenty of trainers\u201d were using the banned medication, as proof that other racing jurisdictions are bedeviled with the same problem. When I asked Alan King, one of the UK\u2019s leading duel-purpose trainers with 14 winners at the Cheltenham festival, how he medicates bleeders, he argued that anti-bleeder medications such as Lasix have never been a part of his training regime. \u201cI\u2019ve never had the need to use it,\u201d he said. \u201cThough I don\u2019t think [bleeding] is as much of an issue here in this country. \u201cIf a horse is a really bad bleeder we might try to dehydrate them, take their water away the morning of a race, something like that, but that\u2019s as far as we go,\u201d he added, though he said that less than 10% of his horses bleed, and few of those are bad bleeders. \u201cMostly, we turn them out as much as we can.\u201d  Which leads back to that frequently raised suggestion: that climate, training facilities and racing programmes make Lasix more necessary in the US than elsewhere.  A question of welfare? Other prominent figures, however, approach the issue from another angle \u2013 that the very public debate surrounding Lasix is overshadowing efforts to make changes within the industry that would be more critical to racehorse safety and welfare.  Maggi Moss, who owns a large string of horses from her base in Iowa and is a long-time animal-rights advocate, said:   My concern is this: while a lot of people on this bandwagon are concerned about banning all race-day medications, I\u2019m concerned about all of the other things we\u2019re doing to horses.  As a matter of priority Moss, who says her horses are never shockwaved and are only administered intra-articular injections on the advice of veterinarians, and not to mask unsoundness, would like to see those drugs and treatments more directly tied to soundness given the same public scrutiny as Lasix. \u201cThere are too many unsound horses running \u2013 horses that need breaks, horses that should not be running and are having soundness problems masked by race-day or pre-race medications,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat about discussing shockwaving and multiple injecting? What about discussing breeding unsound horses?  \u201cWhat I see is a real problem as to the welfare of racehorses is that horses can have no after-life or pain-free life due to this sort of abuse. I do not understand why it\u2019s OK to use cortisone or shockwaving or new boutique drugs, never giving horses breaks and continuing to run unsound horses, and then [I] try to understand how Lasix became so urgent and the topic of the day.  \u201cShouldn\u2019t the welfare of the horses be the concern?\u201d ", "title": "Lasix: the drug debate which is bleeding US horse racing dry", "sentences": ["\u201cI trained in Dubai for ten years and their facilities are very, very similar to America,\u201d he said."], "publicationDate": "2014-08-31T11:00:08Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/sep/01/paul-mcginley-ryder-cup-wildcard-selection", "tags": ["Paul McGinley", "Ryder Cup 2014", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Whatever criticism may be thrown the way of Paul McGinley when announcing his Ryder Cup wild-card selections \u2013 and some is inevitable \u2013 there can be no suggestion of the Irishman making them on a whim \u2013 or, for that matter, on the grounds of emotion only. McGinley has taken levels of analysis to new levels in his quest to select the best three players to supplement what already looks a formidable European team. On Tuesday lunchtime at Wentworth the captain will reveal his chosen three. McGinley has always stressed his selections would be perfectly logical, which is entirely in keeping with his approach to captaincy. \u201cJos\u00e9 Maria Olaz\u00e1bal made a wonderful point two years ago when people were talking about, \u2018Are you going to pick a player because you like or don\u2019t like them?\u2019 He said: \u2018This is the Ryder Cup. I\u2019m here to win the Ryder Cup,\u2019\u201d McGinley said. \u201cPersonal things go out of the window and that\u2019s what it will be for me. I am prepared for the tough decisions, I am not afraid to make those.\u201d At a push McGinley had five names to consider at a Monday meeting in Surrey with his vice-captains: Luke Donald, Lee Westwood, Ian Poulter, Steven Gallacher and Francesco Molinari. On the basis that the talismanic Poulter is a certainty, that becomes two from four. Molinari\u2019s poor Ryder Cup record limits the options further; speculation, and it is only that owing to McGinley\u2019s tight grip on information, has suggested Gallacher, Poulter and Westwood will be confirmed as making up Europe\u2019s numbers. In upping the level of wild cards from two to three McGinley made specific mention of rewarding European Tour players who perform with consistency and would make a special effort on that platform to seal a place at Gleneagles. That points directly towards Gallacher, who has eight top-10 finishes this year alone and successfully defended the Dubai Desert Classic. Gallacher\u2019s stirring finish at the Italian Open on Sunday saw him fall a whisker short of an automatic Ryder Cup berth. Not only did that mark a highly impressive effort under immense pressure; crucially it drew public praise from three established European team members: Rory McIlroy, Martin Kaymer and Graeme McDowell. A Gallacher appearance in Perthshire, while not necessary, would provide an endearing local tale; his home is 35 miles from the Ryder Cup venue. The family name, via Stephen\u2019s uncle Bernard, is already warmly associated with the event. Last year Gallacher reached a play-off at the Johnnie Walker Championship at Gleneagles \u2013 it is no exaggeration to point out the climate and surroundings of Scotland in late September will hand him a professional advantage. The key consideration McGinley must give is perfectly simple. Which players will deliver points? History suggests not only Poulter but Westwood and Donald can deliver in that regard. Donald\u2019s record is superb \u2013 he has never played in a losing Walker or Ryder Cup side, a matter of course linked to his brilliance with the putter. Donald has delivered 10 and a half points from 15 Ryder Cup matches. However, if Ryder Cup teams were chosen solely on the basis of past performance, then Colin Montgomerie would still be involved. The harsh reality is Donald has provided little evidence at all that recent swing changes have benefited his career. The Englishman closed out at the Deutsche Bank Championship on Monday with a 67 but after back-to-back 74s this had the look of too little, way too late. For a player of his talent Donald\u2019s seasonal record is dismal. At the Deutsche Bank he finished outside the top 35 for a ninth time in succession. Still, McGinley would leave out Donald with a heavy heart. At the time of his appointment as captain Donald was one of those who publicly backed McGinley\u2019s cause. That was both significant and necessary as a rather dubious pincer movement sought to deny McGinley the chance to go head-to-head with Tom Watson. Westwood and Poulter have not exactly lit up the golfing spectrum themselves but there are crucial footnotes in each case. A string of injuries, which Poulter initially played through, clearly set him back at the beginning of this year. He has proved that he can rise to the Ryder Cup stage no matter the backdrop. Westwood\u2019s woes have also been slightly overstated. In high-profile events, such as the Masters and Players Championship, the 41-year-old has recorded good results. When McGinley publicly called for Westwood to display form worthy of a Ryder Cup place, the Worksop man responded with a closing round of 63 at the WGC Bridgestone Invitational and by taking the first-round lead with a 65 at the US PGA Championship. The additional value of Westwood is in the team room, where he is a known benefit to players of all ages. Donald, and this is in no sense condemnation, does not have the same presence. One man such a claim could never be levelled against is Watson, who will declare his three selections later on Tuesday. Keegan Bradley and Hunter Mahan are likely to be in that group, with Brandt Snedeker, Webb Simpson, Ryan Moore and Harris English among those looking to seal a place on the transatlantic flight. Unlike McGinley, Watson is not on the verge of disappointing a Ryder Cup veteran. \u201cVery difficult\u201d as that will be for McGinley, he will not struggle to explain it.", "title": "Paul McGinley takes reasoned route to Ryder Cup wildcard selection | Ewan Murray", "sentences": ["That points directly towards Gallacher, who has eight top-10 finishes this year alone and successfully defended the Dubai Desert Classic."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-01T20:25:44Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/sep/03/europe-usa-ryder-cup-gleneagles-2014", "tags": ["Ryder Cup 2014", "Ryder Cup", "Paul McGinley", "Tom Watson", "Golf", "Sport", "US sports"], "article": "They have the better team Paul McGinley can boast the best player in the world in Rory McIlroy. Henrik Stenson, Justin Rose and Sergio Garc\u00eda ensure four Europeans \u2013 and not a single American \u2013 sit in the world\u2019s top five. A batch of USA players are between that group and Martin Kaymer, who is 12th, but the German has roared back to form this year with wins at the Players Championship and the US Open. Tales of USA turmoil and apparently dismal status have been largely overplayed but it still remains the case, man for man, that the Europeans have the superior dozen golfers. Wild-card selections It would be unfair to suggest Tom Watson was scraping any barrels with his captain\u2019s selections on Tuesday but the choices facing the eight-time major winner were in stark contrast to his European counterpart, McGinley. There was something noticeably low-key about Watson\u2019s options and choices, whereas McGinley had a high-profile dilemma. In the end, Watson plumped for the streaky Keegan Bradley, Hunter Mahan \u2013 who has previous for folding in the heat of the Ryder Cup singles \u2013 and Webb Simpson. The third member of that group is a former US Open winner and FedEx playoff champion but clearly lacks the presence of a Lee Westwood or Ian Poulter. Some may cite Stephen Gallacher\u2019s rookie status as a cause for European concern but the Scot has proved already this year, both in Dubai and Italy, that he can handle pressure. Gallacher should revel in a home atmosphere. Europe\u2019s picks have provided 25 match wins since 2000 and should continue that trend. A stronger backroom team In public appearances thus far, McGinley has impressed far more than Watson. The USA captain was guilty of contradictory messages over the Tiger Woods scenario and has tended to ramble rather than make specific points when under the glare. McGinley is focused, direct and highly motivated. He doesn\u2019t enter into storybook tales from golfing experiences of the past, because they aren\u2019t at all relevant. Watson has a wonderful golfing history \u2013 and is a notoriously hard man \u2013 but that may count for very little when in charge of a group of players who recognise such success only via video footage. Two of Watson\u2019s assistants, Ray Floyd and Andy North, have the same potential problem of disengagement, a matter previously and interestingly highlighted by Woods. Not only is McGinley well known to all his team members, he may have pulled a masterstroke in convincing Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Olaz\u00e1bal to return to the Ryder Cup stage as a vice-captain. That duo, plus Padraig Harrington and Miguel \u00c1ngel Jim\u00e9nez, have an immediate basis for interaction with Europe\u2019s team. The conditions at Gleneagles When mentioning Perthshire in late September, it is inevitable that sceptics will point towards the probability of some rough weather. Or, specifically, some cold and damp stuff. This is actually a serious point in the Ryder Cup context. The vast majority of the USA team have no experience of a parkland course in the United Kingdom at this time of year. Even those who have excelled on a summer links, such as Phil Mickelson and Rickie Fowler, are suddenly entering a very different movie. For all that the best European players have tended to migrate towards the riches and sunshine of the US PGA Tour, there is a backstory in European set-ups such as the PGA Centenary Course at Gleneagles. It will be set up strongly in Europe\u2019s favour, with tight fairways and far slower greens than was the case, for example, at Medinah \u2013 where the visitors initially toiled badly on the greens. The burden of history OK, so it would be overly simplistic to suggest Europe will retain the Ryder Cup just because they have dominated the recent events. Nonetheless, USA find themselves in a rut from which they lack the momentum to remove themselves. Starting in 1995, the Americans have prevailed only twice against Europe. It is the kind of run which has some believing a USA success is necessary sooner rather than later to maintain wider interest in the event. Thankfully, we remain a long way short of that scenario yet. Still, the current USA team has players who bear the scars of previous disasters against Europe \u2013 Mickelson, Mahan, Jim Furyk, Matt Kuchar and Zach Johnson included. It is surely a huge leap of faith to expect Jordan Spieth, Jimmy Walker, Fowler and company to kickstart a new era of USA triumphs against Europe when away from home.", "title": "Five reasons why Europe should win the 2014 Ryder Cup | Ewan Murray", "sentences": ["Some may cite Stephen Gallacher\u2019s rookie status as a cause for European concern but the Scot has proved already this year, both in Dubai and Italy, that he can handle pressure."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-03T14:30:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/03/camel-races-gulf-munich-theresienwiese-resistance", "tags": ["Germany", "Middle East and North Africa", "Animals", "Animal welfare", "Europe", "Saudi Arabia", "Kuwait", "Qatar", "United Arab Emirates", "Bahrain", "Oman", "Dubai", "World news"], "article": "A dispute has erupted in Munich over six Gulf states&apos; plan to host a camel race on the city&apos;s Theresienwiese, the huge open space where the Oktoberfest is held every year.

I had all my dedication, everything directed to this US Open. I tried to give my best and I did. Now my best today was not where I wanted it to be.\u201d However he seemed strangely uncertain in defeat, at first refusing to confirm that he would play again this year, expressing doubt about taking part in Serbia\u2019s Davis Cup tie against India next week, then declaring he had signed for the Indian Premier League of Tennis, due to start in Dubai in December \u2013 if it starts at all. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Djokovic said of his remaining schedule. \u201cIt\u2019s too early. I don\u2019t know yet. Just got off the court. I don\u2019t know.\u201d So Nishikori could not ask for more convincing evidence that he deserves to be in this company than reducing a great player to such public despond and confusion. The 10th seed surely will hope that his growing maturity on court, allied to kind scheduling on the second Saturday of the tournament, will sustain his challenge in Monday\u2019s final. He played some blindingly audacious tennis off the ground, although his serve was unreliable at key moments. Djokovic looked to have his measure when he recovered from a close first set \u2013 the seventh semi-final in a row here when he has given his opponent the lead \u2013 to batter Nishikori for the loss of a single game in half an hour in the second. Thereafter it was a swaying struggle. However, after holding off the Serb\u2019s charge in the tie-break from 0-4 down, Nishikori was rejuvenated in the fourth set, breaking early and staying strong to the end. Djokovic made no excuses \u2013 because there were none. He was the fresher coming into the match by three and a half hours, the same margin he held over Murray before seeing him off in four sets in the quarter-finals. And the Serb rightly pointed out that the debilitating heat and humidity were the same for both of them. \u201cIt was not easy to play in these conditions,\u201d he said, \u201cbut also he had more hours spent on the court. So it\u2019s no excuse. \u201cI expected him to be able to play another five-setter because he had two days off. He hasn\u2019t played before this tournament, so he had a big break. He could prepare himself for this tournament. He played some great tennis. I congratulate him for the effort. He was the better player today. \u201cI just wasn\u2019t managing to go through the ball in the court. I wasn\u2019t in the balance. There were a lot of unforced errors [35]. Even when the ball gets back to his part of the court it\u2019s pretty short; he takes advantage of it. On the other side I didn\u2019t.\u201d Asked where he saw improvements in a player who a year ago was prone to regular injury and disappointment in big matches, Djokovic said: \u201cHe wasn\u2019t using the forehand as well as he does now. His backhand is very solid, one of the best double-handed backhands from all over the court, really aggressive. He\u2019s very quick, so he gets a lot of balls back, uses every short ball to attack. I think now he\u2019s an all-around player.\u201d", "title": "Kei Nishikori stuns Novak Djokovic to reach US Open final in four sets", "sentences": ["Now my best today was not where I wanted it to be.\u201d However he seemed strangely uncertain in defeat, at first refusing to confirm that he would play again this year, expressing doubt about taking part in Serbia\u2019s Davis Cup tie against India next week, then declaring he had signed for the Indian Premier League of Tennis, due to start in Dubai in December \u2013 if it starts at all."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-06T19:26:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/07/marin-cilic-roger-federer-nishikori-djokovic-us-open", "tags": ["US Open Tennis 2014", "Roger Federer", "US Open tennis", "Tennis", "US sports", "Sport"], "article": "This US Open always had the feel of tumult about it \u2013 but nobody thought Kei Nishikori and Marin Cilic would be making history together in Monday\u2019s final, leaving in their wake two legends of the modern game, the world No1, Novak Djokovic, then Roger Federer, who has won here five times but might not now, at 33, win that 18th career major that has eluded him for two years. Nishikori beat Djokovic 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-3 then a rumbling thunderstorm by mere minutes to reach his first grand slam final. A few hours later, 25-year-old Cilic, too long a prodigy, also secured his debut in the final of a major, using a swirling early-evening wind under threatening skies and his own intuitive tennis to beat Federer 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 in just an hour and 45 minutes, ending the Swiss\u2019s rejuvenated dream of one more grab at glory. The Croat, resisting 12 Swiss aces, also tamed Federer at the net, where he has been having increased success, and finished the job in front of a stunned Arthur Ashe court with a perfect single-handed backhand down the line, his beaten foe\u2019s trademark shot. As if ordered up by the tennis gods, the skies again grew dark, like a curtain closing on an era. Maybe this really is the point in the evolution of the game where the insurrectionists take over, when the likes of Federer, Djokovic, Andy Murray and the absent Rafael Nadal no longer can presume to be the lords of the final weekend in grand slams. \u201cIt was just an amazing day for me to be able to play like this,\u201d Cilic, seeded 14, said. \u201cI never dreamt of such a day. It was the best performance ever in my career.\u201d Looking forward to Monday\u2019s final, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a sensational day for both of us. I\u2019m just going to enjoy it.\u201d Federer praised his opponent after the match: \u201cHe served great when he had to, played with no fear, full of confidence.  \u201cIt\u2019s exciting to have different faces [in a slam final] from time to time. I\u2019m more surprised with Cilic, to be honest, because he\u2019s older. There are significant differences in his game from the first time I played him when he was 17. Kei I always thought was an unbelievable talent.\u201d  Federer was disappointed but not shattered to be denied a shot at another slam, and said he would \u201cgive it a good go\u201d at the Australian Open. John McEnroe was impressed by Cilic: \u201cHis groundstrokes were awesome.\u201d Earlier, there were similar flashes of brilliance from Nishikori. Seeded 10 but playing like a champion, the 24-year-old Japanese player did to Djokovic in four sets in the heat of the day what Murray could not do to him in the still of the night over the same distance in the quarters \u2013 so he has much to be proud of. As he left the site, he heard Cilic had taken a two-set lead \u2013 the second match in a row that Federer has looked down and out, but this time falling short. He will know, too, Cilic was a set and 5-1 up against Murray here in the fourth round two years ago and lost. He will be aware of his own 5-2 career record against Cilic. And Nishikori will know one more thing: history is on his racket. If he takes his chances, as he has done in his past three matches \u2013 and never with more conviction than when outlasting the world No1 \u2013 he can become the first Asian man in the Open era to win a grand slam title. He is already the first to reach a final, in fact, the first to reach a semi\u2011final. He is also the first Japanese man to reach the US semi-finals since Ichiya Kumagae the year the first world war ended. This is a pleasing curve for a most pleasant individual, and he said later: \u201cI hope they were staying up to watch me, even though it was four o\u2019clock in the morning.\u201d They surely were. He already had received 20 personal messages. If he wins the final, there might be a few ratings records broken in Japan. Nishikori revealed he did not think he would even be in the tournament after he had surgery for the removal of a cyst in August. \u201cI only started playing points a few days before the tournament,\u201d he said. \u201cI didn\u2019t even know if I would come to New York. I wasn\u2019t expecting anything. But, after [two matches], I had more confidence in my foot and [played without pain]. I was starting to slide a little more. But my tennis was there already.\u201d He claimed to have no preference for an opponent in the final, reflecting confidence that has grown since he broke into the top 10 for the first time, in the summer \u2013 although he admitted he did not relish a fifth set against Djokovic. \u201cI believed if it went to a fifth set I didn\u2019t think I could run. Very happy to finish in four sets.\u201d Despite this, Nishikori might be the fresher of the finalists, even though getting from the fourth round to the final has demanded 14 very tough sets from him. He will be the one with the quality tennis in the bank, having completed a hat-trick of wins against the fifth seed, Milos Raonic, the third seed, Stanislas Wawrinka, and now Djokovic, who was so drained and desolate afterwards he hinted that this might be his last match of the year. He has been asked many times if his marriage to Jelena Ristic after winning Wimbledon in June and the pending arrival of their first child had distracted him, and was firm in his protestation to the contrary. However, he seemed strangely uncertain in defeat, at first refusing to confirm that he would play again this year, expressing doubt about taking part in Serbia\u2019s Davis Cup tie against India next week, then declaring he had signed for the Indian Premier League of Tennis, due to start in Dubai in December \u2013 if it starts at all. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d Djokovic said of his remaining schedule. \u201cIt\u2019s too early.

One World Trade Center, finally approaching completion after 13 years of trauma and backbiting, has become a familiar, serene sight to New Yorkers \u2013 from a distance, at least. Up close, at the foot of the tallest building in America, it\u2019s a different story. Trucks pull in and out of construction sites. Commuters trek through scaffolding and mazes of blue tarp. Office workers shove aside dawdling tourists, or try to. Advertisements promise forthcoming luxury boutiques, while street merchants sell New York Police Department jackets for dogs. It is at once a place of frenzy and flatness. From some angles it looks like the future of New York \u2013 from others, not like New York at all. In the plaza that many New Yorkers still call Ground Zero, two towers are open for business: 7WTC, a smaller building north of the site completed in 2006, and 4WTC, a sublime new office building to the east. But 1WTC \u2013 thankfully no longer called the \u201cFreedom Tower\u201d \u2013 has had its opening pushed back several times, and now seems set to welcome its first tenants in early 2015. Two further towers are deferred: 3WTC has had construction halted at eight storeys, while 2WTC has not yet begun to rise, and may never.     One World Trade Center seen from Fulton Street in the financial district    Also delayed is a new public transportation terminus for the World Trade Center site: the PATH (Port Authority Trans-Hudson) train, which connects Manhattan to New Jersey. Designed by Santiago Calatrava \u2013 currently being sued by his hometown of Valencia in connection with his crumbling Palau de les Arts \u2013 it should open in 2015, a full six years behind schedule, and comes with a $4bn (\u00a32.5bn) price tag that exceeds the initial budget twice over. And sitting in the middle of all of this is the memorial: two gargantuan fountains, each filling the exact footprint of one of Minoru Yamasaki\u2019s destroyed towers, ringed by bronze railings bearing the victims\u2019 names and set in an oversized, largely bare quadrangle. The only building on the superblock where the towers once stood is a small pavilion leading into the underground National September 11 Memorial Museum, which finally opened in May complete with airport-style security checkpoints. Greenwich Street, a north-south axis eliminated by the old twin towers superblock, may have been reestablished to connect the site with Tribeca to the north. But the World Trade Center has not yet cohered into an organic, constituent part of the city. Office workers are nearly absent on the giant parvis, while tourists snapping selfies on the site of a mass murder stick to a few well-trafficked routes, beelining down Liberty Street and Vesey Street, as if the place was divorced from New York\u2019s thrumming grid. You would have thought that, 13 years after the attacks of 9/11, the outcome of the largest and most closely watched building project in the United States would be clearer. But the World Trade Center is still in limbo, its future as uncertain as New York\u2019s.     One World Trade Center reflected in the glass facade of Four World Trade Center    A global, national and local catastrophe The murder of nearly 3,000 people on 11 September 2001 was a national and international disaster. So were the wars and retributions that came after. But it was also a local catastrophe with an immediate political impact: it redeemed New York\u2019s unpopular mayor, Rudy Giuliani, and opened the door for the election of Mike Bloomberg, the second Republican in a row in this overwhelmingly Democratic city. And there were hellish consequences for downtown\u2019s infrastructure and economy; this was an attack on buildings and streets and tunnels and infrastructure, and its consequences not just political but urban too. In the wake of the attacks George Pataki, a Republican then serving as governor of the state of New York, established the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation (LMDC), a commission of experts tasked with disbursing federal funds and supervising reconstruction efforts. The LMDC was challenged to imagine a new World Trade Center, but it also had to satisfy two big stakeholders: the site\u2019s owner, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey (a laughably incompetent and allegedly corrupt agency that also manages New York\u2019s decrepit airports and bus terminal), and Larry Silverstein, a billionaire real estate developer who had leased the twin towers in a privatisation scheme in July 2001, and thus had a legal right to rebuild. Pataki, who in those years of terror and illiberalism deluded himself that he might be president one day, milked his moment in the spotlight by insisting that \u201cwe will never build where the towers stood. They will always be a lasting memorial for those that we lost.\u201d It was the first of many political decrees with direct, and not altogether salutary, urban consequences. From the start, the new World Trade Center could not be a living place that also memorialised the dead. It had to make their deaths visible at demagogic scale, 180 feet square times two.     One World Trade Center from the top of Four World Trade Center    Such was the backdrop for the design competition, a roller-coaster of an architectural showdown that brought out the worst in New York. A first round of entries was thrown out. Many big names stayed away \u2013 Rem Koolhaas, always the smartest man in the profession, figured out fast that he\u2019d have more luck building in China. And the two finalists offered strongly divergent masterplans.  One, featuring a sunken memorial surrounded by a ring of five towers, came from Daniel Libeskind, who declared himself \u201cthe people\u2019s architect\u201d and took to wearing an American flag lapel pin at meetings. The other proposed a pair of massive, ghostly latticework structures, with a museum, a conference centre and theatre suspended above the twin towers\u2019 footprints. This ambitious, less commercial proposal (which Libeskind publicly called \u201cStalinist\u201d) was the work of Think, an ad hoc international team led by Rafael Vi\u00f1oly, Shigeru Ban and especially the late Frederic Schwartz, a civic-minded architect often called the conscience of Ground Zero, who attended every meeting and ceremony and spoke frequently to victims\u2019 families. On 25 February 2003 \u2013 three weeks before the start of the Iraq war, which George W Bush tried to wage in the name of the World Trade Center dead \u2013 the LMDC chose Think, and informed Schwartz and Vi\u00f1oly that they had won. They thought the decision was final. But the next day, Pataki and Bloomberg overruled their own committee (\u201cThere\u2019s no goddamn way I\u2019m going to build those skeletons,\u201d Pataki told its chairman). Libeskind suddenly got the job, setting in motion all the compromises and confusion that have come since. By overruling his own committee, and by imposing Libeskind\u2019s more traditional sequence of towers over Think\u2019s innovative lattice structure, Pataki played directly into the hands of the man who more than anyone has shaped the new World Trade Center. That man is Larry Silverstein, a developer who not only sued his insurers for a double payout (there were two planes \u2013 pay me twice!) but also United and American Airlines for allowing the hijackers onboard. Proprietor of the twin towers for less than two months before they were destroyed, Silverstein has since pressured federal, state and city governments for billions of dollars in subsidies and tax abatements, shovelling risk and expense on to the public while ensuring profits accrue to himself. A grandmaster of state capitalism, Silverstein has held on through the endless delays, defections and budget overruns, outplaying not just Libeskind but the Port Authority too, and leaving no one in doubt that the most public tragedy in New York\u2019s history took place on his private construction site. Silverstein is no philistine \u2013 he is a significant philanthropist in New York \u2013 but he was not about to let aesthetic concerns override financial ones. On his watch, Libeskind\u2019s designs were simplified almost to the point of disappearance, minimising their jagged forms into corporate quiescence. 1WTC \u2013 which Pataki (not Libeskind, as is often erroneously assumed) smarmily christened the \u201cFreedom Tower\u201d \u2013 would henceforth be designed by David Childs of the mega-firm Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill. The pinnacle height remains 1,776 feet (after the year of the Declaration of Independence), but only thanks to an accounting trick: that measurement counts the antenna. Libeskind, after suing Silverstein and then settling with him, still has the title of master planner of the World Trade Center, even though almost nothing on the site is his idea.     The new New York skyline: Lower Manhattan from the Empire State Building    A tranquilised New York The tallest tower may glint on the New York skyline, but the site itself has receded from the public imagination. Delays became commonplace, markets collapsed, and major developments that should have stoked democratic anger elicited, in Bloomberg\u2019s tranquilised New York, only bored acceptance. Back in 2006, at the end of his 12-year governorship, Pataki and Bloomberg brokered a deal to have the Port Authority take over construction of 1WTC, providing Silverstein a huge cut in rent on the remaining towers. It made New Yorkers perpetual landlords of a commercially unviable goliath, but nobody cared. Even when Occupy Wall Street electrified downtown New York in the autumn of 2011, neither the protesters nor their antagonists paid much attention to the giant tower rising one block away, which has cost $3.8bn in public funds \u2013 the world\u2019s priciest skyscraper by far, more than twice the cost of the world\u2019s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai \u2013 and is at least partly to blame for climbing tolls on the city\u2019s bridges and tunnels and a lack of funds to repair the city\u2019s reprehensible infrastructure. In Libeskind\u2019s original vision, 1WTC was to be a jagged asymmetrical spire, rhyming somewhat with his fractured Jewish Museum in Berlin or Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. Under Childs, it has become a leaden, compromised behemoth, whose chamfered corners resolve into a ho-hum sequence of triangular curtain walls. It\u2019s tall, you can give it that \u2013 but at ground level, and for 15 storeys above that, 1WTC is a grim, unfenestrated fortress, cloaked in glass but made of concrete, on the orders of the New York Police Department. The post-2001 security state is inscribed on the World Trade Center, in visible and invisible ways. The new buildings incorporate extra emergency stairwells and bomb-resistant cores, while the streets are studded with bollards, and well-armed officers patrol the memorial square. Silverstein has redeemed himself somewhat with the opening of the first of his three large towers \u2013 one of the finest works of architecture to arise in New York in years. At 978 feet, 4WTC is the seventh tallest building in New York, but unlike other recent skyscrapers \u2013 Renzo Piano\u2019s New York Times headquarters in Midtown, say, or the outrageous One57, a supertall condo for absentee billionaires \u2013 Fumihiko Maki\u2019s tower, composed of two blocks of broad dark glass, withdraws into the sky and almost disappears on sunny days. 4WTC also has a commercial facade facing Church Street, one block east of the memorial, which will reportedly host a branch of the gourmet Italian food market known as Eataly, whose mobbed Chelsea location sees legions of gluttonous patrons snapping pictures of themselves with imported hams. Here you can see New York\u2019s urban future more clearly: luxuries before necessities, consumption as culture \u2013 this is the grand Bloomberg legacy, and it is written across downtown everywhere from Broadway to Battery Park. As for 2 and 3WTC, their fate remains uncertain, since nobody seems too keen on leasing in the buildings that are already on the market. Cond\u00e9 Nast, publisher of Vogue and the New Yorker, has rented 25 floors in 1WTC, aided by millions of dollars in tax incentives \u2013 the Port Authority even took on Cond\u00e9\u2019s current lease in Times Square. But despite the cachet of Anna Wintour and friends, 1WTC remains almost half empty. In the last three years, just one private company has inked a lease in the tallest building in New York, an advertising agency that took the 87th floor. The 16 floors beneath that are all yours if you want them, though even after a price chop last spring they\u2019re still $69 a square foot, well above market average.         A timelapse film of the construction of One World Trade Center, courtesy of EarthCam    4WTC, which belongs to Silverstein even while being funded with $1bn in financing from the Port Authority, had no renters for years except the city of New York and the Port Authority itself. (This May, 4WTC finally landed a private sector tenant, another ad agency.) 3WTC, designed by Richard Rogers, now seems a goer after yet another ad agency, this one a WPP subsidiary, signed on as principal tenant. 2WTC, Norman Foster\u2019s, has had interest from bailed-out Citigroup but nothing definite. But economics were never the motivating factor at the World Trade Center at least on the government\u2019s side. Lower Manhattan lost approximately 11 million square feet of office space on 9/11, but the 5 million square feet of 1 and 4WTC got dumped on the market in the wake of Lehman Brothers\u2019 collapse, which led to significant restructuring in the financial sector \u2013 traditionally the biggest renters downtown. The urban design of the World Trade Center has always been negotiated at the unhealthy conjunction point of sentimentality and commerce, with political and emotional desires jostling against hard-edged business motives. Cannier private developers have played that sentimentality to their advantage. Public interests have not been so lucky. Short straw If you really want to see how the public drew the short straw at the World Trade Center, go underground. Public transportation should have been the glory of any downtown redevelopment: nearly all of the city\u2019s subway lines converge in Lower Manhattan, along with the commuter train from New Jersey. Yet in the summer of 2014, commuters are still trudging through a maze of temporary structures, while the World Trade Center Transportation Hub, designed by the disastrous Calatrava, languishes unfinished. The hub has metastasised into by far the most expensive rail station in history, an insane $4bn for a low-traffic terminus (the city\u2019s 10th busiest) that doesn\u2019t even expand capacity. Half a decade overdue, outrageously over-budget, the final design will not even incorporate Calatrava\u2019s spiffier elements: the \u201cwings\u201d of the roof that could be opened on sunny days are now non-functional. It is a bona fide catastrophe, especially considering the woeful state of New York\u2019s subways; a new line along Second Avenue has now been delayed for 85 years.     One World Trade Center    Then there are the memorial and museum, which have had mixed fortunes. The museum, which opened in May and elicited criticism for its exhibitions and its tacky gift shop, has been attracting visitors \u2013 out-of-towners mostly \u2013 despite its $24 admissions charge (a consequence of he-said she-said bickering between federal and local governments as to who should support the institution). Its main exhibition spaces lie down at bedrock, facing the huge slurry wall that kept the Hudson River from flooding the lower levels of the twin towers, and which held fast on 9/11. Whatever the museum\u2019s faults, this moist industrial wall, stretching 68 feet up, is something to see. It is the one major evocation of the original World Trade Center that remains on site, and the only place where I feel the sadness, hope and civic righteousness that the new World Trade Center ought to inspire. Libeskind\u2019s masterplan would have placed the memorial to the dead against the slurry wall, but that got scrapped too. Instead it is at street level, in a massive new square whose few trees and benches don\u2019t do enough to make it work as a public space. The memorial, designed by Michael Arad, does at least evade the rightwing kitsch of some other 9/11 commemorations (nearby is a despotic bronze statue of an American soldier on horseback, paid for by private funds). But its remembrance-for-dummies style \u2013 the names of the dead plus waterfalls, at the giant scale Pataki demanded \u2013 hasn\u2019t commended it to New Yorkers, and while it looks alright from the 57th floor balcony of 4WTC, at ground level it remains divorced from the fabric of the city. On three visits this summer, I found the site busy every day. Children run about, untroubled by the security apparatus, and the volume is loud; it is a site of amusement rather than meditation. Fine, but then where are the office workers, where are the apartment dwellers of Battery Park? If it isn\u2019t contemplative, shouldn\u2019t it be urban? What should have been the centre of a massive redevelopment, one for locals and visitors alike, has instead become a lacuna in New York\u2019s grid, a foreign exclave in the middle of a city of eight million. As for the future of culture at the World Trade Center, that may be the trickiest problem of all. Numerous cultural institutions, among them the Signature Theatre, the Drawing Centre and the now-defunct New York City Opera, had envisioned a move downtown. But during the planning process Pataki, still in presidential-wannabe mode, proclaimed: \u201cWe will not tolerate anything on that site that denigrates America, denigrates New York or freedom\u201d \u2013 and this threat of censorship was enough to send many prospective tenants packing. A site is still designated for a cultural institution, but its location between 1WTC and the PATH terminal guarantees headaches for construction, and Frank Gehry, the project\u2019s initial architect, was dismissed last week. Still, there will be Eataly, there will be 50 different kinds of olive oil to buy! In the city that Bloomberg made, that may be culture enough.     The view from 4WTC    Street-level politics When the pit was at last cleared, the remains of the dead accounted for and the carcinogenic rubble carted away, New York was ready to wager that thoughtful, ambitious urban design could make the city whole again \u2013 or remake it, actually, as something even better than the financial capital disrupted by Yamasaki\u2019s superblock. It didn\u2019t happen. But 13 years on, it\u2019s easier to see the World Trade Center as something more complicated than an autonomous urban design debacle. Rather, it is a symptom of larger urban conditions that, even with the election of the leftwing Bill de Blasio as our new mayor, show no signs of abating.  In the early 2000s, lower Manhattan was principally a site of trauma. In 2014 it evokes other, fresher troubles, among them massive income inequality, the impunity of the financial sector, a do-nothing Congress and a state government corrupted beyond redemption, and a record tourist influx that\u2019s the flipside of the city\u2019s gentrification and pacification. Politics play out on the level of the street. Aesthetics and design are not enough. Ultimately, the moral of the new World Trade Center is that you can\u2019t just plug an urban scheme into a grid and wait for results. You need community, solidarity and civic virtue \u2013 ideals that flickered for a moment in the hazy, uncertain days of late 2001, but that disappeared in the era of Bloomberg and were replaced by the privatisation and oligarchy that are the hallmarks of the 21st century.  Public infrastructure has languished while private arrangements have grown. Billions and billions of public dollars have been drained while private cash has been hoarded. And New York now has a modestly improved street plan, one great tower, a few OK ones, an acceptable museum, an unworthy memorial, a scandalous transit hub and, sooner or later, a lot of new places to shop. The World Trade Center: it could have been worse! But if that\u2019s all we expect from New York, then maybe we should move somewhere where the average rent isn\u2019t $3,451 a month.

The announcement comes following a summer-long push to tackle FGM at the UK&apos;s borders. Officers at Gatwick airport say they have made a &quot;significant impact&quot; after specially trained child protection squads teamed up with police to target specific flights this summer. Joe Cuddy, the senior Border Force officer at Gatwick, leads training sessions there for more than 70 officers. He said a small number of cases involving a potential cutter had been referred to police. In one instance a man was found entering the UK with photograph of a family, a bloodied cloth in a ladies&apos; handbag in his luggage, and a jar containing dirty water and sand, which they suspect was used to clean a blade. Investigations into the man are ongoing, but Cuddy said there was a suspicion the paraphernalia could have been used as &quot;proof&quot; for someone in UK that a potential future bride had been cut. FGM involves removing part or all of a girl&apos;s outer sexual organs and is carried out in many African countries as well as areas of the Middle East. &quot;Instead of the girls being removed from the UK to go back to the country of origin to have this procedure carried out, now there are cutters travelling from the country of origin to the UK to carry it out in London and in other cities,&quot; Cuddy said, &quot;That is an emerging trend that we have found as a result of this initiative.&quot; Cuddy said he hoped for a &quot;positive outcome&quot; in a couple of such cases that had been referred to police. The operation has seen the implementation of an 80-strong team of specialist child protection officers at Heathrow and teams of 65 at Gatwick and 21 at Manchester. The officers are also trained to deal with trafficking and forced marriage. A new team has been put in place at the port of Harwich in Essex, with specialised FGM training also planned at the ports of Calais and Dunkirk, and at Birmingham, Stansted and London City airports. The Home Office said no specific figures were yet available, but staff at Gatwick said as part of Operation Eris \u2013 launched in July \u2013 more than 30 families had been stopped and several referrals had been made. Last year, when the safeguarding teams had not yet been set up, no referrals were made during the same period. &quot;We have worked hard to make people aware of what we are doing, and for those who might have been thinking about doing this, they now now that operations are taking place on the border. That is not tangible but is important for prevention,&quot; said Cuddy. The beefed up teams focus on flights to and from high risk destinations, such as Gambia and other African nations where FGM is practised. Other flights to locations which act as travel hubs, such as Istanbul and Dubai, are also targeted. During a routine operation on Wednesday, Border Force agents stopped and talked to passengers arriving from Istanbul, asking for details about their journeys. One woman travelling from Sudan, where she said she and her children had been for a wedding, was stopped and her children were also questioned. &quot;It does require different skills,&quot; said Angie Fishwick, a senior officer. &quot;We are enforcement officers, but when it comes to this we have to go softly because there is nothing more important than the safety of the child.&quot; The team of largely female officers, nicknamed &quot;the Gatwick Angels&quot;, are committed to their task. &quot;We are all women and we are part of that message \u2013 saying this should not be happening. End of,&quot; said Fishwick. Her colleague Sharon Morris added: &quot;We are not going to save the world.

His passion for travel has not only informed his lessons and assemblies, but has also inspired students to follow in his footsteps by organising their own educational trips abroad, from The Netherlands to India. I spend my six-week holidays travelling to broaden my mind and the minds of my students. When I came out of university I went into banking for four years. I felt like it was very cloak and dagger and not on the same side as the customer. I wanted to sell geographical learning; instead of using secondary resources, such as textbooks or the internet, I thought there was no better way to do that than by seeing and experiencing the things I teach about first hand. I have been to 55 countries and my aim is to go to every country on the planet. I didn\u2019t like the idea of just taking photographs which find themselves at the bottom of the cupboard and are never looked at again. What I really wanted to do was take three or four weeks to get out and see things. If students see me maximising my opportunities, they will want to do the same. You go to school every day and work until you are 70 so you need to do things you enjoy and get fulfillment out of. You should aim to achieve beyond expectations of the generation above you. You have got to be able to take the opportunities on offer. I began writing about my travels to make lessons more engaging. When I first started interrailing around Europe, I would write journal-style travel books. I then went on to write a children\u2019s story based on my travels in China, an essay on Australia and a graphic novel about Malaysia using all my holiday photos. I also wrote an anthology of poems about New Zealand called NZ09. I am no expert, I have just gone out, learned and experienced. I immersed myself and challenge them to now do the same. That really fuelled a few things. Firstly, it meant I no longer had to rely on my textbook in class. In geography lessons I can bring up pictures and videos of things which I have experienced. My students have been the driving force behind over 50 educational trips abroad. We started 12 years ago in the Netherlands and then went to Dubai. Now we are going to India in October. I give the kids free rein to organise the trips, as long as it is within our syllabus. I let the children champion the projects, for example calling the travel agents to work out which destination is best value for money. I simply stand behind them for support. At the end of the day though, it has to be of value to the learning. The students therefore draft letters to send to parents outlining the links to the geography curriculum exam. From studying world cities such as Mumbai to alternative birth control and recycling, it\u2019s really cross curricular. Nothing gives students the experience of awe and wonder better than travelling. It\u2019s the idea that you can stand on a glacier in Norway or the Great Wall of China and it will be a life-changing experience. I am more of a physical geographer, but explaining how my jaw dropped when I walked round the corner and saw the Duomo in Florence for the first time is breathtaking. It\u2019s an emotional experience. I am just a guy standing on an assembly stage, but to see me being clearly affected by the experience is an inspiring thing for students.  We are citizens of the world and this planet is small so you have to try and take as much in as possible. In the end you are going to be sitting down and doing an exam. To inspire learning and get the child to want to take the subject on board and go further with it, all you have to do is make it relevant and engaging. Then you must support them to get them where they want to go. Travel has worked for me to achieve that aim and use as a teaching tool.  Assemblies don\u2019t have to be boring. They\u2019re a great way to motivate children for learning. I\u2019ve brought in dogs to teach animal training, done a stage dive to help the kids build trust, as well as turned the lights off and given everyone glow sticks to teach about beats and rhythm. Assemblies have to take place every day, but the majority are very stolid. You won\u2019t really be awake. You\u2019ll ask children what the assembly was about and they won\u2019t really know. I see it as a chance for everyone to get to know each other, be entertained and to launch the day. I don\u2019t have any behaviour problems when kids have seen me doing something special in an assembly. They are more interested. You\u2019ve got to make the kids want to learn and be involved.

I am not going to the beach. I am not carrying diapers, or a yoga mat, or multimedia recording equipment, though I might be carting around a thin laptop and my iPhone and an apple and a pair of rock-climbing shoes. I am a young, urban-dwelling male, and a canvas bag with straps on it is essential to my daily existence.  I own somewhere over a dozen. There are larger bags, good for grocery shopping (thanks Christie\u2019s, even though I can\u2019t afford any of your art). Some have flat bottoms, perfect to keep balanced on tilting subways. Others are decorative, just large enough for a magazine. The tote communicates my attitude toward the day as much as it helps me carry things, and I don\u2019t care what you think about how it makes me look. But I do think you should carry one, too. With apologies to Freud, my tote obsession has nothing to do with purse envy. Don\u2019t call it a \u201cmurse\u201d or a \u201cman-bag\u201d, two derogatory terms for what is clearly its own practical, potent genre. It is time for gentlemen everywhere to embrace this necessary vessel and overcome their shame, to shout from the rooftops: I\u2019m a tote bagger, and I am proud. Somehow, a square of cloth sewn shut into a pouch and given arm-straps and maybe a logo has inspired a deep current of anxiety in the male population. The tote has \u201cfeminine connotations\u201d, according to Reddit. \u201cIs it gay for a guy to carry a tote at school?\u201d wonders a user at Yahoo Answers. Even Styleforum, that den of menswear fashion, has gotten in on the embarrassment. \u201cI am afraid to just carry the [leather tote bag] in my hands as I am worried it would look like a handbag,\u201d writes Baby Pink, a username that seems like it would carry even more, uh, baggage about effete anxiety. Yet tote bags were originally as manly as could be. LL Bean designed the modern tote\u2019s first ancestor in 1944 with the Bean\u2019s Ice Carrier, a hefty bag made of reinforced cotton for carrying giant blocks of ice from \u201ccar to ice chest\u201d. How much more rugged can you get? These days, we\u2019re more likely to be carrying a book and a spare sweater for the incipient cold weather than ice, but tote bags are no less useful. An entire industry has grown around purses. But everyone has a lot to carry around every day. No amount of Apple Watches is going to change the burden of having to carry around wallets, keys, ChapStick tubes, headphones, and whatever else for days and nights out in the city. Women have a long tradition of being able to chuck everything into a big, beautiful bag, and the fashion industry supplies the goods. I believe men should feel comfortable doing the same \u2013 and after decades of settling for backpacks and briefcases, perhaps the right bag was always just an NPR telethon away. Apart from convenient storage, the tote bag can function in the city as a similar kind of social semaphore to cars in the suburbs, signaling who you are, where you\u2019ve been, or just how much you hate using the plastic bags at Trader Joe\u2019s. Totes trigger the most opportunities for informed flirting since ebooks destroyed our ability to know what other people are reading on the subway. Want to attract artists? Grab a bag from the nearest museum \u2013 if you\u2019re in New York, the Whitney has a great one, though in a pinch any recent art fair will do, with extra points if it was in Dubai or whatever. You could pick a tote bag that signals your increasingly irrelevant grad school career, or else pledge allegiance to the corporation that owns your soul. If you can\u2019t find anything else, the creative agency that hosted that Fashion Week party probably gave one out, right? Totes are a chance to say something about yourself. Like, for instance: I enjoy intellectual literature \u2013 or want to appear as if I do! Bags from the literary journal n+1 are a popular choice. The New Inquiry\u2019s sleeper-hit Valentine\u2019s Day tote, perfect for declaring your male-feministness, features a man getting impaled by a very literal interpretation of the female gaze. If you stand outside the offices of the Paris Review long enough, literary tote bags are said to simply bloom around you like dandelions in the spring. Aspirational or ironic, cotton, waxed canvas or all-leather (if you\u2019re really hardcore) \u2013 you never really know which tote will emerge as your favorite, or what you might use it for. One friend, who requested anonymity, threw up into a beloved South by Southwest tote bag during an unfortunate cab ride home. Messy, but so much neater than out the window, and better for the driver as well. The bag did have to be thrown out afterward, however. It\u2019s OK; totes are meant to be transient. So, guys, please calm your gendered fears. Tote bags are just useful accessories. All you need to carry one is confidence, and once you start, there\u2019s no turning back. Soon enough, like me, you will be stashing tote bags inside other, larger tote bags, wondering if anyone has gotten around to inventing a rotating tote rack, like the one your dad has in his closet for ties.

Feeling unloved, overworked and ignored, endies are becoming disillusioned with their lot, according to a report from the Centre for London that suggests there are now about a million modest earners in the capital. Hollow Promise: How London is Failing its Modest Earners and What Can Be Done About it \u2013 which is based on quantitative research and in-depth interviews with families on modest incomes \u2013 paints what it claims is an alarming picture of the pressure on &quot;squeezed-middle&quot; households, those on low to modest incomes who are not entitled to most benefits. It finds that most &quot;endies&quot; are struggling to make ends meet and few are managing to save. The authors note: &quot;While &apos;endies&apos; don&apos;t complain, they are increasingly disenchanted with the political system. Unless London does better by them, the city&apos;s politics could easily turn sour.&quot; The report claims that low- to middle-income workers have been hit hard in the capital because rents are around 50% higher than in the rest of the UK. For households with incomes between \u00a320,800 and \u00a328,500 a year, rental costs have risen 4% in real terms over the last decade. Rent now accounts for about 41% of their incomes. It warns that &quot;endies&quot; who do not own a home have almost no chance of buying one. &quot;There are now only three boroughs \u2013 Tower Hamlets, Newham and Barking and Dagenham \u2013 where home ownership is potentially affordable for two people earning that borough&apos;s median wage,&quot; the report says. Other costs in the capital have soared. Between 2008 and 2014 trips using pay-as-you-go Oyster cards rose in price by 61% for bus journeys and 47% for the underground. A zone four resident on an annual salary of \u00a322,000 spends the first 55 minutes of their working day just paying for their commute to and from work. Between 2001 and 2011, the average London fuel bill rose by more than 50% above inflation. Nursery care for a child under the age of two is 25% more expensive in London than elsewhere in Britain. A London couple with one child need a second earner with wages of at least \u00a317,000 to make full-time childcare cost-neutral. &quot;As this report shows, London is failing its modest earners,&quot; said Ben Rogers, director of the Centre for London. &quot;They take pride in working hard, and make an essential contribution, but as their wages have deflated, the cost of living in the city has shot up. Yet there are a range of innovations that could help make life easier for London&apos;s hard-pressed working families \u2013 above all through developing a new generation of decent affordable homes in good quality neighbourhoods.&quot; David Lammy, MP for Tottenham, said the report was the first to show how lower middle earners in London had been particularly hard hit. &quot;We need a new agenda for London&apos;s middle earners \u2013 one which will help boost their earning power while reducing housing, transport and other costs.&quot; Charles Leadbeater, the report&apos;s author, said few &quot;endies&quot; could leave the capital. &quot;The vicious combination of very flexible and competitive labour markets and a very distorted housing market means they&apos;re not just under pressure but trapped. If you look back at the 1980s people in these positions would probably be able to afford houses in a way they can&apos;t now.People&apos;s costs have gone up much more sharply.

But if, say, you are a teaching assistant working in Walthamstow you are working really hard just to stand still.&quot;He suggested the capital&apos;s complexion would suffer if things continued. &quot;Zone 1 inside the Circle Line will become like Dubai. It will be inhabited only by cosmopolitan people who come to London to spend money.&quot; Leadbeater, a former adviser to Tony Blair, warned that there would be &quot;a political price&quot; to pay unless the needs of endies were addressed and a new generation of well-designed affordable homes in good quality neighbourhoods were created. &quot;Endies think Aldi and Lidl address them, but no one else.

The story goes that Ma fixed on the name of his soon-to-be-floated Chinese e-commerce business \u2013 dubbed China&apos;s Amazon and eBay combined \u2013 while sitting in a San Francisco cafe. He was considering calling it Alibaba and asked a waitress what the word meant to her. When she said &quot;open sesame&quot;, the idea of a door to a treasure trove seemed to fit his grand ambitions. Now those ambitions are being fulfilled as Alibaba becomes the largest-ever listing on the New York Stock Exchange. Fifteen years after the fledgling business failed to rustle up $2m from Silicon Valley, Alibaba will be raising $21bn or more and will be valued at around $160bn, with dealings due to start next Friday. But it is not all plain sailing. Alibaba reported second-quarter earnings of $2bn, up 46% on a year ago, although growth in active users showed signs of slowing. China&apos;s e-commerce market is expected to continue booming, with less than half the population online, but Alibaba faces growing competition from the likes of Baidu and Tencent. And investors may be wary of possible problems with Chinese censorship and regulations, as well as the control exercised over the company by Ma and his senior managers. There has already been controversy over the 2011 sale of Alibaba&apos;s payment business, Alipay, to a company controlled by Ma. Reputations riding on the iPhone 6 Amid all the razzmatazz of Apple&apos;s latest launch \u2013 including a live performance from U2, and iTunes account holders receiving the band&apos;s new album whether they wanted it or not \u2013 it is easy to forget that the success of the iPhone 6 and Watch is crucial for its chief executive, Tim Cook, and highly paid retail guru, Angela Ahrendts. It is also important for chip designer Imagination Technologies, a key supplier to Apple, which issues its latest trading update on Wednesday. The company has had a volatile time, with worries about weak licensing and falling royalty rates. A statement in June showed it beating expectations amid growth in new deals for smartphones and other products, but analysts still expect a dip in profits this year from \u00a323.7m to around \u00a322m. Imagination Technologies will drop out of the FTSE 250 at the market close on Friday after recent share price weakness, particularly since June&apos;s sale of a 9.3% stake for \u00a352m by Intel. So investors will be keen to hear about the company&apos;s progress, especially for its newly launched 64-bit central processing unit, as well as its thoughts on Apple&apos;s future sales. Asos must dress to impress shareholders With London fashion week now well under way, online retailer Asos is hoping to come back into style with investors. Once a stock market darling, the company issued two profit warnings in six months, prompting fears that its stellar growth had peaked. Shortly after the second one, in June, it suffered a warehouse fire in Barnsley, which damaged around 20% of its stock and prompted it briefly to stop taking orders. Its shares have lost 60% of their value since the start of the year, despite a recent upwards blip on vague talk of a US takeover bid, and continue to be under pressure amid concerns of further bad news to come. So investors will be looking for reassurance from Tuesday&apos;s update, especially about currency effects relating to its overseas sites. The recent strength of the pound had forced it to offer steep discounts in markets such as Russia, one of the reasons for the June warning. News on Asos&apos;s soon-to-be-launched Chinese site is also being keenly awaited. As for any takeover, that would partly depend on 27% shareholder Bestseller, a Danish fashion group that is variously said to be keen to sell, or alternatively keen to snap up the rest of the group.

Military capability is not a problem: Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Qatar together have hundreds of advanced fighter aircraft, though the six-member Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) has next to no experience of coordination. Politically, however, fighting with the US would require greater determination than they have yet shown to tackle the jihadis who have sent shockwaves across the region. Offers of help \u2013 most likely from the Emiratis and Saudis \u2013 attest to the gravity of the situation. Washington may be cautious given that the Iraqi military has extensive experience of working with the US but none with the Gulf states. The UAE is the most assertive country in the GCC and recently sent jets to Egypt to bomb Islamist targets in Libya. But the more reluctant royals in Riyadh may prefer to be told they can make a more useful contribution in counter-extremism messaging, bankrolling Iraqi tribes or training Syrian rebels. Both will be worried about whether they can trust Barack Obama to follow through after high tension over his policy on Iran and his inconsistent approach to the Syrian war, culminating with his failure to act when his own &quot;red line&quot; was crossed last year with Bashar al-Assad&apos;s use of chemical weapons. Both also fear that crushing Isis will bolster Iran and its allies or proxies in Baghdad and Damascus and trigger a Sunni backlash. They will heed the influential Qatar-based Egyptian preacher Yusuf al-Qaradawi, who is often seen as a mentor of the Muslim Brotherhood and who criticised Washington&apos;s role in the campaign against Isis as purely &quot;self-interested&quot;. The US has made clear that Iran&apos;s participation in the coalition would not be appropriate because of its staunch support for Assad. But Iran is helping the Iraqi government fight Isis, using Shia militias it has long backed. Signs of difficulties are already emerging. Turkey&apos;s refusal to allow its bases to be used for air strikes is one. And in Egypt over the weekend, the president, Abdel Fatah al-Sisi, made clear he wanted to see an effort against other extremists, including Ansar Bet al-Maqdis, a jihadi-type group active in the Sinai peninsula. Sisi&apos;s friends and backers in the UAE and Saudi Arabia also back action against hardline Islamist fighters in Libya \u2013 some of them backed by their Gulf rival Qatar. Gulf officials have been talking up a new era of cooperation. &quot;But there are still many unknowns about how the coming months \u2013 and years \u2013 will unfold,&quot; said Theodore Karasik of the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis in Dubai. &quot;Specifically, one misstep by the United States in leading the coalition against Isis will quickly erase the goodwill witnessed over the past week.&quot; Other commentators highlight a gap between Obama&apos;s pledge to &quot;degrade and destroy&quot; Isis and the political and practical difficulties of forging an effective alliance to work with the US. &quot;The Arab and Turkish allies being herded into the coalition do not inspire a great deal of enthusiasm or confidence, I am sad to say \u2013 genuinely sad, because only dynamic and effective local action will defeat IS and other deviant and dangerous dimensions of our societies,&quot; wrote Rami Khouri in the Beirut Daily Star. &quot;John Kerry looks less like the maestro of a united orchestra and more like a strong-willed sheriff assembling a half-hearted posse of scared locals to chase a dangerous bad guy.&quot; And defeating Isis would not end the troubles of the Arab world, noted Stratfor, a strategic consultancy. &quot;The United States might be able to help loosen the Islamic State&apos;s grip in Syria and Iraq,&quot; it said, &quot;but it is unlikely the regional players will simply move forward and seamlessly establish a new regional order to contain the sectarian conflict.&quot;", "title": "Arab cooperation is symbolic win for US, but uneasy allies face many tests", "sentences": ["&quot;But there are still many unknowns about how the coming months \u2013 and years \u2013 will unfold,&quot; said Theodore Karasik of the Institute for Near East and Gulf Military Analysis in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-14T19:45:49Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/15/rory-mcilroy-ryder-cup-fedex-cup", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Ryder Cup 2014", "Ryder Cup", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Rory McIlroy is well enough versed in the success of Tiger Woods to fully appreciate the level of mental intensity associated with the 14-times major winner\u2019s previous dominance of golf. More than that, this year has offered McIlroy a practical snapshot. McIlroy\u2019s failure to claim the FedEx Cup in Atlanta on Sunday was hardly a disaster. Those who had paid close attention to him in recent weeks would have seen traces of the mental fatigue which is a natural consequence of a stunningly successful summer. By his own admission, McIlroy could not summon the energy for one final tilt at glory. Competing comes at a cost. McIlroy has only appeared at the FedEx play-off finale twice, this year and in 2012, with opportunities to claim the $10m (\u00a36.1m) bonus attached to victory evading him on both occasions. \u201cI really wanted to win,\u201d he said. \u201cI really wanted to cap this year off well, even though it\u2019s still been a great year. I was coming in with really high hopes and expectations, and I haven\u2019t quite been able to play the golf to live up to those. \u201cIt\u2019s still been a great season for me and there\u2019s still a little bit of golf left. I\u2019m looking forward to this little bit of time off and getting back at it, maybe next weekend, to get ready for the Ryder Cup.\u201d The Open and US PGA champion\u2019s year is far from over. McIlroy will compete at the Ryder Cup and in individual events in Bermuda, Dubai, China and Australia before the end of 2014. Sunday at East Lake looked like an important moment, though, with McIlroy feeling the strain of four FedEx events in succession. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long four weeks,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cYou know, if I had to do it all over again, I probably would have taken a week off somewhere in this stretch of tournaments. \u201cIt\u2019s tough because these sponsors that are sponsoring the tournaments and the FedEx Cup play-offs, they\u2019re putting up an awful lot of money to get the best players in the world to their event. Not that you feel obliged, but you want to support the events, you want to show up and give the sponsors something to be happy about and proud of. \u201cI\u2019ve got a great relationship with BMW and that was probably the only reason why I did play in Denver [at the BMW Championship] last week. But at the same time, if I had to do it again, I probably would have taken a week off just to feel a little fresher coming to Atlanta.\u201d The back-to-back FedEx series is unlikely to be repeated. It was understood to be the idea of Tom Watson, who wanted a clear break before he leads the United States into the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles from Friday 26 September. Two years ago, the Tour Championship immediately preceded the Ryder Cup, a matter Watson identified as troublesome during his discussions over the USA captaincy. That is notable, given the number of players who have made it clear that a hectic tournament run this time around has taken its toll. \u201cI think a week off will do a lot of us a world of good,\u201d said McIlroy, who was far from alone in citing East Lake tiredness. \u201cIt really will. As I said already, I don\u2019t want to see my clubs for a few days and I\u2019ll pick them back up again probably at the weekend. \u201cHaving these five days off is going to be big and I think a lot of guys will do the same thing. I don\u2019t think tiredness or fatigue will play a part in the Ryder Cup,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cNow that all this is over, I\u2019ll start thinking about it a lot more over the next few days and obviously get very excited about it. It\u2019s a great way to get right back on the horse and get back at it. It\u2019s always a phenomenal week and I\u2019m sure it\u2019ll be the same this time.\u201d", "title": "Rory McIlroy needs break after FedEx excess to recharge for Ryder Cup", "sentences": ["McIlroy will compete at the Ryder Cup and in individual events in Bermuda, Dubai, China and Australia before the end of 2014."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-15T12:47:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/sep/16/pat-cosgrave-risk-worldwide-ban-unpaid-costs", "tags": ["British Horseracing Authority", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "Pat Cosgrave, who successfully persuaded the British Horseracing Authority (BHA) not to reciprocate a four-month ban imposed by the Emirates Racing Authority (ERA) earlier this year, could be forced to pay nearly \u00a335,000 if he wants to continue his riding career in Britain after the ERA placed him on its forfeit list for failure to pay fees and legal costs relating to the case. Under the BHA\u2019s rules, any individual on the forfeit list of a major racing nation such as Dubai would normally be considered a disqualified person until the debt is discharged. However, the BHA said on Tuesday that Cosgrave \u201chas exercised his right to make an application that the penalty not be reciprocated and he has been granted a stay with regard to the enforcement of the disqualification until close of play Monday 22 September, by which time he should have provided BHA with the ground on which his application would be heard.\u201d Cosgrave was initially banned for six months by the ERA after he was found guilty of improper riding in the Group One Jebel Hatta. Cosgrave, riding Anaerobio for Mike de Kock, appeared to make way for his stablemate Vercingetorix, the favourite for the race, who went on to win comfortably. His suspension was reduced to four months at a subsequent appeal before the BHA\u2019s disciplinary panel agreed that it should not be reciprocated in Britain, but the ERA has continued to pursue him for legal costs despite the partial success of his appeal. Should his latest application to the BHA fail, Cosgrave could face a ban from riding until he has paid the amount being demanded by the ERA. Even if it succeeds, meanwhile, he could be forced into a similar process in order to ride in other racing jurisdictions. \u201cThe fact is that Pat, as it currently stands, isn\u2019t willing to and isn\u2019t able to pay nearly \u00a335,000, which is the costs award in Dubai,\u201d Paul Struthers, the chief executive of the Professional Jockeys\u2019 Association, said. \u201cWe just need to go through the process at the BHA before we say any more but we will have a lot more to say about it because it\u2019s a very worrying situation when it comes to the disciplinary processes in Dubai. \u201cWe did invite the ERA to withdraw the costs award, whilst raising numerous concerns about the rules and procedures and the decision to award costs against Pat despite him being successful at least in part at the appeal panel.\u201d Struthers also revealed that Silvestre de Sousa, who won the Dubai World Cup, the world\u2019s richest race, on Godolpin\u2019s African Story in March, also faces being placed on the ERA\u2019s forfeit list. \u201cIt relates to his appeal against a careless riding finding and the appeal was actually against the penalty imposed,\u201d Struthers said. \u201cSilvestre\u2019s costs [owing to the ERA] are nearly \u00a320,000 and that\u2019s in addition to his own personal costs for his legal team. They have warned him this week that, if he doesn\u2019t pay, he will go on the forfeit list.\u201d Cosgrave and De Sousa are just the latest jockeys to potentially suffer significant bans or financial loss after being found in breach of running and riding rules abroad. Richard Hughes, Britain\u2019s champion Flat jockey, and Martin Dwyer have also been involved in long-running cases arising from incidents in India in recent seasons. \u201cWe\u2019re approaching the time of year when jockeys are planning to go to foreign climes for the winter,\u201d Struthers said. \u201cI think jockeys, not just British jockeys but jockeys based anywhere in the world who may be riding in Dubai this winter, should be looking very closely at what is going on. \u201cThe various examples of incidents overseas over the last 12 to 18 months have all been very high-profile and certainly serve as a warning to jockeys venturing overseas. Largely the processes and procedures and rules in Britain are very fair and that isn\u2019t always mirrored overseas, even in some jurisdictions which covet the biggest owners and the best trainers and jockeys.\u201d Sea The Moon, who was the clear favourite for the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe before suffering the first defeat of his career earlier this month, has been retired from racing due to injury. It was announced on Saturday that Sea The Moon, who won the German Derby by 11 lengths, would miss the rest of the season but there were hopes that he might return to the track as a four-year-old.

The former chief planner of the City of London should know about such things, having presided over the results of both. Over the last 30 years, he has ushered in a menagerie of their monuments, from the Gherkin and Cheesegrater to the Walkie-Talkie and Heron Tower, during which time he has seen a significant shift in the balance of power. \u201cWhen I arrived in the job in the 1980s, the big banks were in control of London,\u201d he says. \u201cBut now it\u2019s the big house-builders. We\u2019ve gone from being ruled by Barclay\u2019s bank to being controlled by Berkeley homes.\u201d Left unchecked, the banks went off the rails in spectacular fashion, as they sprayed money into the great mortgage mirage. And now property developers have been allowed to follow suit. Fuelled by the dazzling wealth of investors from Russia, China and the Middle East, who they turned to when the banks stopped lending, their steroidal schemes are causing irreparable harm to our cities. Across the country \u2013 and especially in superheated London, where stratospheric land values beget accordingly bloated developments \u2013 authorities are allowing planning policies to be continually flouted, affordable housing quotas to be waived, height limits breached, the interests of residents endlessly trampled. Places are becoming ever meaner and more divided, as public assets are relentlessly sold off, entire council estates flattened to make room for silos of luxury safe-deposit boxes in the sky. We are replacing homes with investment units, to be sold overseas and never inhabited, substituting community for vacancy. The more we build, the more our cities are emptied, producing dead swathes of zombie town where the lights might never even be switched on. Developers have bounced back from the crash with bigger plans than ever before, acquiring vast areas of land with the ambition to operate like the great estates of yore. Framed with the cuddly terminology of \u201clong-term stewardship\u201d and \u201cadding value\u201d, they are merely mimicking those aristocratic fiefdoms, recasting the city as a network of privatised enclaves. The landed families of Grosvenor, Portman and Cadogan have been joined by a breed of corporate giants like Lend Lease, CapCo and Ballymore. The latter is overseeing the \u00a32bn transformation of Nine Elms into a high-security zone of luxury flats around the new American embassy, that will apparently \u201cdraw inspiration from the attractive residential and commercial estates which evolved over time in cities like New York and Boston\u201d. CapCo is building its \u00a38bn kingdom across a 30-hectare swathe of Earls Court, while Lend Lease is ruling Elephant and Castle, Argent is reshaping Kings Cross, and most of Victoria is now controlled by Land Securities. The list goes on.     A view of the Nine Elms redevelopment, which is getting a \u00a32bn transformation into luxury flats. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    They have been accompanied, and often outbid, by a newer kind of international development force, supercharged by the untold riches of sovereign wealth funds, national pension funds and the gushing pump of petrodollars. The Qataris, who bailed out the Shard and snapped up the Olympic Village, have been joined by the growing appetite of Malaysian and Chinese investors. Malaysian consortium SP Setia acquired Battersea power station for significantly more than its competitors could muster, while China\u2019s recent property supermarket sweep includes such sites as Wandsworth\u2019s Ram Brewery and a \u00a31bn deal for the Royal Docks. These inflated land deals, with foreign buyers ready to pay over the odds, are spawning a new form of equally oversized and exclusive developments.  Bankers have faced our collective wrath, but what about developers? The economy goes in fickle booms and busts, cycling merrily through bubbles and crises, but cities, built in concrete and steel, generally stay put. What we are making now, we will all have to live with for a very long time. The iniquities of the banking crash have been intricately unpicked, but the wilful destruction of the places where we live and work remains something of a mystery. We may rant and rage against ugly additions to the skyline, but what of the mechanisms that are allowing it to happen? How did it come to this? The principal reason can be traced to the fact that awarding planning permission in the UK comes down to a Faustian pact. If the devil is in the detail, then the detail is Section 106 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, a clause which formalised \u201cplanning gain\u201d, making it in the local authorities\u2019 interests to allow schemes to balloon beyond all reason, in the hope of creaming off the fat of developers\u2019 profits for the public good. Introduced as a negotiable levy on new development, Section 106 agreements entail a financial contribution to the local authority, intended to be spent on offsetting the effects of the scheme on the local area. The impact of a hundred new homes might be mitigated by money for extra school places, or traffic calming measures. In practice, since council budgets have been so viciously slashed, Section 106 has become a primary means of funding essential public services, from social housing to public parks, health centres to highways, schools to play areas. The bigger the scheme, the fatter the bounty, leading to a situation not far from legalised bribery \u2013 or extortion, depending on which side of the bargain you are on. Vastly inflated density and a few extra storeys on a tower can be politically justified as being in the public interest, if it means a handful of trees will be planted on the street.     China\u2019s recent property sweep includes a \u00a31bn investment in London\u2019s Royal Docks. Photograph: HayesDavidson    \u201cCouncil chief executives will allow schemes to be pumped up as much as they can go before they get political push-back from councillors,\u201d says one planning officer from a London borough that has suffered from a recent a spate of towers. \u201cAnd the worst schemes happen when there is no political resistance at all.\u201d It is a system that is all too open to political pressure, given that any officer who advises against a new development can be conveniently framed as \u201canti-growth\u201d, heartlessly preventing a promised tidal wave of new public amenities from flooding into the borough. Based on negotiation and discretion, the result is entirely down to the individual planning officer\u2019s ability to squeeze out as good a deal as they can get, a battle that all too often ends in the developer\u2019s favour. The results of such botched bargaining can be seen sprouting up across London\u2019s \u201cregeneration\u201d hot-spots, such as Elephant and Castle, where the council is attempting to transform the maligned mess of the roundabout into an \u201cexciting destination\u201d. With shimmering golden fins rising into the skies, the 37-storey tower of One the Elephant promises to \u201cset new standards for contemporary London living\u201d. It is one of the flagship projects by Australian developer Lend Lease in the \u00a33bn transformation of the area. But take a closer look, and it seems the new standards it is setting comprise an impressive ability to avoid providing any affordable housing at all. Such second-class accommodation would of course require its own \u201cpoor door\u201d entrance and circulation and, according to a council report: \u201cThe cost of construction would increase with the introduction of a further lift, as well as separate access and servicing arrangements.\u201d Bypassing Southwark\u2019s requirement for 35% affordable housing \u2013 which would have meant around 100 units \u2013 Lend Lease has instead contributed \u00a33.5m in lieu towards the construction of a community leisure centre next door, which will cost \u00a320m to build. A triumph for the public good, you might think, until you realise that the equivalent cost of building 100 affordable units would have been around \u00a310m, three times what the developer paid. Pressure group 35 Percent \u2013 which campaigns for the borough-wide policy of 35% affordable housing to be enforced in Elephant and Castle \u2013 estimates that, in the six biggest schemes in the area, developers have avoided paying \u00a3265m in off-site affordable housing tariff payments required by policy. And of the 4,282 new homes being built, just 79 will be social rented (ie. managed by registered providers for those on low incomes).           Video: the local business view of Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s planned new stadium.    The same story is repeated the other side of town, where Haringey awaits the momentous arrival of Tottenham Hotspur\u2019s new \u00a3400m football stadium. This bulbous mothership was promised to bring 200 new homes, half of which would be \u201caffordable\u201d, and an abundance of public benefits to the area. But, once again, the affordable component has been mysteriously waived, replaced with 285 flats for solely private sale, while the Section 106 contribution has been reduced from an agreed \u00a316m to just \u00a3477,000 \u2013 a token contribution towards transport improvements. The system has spawned a whole industry of S106 avoidance, with consultancies set up specifically to help developers get out of paying for affordable housing at all scales of development. Section 106 Management, set up by solicitor-turned-developer Robin Furby, is one such company that offers a service to small-scale developers, promising \u201cto establish the profitability of your project and thereby reveal unviable Section 106 obligations\u201d. Its website displays a list of case studies proudly showing how much they have helped developers dodge, and boasting of planning permissions achieved \u201cwithout any contribution towards affordable housing\u201d at all, saving \u201ctens, if not hundreds of thousands of pounds\u201d. So what exactly does it mean when a property developer pleads poverty? \u201cIf the profit margin for your scheme is pushed to below 17.5% by Section 106 payments, you should talk to us,\u201d says the website. Other consultants promise to safeguard 20% profit margins and upwards, before any Section 106 contributions are even considered. If a scheme is declared \u201cunviable\u201d, it simply means \u201cwe\u2019re not getting our 20% profit so why should we bother\u201d. The power of the policy to leverage affordable housing has been further eroded since the introduction of community infrastructure levy (CIL) in 2010. A non-negotiable fixed-rate tax on new development, CIL was intended to introduce more transparency and give developers a level of certainty about how much they would be expected to contribute towards infrastructural improvements. But, in reality, it has provided another excuse to dodge Section 106 obligations. A further change to the town planning act last year has made Section 106 agreements renegotiable, allowing review and appeal of all existing obligations, in a misguided attempt to promote growth \u2013 which simply makes it easier for developers to wriggle out of their promises, as happened in Tottenham and elsewhere. \u201cNot surprisingly, developers are now even keener to renegotiate the S106 after they\u2019ve got planning permission, finding they can\u2019t negotiate the CIL,\u201d says Peter Rees. \u201cIn most cases, they manage to prove that they can no longer afford to pay for the affordable housing that they agreed \u2013 it\u2019s simply \u2018not viable\u2019 any more.\u201d One planning officer puts it succinctly: \u201cThere has never been a worse time to give schemes consent, in terms of securing public benefit.\u201d In all cases, how developers prove what they can afford to pay for comes down to the dark art of \u201cviability\u201d. The silver bullet of planning applications, the viability appraisal explains, through impenetrable pages of spreadsheets and fastidious appendixes, exactly how a project stacks up financially. It states, in carefully worded sub-clauses, just why it would be impossible for affordable housing to be provided, why the towers must of course be this height, why no ground-floor corner shop or surgery can be included, why workspace is out of the question; indeed, why it is inconceivable for the scheme to be configured in any other form. Presented as a precise science, viability is nothing of the sort; it is a form of bureaucratic alchemy, figures fiddled with spreadsheet spells that can be made to conjure any outcome desired.     London\u2019s \u2018Cheesegrater\u2019 building is at the forefront of the City of London\u2019s planned cluster of tall towers. Photograph: Oli Scarff/Getty Images    \u201cCouncils just don\u2019t have the expertise to challenge viability reports,\u201d says one senior planning officer. \u201cWe can\u2019t argue back.\u201d Instead, they can commission viability assessments, produced by the same consultants that work for developers, to determine whether the report is accurate \u2013 but not to propose an alternative. The figures may well stack up, but it doesn\u2019t mean the scheme could not be designed in a different way, which would still guarantee the developer\u2019s 20% profit margin. \u201cYou only have to modify one of the variables very slightly to get completely different outcome,\u201d says one planning consultant. \u201cYou can very easily go from something being rip-roaringly viable to completely unviable by tweaking something very modestly. If a planner doesn\u2019t understand that, they\u2019re not going to do very well.\u201d Evidence suggests that is all too often the case, judging by the number of planning officers\u2019 reports that diligently conclude a scheme would simply be unviable if it was obliged to fulfil the policy objectives. With calculations often undisclosed for reasons of commercial confidentiality, councils are forced to blindly accept the developers\u2019 figures as the ultimate de facto truth, allowing their own policies to be flagrantly breached. \u201cI\u2019ve never been confident in reports that I\u2019ve received on viability,\u201d says one planning officer, describing how the big property consultancies operate as something of a cabal, with one wary of challenging another\u2019s figures. \u201cEvery consultant that\u2019s advising a local authority is hoping to advise a developer tomorrow. If they put the boot in on a big development scheme, they simply won\u2019t be hired again.\u201d A relatively new field, viability has been given increasing weight by the government\u2019s National Planning Policy Framework, introduced in 2012, which slashed 1,300 pages of policy down to 65, as part of the coalition\u2019s triumphant bonfire of red tape. The NPPF introduced a \u201cpresumption in favour of sustainable development\u201d, which sounds innocuous enough \u2013 but as Rees points out, \u201cthe definition of \u2018sustainable\u2019 has nothing to do with green issues or energy at all. It means one thing: commercially viable.\u201d Immune from public scrutiny, viability assessments have rightly come under fire for clouding the accountability and transparency of what should be a statutory public process. Their confidentiality is closely guarded, in order to preserve developers\u2019 trade secrets, but where the sale of public assets is concerned, there is increasing pressure for the books to be opened.     Southwark\u2019s Heygate Estate is to be replaced by a redevelopment with far fewer social-rented homes. Photograph: Dan Kitwood/Getty Images    One such case recently ended in victory for housing campaigners, when after two years of fighting, which culminated at a tribunal, Southwark Council was ordered to disclose the viability assessment produced by Lend Lease over its controversial redevelopment of the Heygate Estate. The 15-year project is seeing more than 1,200 mainly social-rented homes on the post-war estate replaced with over 2,300 units, only 25% of which will be classed as affordable, with just 79 flats for social rent. Many leaseholders were subject to compulsory purchase orders so low they have been forced to move to the far reaches of outer London, their decent-sized two-bed flats valued at under \u00a3150,000, while the new homes of \u201cElephant Park\u201d will be sold for prices reaching \u00a3420,000 for a one-bed apartment. The figures explaining why this was the only feasible way to develop the site were safely locked away in the viability appraisal, which Southwark fought tooth and nail to keep secret. The borough has been particularly keen to keep financial details under wraps since it accidentally disclosed it had sold the entire nine-hectare site for just \u00a350m, having spent \u00a344m on moving residents out \u2013 while estimating its gross development value at \u00a3990m. \u201cWithout some commercially sensitive information remaining private, developers could simply refuse to work with councils, leaving boroughs without the housing and regeneration we all need,\u201d says a spokeswoman for Southwark Council. The borough brought a legal challenge against a decision by the Information Commissioner\u2019s Office last year ordering the council to disclose the full details of the viability report, after a freedom of information request was denied. Southwark argued that full disclosure would \u201cdamage regeneration\u201d, while Lend Lease, in a defence that verged on farce, pleaded the human right to \u201cpeaceful enjoyment of its possessions\u201d, arguing that disclosing the viability assessment would amount to \u201cunjustified interference with this enjoyment\u201d. The tribunal concluded that the information must be disclosed, stating that \u201cthe importance \u2026 of local people having access to information to allow them to participate in the planning process outweighs the public interest in maintaining the remaining rights of Lend Lease\u201d. It sets an encouraging precedent for campaign groups battling similar situations elsewhere, from Greenwich Peninsula to Earls Court \u2013 where the information commissioner has supported further disclosure of viability assessments on gargantuan regeneration schemes.

From a pair of \u00a31,600 Olympic opening ceremony tickets to a \u00a31,250 trip to the lavish Mipim property fair in Cannes, these sponsored outings were reported to have joined a lengthy list from the previous year of Proms tickets and dinners at the Ivy, paid for by at least 10 other companies. Developers getting into bed with local authorities might usually happen behind closed doors, but at Mipim the conspicuous chumminess was proudly on show along the Croisette for all to see. In the wake of headlines decrying public money being spent on councils attending the champagne-soaked jamboree, their private \u201cdevelopment partners\u201d have been more than willing to step in and foot the bill. With a borough\u2019s presence at Mipim costing up to \u00a3500,000, developers happily pay for glistening city models, trade show booths and yachts, where cakes iced with their logos are handed out by mayors. More than 20 local authorities took part this year, with developers sponsoring everything from a \u201cCroydon on the beach\u201d cocktail party to an entire \u201cManchester bar\u201d, where public-private relationships could be cemented by free-flowing booze. \u201cThe boroughs might be proud that they\u2019re not here at the public\u2019s expense,\u201d says housing campaigner Jake Freeland, who held a protest in Cannes this year. \u201cBut that\u2019s precisely the problem. They\u2019re in the pockets of the investors, and they\u2019ve come here to sell off our city.\u201d Developers have long thrown parties and funded foreign trips as a way of lubricating their plans through the system, but the quest for permissions now extends into the statutory planning process itself, through the rise of deals known as planning performance agreements. Introduced to help fast-track large, unwieldy schemes through the system, PPAs see the applicant pay for a new dedicated position in the council\u2019s planning team to focus solely on their application, guaranteeing a faster turnaround and a better \u201cbespoke\u201d service. Capital and Counties Properties (Capco) paid over \u00a32m to Hammersmith and Fulham council under a PPA to have its \u00a38bn redevelopment of Earls Court assessed, while similar deals were reached for Westfield and Hammerson\u2019s \u00a31bn plans for another mega-mall in Croydon, as well as Argent\u2019s \u00a32bn redevelopment of King\u2019s Cross.     The \u00a38bn redevelopment plans for Earls Court extend across an area of 30 hectares. Photograph: Jo Blason    \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with planning performance agreements,\u201d says one planning officer. \u201cIt\u2019s just like allowing people to travel club class. You pay for a better service.\u201d Quite whether club-class planning should be offered by a statutory pubic service is questionable, but developers have few qualms about throwing money at an authority, spitting out as many applications and fees as are necessary to see a project through. \u201cWe pay vast sums of money to have things determined quickly,\u201d says the director of one major development company. \u201cWe pay the planner\u2019s salary, cover their lawyers\u2019 fees and everything, but we wouldn\u2019t expect preferential treatment. It\u2019s not a bribe.\u201d Under the coalition\u2019s localism agenda, the wheels for private-sector encroachment into public planning have been further oiled, with the introduction of neighbourhood plans. Presented as a means of empowering communities, they have in fact left the door wide open for canny developers to move in, host a few community coffee mornings with felt-tips and post-it notes, and engineer a plan to their own advantage. There is no requirement for those who draw up the plan to even reside in the neighbourhood and, although they need a 50% \u201cyes\u201d vote at referendum, there is no requisite minimum turnout. But such a tactic would require at least cursory engagement with the community and the council, something which many developers are increasingly choosing to bypass altogether. Since the introduction of the NPPF, there has been a sharp rise in the number of planning applications won on appeal, as many applicants choose to go straight to the inspectorate, conscious of the new \u201cpresumption in favour\u201d of development. Rather than being the last resort option, after negotiations with the local authority have broken down, the process of planning by appeal has become a tactic in itself. One developer is particularly candid on the matter: \u201cPlanning decisions are so often the result of political wrangling at committee anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cWhy would you waste months negotiating something to get the planning officer on side, when they can\u2019t guarantee delivery at planning committee?\u201d On appeal, it comes down to a battle between planning lawyers, the judgement often determined by who can afford the best representation. When the Rolls Royce legal team of the private developer meets the quivering case officer of the emasculated public sector, its not hard to guess the outcome. Developers with bigger ambitions are choosing to bypass the local authority in a different way, by going straight to the top and playing for a \u201ccall-in\u201d \u2013 waving their schemes under the nose of the mayor of London or secretary of state. Such a situation has emerged at Mount Pleasant in north London, where the Royal Mail Group has proposed a fortress-like scheme of 700 flats, only 12% of which will be affordable. The site straddles the boundary between Camden and Islington, both of which have a target of 50% affordable housing. Boris Johnson ignited local fury when he called the scheme in earlier this year to be determined by his planning team, describing it as a \u201cbeautiful design \u2026 and a wonderful place to live\u201d before the local boroughs had even turned it down.     The Royal Mail Group has proposed a fortress-like scheme of 700 flats on its Mount Pleasant site.  Photograph: Matt Dunham/AP    \u201cIt is hardly surprising that the mayor has called this in,\u201d says Duncan Bowie, lecturer in planning at the University of Westminster. \u201cThe mayoral planning process is based entirely on achieving the maximum number of housing units on any given site, aimed at selling to an international market. The London-wide target of building 42,000 new units per year is predicated on a lot of very high density developments that don\u2019t even comply with the mayor\u2019s own policies on density.\u201d The same thing happened at Convoys Wharf in Deptford, where a \u00a31bn proposal for 3,500 units (of which just 15% will be affordable), in the form of three towers rising up to 40 storeys, was called in by the mayor after the Hong-Kong based developer wrote a blustering letter complaining of planning delays. The scheme was approved in April, against the advice of the local authority and the cries of heritage groups. \u201cIt\u2019s common practice to play the mayor off the borough,\u201d says one senior planning officer. \u201cWe recently had one vastly oversized scheme that we\u2019d spent months trying to tame, then we had a meeting with the GLA planning team, and their first response was \u2018why not make it taller?\u2019\u201d Driven by tick-box housing targets, the GLA merrily rubber-stamps whatever comes its way, yet most of these schemes are doing nothing to help the housing crisis, given the fraction of \u201caffordable\u201d homes they include are still out of reach of most, at up to 80% of market rent. \u201cDevelopers have quickly latched on to the fact that, even if they can\u2019t get local authorities to approve schemes, they can get them through the mayor or the government,\u201d says Peter Rees. \u201cThe bigger the better. And they know that they\u2019ll happily allow towers to be built outside designated clusters.\u201d     Click here to see our interactive graphic of how Vauxhall is changing    As deputy prime minister, John Prescott personally approved both the Shard and the Vauxhall Tower, the latter against the decision of the planning inspector and after strong warnings from his advisers that it \u201ccould set a precedent for the indiscriminate scattering of very tall buildings across London\u201d. How right they were. With a 50-storey shaft already on the skyline, the council was in no position to refuse further skyward ambitions. The GLA, keen to seem \u201cstrategic\u201d, quickly declared the area a \u201ccluster\u201d, beckoning in a thicket of towers and opening the floodgates for the emerging Dubai on Thames. A wall of glass stumps is beginning to sprawl along the river from Wandsworth and Battersea to Nine Elms and Vauxhall \u2013 and beyond. \u201cIt is an absolute fiasco,\u201d says Mark Brearley, professor at Cass Cities and former director of Design for London. \u201cIt is the outcome of not really taking much notice of plans and being fairly relaxed about negotiating the best outcome, and not placing too many obligations on developers. Nothing hangs together as a result, nothing makes sense at ground level. As a piece of city it\u2019s a farce.\u201d A similarly galumphing form of urbanism is appearing across London, from the gauntlet of City Road to Stratford High Street. Many of the worst offenders are the result of our slippery two-stage planning system, in which general outline permission can be given, while further details are postponed to a later \u201creserved matters\u201d application. In a system based entirely on negotiation, it is a fair way of allowing developers to test the water and see what they can get away with, before spending money on detailed work. Yet it also allows crucial elements, like ground-floor uses, the location of entrances, the nature of materials and even massing and bulk, to slip through the net, allowing designs to be watered down to pale imitations of what had been agreed. And the hands of the local authority are hopelessly tied. \u201cOnce an outline permission is granted, it makes it very difficult for us to refuse a scheme further down the line,\u201d says one officer. In Stratford City\u2019s \u201cInternational Quarter\u201d, part of the promised spoils of the Olympic legacy, consented tower proposals have recently gained a substantial number of extra storeys. Similarly in Wandsworth, a proposed pair of towers have put on a growth spurt and lost their planned mix of uses, reverting entirely to high-end flats.  Conditions that have been agreed are relentlessly renegotiated at reserved matters stage. Good architects are employed to win outline planning, then ditched for a cheaper alternative; high-quality materials are substituted for flimsy plastic panels \u2013 all in the name of viability. Just like the banking crisis, the problem of botched urban development has long been encouraged by a system that is open to exploitation and all too susceptible to careless regulation. But it is also not something that can be easily fixed. \u201cThere\u2019s only so much mileage in vilifying developers or planners,\u201d says Brearley. \u201cMaking cities is imperfect and messy, and has been for thousands of years. But we should be able to do better than this.\u201d      Proposal for \u2018phase 3\u2019 of Battersea Power station\u2019s redevelopment, by architecture firms Gehry Partners and Foster + Partners. Photograph: Gehry Partners    It comes down, he thinks, to the fact the UK planning system is overly reliant on individual negotiation between private developer and public servant, which is usually far from a level playing field. \u201cIt makes a very opaque and confusing system that relies on having people that are very sophisticated at brokering deals,\u201d Brearley adds. \u201cAnd those people will generally settle in places where they\u2019ll earn more money. The people negotiating on behalf of the public are simply not sophisticated enough.\u201d One former planning officer is frank about the reality of the imbalance in our confrontational system. \u201cIf you throw enough resources at a planning application, you\u2019re going to manage to tire everyone out,\u201d he says. \u201cThe documentation gets more and more extensive, the phone calls get more frequent and more aggressive, the letters ever more litigious. The weight of stuff just bludgeons everyone aside, and the natural inclination is to say, \u2018Oh yeah okay, I\u2019ve had enough of this one,\u2019 and just let it through. It\u2019s like a war of attrition.\u201d And it is a war in which the side representing the public interest has been systematically drained of expertise. The number of architects employed in the public sector has fallen from over 60% to less than 10% over the last 30 years, while planners have been relegated to third- and fourth-tier officers, with some boroughs contracting the service out altogether. As part of the Farrell Review into architecture and the built environment, a \u201cPlan First\u201d initiative has been proposed, by GLA regeneration manager Finn Williams, on the model of Teach First, to try to lure the best graduates into planning. But it faces an uphill struggle to overturn the years of neglect and transform a system that is fundamentally anti-plan-making. \u201cTo this day our planning system is the wrong way around,\u201d says Rees. \u201cIt evolved to protect the countryside from the encroachment of the towns, rather than to make the cities better. It isn\u2019t about building great places, it\u2019s about protecting non-places.\u201d And in the process, it has allowed our cities to cannibalise themselves and become those non-places it set out to protect. Bullied and undermined, planning authorities have been left castrated and toothless, stripped of the skills and power they need to regulate, and sapped of the spatial imagination to actually plan places. As one house-builder puts it simply, \u201cThe system is ripe for sharp developers to drive a bulldozer right through.\u201d And they will continue to do so with supercharged glee, squeezing the life out of our cities and reaping rewards from the ruins, until there is something in the way to stop them. \u2022 Read more on the London skyline debate", "title": "The truth about property developers: how they are exploiting planning authorities and ruining our cities", "sentences": ["The GLA, keen to seem \u201cstrategic\u201d, quickly declared the area a \u201ccluster\u201d, beckoning in a thicket of towers and opening the floodgates for the emerging Dubai on Thames."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-17T08:52:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/sep/17/live-racing-17-september-2014", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "11.45am Grey Gatsby not a certain runner in Champion Stakes Tony Paley: Trainer Kevin Ryan has warned The Grey Gatsby is not a certain runner in the Qipco Champion Stakes at Ascot on October 18.

The going seems likely to be a key factor, since it\u2019s currently reported as good to firm in places and only a small percentage of staying chasers really appreciate that kind of surface. It looks to me as though Burn And Turn (4.40) is one of them, so I\u2019ll take the 9-1 about Jessica Harrington\u2019s mare, who was a game second in the Galway Plate and is only 3lb higher. She\u2019s never tried three miles before but her effort that day suggested that it might be a help to her. Robbie Power, who rode a winner over the Listowel fences yesterday for Harrington, gets the ride. My pick of the English cards is Certificate (4.30) at Yarmouth, representing the Roger Varian / Andrea Atzeni combination that you may have heard of recently.

It will therefore come as an added blow that earlier this month bus company Stagecoach axed or cut back on 70 routes, after Cumbria county council announced it would phase out \u00a31.3m in annual subsidies to private bus operators. Cumbria is a world away from London, where buses come along every seven minutes, not every seven days, and 24m journeys are taken a day on a seamless network that includes city buses, the underground, ferries and even bikes.  But it is not only in rural regions of Britain where public transport bears no resemblance to London. Big cities such as Greater Manchester and Birmingham are struggling to bring in a transport system that can stem the rising tide of car use that is leading to gridlock on Britain\u2019s roads. There was anger last week at news that Northern Rail, with its ageing rolling stock, is hiking peak-time fares to compensate for the government\u2019s withdrawal of subsidies.  As part of the Guardian\u2019s big transport debate, we brought together MPs, transport chiefs, technology experts and academics at the House of Commons and asked them to get to grips with one of the most contentious issues in British politics: how to ensure that all of Britain benefits from a transport system \u2013 incorporating buses, trains, ferries and planes \u2013 fit for the 21st century. Jason McCartney, Conservative MP for Colne Valley in West Yorkshire, said the difference between London and northern cities is stark: \u201cI used to commute regularly to Leeds from my home in Honley, and though it was only 30 miles, I had to leave at 6.30am to be at my desk at 9am. I come to London and see all the investment in transport infrastructure and it seems like Dubai compared to where I come from. It feels like a north-south divide.\u201d But Caroline Dinenage, Conservative MP for Gosport in Hampshire, said parts of the south also suffer from decades of under-investment. The M27 along the south coast is \u201cpainfully inadequate\u201d, she said. And the fast train from Portsmouth Harbour to London Waterloo takes as long as the rail commute to northern cities that are more than twice as far away. Talk of devolution is thick in the air in Westminster, with Nick Clegg backing a report by the Institute for Public Policy Research last week outlining a timetable for devolving power to English cities and regions. When Gwyn Topham, the Guardian\u2019s transport correspondent, who chaired the session, asked participants whether this would help solve Britain\u2019s transport woes, there were nods around the table.  Jon Lamonte, chief executive of Transport for Greater Manchester, said when Transport for London (TfL) was set up in 1999 \u2013 at the same time the Greater London Authority was set up and London got a directly elected mayor \u2013 it was given powers over fundraising and strategic planning for all the myriad parts of London\u2019s transport system.  When the bus industry in the rest of the country was deregulated in 1986, London\u2019s bus system remained in the control of TfL. So while London has had Oyster card for a decade, Greater Manchester is struggling to bring in a similar payment card for its bus, rail and tram network.  \u201cIt is proving incredibly difficult to orchestrate that with 30 bus operators, six rail operators \u2013 we can do it for the tram because we own it \u2013 but trying to have a ubiquitous, simple ticketing scheme at a price people can afford is not easy,\u201d Lamonte said. As well as the ability to raise funds, devolution would give cities more control over long-term planning, several panellists pointed out. Lamonte explained that National Rail deals in five-year spending cycles for infrastructure while the Highways Agency, which is due to be taken under central government control, will also have five-year settlements. The problem is that most infrastructure programmes take a lot longer to devise and deliver, Lamonte said. \u201cDevolution offers the prospect of longer-term thinking, and proper plans for investment that can be co-ordinated with plans for economic growth, skills, and housing. In particular, as we look forward to maximising the opportunities offered by High Speed 2 [HS2, the plan for a high-speed railway that will link London, Birmingham, Leeds and Manchester].\u201d HS2 was a red rag for many panellists. Prof Roderick Smith of Imperial College London said HS2 was being developed in a \u201cpolicy vacuum\u201d, with no assessment of how it would impact on CO2 emissions, and Richard Burden, the shadow transport minister, lamented that there had been little prior consultation by the government on the route it will take, and little consideration of how it will connect with regional rail lines.  Roger Vickerman, dean for Europe at the University of Kent, who sits on one of the HS2 advisory panels, warned that without careful integration of local transport with HS2, people will jump in their cars to drive to high speed rail stations rather than wait for local trains. \u201cDon\u2019t act as if they [regional railways and HS2] are separate entities that just go from A to B. Make sure they integrate in at key points. That does require that awful word planning.\u201d  Planning is certainly not a dirty word in London, which has mapped out a fully integrated economic, environmental, transport and social framework for the development of the capital to 2031, known as the London Plan. In the summer, the mayor published draft proposals for developing London\u2019s strategic infrastructure \u2013 transport, green, digital, energy, water, and waste \u2013 up to 2050.  Mich\u00e8le Dix, managing director of planning for TfL, said it is important to consider how the city will be able to raise finance for the estimated \u00a3466bn bill for new transport infrastructure, including a second Crossrail and a doubling in capacity on the rail network.  Mayor Boris Johnson argues that London will not be able to afford to raise the necessary finance without fiscal devolution from Westminster, including the ability to keep stamp duty, land tax and business tax revenues in city coffers. Dix said this model could be replicated by other cities. \u201cIt\u2019s not just a case of London just doing this, but what other cities can do.\u201d But devolution is not the only solution. Steve Yianni, chief executive of Transport Systems Catapault, a not for profit organisation set up by the Technology Strategy Board to work on intelligent mobility, said technology should be harnessed for improving urban transport. It is involved in trialling automated electric two-person pods, which will ferry commuters from Milton Keynes rail station to the city centre. \u201cTechnology can\u2019t solve all of our problems, but technology can help.\u201d And no high-level discussion about transport in Britain can ignore the contentious issue of which airport should be expanded to provide greater capacity for London and the south east. Alastair McDermid, airports commission director for London Gatwick, pointed out that with the rise of Dubai as a global aviation centre, with plans to create a $32bn (\u00a319.5bn) second airport in the desert, \u001fLondon is used more as a destination than a hub by international travellers.  This was disputed by Labour MP Graham Stringer, who championed Heathrow. \u201cIt\u2019s not about adding runway capacity. We already have 21 times the amount of runway we need. It\u2019s getting it in the right place.\u201d  McCartney said having just successfully lobbied for the restoration of a British Airways service from Leeds-Bradford to Heathrow, he looks at the prolonged debate over airport capacity in the south east with amazement. \u201cI would like the regional airports to have more expansion instead of this obsession with the south.\u201d Attendees Gwyn Topham (chair), transport correspondent, the Guardian Richard Burden MP Sarah Champion MP Mary Creagh MP Caroline Dinenage MP Mich\u00e8le Dix, managing director, planning, Transport for London  Robert Flello MP Lilian Greenwood MP Julie Hilling MP John Leech MP Jason McCartney MP Karl McCartney MP David McMillan, non executive director, London Gatwick Lord Rosser Professor Roderick Smith Iain Stewart MP Alan Stilwell, Vice President UK Regions, Institution of Civil Engineers  Graham Stringer MP Professor Roger Vickerman Steve Yianni, chief executive, Transport Systems Catapult Jon Lamonte, chief executive of Transport for Greater Manchester  This article is part of the Big Transport Debate.

Photograph: ZHD    The work of Zaha Hadid Design, one of seven companies registered in her name, and the branch of the office that handles interiors, products and exhibition design, the objects are the result of the practice\u2019s ongoing pursuit of fluid geometries and experimental organic structures. But in some ways it represents Hadid coming full circle. Like many young architects, she started out designing interiors in the 1980s, making side tables and sofas saturated with a Russian constructivist air, way before she began building. Following the trajectory of her architecture, this new collection is imbued with an interest in a much more supple language, Malevich shards exchanged for a voluptuous aesthetic of her own making. Although Gibbon insists that \u201cthey are not miniature buildings,\u201d the pieces nonetheless bear a definite family resemblance to recent projects, and many have been drawn from structures developed by the architect\u2019s in-house \u201ccode group\u201d, a kind of laboratory for producing alien forms. The Aqua platter \u2013 four teardrop swooshes that resemble the fanned petals of a bird of paradise flower \u2013 is based on a distorted version of London\u2019s Olympic Aquatics Centre, each tray flexing in a taut arc before coming to rest on three points, just like the building. CNC-milled from blocks of transparent acrylic, and hand-finished in Italy, they have an alluring jewel-like quality \u2013 which sadly evaporates when you touch them. Expecting the expensive ring of cast glass, you instead find the cheap rattle of a plastic picnic tray, which belies the \u00a310,000 price tag. Those on tighter budgets can make do with the Aqua acrylic placemat \u2013 a snip at \u00a376. Across the collection, the ghosts of Hadid\u2019s buildings begin to emerge. The closer you look, the more they start to form particular families, a mutant genealogy of creatures at different stages of evolution. They are like early embryonic forms of her buildings, plucked from the parametric womb before they have matured into fully fledged pieces of architecture, still slippery and gelatinous. It is as if, by some quirk of natural selection, the siblings were separated before birth \u2013 one went on to become an Olympic swimming pool, the other was destined to hold nuts and olives. One will soon be a skyscraper in Asia, while its stunted sibling will hold your scented candle in the downstairs loo.     Like the skyline of Shanghai squaring up to Dubai... the Field of Towers chess set by ZHD homeware. Photograph: ZHD    Geometric experiments for towers in Brisbane and Beijing have proved particularly fruitful as a source of inspiration, providing the basis for cups, saucers and flasks, as well as a gleaming resin chess set. For \u00a34,860, you can do battle with your very own armies of Zaha Hadid skyscrapers, the double rows of twisting totems facing off across the board, like the skyline of Shanghai squaring up to Dubai. There is a range of scented candles (a personal Zaha favourite) housed in blocky ceramic holders, modelled on the base of a tower proposed for Miami. As if squeezed into a futuristic corset, the building will braced by a concrete exoskeleton of bifurcating flow lines. When scaled down to tabletop size, the form recalls the entwined tendrils of art nouveau styling, with a slightly sinister sci-fi air \u2013 Victor Horta meets HR Giger on a dark night. Available in white (the fresh and lemony \u201coriental\u201d) or black (the dark and musky \u201copulent\u201d), they range from \u00a399 to \u00a3252. Hadid already has several, and it turns out they provide a useful indicator to her employees. \u201cZaha loves scented candles,\u201d says one designer. \u201cIf you smell a candle in the office, you know she\u2019s coming.\u201d For a practice whose work is so focused on the production of novel forms, it appears that the product-development line provides a useful scale of experimentation, before multi-millions are invested in buildings. \u201cArchitecture takes years and years to produce, but with products you can get something to market within a year,\u201d says Maha Kutay, co-director of the design team. \u201cAll the pieces are designed by architects, and it can provide a rejuvenating break from the monotony of working on a building.\u201d     Slightly sinister sci-fi air? The Prime Orientscented candle, \u00a3299, by ZHD homeware. Photograph: ZHD    In some ways it recalls the approach of the master architects of yore, from Frank Lloyd Wright and Arne Jacobsen, to Alvar Aalto and Eero Saarinen, who enjoyed a megalomanic control over every detail, each project conceived as a gesamtkunstwerk, from the door handle to the city block. It might seem like an unlikely return to such times, but there is increasing demand from clients, particularly in Asia, for Hadid to extend her attentions beyond the jazzy envelope of the building down to the interiors and furniture. In the case of ZHA\u2019s new homewares collection, however, it seems to be a process of reverse-engineering, scaling down her architectural proposals into trinkets. \u201cIt\u2019s a challenge trying to adapt the structural language of a building into something the size of a piece of furniture,\u201d says Wandy Mulia, an architect who worked on the design of the Radia stools, little munchkin seats sprayed with sparkling car paint, which are based on another tower design. It makes you wonder if the extreme formal language of Planet Zaha isn\u2019t better suited to the tabletop, where there is less to go wrong, freed from the critical realities of context and function. Perhaps these sweeping sinews are more appropriate for the privacy of the devoted fan\u2019s living room, rather than imposed on the skyline for all to endure. They are the kind of bijou sculptural experiments that may work better when elegantly perched on a shelf, rather than forcefully lumbering across an urban block.

Dettori, however, is no closer to knowing whether he will have a ride in a race he has won three times \u2013 though he remains a potential partner for Ruler Of The World once other jockeys have finalised their rides, Harry Herbert, the racing manager to the colt\u2019s part-owner Al Shaqab Racing, said on Thursday night. Joseph O\u2019Brien, stable jockey to his father Aidan, Ruler Of The World\u2019s trainer, rode the four-year-old in the Dubai World Cup in March, the colt\u2019s only start this year prior to Sunday\u2019s victory. That race came just a few days after Sheikh Joaan al-Thani, the founder of Al Shaqab, bought a \u201csignificant share\u201d in Ruler Of The World from John Magnier\u2019s Coolmore Stud syndicate, which owns all but a handful of the horses at Aidan O\u2019Brien\u2019s Ballydoyle stable. A Coolmore statement at the time of the sale said that Ruler Of The World \u201cwill remain in training with Aidan O\u2019Brien at Ballydoyle and will continue to be ridden by Joseph O\u2019Brien\u201d. Dettori took over on Sunday with O\u2019Brien already committed to ride for Ballydoyle at The Curragh. Dettori replaced O\u2019Brien on Ballydoyle\u2019s Camelot, the 2012 Derby winner, in the Arc two years ago, precipitating a split with the Italian\u2019s former employer Godolphin, Coolmore\u2019s major rival in racing and bloodstock, where he had been the retained rider for nearly two decades. That was because O\u2019Brien could not make the required weight on a three-year-old, however, a problem which would not arise on the four-year-old Ruler Of The World. With Australia, this year\u2019s Derby winner, apparently being steered towards a run at Ascot on Champions Day in mid-October, Ruler Of The World appears to be Ballydoyle\u2019s main contender for the Arc at this stage, and thus a ride that O\u2019Brien would hope to take. \u201cThe decision on who rides Ruler Of The World will be made after the horse\u2019s last piece of work,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cAt this stage there are so many variations as a result of other jockeys\u2019 decisions so things could easily change. \u201cFrankie himself is keen to ride Ruler Of The World as he was so impressed with the horse last Sunday.\u201d Dettori confirmed his opinion of the colt\u2019s chance in the Arc in an interview with At The Races on Thursday. \u201cHe\u2019s a very, very good horse,\u201d Dettori said. \u201cThe time was great, he did it all on his own, he had to do it the hard way and it never looked in doubt. He\u2019d also had a long lay-off and I\u2019m sure that Aidan will improve him a little bit more, and he is a Derby winner.\u201d Dettori, who is the retained senior jockey for Al Shaqab, had the pick of Godolphin\u2019s big-race contenders for nearly 20 years and took the Arc in their colours on Sakhee and Marienbard in 2001 and 2002, following his first win in the race on Lammtarra in 1995. This year, however, he must first wait until Gr\u00e9gory Benoist has made his choice between the unbeaten, dual-Classic winning filly Avenir Certain, and Al Shaqab\u2019s colt Ectot, who was an impressive winner of the Prix Niel, one of the major Arc trials, shortly before Ruler Of The World\u2019s victory four days ago. If Benoist opts for Ectot, Dettori could yet be watching the Arc in the weighing room. The negotiations to finalise the 54th Levy scheme, which returns funding to racing from off-course betting, concluded on Thursday, nearly a month-and-a-half before the deadline for an agreement between racing and bookmakers on 31 October. What is, in effect, a rollover of the current scheme, is expected to yield \u00a374.3m between 1 April 2015 and 31 March 2016.

Already long odds-on for the championship before racing, despite trailing Ryan Moore by seven winners, Hughes took three of the first five races, prompting several of the layers still offering odds to close their books and effectively anoint Hughes as the champion once more. Overnight rain and more during the morning had changed the official going description from good to firm (watered) to good-to-soft by the time 19 maidens went to post for the opener. It was Hughes who led them back on the 8-1 chance Desert Force and he completed a double an hour later when Code Of Honor, in Godolphin blue, took a three-runner conditions event. By the fifth race it was a treble, as the two-year-old filly Marsh Hawk won with sufficient ease to justify entries in Group One races over the next few weeks. \u201cI thought I had good rides today but it\u2019s an ordinary book tomorrow so I needed to make hay while I can,\u201d Hughes said after completing his treble. \u201cThe gap was down to four during the week, then it went back to seven, now it\u2019s four again. It will do that, just as long as it doesn\u2019t get back up over 10, I\u2019ll have to keep on top of it.\u201d Moore has already made it clear that he will not abandon plans to ride at the Spring Carnival in Australia and the Breeders\u2019 Cup in America to pursue the title and he may well be absent for nearly three weeks at the tail end of the campaign. For as long as he is trailing, though, Hughes knows that he cannot let up, having already missed several weeks after a bad fall in Dubai in March. \u201cIt\u2019s a bit premature [to close the betting] after what happened to me in Dubai,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cThe same thing could happen to me tomorrow and I\u2019m well aware of that. I just have to ride as many winners as I can until he goes.\u201d Marsh Hawk holds an entry in the Group One Prix Marcel Boussac at Longchamp on Arc day but is more likely to be supplemented for the Fillies\u2019 Mile on Future Champions day at Newmarket in mid-October. \u201cIt was nice to see her learn something today because her last two runs have been a bit frantic,\u201d Richard Hannon, Marsh Hawk\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cIt was all a bit of a blur first time as she never saw another horse and the second time she was just off her legs a little bit. Today she was able to relax and enjoy it.\u201d Moore was within a short head of extending his lead once again in the Haynes, Hanson and Clark Stakes but, having driven Acaster Malbis alongside Snoano in the final strides, he could not get his nose in front where it mattered. He was out of luck in the final race too, as Tercel, the 7-2 favourite, could finish only second behind the 14-1 chance Starwatch. Barring injury, Hughes now seems to have his third consecutive riders\u2019 title wrapped up but there was a glimpse of the future here too on Friday as Cam Hardie rode his 40th winner of the campaign on Ismail Mohammed\u2019s Rhombus. In another season Hardie might have been vying for the apprentice championship with his current total but Oisin Murphy, the outstanding young rider of the moment, has long since had that title wrapped up. Hardie is involved in a tight race with Connor Beasley and Jason Hart for second place, however, and is likely to renew his partnership with Rhombus when the four-year-old lines up for the Cesarewitch Handicap at Newmarket on Saturday 11 October. Rhombus missed the break by at least half a dozen lengths but Hardie showed patience to ease his way into the contest in the home straight on the way to a comfortable success. \u201cThe way we were drawn we didn\u2019t want to be in among them,\u201d Niall Collum, assistant to Rhombus\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cHe took his time and did it a bit too much [at the start] but they didn\u2019t go too fast early on so we were OK. \u201cHe\u2019s got an old head on young shoulders. He\u2019s got a brain on him and that\u2019s half the battle. He didn\u2019t panic, he showed a lot of maturity, he\u2019s very well-balanced and he rides very well.\u201d Rhombus is just one of nearly a dozen horses quoted at around 20-1 for the Cesarewitch though, given that there will be 30 horses lining up at Newmarket, another of Collum\u2019s comments might give punters pause for thought. \u201cThat\u2019s the way he needs to be ridden,\u201d he said. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t like the hustle and bustle of too much going on around him.\u201d", "title": "Richard Hughes\u2019 Newbury treble may be crucial in jockeys\u2019 title race", "sentences": ["For as long as he is trailing, though, Hughes knows that he cannot let up, having already missed several weeks after a bad fall in Dubai in March.", "\u201cIt\u2019s a bit premature [to close the betting] after what happened to me in Dubai,\u201d Hughes said."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-19T17:15:54Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2014/sep/20/only-way-is-up-for-towers-that-touch-the-sky-in-pictures", "tags": ["Architecture", "Empire State Building, New York, US", "New York holidays", "Dubai holidays", "Kuwait holidays", "London holidays", "The Shard", "Art and design", "Seoul holidays", "Saudi Arabia holidays", "China holidays"], "article": "   Empire State building skyscraper    EMPIRE STATE BUILDING Completed: 1931 Location: New York, USA Cost: $41m  Height: 443 metres  Floors: 103  The tallest building in New York city until 1972, when it lost the title to the North tower of the World Trade Centre.

In one press release, Andreas Nauen, chief executive of Senvion Australia, a windfarm builder, said any change to the RET would compromise the company\u2019s existing investments and \u201cdamage Australia\u2019s international reputation as a safe place to invest\u201d. \u201cOnce the trust has gone, once the knowledge has gone, once the jobs have gone, then restarting the clean energy industry takes a lot of effort,\u201d the release said. Nauen has good reason to be irritated. In February, Senvion Australia received development permission to begin work on a new windfarm project in the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia. That project should end up being worth $1.5bn and create 500 construction jobs, with 50 more sustained over the 25-year life of the project. But now the company says investment in windfarm projects has stalled, making it impossible to know when the project will be completed and come online. In economic jargon, this is called \u201csovereign risk\u201d and occurs when a government\u2019s decisions make business investment unreliable. Richard Inwood, the managing director of Tindo Solar, the country\u2019s only domestic solar panel manufacturer, says the uncertainty created by the RET review has effectively \u201ckneecapped\u201d the industry and will force his company to revise its plans for growth, which is a tragedy for the renewable energy industry that once seemed to be doing everything right. Already well-established in countries such as Spain, Germany and China, clean energy offered a way to tackle climate change while setting up a new industry at a time when the manufacturing sector had been declining due to a high Australian dollar and structural changes within the economy. The Renewable Energy Target (RET) was the core mechanism in making this happen. Initiated in 2001 under the Howard government to help build Australia\u2019s clean energy industry, the program was expanded under Labor. Under the RET, Australia is required to ensure that 41,000 gigawatt hours of the country\u2019s energy comes from renewable sources by 2020. With a largely unexpected drop in electricity demand, that figure is likely to be nearer 26% of the country\u2019s energy by 2020 than the 20% that was initially envisaged. The lesson from this is that the RET has largely been a huge success. When Warburton, a self-professed climate sceptic, calling for the program to be either closed to new entrants or scrapped entirely, it spelled chaos for the $20bn renewables industry \u2013 and the South Australian economy in particular. The state is expected to struggle after 2017 with the closure of the local car industry, which will shut the Elizabeth Holden factory and cause the loss of 1,700 jobs. Most of the factory\u2019s 33 direct Australian suppliers are also expected to go, along with a good chunk of the 700-800 companies in the wider supply chain. The bad news doesn\u2019t end there. Another recent report from the Department of Defence threw up questions about the future of the state\u2019s defence manufacturing industry and reports that the federal government was considering buying \u201coff the shelf\u201d submarines from Japan instead of sourcing them locally from the Australian Submarine Corporation, which built the Collins Class submarines, have added to the state\u2019s fears. Doing so would effectively gut the last major manufacturing industry in South Australia, potentially putting thousands out of work and increasing the risk that the state will shed its skillbase. This has prompted criticism from industry figures such as Goran Roos, chairman of the Advanced Manufacturing Council who says that the decision to let manufacturing slide is a mistake. \u201cThe statement from the prime minister about defence policy and industrial policy, and you can quote me on this, is completely ludicrous,\u201d Roos says. \u201cYou can\u2019t run a defence operation without industry. Who\u2019s going to make your ammunition? Who\u2019s going to repair your vehicles?\u201d \u201cPart of it is this erroneous idea about becoming a service economy. Two-thirds of all services that generate value are linked to manufacturing. You can see in Adelaide the link to Holden has an effect on lawyers, accountants and so on.\u201d \u201c[Adelaide] is just ahead of the curve.\u201d     Gavin Warwick, one of 30 workers employed at the Tindo Solar factory north of Adelaide.  Photograph: Royce Kurmelovs for the Guardian    Clean energy had offered a source of hope, as its expansion requires exactly the kind of \u201cadvanced manufacturing\u201d the premier had been promising to bring to the state to fill the gap created by the end of Holden. Inwood, of Tindo Solar, says: \u201cWe were the fourth largest investor in renewables. In six months we\u2019ve fallen to ninth.\u201d  He says when Warburton and his team visited Tindo\u2019s factory, they treated it like a \u201cbox-ticking exercise\u201d. The company\u2019s factory sits on the outer edge of Technology Park in Mawson Lakes, about a 40-minute drive north of Adelaide. From here, Tindo builds, sells and delivers each system under a contract similar to those widely used across the US and EU. This creates an arrangement where a solar panel system is installed free, in return for a 15-year commitment from the client to buy power from the company. Inside, the place doesn\u2019t look like much. Everything is compact. The entire production line fits into a room not much bigger than the average residential house. Every four minutes a brand new panel slides off the line. It takes 40 minutes for a panel to go from start to finish, overseen by a handful of workers in high-vis clothing who keep everything moving. \u201cI\u2019d been here three weeks when the [former] PM decided to open the company,\u201d says Gavin Warwick who has worked for the company since October 2012. He smiles as he remembers being the one to show Julia Gillard the ropes. \u201cSome of the guys thought it would be funny to throw me in the deep end to see how I went,\u201d he says. Of the 18 jobs Warwick had applied for that month, he says, Tindo was the one he wanted the most. As a baby company in a new industry, Tindo promised exactly the kind of stability he had been looking for. And Tindo Solar has plans to expand, which would create more positions for people like Warwick. The company employs 30 people across one shift, but wants to put on a second and third shift, which would create 100 jobs. That number might have been even higher, Inwood says, had the rules of the game not changed so suddenly, forcing the company to rethink when and how it may be able to achieve its goal of cornering 20% of the Australian solar panel market. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to go bankrupt,\u201d Inwood says, but \u201cthis would have translated to 600 new jobs, five minutes down the road from Holden.\u201d The fallout doesn\u2019t stop there.

We\u2019re dead last.\u2019 Photograph: Royce Kurmelovs for the Guardian    Across town, Rhys Jacobs is in his office at the University of South Australia\u2019s Sustainable Energy Centre. There, the 23-year-old PhD student is working on a project for use in the Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) industry. CSP represents the other half of the solar energy industry from the photovoltaic solar cells made by Tindo. CSP works much the same way as traditional coal-fire power stations, but instead of burning coal to generate electricity, concentrated sunlight is used to heat a fluid, make steam and produce electricity. Jacob says his research project is on \u201cencapsulated phase-change materials for use in thermal-energy storage\u201d. In a word, batteries. Big ones. Jacob says initial design would halve the cost of storing electricity for the CSP industry, though it has yet to undergo a feasibility study. \u201cIn terms of cost, current ones go for around $30/kWh, which is horrible,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re aiming for $15/kWh.\u201d Jacob is blunt about the state of the Australian renewable energy industry. \u201cAustralia\u2019s a complete joke in renewable energy policy. We really are the worst country for renewable energy projects. We\u2019re dead last. There will be a huge market, unless we call off the RET.\u201d Asked whether he will move away to find work, Jacob is just as forthright. \u201cSouth Australia doesn\u2019t have a lot of the industry I\u2019m looking at,\u201d he says. \u201cA lot of it is based in Sydney and Victoria. That\u2019s where a lot of the work gets done. South Australia has a lot of experts in the field, but we\u2019re very far behind when it comes to putting money in the project. \u201cThere\u2019s a huge market overseas. Europe\u2019s still fantastic at it. China, not so much. Dubai, surprisingly has a huge CSP industry. Which is very surprising that they are more up-to-date than we are.\u201d And so long as the renewable energy industry is left to wonder about what comes next for the RET, the fear is investors will stay away, meaning the country will miss out on opportunities for growth. Inwood says this is the great tragedy behind the review. \u201cWe\u2019ve directly put in $6m under a set of goal posts that were set in concrete,\u201d he says. \u201cAll I\u2019m saying is get out of our way and let us do it.

Milanic joins Leeds from the Austrian club Sturm Graz, having previously enjoyed significant success in Slovenia with Maribor, where he won nine trophies in five years. The 46-year-old is multilingual. It brings to an end a three-week managerial search by Cellino following the sacking of David Hockaday after just six matches, a bizarre appointment given that his previous job was in the Conference with Forest Green Rovers. \u00d3scar Garc\u00eda was the Italian\u2019s first choice until he joined Watford while the former Argentina coach Alejandro Sabella was also interested in the job. However, Cellino\u2019s interest in Milanic stepped up last weekend after holding talks with the former Yugoslavia and Slovenia international, who in recent days has been negotiating his severance deal with Sturm. He took charge of the Austrian side for the final time on Saturday and held an emotional press conference at a club he joined as manager in June 2013, having spent seven years there as a player. Milanic described the offer from Leeds as a \u201ctremendous opportunity \u2013 from another world\u201d. He said: \u201cWho knows when such an offer will come again?\u201d Milanic holds a Uefa pro licence and has coached in the Europa League but takes the Leeds job in the knowledge that Cellino went through 36 managers in 22 years during his time as president of Cagliari, whom he owned before buying Leeds in April this year despite opposition from the Football League. The arrival of Cellino\u2019s second head coach at Leeds signals the end of Neil Redfearn\u2019s successful spell as caretaker manager, with United having won three and drawn one in the Championship since Hockaday\u2019s departure, including successive victories over Bournemouth and Huddersfield that have provided six goals for Leeds. Cellino has been significantly involved in team affairs since Hockaday\u2019s sacking, although Redfearn \u2013 who at one stage had been tipped to take the reins full time \u2013 will remain in the coaching set-up or return to the post of academy coach with his reputation enhanced. Milanic\u2019s first game in charge will be Saturday\u2019s at Brentford. Milanic inherits a squad in good form with numerous new faces, Leeds signing 15 players during the transfer window, the majority from abroad. Cellino fears the club could be hit with a future transfer embargo under the Football League\u2019s financial fair play rules because of the losses amassed by previous owner, Gulf Finance House Capital \u2013 the Bahrain-based investment bank which remains minority shareholder but under whose watch Leeds were haemorrhaging around \u00a31m a month.

Aimed less at Isis itself than at potential supporters, a bevy of US diplomatic and communications initiatives seek to undermine Isis\u2019s portrayal of itself as an authentic, successful Islamic resistance. But even some who helped push the State Department into confronting extremists online fear that US counter-propaganda is amorphous, slipshod and unlikely to persuade internet-fluent youths to whom Isis attempts to appeal.  \u201cI honestly don\u2019t think the government should be in the position of directly engaging jihadis on Twitter. It\u2019s a silly game,\u201d said Shahed Amanullah, who last year left the State Department after helping establish programs to promote anti-extremist Muslim voices abroad.  Isis propaganda runs the gamut from the gruesome video-recorded beheadings of journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff to Instagram photographs of cats with AK-47s, indicating a comfort Isis has with internet culture. A common theme, shown in euphoric images uploaded to YouTube of jihadi fighters parading in armored US-made vehicles captured from the Iraqi military, is Isis\u2019s potency and success.  Isis videos are shot in high definition and have a cinematic quality. They stitch together battlefield scenes with imagery of Islamic life in the territory the group has conquered, serving as the equivalent of a tourist attraction for what it argues is a true Islamic state. They contrast with al-Qaida\u2019s now-familiar videos showing Osama bin Laden or other leaders reading a statement into a camera or hiking in the Pakistani mountains, a difference sharpened by Isis\u2019s occasionally sardonic tone.  In the offline world, the US response occurs in public diplomacy hubs from Dubai to Washington, where the State Department sends out Arabic-speaking mouthpieces to amplify the latest denunciation of Isis from Barack Obama or secretary of state John Kerry. Much of it focuses on news media outlets like al-Jazeera and al-Arabiya. Similar efforts occur across Europe, according to a State Department official, to dissuade the continent\u2019s Muslim youth from joining Isis and other jihadist groups in Syria. The White House also emails reporters reams of anti-Isis quotes by Muslim clerics. The US administration also points to State Department programs in Muslim countries beyond the Middle East to aid youth, community activists and religious figures in organizing and non-violent activism, something Amanullah helped establish in 2012. Program architects argue that empowerment efforts will eventually reap the benefit of authentic Muslim refutations of extremist groups, either through deed or by word, without the taint of the US government\u2019s involvement.  Online, the most visible US attempt to counter to Isis comes from a social media campaign called Think Again Turn Away, run by a State Department office called the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications.  As its name indicates, Think Again Turn Away aims less at Isis itself than at its potential recruits. On YouTube, Facebook and Twitter, US diplomats have begun actively trolling Isis, arguing with pro-Isis accounts and producing videos portraying Isis-conquered territory as a hellscape.  Yet Think Again Turn Away has been met with much criticism and even outright mockery. Public diplomacy veterans question its direct engagement with Isis and its choice of topics. A video released on Friday, for instance, criticized Isis\u2019s threadbare curriculum for Iraqi schools. The head of an institute tracking online jihadist messages called Think Again Turn Away\u2019s Twitter campaign \u201cridiculous\u201d for engaging Isis supporters and inviting ridicule of US policy.  \u201cWhen these people go online, they needed to be treated like trolls,\u201d Amanullah said, \u201cand we keep feeding the trolls.\u201d US officials balk at suggestions that Think Again Turn Away is central to its counter-propaganda efforts, even as it stands as the most concerted and tangible program to refute Isis and other extremist groups. Will McCants, a former State Department adviser who helped establish the Center for Strategic Counterterrorism Communications, conceded that it is \u201cimpossible for State to know if it\u2019s succeeded or failed at its task\u201d. But McCants argued that the program has potential to \u201cget inside the leadership\u2019s attack calculus\u201d, dissuading Isis from targeting Muslim civilians lest it face increasing criticism.  \u201cThis stuff is hard to prove, but there is anecdotal evidence of some jihadi groups complaining about the \u2018lies\u2019 spread by State,\u201d McCants said.  Amanullah said the initiative was inadvertently creating a dialogue of equals between the US and Isis, distracting from Muslim criticisms of Isis that carry more credibility within the Muslim world.  The \u201ctragedy of the US government\u2019s attempts to engage online\u201d, Amanullah said, is that \u201cthere\u2019s nothing these people like more than to see the US government specifically acknowledging and interacting with them online. They turn right around to their followers and say, \u2018See?

Abbott\u2019s evocation of an almost magical modernist metropolis echoes though the entire exhibition, which ranges from 1932 to 2011, but her way of seeing was influenced by Eug\u00e8ne Atget, whose studies of a much older city, Paris, so captivated her that she acquired most of his archive on his death in 1927. \u201cAs a result,\u201d writes David Campany in his catalogue essay, \u201can equivocal take on progress \u2013 looking askance or awry at the white heat of modernisation \u2013 became an important part of serious photography.\u201d It has been that way ever since \u2013 even though, as this exhibition shows, form as an end in itself has captivated certain photographers, from Lucien Herv\u00e9 to Hiroshi Sugimoto, as much as it has driven architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright and Le Corbusier. \u201cSince the earliest days of photography,\u201d write the curators, Alona Pardo and Elias Redstone, \u201carchitecture has been the medium\u2019s most willing accomplice.\u201d Leaving aside the fact that one could say much the same of landscape or portraiture, Constructing Worlds does a good, if highly selective, job of illustrating the often tricky relationship between buildings and their representation in photographs.      Cooling plant, Dubai, 2009. Photograph: Bas Princen    From Abbott\u2019s images of a city caught between the surge of modernity and the messy, makeshift urban landscape that lurked beyond Manhattan\u2019s tall towers, it moves on to Walker Evans, who was simultaneously documenting sharecropper\u2019s shacks in the American south during the Great Depression. The restlessly creative Evans moved from social documentary to vernacular photography, becoming increasingly fascinated by the churches, shop fronts and signage of an everyday America that, until he pointed his camera at it, remained virtually unchronicled. Untouched by the romantic grandeur of America that attracted photographers such as Ansel Adams, Evans was a touchstone for the likes of Robert Frank, William Eggleston and Stephen Shore, all of whom looked illuminatingly at that everyday America in their different ways. It is Shore whose work is included here, with his detached colour studies of American streets from the influential series, Uncommon Places, as well as his playful postcard project, Greetings from Amarillo, \u201cTall in Texas\u201d (1971). For that project, he placed his own \u2013 often deadpan \u2013 photographs of American buildings in the postcard racks of tourist shops and sites in the cities he had visited. As time goes by, Shore\u2019s formally rigorous images of an everyday America, once dismissed as boring by contemporary critics, have become signifiers of yet another disappearing America. Even yesterday\u2019s formal detachment can become today\u2019s nostalgia. A decade before Shore, Ed Ruscha\u2019s photographs of Los Angeles in the 1960s were giving form to what often seems like an architectural sprawl. Ruscha\u2019s series of vast parking lots, taken from the air, show repeated motifs \u2013 arcs of cars, rows of trees, spirals of intersecting freeways. JG Ballard, obsessed with the dark fantasies of everyday English suburbia, was an early fan.     A nighttime view of New York City, USA, 1932. Photograph: Berenice Abbott/Getty Images    One wonders what Ballard would have made of Bernd and Hilla Becher\u2019s documentation of the fast-disappearing industrial architecture of the Rhine-Ruhr region of their native Germany \u2013 water towers, gasometers, blast furnaces \u2013 and the almost identical structures built in France, America and Britain in the postwar years. This is the birth of a particularly European kind of almost scientific typology, and it was at the Becher\u2019s Dusseldorf School that Thomas Struth and Andreas Gursky honed their respective styles. The former\u2019s bleak West German streetscapes, made in the 1970s and 80s, show how \u2013 in certain cities \u2013 postwar redevelopment was ruthlessly efficient but utterly characterless. It is salutary to see a single British landscape included here \u2013 Clinton Road, London (1977) \u2013 and to be reminded that great swaths of London in the 70s looked like London in the 30s: bleak, soot-blackened, forlorn. It is almost a relief to encounter Gursky\u2019s epic eye in all its manipulated detail. His vast image of a block of flats, Paris Montparnasse, 1993, which was built by the modernist master Jean Dubuisson to house 5,000 residents, is painterly in its composition and illusory in its scale. The sense of linearity and almost endless repetition was created by seamlessly merging two separate shots, but, even in its vastness, the detail offers a wealth of human activity in the glimpsed interiors. As might be expected, Constructing Worlds intrigues as much for what has been left out of the narrative. Simon Norfolk\u2019s elegant ruins of war-torn Afghanistan make the cut in a nod to the architecture of conflict; but not Donovan Wylie\u2019s ambitious Watchtowers\u2019 series, which ranges from south Armagh to Kandahar and makes apparent the relationship between occupation, surveillance and architecture. Guy Tillim\u2019s post-colonial African ruins are in, but his fellow South African Mikhael Subotzky\u2019s dramatic project, Ponte City \u2013 in which the view from every door and window of the Johannesburg towerblock is recorded alongside the revealing detritus left by residents \u2013 is not included.

Photograph: Simon Norfolk    It is, of course, impossible to explore every aspect of the relationship between architecture and photography in a single show, but I struggled to grasp the underlying approach, not least when the groundbreaking American New Topographics movement of the 1970s is all but overlooked. Curiously, Lewis Baltz is central to Campany\u2019s catalogue essay, but his work absent. And where is Robert Adams, whose long exploration of the manmade suburban environment, combines formal rigour with a pioneering eco-political undertow that is missing here? For all that, it is good to see Luigi Ghirri, an influential Italian colourist, having a moment. Ghirri\u2019s collaboration with architect Aldo Rossi in the 1980s was unapologetically cerebral but also playful. In his search for \u201ca new way of describing architecture\u201d, Ghirri used form and colour in subtle new ways, allowing Rossi\u2019s spaces such as the cemetery of San Cataldo, Modena, to emerge in a fragmentary, but formally unified, way. The sky \u2013 and the tiny skyline below it \u2013 is glimpsed though a square of concrete in one image and allowed to dominate the entire frame in another. A red-brick tower appears in a small window frame as if painted there and reappears as a monumental object in another conceptually linked photograph. Quietly mischievous, Ghirri makes us look closely at how an architect works \u2013 and thinks.     High Court of Justice, Chandigarh, 1955. Photograph: Lucien Herve    One image lingers in the head long afterwards: Hiroshi Sugimoto\u2019s long monochrome exposure of the World Trade Centre made in 1997. In it, he transformed the twin towers into a shadowy memorial before the epochal event. After all the concrete and steel, the everyday and the epic, it is a dark reminder that all that is solid melts into air. \u2022 Constructing Worlds is at the Barbican, London EC2, from 25 September to 11 January.

Sardinian revenue officers on sea patrol for the Guardia di Finanza were curious and undertook a routine check of the vessel, a check which has, remarkably, become entwined with the future of Leeds United. Cellino was found guilty of evading almost \u20ac390,000 (\u00a3305,000) of import tax duty on the boat earlier this year, a first-grade conviction in Italy that he is appealing. Now, however, an Italian judge has ruled that this was a \u201cMachiavellian simulation\u201d which could have serious ramifications for the Championship club, who have recently been heading into calmer waters themselves despite a wretchedly turbulent year. The Football League, which initially blocked Cellino\u2019s takeover earlier this year, must decide whether judge Sandra Lepore\u2019s written reasons for the guilty verdict are sufficient to deem that the maverick Italian acted \u201cdishonestly\u201d. If so, the League could decide to ban the 58-year-old from ownership of Leeds under its owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test. The key moment in this unlikely saga came in April, on an afternoon when Leeds lost 1-0 at Wigan Athletic last season. Tim Kerr, an independent QC, overturned the League\u2019s decision to block Cellino from buying Leeds, citing insufficient evidence to prove dishonesty until the full judgment from Sardinia had been released. It sparked celebration among the majority of supporters and opened the door for Cellino to purchase a 75% share in Leeds through his company Eleonora Sport, with the previous owners Gulf Finance House \u2013 a Bahrain-based investment bank \u2013 remaining as minority shareholders. Since then he has been heavily involved in all matters at Leeds from the hiring and firing of his unlikely first head coach, David Hockaday, to the signing of 15 players in the summer transfer window and appointment this week of the Slovenian Darko Milanic. He has become embedded in a club that without his intervention was sailing into oblivion. Under GFH Leeds were haemorrhaging around \u00a31m a month but since his \u00a335m takeover Cellino has brought financial stability, galvanised support and also promised to buy Elland Road back from private hands, although a significant number of staff have lost their jobs at United. A key figure pulling the strings at United then, David Haigh, has been in a Dubai jail since May accused of serious financial wrongdoing by GFH. He denies the allegations, and reiterated his innocence on Wednesday. However, while it may seem perplexing that an investment bank with no history in football was allowed to take over an English club while Cellino \u2013 an experienced football man who has brought relative stability \u2013 was not, the Football League rules are black and white. The League argues that such issues cannot be subjective. Its regulations state that owners and directors can be disqualified if \u201cthey have unspent convictions for offences of dishonesty\u201d, rendering Cellino\u2019s current position under renewed threat. His previous conviction for false accounting at Cagliari in 2001, for which he received a suspended 15-month prison sentence, is considered spent in the British legal system but the case of the N\u00e9lie \u2013 and two other pending charges on a Land Rover and a separate yacht \u2013 could have a key influence over his continued ownership of Leeds. The League\u2019s fit and proper persons rules, in place to protect clubs, prohibit individuals with unspent convictions for dishonesty offences from being directors, 30% owners or from exercising control. However, sources close to Cellino have indicated that even if the League should rule against him regarding the N\u00e9lie, his position at Leeds will not be relinquished without a fight. It could become another protracted and messy affair similar to the one which dragged on earlier in the year when Cellino first attempted to buy the West Yorkshire club, thinking he had completed the deal on a bizarre night in the club\u2019s history as fans descended on Elland Road to voice their protest, only to be told later the transaction had not been not ratified. A possible battle in the high court could ensue and potentially another saga that is likely to do no good whatsoever for the club, who this season are rebuilding on the road to a potential first return to the Premier League since 2004. Judge Sandra Lepore\u2019s written findings in the yacht case \u2013 revealed by the Guardian \u2013 certainly do not do Cellino any favours, even if his lawyer in Italy, Giovanni Cocco, has dismissed them as \u201cfull to the brim of errors\u201d. Cocco added: \u201cIt does not take into account what emerged in the trial: that is to say, that nothing implicates Cellino. I have already \u2026 lodged an appeal and have also completely demolished the [judge\u2019s] reasoning.\u201d The standard check on the N\u00e9lie by finance officers on patrol in 2012 turned out to be anything but routine, as Lepore ruled that not only was the yacht registered to a Miami-based company and yet \u201cin the exclusive use \u2026 of an Italian citizen, resident in Cagliari\u201d, but that citizen, Cellino, the then owner of Cagliari football club, was \u201cdiscovered onboard during the check, acting in the capacity of captain\u201d. Subsequent research revealed that import duty on the yacht had not been paid. The total fine was fixed by the police at \u20ac388,500 \u2013 a figure Lepore says was calculated according to the estimated worth of the vessel. Following the first-grade conviction in March, Cellino was ordered to pay a \u20ac600,000 fine. He is appealing that decision and a final judgment is some way off, although prosecutors in the case are also appealing on the grounds that the fine was too lenient. The complexities of the Italian legal system ensure that case may not reach a resolution for a significant time. It is a strange quirk of modern football that unpaid import tax on a yacht in Sardinia two years ago could have such a bearing on the future of a major English club. Yet this is merely another twist in the frenetic recent history of Leeds United. Since his arrival in England Cellino has undoubtedly lived up to his reputation as a maverick individual.

In retrospect, it was a fair call, given how well Rose putted in the rest of the match, going on to compile a 10-birdie finish with Stenson for a 3&amp;2 victory. From the moment he announced his arrival in the game as an amateur teenager by holing from the rough on the 18th to tie for fourth at the 1998 Open at Royal Birkdale, he has had a penchant for the dramatic, and he has hit the heights many times since. But, given the context, beating this fine American pairing probably tops even the final-round 62 he shot in the DP World Championships in Dubai in 2012, when it took a late charge by Rory McIlroy to overhaul him. His putt on the 17th at the Medinah Country Club two years ago to level his match with Phil Mickelson was a singular moment of magic \u2013 rounded out with a winning birdie on the 18th to drag Europe back to parity with the USA in one of sport\u2019s most memorable comebacks. But this was sustained excellence for almost the entire round in a match of the very highest quality. \u201cHenrik was a fantastic partner,\u201d Rose said. \u201c I missed one from eight feet \u2013 I can\u2019t believe I missed \u2013 but Henrik knocked it in from seven feet, and that started a phenomenal run, 10 birdies in a row.\u201d It was irresistible momentum \u2013 although the Americans did their best to stay in touch. Indeed, Watson and Kuchar were two up after six holes and did not play badly at all. \u201cGive Bubba and Matt credit,\u201d Rose said. \u201cWe knew we were up against it with those guys and the spirit in which they played the match was phenomenal. They would have won nine times out of 10.\u201d It was not a promising start: Rose hit some jungle on the left, and Stenson found a bunker on the other side. Rose, whose choice for shower song we had learned earlier was Lose Yourself by Eminem, hardly hit another discordant note, with Stenson an admiring sideman. The Swede, who gave way to Martin Kaymer as Rose\u2019s foursomes partner in the afternoon, said: \u201cIt was definitely Justin who was the backbone in our team and I was lucky enough to be there backing up on a couple of occasions. I didn\u2019t play my best. I think I played better than I did yesterday morning in the better-ball. \u201cWe didn\u2019t give it away. It\u2019s hard to reflect on it that way [as one of the great Ryder Cup matches] when you\u2019re playing, but I guess 21 birdies in 16 holes between us [both teams], that\u2019s something special. Yeah, it might be a highlight to put on the big screen with the grandkids one day.\u201d The first of Rose\u2019s birdies came on the difficult 5th, countering Watson\u2019s 25-foot putt. He levelled on the 8th with another, breaking left to right extravagantly and the gallery sensed something special was unfolding. His next choice of magic wand was a wood to thrash out of the rough to within 15 feet of the pin on the 9th, and he just missed an eagle securing a half. When he holed from off the green at the 10th Europe looked to be pulling away, but were shackled by another fine Watson birdie. The birdies kept flying on a morning of astonishing golf, to the point where par was hardly a matter of vague consideration. Their 12-under was a Ryder Cup record, as were the 21 birdies the fourball managed. \u201cI got into reading the greens well,\u201d Rose said. \u201cWhen you visualise it like that ... it was really happening for me. We set a mini-goal of getting all-square by 16. To close it out then was phenomenal.\u201d In the afternoon, Rose and Kaymer found themselves in a similar situation, trailing after six holes against Jordan Spieth and Patrick Reed, the young American hotshots leading by two until the eighth \u2013 when Reed slid a tricky short putt long. But Spieth\u2019s birdie at the 9th restored the advantage, Rose failing to match him. Rose lipped the cup to blow a chance at the 11th, and Reed saved par. Spieth missed a long par putt on 12, and the lead was cut to a single hole with six to go. It stayed that way until the par-four 15th, when Rose put Kaymer close enough to get back to all square for the first time since the fifth hole. Europe got out of jail when Reed misread a two-footer to blow the 16th . Spieth\u2019s tee-shot at the next hole was superb, and the Americans went to the par-five 18th back in front again. This time Spieth found the bunker, quickly joined in the same sandpit by Rose, but Kaymer had much the easier lie, and put his partner to within four feet with a great shot under pressure. Rose, by this time tired but grateful, found his touch again to grab what could be a crucial half a point at just after 5.30pm to give Europe a 10-6 lead \u2013 the score they overhauled on the final day at Medinah two years ago. \u201cWe had all the chances,\u201d Kaymer said. \u201cAs we walked up the 18th, I said to Justin, \u2018We deserve at least half a point.\u2019\u201d Rose said of their opponents: \u201cThey\u2019ve had a great Ryder Cup, but that match was there for the taking for both teams and they got a bad lie on the 18th.\u201d", "title": "Justin Rose proves Europe\u2019s backbone with a superb display against USA", "sentences": ["But, given the context, beating this fine American pairing probably tops even the final-round 62 he shot in the DP World Championships in Dubai in 2012, when it took a late charge by Rory McIlroy to overhaul him."], "publicationDate": "2014-09-27T17:45:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2014/sep/29/predicting-future-of-travel-holidays", "tags": ["Travel", "Travel websites", "Virtual reality"], "article": "What does the future hold for travel?

We\u2019ve digested the findings and come up with a few ideas that we think would benefit the world of travel. But what would you like to see in future? Give us your ideas in the comments below. Hotel room of the future     Keep fit in your hotel room with a hologram personal trainer Photograph: Skyscanner    They say: Within 10 years travellers will \u201chave no need to encounter a single human being\u201d from the moment they check in. Instead, hotel rooms will be transformed into digital, hyper-interactive spaces in which even the pillows will be \u201cembedded\u201d with electronics to massage your neck and wake you up in the morning. The walls will display high definition images of your friends and family, hologram personal trainers will hang out with you and the shower will use sound technology to \u201cagitate\u201d dirt from your body, using a traffic light system to indicate when you\u2019re clean enough to get out. We say: Thanks shower, but we\u2019re doing just fine when it comes to washing ourselves. As for the prospect of photographs of our friends and family glaring down at us from the walls, surely this will only serve to hammer home just how isolated one feels trapped in a computer-dominated digi-limbo, with a better-looking-than-you hologram making you feel insecure about those profiterole-shaped bulges around your waistline. Meanwhile, it\u2019s only been one night and your partner has already realised they can get better pillow talk from the, well, pillow. You\u2019ve never felt so alone. In a nutshell: Computer says: \u201cYou\u2019re dirty.\u201d Space travel     Architecture firm Foster + Partners have been looking into the possibility of constructing a colony on the moon. Photograph: Skyscanner    They say: For the ultimate in \u201cserious traveller bragging rights\u201d, how about a brief time spent floating weightlessly in low Earth orbit? It\u2019s something that should become relatively affordable (ie $75,000) compared to the cost of, say, an actual Apollo-style excursion to the moon. That said, architects Foster + Partners are currently involved in a project with the European Space Agency exploring ways they could build structures on the moon with the help of 3D printers, so a lunar hotel could be on the horizon. We say: It\u2019s bad enough having to listen to someone recounting the time they befriended a local harem pants salesman during their gap year in India, let alone the time they accidentally sneezed in their own face while experiencing zero gravity. A moon colony, however, does pique our interest. In a nutshell: Get saving. Underwater experiences     Underwater hotels, like the planned Poseidon Underwater Resort in Fiji (pictured), will become more mainstream in the future - but it\u2019ll cost you. Photograph: Skyscanner    They say: Sub-aquatic hotels will be a \u201cfar more mainstream proposition\u201d by 2024 and underwater tourism will certainly trump space travel. As Skyscanner CEO Gareth William says: \u201cI suspect you would get more from it, because there is more to see down there than in space.\u201d That said, the Poseidon Underwater Resort in Fiji, which was due to open in 2008, is still nowhere near ready. We say: It may not cost as much as space but sleeping with the fishes is still going to be beyond the budget of 99% of holidaymakers \u2013 when it does finally open, a week at the Poseidon resort in Fiji will cost \u00a39,000. In a nutshell: Don\u2019t hold your breath. Local travel     A couple arrive in their Airbnb apartment - but peer-to-peer holiday rentals are just the beginning. Photograph: Peter Stroh/Alamy    They say: Peer-to-peer collaboration will take over the world, and within the next decade between 5-10% of people could be renting out their homes to travellers. Increasingly, \u201csocial travel\u201d \u2013 from accommodation to supper clubs and other experiences \u2013 will become part of the traditional travel industry. New tools will lead to collaboration between tourists and people in the destinations, helping create more localised and personal travel. We say: As personal, authentic experiences go mainstream, what next for the current set of supper-clubbing, airbnbing globetrotters who like to think of themselves as travellers not tourists? The only way they will be able to distance themselves from the travelling masses muscling in on their territory is to drop the idea of social travel altogether (so 2014) and instead adopt an anti-social approach: the countryside will be awash with hipsters being mindful \u2013 alone \u2013 in the woods. In a nutshell: Forget secret supper clubs \u2013 expect secret holidays. Extreme travel     Tourism to North Korea is already increasing in popularity and \u201cextreme\u201d tourism is set to grow. Photograph: Gavin Hellier/Alamy    They say: In the further pursuit of \u201cbragging rights\u201d, tourists will start pursuing adventures in extreme destinations. Travellers will want to be the first to drop in on so-called \u201cforbidden zones\u201d, destinations once rendered inaccessible by conflict or political instability or, conversely, be among the last people to see a habitat or species threatened with extinction. Lebanon will become the new Dubai, Angola could take off too, and the chance to spot a bare-faced tamarin before the species dies out will be a lifetime holiday highlight for a lucky few. We say: Firstly, anyone who goes on holiday for \u201cbragging rights\u201d is an idiot. As for travelling to forbidden zones, fine if you\u2019ve got a genuine interest \u2013 but even then let the story of Matthew Miller, the American who wanted to secretly investigate the human rights situation in North Korean prisons \u2013 and is now experiencing them at first hand \u2013 be a cautionary tale. In a nutshell: Don\u2019t do it. Five things we\u2019d like to see in 2024     Commercial airships are already in development \u2013 could they become a commercial form of transport in the near future? Photograph: PATRICK SEEGER/EPA    Airships, the return ofEver since the Hindenberg disaster, the idea of travelling beneath a huge balloon of highly inflammable gas has \u2013 perhaps understandably \u2013 been on the back burner. But now they are back in development: safe, environmentally friendly and with the potential to stay in the air for weeks at a time, dirigible transportation seems to us like the closest we\u2019ll come to living in the clouds. Transatlantic trainsLondon King\u2019s Cross to New York\u2019s Grand Central without changing trains? Someone needs to start digging that tunnel. Virtual reality destination testingIn the future, holidays from hell should become inconceivable. One way of ensuring this is through virtual reality destination testing. Simply pop on an Oculus Rift headset and go for a stroll. Mould in the hotel room? Building work in the pool? Then go somewhere else or sort out the problem before you go. Never again shall unsuspecting holidaymakers be faced with such imperfections on arrival. Multi-lingual brain implants\u201cMe \u2026 Want \u2026 Beer?\u201d In the future, the linguistic ineptitude of British travellers will be an irrelevance thanks to the invention of multi-lingual brain implants that you can inject into your skull at all good chemists.

Insta-hols brain zaps(Probably) using the same technology of multilingual brain implants, in the future you won\u2019t even need to go on holiday to get that refreshed and relaxed feeling. Instead, just zap yourself with a \u201choli-rod\u201d and to be transported to your destination of choice. Two minutes later you\u2019ll be back in the office, this time with a brain full of wonderful memories, such as the delicious cocktails you drank in that underwater hotel, and how clean you feel from the intelligent shower you had that morning.

Probably to the relief of parents familiar with the increasing trauma over trauma affecting another contact sport, American football, they did not then run straight into the nearest similar kid. Waisale Serevi, the Fijian rugby union great who was overseeing the day\u2019s events, explained: \u201cA lot of kids, at our first training session they say \u2018When are we doing tackling? When are we running straight at each other?\u2019\u201d Clapping his right fist into his open left hand, with a laugh, he continued:  That is normal, because that\u2019s what they see in football, running straight into each other, and they think that is rugby. And we tell them that is the easiest way to play rugby. But our thing is that we are trying to get kids to get used to using the space; trying to evade the defenders, trying to create the space for another friend to score the try.  Concern over the damaging effects of contact sports is not confined to the US, where debate continues over a $765m concussions settlement reached between the National Football League and a group of former players. Though many American advocates of rugby promote it as an alternative to football, played without the illusory security of helmets and pads and with rules to make tackles as safe as possible, worry is spreading at all levels of the game, from moneyed megastars to muddied minis. In Britain such concern surrounds the recent publication of a book, Tackling Rugby: What Every Parent Should Know.  Serevi, however, is on a mission \u201cto spread the gospel\u201d, with an eponymous, Seattle-based company as his ministry. In Harlem, while he signed t-shirts with a habitual reference to Philippians 4:13 \u2013 wherein lies the phrase \u201cI can do all things through Christ who strengthens me\u201d \u2013 it was clear his vision was more New Testament than Old, more of heavenly skills than the hellish collisions of Gog-and-Magog forwards which mar so much of the modern game. There were certainly no collisions between the children of Columbia Secondary School, who were being coached by Serevi and representatives from Play Rugby USA thanks to Sevens World Series sponsor HSBC. Attempting to grow the shortened form of rugby before it goes Olympic in Rio in 2016, the bank has already staged such \u201cfestivals\u201d in Brazil and Hong Kong; Canada, Australia and Dubai are next. The events are aimed at children who have never picked up a rugby ball. In Harlem, thanks to teacher and former New York Rugby Club captain Harold Delucia, Serevi, USA sevens star Matt Hawkins and women\u2019s Eagle Phaidra Knight were partly preaching to the converted. The next day, however, the show would move to less-explored territory, in Queens, and complete a first New York mission projected to reach close to 2,000 children. On Monday the coaching ran in shifts, one tide of white t-shirted kids succeeding another to sprint, dodge and tag. Oval balls were passed and kicked across asphalt perhaps used to a more regular bounce \u2013 \u201cThey have the skills because of basketball,\u201d Serevi said, \u201cand rugby\u2019s like that, you have to catch, you have to run, you have to see and use the spaces\u201d \u2013 and locals paused at the chain-link fence to watch. Listening from the 125th Street subway, a couple of blocks away, whistles, laughter and applause could be heard. \u201cFor me as a little kid,\u201d Serevi said, \u201cI was hoping for this kind of environment. When I played for Fiji I found my own way to get there \u2013 I didn\u2019t have top rugby players to teach me a few basic skills. That was the goal with Serevi Rugby, to give back to rugby, to try to help kids make a pathway to international level, maybe.\u201d            Serevi played international 15-a-side at three World Cups, and was employed by clubs in England, France and Japan. He shone brightest, however, in sevens, leading Fiji to world titles in 1997 and 2005. He is widely considered the greatest sevens player of all time. Played drastically short-handed on a full-size field, sevens is the quickest and most open form of rugby. Contact still counts \u2013 as football convert and \u201cfastest man in rugby\u201d Carlin Isles has found out over two fascinating seasons in the American game \u2013 but space and speed count for more. \u201cThis is how I used to play rugby,\u201d Serevi said.   And this is what we are trying to teach the kids now, whatever grade we go to \u2013 here or in high school or college. We try to tell the players, \u2018Use the space, use the players to score the try.\u2019  As debate increases over the fractures, concussions and even paralyses that can be caused by rugby, it is a lesson worth remembering. This may be a contact sport, but that does not mean contact should always be sought. \u201cI always tell the kids it\u2019s how I survived 21 years of rugby,\u201d Serevi said. \u201cUsing the space and making the big boys look funny on the field. The kids always like that \u2013 and so that\u2019s what we try to do.\u201d", "title": "Rugby great Serevi does the Harlem shuffle \u2013 and dummy, sidestep and pass | Martin Pengelly", "sentences": ["Attempting to grow the shortened form of rugby before it goes Olympic in Rio in 2016, the bank has already staged such \u201cfestivals\u201d in Brazil and Hong Kong; Canada, Australia and Dubai are next."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-01T13:00:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/01/frankie-dettori-ruler-of-the-world-arc-de-triomphe", "tags": ["Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe", "Frankie Dettori", "Ryan Moore", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "  Frankie Dettori will attempt to win the Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe for a fourth time at Longchamp on Sunday after he was confirmed as the rider of Ruler Of The World, last year\u2019s Derby winner, in the European season\u2019s showpiece event. Ryan Moore, meanwhile, could yet pick up a ride in the race at the 11th hour, with Tapestry, who beat the Arc favourite, Taghrooda, in the Yorkshire Oaks in August, emerging on Wednesday evening as a possible addition to the field at Thursday\u2019s supplementary stage. Ruler Of The World is just one of three leading contenders for Sunday\u2019s race who will carry the colours of Sheikh Joaan al-Thani\u2019s al-Shaqab Racing, which retains Dettori as its principal jockey. He is now spared the embarrassment of not being aboard any of the al-Shaqab runners, having lost the ride on Treve, last year\u2019s Arc winner, at the request of the filly\u2019s trainer Criquette Head. He was then denied the chance to partner Ectot, the Prix Niel winner, after the colt\u2019s regular partner Gregory Benoist decided to take the ride in preference to Avenir Certain, the French Oaks winner. Al-Shaqab bought what was described at the time as \u201ca significant share\u201d in Ruler Of The World in March, when a statement from John Magnier\u2019s Coolmore Stud, where Ruler Of The World will retire to stand as a stallion, suggested that Joseph O\u2019Brien, the trainer\u2019s son, would keep the ride. However, O\u2019Brien has ridden Ruler Of The World only once this season, in the Dubai World Cup in late March, with Dettori coming in for the winning ride in last month\u2019s Prix Foy at Longchamp when O\u2019Brien was on duty for his father at The Curragh. Dettori rode a well-judged race from the front on Ruler Of The World, but did so in a small field and with plenty of rope from his fellow riders. It is hard to imagine Dettori attempting a similar trick in the Arc, however, when the pace will be much more strongly contested. Even a seven-length success in the al\u2011Shaqab colours in the opening race here on Wednesday could not persuade Dettori to speak to reporters, but Harry Herbert, al\u2011Shaqab\u2019s racing manager, was relieved that speculation about the ride on Ruler Of The World had been resolved. \u201cWe are delighted that Frankie will be on board on Sunday,\u201d Herbert said. \u201cWe discussed the ride with John Magnier and the Coolmore team and they are happy for Frankie to take the ride too. \u201cHe is in good form at home and we are looking forward to the race.\u201d Dettori, who signed a retainer with al\u2011Shaqab in the summer of 2013, missed out on the winning ride on Treve in the Arc 12 months ago after he broke his ankle in a fall a few days before the race. Thierry Jarnet, who replaced Dettori last year, has since returned to his earlier role as Treve\u2019s regular partner and will be in her saddle again on Sunday. Joseph O\u2019Brien could now ride Chicquita, last year\u2019s Irish Oaks winner, in the Arc, although the filly has an alternative engagement this weekend in the Group One Prix de l\u2019Opera. Moore, meanwhile, has emerged as a possible partner for Tapestry, who followed up her victory at York by finishing ninth of 10 starters in the Matron Stakes in September over an inadequate trip. The decision to book Dettori for Ruler Of The World could be seen as a snub to Joseph O\u2019Brien, whose weight would not be an issue on the four-year-old as it was when he was forced to give up the ride on Camelot, the 2012 Derby winner, in the same year\u2019s Arc. Dettori was again the rider to benefit, a decision which precipitated the end of his association with Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s Godolphin operation after nearly 20 years. Since three-year-old fillies get a weight allowance from colts, O\u2019Brien could not ride Tapestry either. It is the money generated by the Coolmore Stud\u2019s breeding and bloodstock operation which supports the racing side of the business at Ballydoyle, however. Sheikh Joaan has invested many millions of pounds to establish himself as a major player in Flat racing, and it seems certain that he will spend millions more at the major bloodstock sales for years to come. Since the Sheikh clearly hoped to see Al Shaqab\u2019s retained jockey aboard Ruler Of The World on Sunday, it must have made perfect business sense from Magnier\u2019s point of view to let him have his way.", "title": "Frankie Dettori rides Ruler Of The World in Prix de l\u2019Arc de Triomphe", "sentences": ["However, O\u2019Brien has ridden Ruler Of The World only once this season, in the Dubai World Cup in late March, with Dettori coming in for the winning ride in last month\u2019s Prix Foy at Longchamp when O\u2019Brien was on duty for his father at The Curragh."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-01T14:58:30Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/fairtrade-partner-zone/2014/oct/02/transparency-supply-chain-fairtrade-gold-silver-jewellery", "tags": [], "article": "Consumers are now very familiar with Fairtrade coffee, bananas and flowers. It\u2019s quite remarkable that you can buy a \u00a310 bunch of Fairtrade roses from Sainsbury\u2019s and know exactly which farm in Kenya they were grown on, because a transparent supply chain has existed for over 25 years.  Depending on which bunch you buy, they could have been grown on a farm that has educated the children of its farmers for many years, through primary school to secondary school and, for the most talented, on to university. A farm that also has a great environmental programme, including geothermal wells and a rhinoceros breeding station. A modest bunch of flowers can have real integrity. Yet ask anyone who is married where the gold in their wedding ring came from and they won\u2019t know, despite the fact that it is likely to be one of the most significant purchases they ever make. This is what I want to change. Cred Jewellery is bringing the same supply chain management to the jewellery industry as supermarkets like Waitrose and Sainsbury\u2019s have done with fresh produce. Currently the gold market is fragmented with 90% of the world\u2019s gold produced by big mining companies. One Brazilian mine is excavating 600,000 tons of ore a day. What environmental legacy will that leave the surrounding area? Only 10% of the world\u2019s gold supply comes from small scale miners and they are often informal or illegal, using dangerous working practices and leaving high levels of pollutants behind. Large scale refineries have taken gold produced by dubious methods, refined it and then sold it into the supply chain as \u2018clean\u2019 gold. Although there are new international guidelines requiring refineries to demonstrate that they have sourced gold responsibly, earlier this year one of the world\u2019s largest refineries, based in Dubai, was reported to have been engaging in \u2018cash for gold\u2019 deals without checking any paperwork for the gold they bought. They are not the only ones whose supply chain lacks transparency. Cred Jewellery is the pioneer for transparency and traceability in the gold supply chain, with our work resulting in gold being established as a Fairtrade product in 2011. Importantly, all aspects of the supply chain are audited by FLO-Cert, an independent certification body, to ensure that they achieve stringent standards. The importance of this credibility cannot be overestimated. There are over 1.4 million small scale farmers and workers around the world signed up to produce Fairtrade products. The benefits are a supply chain with integrity. As well as receiving a fair price, for every kilo of gold purchased on Fairtrade terms, small scale miners earn a social premium of $2,000 (\u00a31,230) which goes to improve the social fabric of their local communities including schools, clean water, electricity and health care. The system works, and the public trust the Fairtrade Mark, recognising that the producers are getting a fair deal. The jewellery industry is 30 years behind the fresh produce industry in its supply chain management and needs to wake up. Just recently, we have started labelling our product with the contents and the origin of its gold and silver. We want to challenge the industry to come clean about where its materials come from and how they are produced. If the consumer wants to know where the gold in their wedding ring comes from and how it was produced, the only choice is Fairtrade gold, which has been independently audited by a body with 20 years\u2019 experience. Typically artisanal miners in Africa earn less than a $1 a day and live in extreme poverty, yet they are producing gold that could end up as someone\u2019s wedding ring. By choosing a ring that is made from Fairtrade gold, consumers can show they care about each other and that they care about helping small scale miners to enjoy a fairer and more sustainable future.

At Cannes in 1978, while promoting the film Pretty Baby, she ran around in thrift-store castoffs, with no makeup and her hair unbrushed. These days, her daughter tells her off if she tries to leave the house without grooming. \u201cIt\u2019s just different now. My daughter\u2019s teaching me how to be a star. She says, \u2018What do you mean, you don\u2019t have a stylist?\u2019 The maintenance just wasn\u2019t the same then.\u201d At 67, Sarandon is in terrific shape, almost eerily youthful-seeming, without the alarmed look of the overly worked-on. After lunch with her assistants in a Manhattan hotel room, she rises to begin the day\u2019s publicity, crossing the room in imperious style and flinching at being made to say hello to the photographer. When a make-up artist starts working on her face, she snaps at her: \u201cThis [interview] isn\u2019t on camera.\u201d Sarandon has made a lot of good films (Thelma &amp; Louise, The Witches Of Eastwick, Bull Durham), won an Oscar for Dead Man Walking in 1996 and continued working, with solid regularity, throughout the danger zone of an actor\u2019s 40s, 50s and now 60s. Nonetheless, she affects a certain boredom with the whole acting enterprise, deriving more pleasure and passion from her politics, which she has been committed to since going on an anti-Vietnam demo in the early 1970s. While married to Tim Robbins, she was half of the most visible liberal unit in Hollywood, a role that Sarandon relishes enormously and would far rather talk about than her latest film, The Calling, a so-so serial-killer flick with Donald Sutherland and Ellen Burstyn, in which she plays a small-town cop with personal problems, hunting down a killer in the face of departmental intransigence. (It\u2019s set in Canada, and there are lots of Fargo-esque scenes of cops milling about drinking coffee in the snow.)     Sarandon as a small-town cop in her latest film, The Calling    The most interesting thing about the film is its Catholic bones. Sutherland, with whom Sarandon appeared in the 1989 film A Dry White Season, is a priest who has to chew through a lot of Da Vinci Code type cod-theology, to explain the ritual behind the serial killer\u2019s style. \u201cI had to read it over a few times to even understand the deal myself,\u201d Sarandon says. \u201cThat was a masterclass in how to take a big bunch of pretty dry dialogue and make it live in that moment.\u201d She is herself a lapsed Catholic \u2013 very lapsed: she hasn\u2019t practised since her teens when, for a short time, her faith was important to her. Sarandon is from a working-class New Jersey family, the oldest of nine children, who was sent to a Catholic grammar school and told early on that she had \u201can overabundance of original sin\u201d. (This was in response to an innocent question she asked in class: \u201cI put up my hand and asked, \u2018If, as the nuns said, you had to be married in the Catholic church or it didn\u2019t count, how were Joseph and Mary married, because Jesus didn\u2019t make up the church until later?\u2019\u201d She was hauled outside into the hallway and told she was sinful.) Sarandon was not a natural rebel; she wasn\u2019t trying to be smart. Growing up, she says, she believed everything her parents and the wider culture told her. She was terrified that the communists would invade America. \u201cSo I was praying every recess when everyone else was making out in the confessionals. I actually wanted to be a good person, wanted to have my faith.\u201d     With Cher and Michelle Pfeiffer in The Witches of Eastwick. Photograph: Allstar    The religion fell away pretty quickly when she left home to go to college in Washington DC \u2013 the fact that it was a Catholic university was just happenstance; after Sarandon\u2019s parents missed the deadline on all her other college applications, it was the only place she could get into. She had given up on religion by then, but a whiff of piety lingers in her flat, affronted air of certainty. She has about her the martyred aspect of one who acts against her own commercial interests, a priority she has maintained since her early 20s. \u201cIn those days, the media wasn\u2019t so corporate, so you were seeing what was going on in the south with the hosing of people, and you saw what was going on in Vietnam. If you had any moral fibre at all, you protested the war. It was just part of being young and being awake.\u201d Acting was an interest: the college\u2019s English and drama departments turned out to be rather good, Sarandon says, and she started auditioning for plays, without any real hope of ever turning professional. After marrying fellow student Chris Sarandon and moving to New York, everything happened quickly, and to her great surprise she got work almost immediately on a TV soap opera and then won the lead in a crime drama, Joe. \u201cSo I had never taken acting lessons, never thought of myself as a practical actor or anything, but just sort of fell into it.\u201d Chris Sarandon was an actor, too, and got work on Broadway, so they were, among their struggling acting peers, in a position of relative privilege. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have much of anything. But we didn\u2019t need much of anything.\u201d For the next 20 years, Sarandon was in constant demand, an actor who fell outside the traditional Hollywood mould, bringing a delightful, bug-eyed intensity to her roles and whose name, attached to a film, tended to guarantee a certain quality. Off-screen, her marriage ended in 1979 and there were some high-profile affairs \u2013 with her The Hunger co-star David Bowie, she recently confessed, and with her director on Pretty Baby, Louis Malle, 30 years her senior.     Sarandon with David Bowie \u2013 she recently confessed to having an affair with the singer in the 1980s. Photograph: Getty    She is interesting on the subject of the dating age gap, having been on both sides of the equation. Robbins was 12 years her junior, and she is currently involved with Jonathan Bricklin, her business partner in the ping-pong franchise Spin, who is in his mid-30s. It is not, she says, so much a question of age as of status when you enter the relationship. \u201cThe biggest age difference was with Louis Malle, and whatever that balance is in the beginning, it\u2019s very hard to reconfigure. So, if you are an actor in a director\u2019s movie and you meet him when you\u2019re there to make his entire world come true, it\u2019s hard to pull away and not have him be upset.\u201d In her next life, Sarandon says, she would like to be a therapist; relationships fascinate her, \u201cand they\u2019re probably one of the few things worth investing in on an experimental level, because you learn so much about yourself and so much about the areas you\u2019re trying to protect, and where you\u2019re tethered and where you\u2019re not. And, of course, your relationships when you don\u2019t have children can be very different from when you\u2019re nesting and expect a partner to be there on certain other conditions. Pragmatism takes over at some point, when you\u2019re protecting your eggs.\u201d Sarandon didn\u2019t use birth control during her 20s and 30s, after a doctor diagnosed her with endometriosis and said it was impossible for her to conceive. (She mentions this with the caveat that though it is not, wholly, polite fodder for discussion, on the other hand a lot of women suffer from similar conditions, so she feels obliged to raise it.) Having children had never been a particular goal and she took this diagnosis on the chin, she says. Somewhere in Sarandon\u2019s late 30s, however, she started to feel restless. \u201cI was praying in every chapel. I had become more and more hands-on political; I had just come back from Nicaragua, and was praying for something to give my life more meaning. I was not looking to have a child \u2013 I was almost 40 \u2013 but I was not that satisfied in this profession and thought, there has to be something that has more meaning.\u201d     Susan Sarandon with ex-husband Tim Robbins, their sons and her daughter Photograph: Rex    She considered staying in Nicaragua and devoting her life to charity work and activism. \u201cIn movies, I wasn\u2019t getting parts that were stretching me so much. I was earning a living and having a good time; I\u2019ve always had a good time. But I was at a crossroads and needed to move on in some way.\u201d And then something odd happened: after a summer fling in Italy with the Italian director Franco Amurri, she got pregnant. \u201cNo one could even figure out how, because it wasn\u2019t supposed to be possible. And with this man who was 12 years younger, who I was just dating. And so I kind of said, \u2018OK\u2019 and told him, \u2018You can participate or not.\u2019\u201d Did getting pregnant in these circumstances reboot her faith? \u201cHahaha. You never know where the answer\u2019s going to come from. And it was a great decision.\u201d Sarandon returned to New York and threw herself into motherhood. There were, she says, advantages to having a child at that point in her life. She had sufficient resources to quit work for a while, and didn\u2019t feel guilty at leaving the Hollywood rat race. \u201cBecause I was old \u2013 39 when I had my first and 45 when I had my third \u2013 and my profession had been demystified. I thought that being with my kids, at that time, was so much more interesting.\u201d Sarandon\u2019s other children were born after her marriage to Robbins, which was for many years held up as a rare example of a great showbusiness marriage. That\u2019s all very well, Sarandon says, but people and relationships change, and most of us aren\u2019t set up to accommodate either. She has a theory that long-term marriages are sustainable only with better management systems in place. Such as? \u201cThe difficulty is growing with someone you pick at a certain point, through all those different stages. I always thought marriage contracts should be renewed every five years, so you get together and then there\u2019s a no-guilt release clause after five years. Then, after the next five years, you talk about it again. If you knew that the five-year deadline was coming, you\u2019d be on good behaviour; you\u2019d work harder and maybe you wouldn\u2019t take your partner for granted. Maybe you\u2019d help out a little, with the kids, because you could see that she\u2019s getting worn down.     Sarandon with her partner, Jonathan Bricklin. Photograph: David M Benett/Getty    \u201cThat\u2019s the built-in problem with long-term relationships: you get to a certain point and you try to hold on to that, instead of constantly seeing it as an organism that\u2019s moving and needs to be fed and re-examined and let some air in. You just try to maintain the status quo, and that doesn\u2019t work because you can\u2019t control anything or anybody. You\u2019re fighting a losing battle.\u201d Fame adds another level of pressure, of course, although one imagines there is something intimate about sharing the bubble of celebrity with someone in the same position. \u201cAssuming that they\u2019re not competitive,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem when two people are in the public eye. Do you feel bad when they come and ask you for an autograph and not him?\u201d Two of Sarandon\u2019s children now live in LA and work in the film and TV industry; her daughter, Eva, acted alongside her in the 2002 movie, The Banger Sisters. The third is a musician, who lives in a building in Brooklyn in which Sarandon recently bought a stake. Real estate, she says, is the only conscious and smart investment decision she has made, \u201cmostly so that my kids each have a place where the maintenance isn\u2019t too high and they\u2019re safe. I\u2019m actually in a lawsuit now with my past business manager, so that shows you that I wasn\u2019t very shrewd. I just glaze over when people start talking about numbers.\u201d Her ping-pong business is doing very well, with new franchises opening on the west coast of America and in Dubai; so she must have a certain amount of business know-how. Not so, she says. \u201cYesterday, we had a big meeting for Spin and I purposefully missed the first hour, which was the financials, because I\u2019m just not interested. I\u2019m interested in the hospitality end and giving people a good time and coming up with good ideas. I know, for instance, that Goldie Hawn is really clever with money. I think Private Benjamin was one of the first really big deals, where she owned part of it. And she has houses everywhere. [Diane] Keaton, too. Those gals are smart. One would never accuse me of being a shrewd business person.\u201d Sarandon saves her energy for other enterprises, first and foremost her politics. When she started becoming well-known, she was asked by various causes to make public appearances on TV and at rallies, and initially hesitated. \u201cI\u2019m still not very comfortable when I have to speak in front of a crowd. I try to keep it simple.\u201d The coverage hasn\u2019t always been flattering. \u201cWhen I went to Nicaragua in \u201984, I remember I was splashed across People magazine in a scary way. Hanoi Susan.\u201d     In Thelma &amp; Louise Photograph: Rex    At this point, her campaigning is part of her image and probably attracts as many people as it repels. On the whole, her agents and business managers have never tried to get her to tone it down, she says, mainly because she doesn\u2019t tell them what she\u2019s planning ahead of time. \u201cI would always tell my kids if I was going to get arrested and explain what was going on and bring them back the plastic cuffs.\u201d Before the start of the second Iraq war, Sarandon talked with other Hollywood liberals such as George Clooney and Sean Penn, her old co-star from Dead Man Walking, as well as Michael Moore. \u201cWe tried to be there for each other. It\u2019s not so much that you\u2019ll never work again. It\u2019s really the shunning thing that\u2019s the scariest. From your peers.\u201d She is fairly immune to opposition. \u201cJust the other day, I repeated some kind of statistics about the shelling of Gaza, that was a UN statistic, how many kids have been killed.\u201d A few people replied, she said, with \u201cthings like, \u2018Oh, and it\u2019s all right for them to be shelling Israel \u2013 what, do you hate Jews?\u2019 And my dog tweeted back, \u2018I don\u2019t think violence is the way to solve any problem.\u2019\u201d Penny, Sarandon\u2019s Pomeranian-Maltese cross, has her own Twitter account (@Mspennypuppy) which, as you can see, is pretty adorable. \u201cThe good news and bad news about Hollywood,\u201d she says, \u201cis that they\u2019re not political. They probably would punish you more for getting overweight or getting old.\u201d That\u2019s why she lives in New York. \u201cIn LA, you can lose a job over a head of lettuce in a supermarket if you\u2019re not all pulled together. You know: \u2018I saw her, she\u2019s not looking so good.\u2019\u201d She has been to Africa to highlight the Aids crisis, and on the Phil Donahue show to talk about Haiti. \u201cI\u2019ll ask questions. But I don\u2019t ever tell anyone what they should think.\u201d She highlights inconsistencies in the public interest. \u201cSome woman called in once and said, \u2018Why should we listen to anything you have to say?\u2019 I said, \u2018I can\u2019t think of one reason you should listen to what I have to say, and I can\u2019t think of one reason you should care who I\u2019m sleeping with, either.\u2019 All I\u2019m saying is, these people can\u2019t get on TV. I\u2019m a UN representative, that\u2019s why you have me going into sub-Saharan Africa to cover the beginning of Aids years and years ago, and when some person \u2013 I don\u2019t know if it was the BBC \u2013 said, \u2018Why should we care what you have to say? You\u2019re not an expert on Aids.\u2019 I said, \u2018Well, why weren\u2019t you here before I got here?\u2019\u201d Her daughter Eva recently had a baby girl called Marlowe, Sarandon\u2019s first grandchild, and soon after the birth she flew to LA to be with her family. Getting older has its compensations, and playing older does, too. The role she took in Melissa McCarthy\u2019s recent comedy, Tammy, in which she aged up to her 80s, had a certain liberating feel to it, not least because at the end of the day she could take off all the makeup and feel rejuvenated. (\u201cMy makeup artist had just come off 12 Years A Slave, so she was used to the heavy prosthetics.\u201d) She\u2019ll see what comes next in terms of movie roles, but, \u201cI\u2019m glad I\u2019m kind of out of the dying groove\u201d. For a while, that\u2019s all she would get cast as \u2013 the dying \u2013 \u201cand then I played three alcoholics in a row\u201d. She\u2019d like to get more into documentary film-making. But, she says, don\u2019t mistake her for someone with a coherent plan. That\u2019s not her style. \u201cI don\u2019t see myself as an expert on anything but my own survival.\u201d \u2022 The Calling is released in the UK on 10 October.", "title": "Susan Sarandon: \u2018The good news and bad news about Hollywood is that they\u2019re not political\u2019", "sentences": ["I just glaze over when people start talking about numbers.\u201d Her ping-pong business is doing very well, with new franchises opening on the west coast of America and in Dubai; so she must have a certain amount of business know-how."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-03T13:00:04Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/05/comic-con-moscow-russia-geek-culture-global-domination", "tags": ["Russia", "Europe", "World news", "Comic-Con", "Comics and graphic novels", "Festivals", "Culture"], "article": "It\u2019s a far cry from the streets of San Diego, but for Artur, the early morning trip to Moscow\u2019s Crocus Centre is a pilgrimage like no other.

The Moscow iteration of Comic-Con is the latest of a series of new destinations on the map. After the Delhi Comic Con launched in 2011 and the Middle East Comic-Con appeared in Dubai in 2012, Comic-Con landed in Eastern Europe in Bucharest last year. The Romanian festival pulled in 9,400 in its first year, with attendance more than doubling to 22,000 this time round. For the thousands who have waited in line, the convention\u2019s appearance in Moscow was an inevitable next step. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to come for years,\u201d says 31-year-old Elena Formina. \u201cThere have always been geeks and fans here, it\u2019s just now they call it Comic-Con. American, Russian \u2013 all fans are the same. They love their heroes.

A lot of the films may be American, but it\u2019s an international culture and it is becoming more and more global.\u201d Dressed as Katniss Everdeen from The Hunger Games trilogy, 18-year-old Victoria Ocharova clutches her bow and arrows tightly. She says she\u2019s not here for anything specific, but to simply be with like-minded people. \u201cWould my friends think this was strange, or not Russian? I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve not talked about it with them. They don\u2019t know I\u2019m here. We have different interests. But I just love this book and I love being this character. I love when people ask to have their photograph taken with me. Next year I\u2019ll be back \u2013 except then, my costume will be better.\u201d Not everyone is buying into it, though. Olga, a middle-aged woman standing on the glass balcony overlooking the entrance, is quick to share her concerns. She cautiously peers out on the convention, making it clear that she is only here to supervise her 13 year-old-son. \u201cHe likes the TV show Supernatural but nothing else,\u201d she says sharply. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not harmful for children, but it\u2019s not normal.

Successful applicants would travel the world from India to Argentina and their primary function would be to drink tea. Tea tasting is an art as rarefied as whisky blending or wine connoisseurship, but even the humblest supermarket teabag is the result of hours of expert sipping, grading and blending. \u201cTea is a natural crop and so taste and quality can vary,\u201d says Giles Oakley, a tea taster and buyer with Tetley. \u201cSometimes harvests in one area can be scarce so you have to change the source and recipe of the leaves and the skill of the taster and blender ensures that this doesn\u2019t alter the taste of a brand.\u201d In rooms resembling science labs, tasters move along several dozen tea samples, slurping the liquid from a spoon to ensure it hits all the taste buds at high speed, then expelling it into a wheeled spittoon. Some of the samples will be from shipments that the company has not yet bid for and wants to try out; others from lots that it has already committed to buying and needs to grade for the British palate. \u201cTetley has five offices across India and Africa and staff there will taste the individual lots before an auction then we in the UK taste bulk lots to decide which will blend well together,\u201d says Oakley. \u201cThe trickiest part is relating what you\u2019re tasting in the office to the practical demands in the factory \u2013 tea destined for teabags, for instance, has to physically fit into a small sachet so you can\u2019t buy wiry, curly leaves for that, whereas when you\u2019re tasting for Indian brands you have to think of the visual attributes of the crop because Indians don\u2019t tend to use tea bags and are therefore much more in touch with the leaves.\u201d     Giles Oakley, a tea taster and buyer with Tetley. Photograph: Giles Oakley    It takes five years to train a palate to identify, blindfold, the origin and blend of each sample and an expert is expected to be able to detect not only the country that produced a certain batch, but the region. A background in botany or science is useful but unnecessary \u2013 what\u2019s crucial, according to Oakley, is a good head for numbers and interpersonal skills. He was a philosophy graduate with no clear ambition when he saw an advert for a trainee tea taster at Tetley. \u201cIt said applicants must be able to travel the world,\u201d he says. \u201cI had spent a year as an English language teacher in Indonesia and Dubai, which had given me the travel bug, and I liked the thought of becoming an expert in something so integral to everyday life.\u201d Oakley was one of several hundred applicants for the post. During a full day of tests and group exercises, his presentation, analytical and interaction skills were scrutinised and his vision probed with colour-blindness challenges since tasters must be able to distinguish the differing colours as well as the flavours of tea leaves. His philosophy training proved, he says, an unexpected advantage. \u201cThere are a couple of philosophers in our department \u2013 the subject challenges you to think beyond boundaries and question assumptions which are useful attributes in the competitive world of tea auctions.\u201d New recruits on a starting salary of around \u00a325,000 spend their first months sipping their way through hundreds of spoonfuls of tea a day under the eye of a supervisor, memorising the names and groups of leaves and mastering the bespoke language used by different tea companies to describe them. Imbibing is only a small part of the job, however. In order to balance what they taste with the realities of the market, trainees have to understand the full process of the tea trade from crop planting to the supermarket shelves. They are drilled in presenting market reports at the weekly buying meetings in which that week\u2019s purchases are recited and forecasts for future prices, availability and demand discussed. Then, after detailed courses on blending different varieties to suit public demand, comes a lengthy training trip overseas to study the manufacturing process and how tea is bought and sold and to meet the network of traders that they will ultimately do business with. \u201cThe first experience of a tea auction is terrifying because you are spending vast sums of money with the nod of your head,\u201d says Oakley. \u201cIt\u2019s essential to have stamina because you always get pushed around a bit on your first few visits.\u201d Oakley relied on budget tea bags before his induction into gourmet blends and, like most of the British population, he had little contact with the ingredients of his daily brew.

All three of the sales-toppers were knocked down to a bidder for the Maktoum family and are likely to carry Godolphin\u2019s colours when they make it to the racecourse in the next year or two. This was only the second time in the recollection of Tattersalls\u2019 marketing director, Jimmy George, that three yearlings had fetched seven figures on the same day. He said the top price of 1.7m guineas for a son of Shamardal was the most paid for a yearling at auction anywhere in the world this year, while the aggregate of 28.9m guineas (\u00a330.3m) for 123 lots was a new record for a single day at a European yearling sale. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a lot of interest from America, Hong Kong, South Africa and Japan,\u201d George said. \u201cI think [the high prices reached] reflect the diversity of the participants at the top level and the quality of British and Irish bloodstock at the moment, which is arguably as good as it has ever been. People from throughout the world are coming here, confident of finding thoroughbreds of the highest quality. \u201cObviously, the market has had its challenges, post 2008. But in overall terms, there are signs of recovery throughout the world and the demand for top-quality thoroughbreds remains remarkably resilient.\u201d John Ferguson, who made the successful bids for all three top lots, said: \u201cI think the standard of yearlings this year is higher than I can remember for many years, at the sales and also the homebreds. Horses are like wine, some years are better than others. We\u2019ve had a good, warm summer here and in Ireland and the yearlings look a remarkably strong bunch.\u201d Ferguson went to 1.7m for the most expensive lot of the day, a son of Shamardal out of the mare Cassandra Go, whose other progeny have included an Irish 1,000 Guineas winner in Halfway To Heaven. The colt provoked a rare bidding war between Maktoum interests and the Irish stud Coolmore, whose John Magnier was the underbidder. \u201cIt was really just one of those times when everything comes together,\u201d Ferguson said of his interest in the Shamardal colt. \u201cCassandra Go was very quick and she\u2019s bred a Classic winner already, so she\u2019s a proven broodmare who was also a star herself.\u201d Ferguson bids for Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai, and also his son, Sheikh Hamdan.

We will be in the Classics and, more importantly, we will be in the Classics competitively.\u201d Given the bare bones of Appleby\u2019s 2014 season to date, this might seem wildly ambitious. He has yet to win even a Group Two in Europe, never mind a Group One, while the only Classic winner in his yard is Encke, who took the St Leger in 2012 and was then caught up in the Mahmood al-Zarooni doping scandal in early 2013. Encke was banned from racing for six months after testing positive for an anabolic steroid and has not won since. The five-year-old\u2019s presence at Moulton Paddocks, where Appleby, previously Zarooni\u2019s assistant, took over in July 2013, is a reminder of the biggest crisis in Godolphin\u2019s 20-year history. The long line of two-year-olds on the gallops, though, is a clear sign that the stable is slowly working its way back into the game. Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai and Godolphin\u2019s founder, did his bit to boost the roster this week, when he was the most active buyer by far at Tattersalls\u2019 Book 1 sale, the year\u2019s most exclusive bloodstock auction. Appleby, meanwhile, insists that 2014 was always intended to be a \u201cbuilding year\u201d at a stable where more than half of the horses are two-year-olds. \u201cI don\u2019t feel under any pressure,\u201d Appleby said. \u201cWe know what our ultimate goal is, which is to produce Group One horses and stallions. \u201cWith the two-year-olds this year I could have stepped some of them up. But for a two-year-old the ultimate goal is the Classics and not all Classic winners are Group One-winning two-year-olds, as we saw this year. Taghrooda [the Oaks winner] broke her maiden at two, Australia [the Derby winner] was a Group Three winner. That was it and they were put away. \u201cCharming Thought is likely to be supplemented for the Middle Park Stakes [at Newmarket on Future Champions\u2019 Day next Friday] and Strong Chemistry runs in the Autumn Stakes at Newmarket [on Saturday]. But there\u2019s fillies like Yodelling. I could have got her out earlier and looked at her as a possible Fillies\u2019 Mile candidate but we just want to give ourselves every opportunity to have sound and healthy horses next year that can step up to the highest level.\u201d Aside from Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s investment in yearlings this week the money lavished on Moulton Paddocks in recent years is also clear evidence that, even in his mid-60s, the owner\u2019s appetite for competition is undimmed. Many acres of lush \u2013 and private \u2013 gallops stretch off into the distance and every possible aid to training is available in or around the main stable complex. \u201cNext spring we hope to have a group of horses that we can go to war with,\u201d Appleby says. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be making the numbers up. We want to be there to be competitive. \u201cThe public have probably been looking at us for the past couple of years and saying, \u2018That\u2019s what you haven\u2019t been doing, being competitive.\u2019 I don\u2019t sit here at Moulton Paddocks in a bubble, I know what people are saying on the outside and we know it here at Moulton Paddocks. \u201cThe general public knows that we\u2019ve got 180 horses here and, if we can\u2019t produce good horses, it\u2019s not for the lack of facilities and hopefully not from a lack of us trying our hardest here.\u201d Appleby\u2019s policy on booking riders for his horses remains \u2018best available\u2019, in preference to retaining a stable jockey. Considerable experience has been added to his team of work riders, though, with Willie Ryan, who won the 1997 Derby on Benny The Dip, and Shane Featherstonehaugh, formerly Frankel\u2019s work rider, both now wearing Godolphin blue. In another departure from the standard procedures of the operation\u2019s early days, meanwhile, all but a handful of horses will remain in Newmarket rather than winter in Dubai. \u201cThe plan is to run through the winter, give the backward two-year-olds some education and then see where we are with them in the spring,\u201d Appleby says. \u201cWe\u2019ve also got some old, wise heads that have joined the team and, from my point of view, that\u2019s been a big help. Every yard has its core of main riders who bring something to the table and there\u2019s some great experience there. If Shane tells me one day that one of them feels as good as Frankel, then I can start to get excited.\u201d", "title": "Charlie Appleby and Godolphin seek a better future at Moulton Paddocks", "sentences": ["Sheikh Mohammed, the ruler of Dubai and Godolphin\u2019s founder, did his bit to boost the roster this week, when he was the most active buyer by far at Tattersalls\u2019 Book 1 sale, the year\u2019s most exclusive bloodstock auction.", "In another departure from the standard procedures of the operation\u2019s early days, meanwhile, all but a handful of horses will remain in Newmarket rather than winter in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-10T17:39:40Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/oct/10/rory-mcilroy-interview-golf-masters-grandslam-hopes", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Golf", "The Masters", "The Open", "Sport"], "article": "The extent of Rory McIlroy\u2019s youth is often lost in the analysis of his success. At Augusta National next April, the world\u2019s No1 golfer will attempt to secure a grand slam of major championships. McIlroy is better placed to reach the record majors haul of 18, as claimed by Jack Nicklaus, than his ailing idol, Tiger Woods. He is once again the undisputed player of a calendar year, was the pre-eminent sportsman of the summer, has established his own management company and presides over a charitable foundation which has been running for almost two years. Not bad for a man who won\u2019t turn 26 until next May. It would be a mistake to assume McIlroy\u2019s success has a basis in grand plans. Asking him what his core aims were for 2014 provides a nod to that much. Earlier, in a tongue-in-cheek comment, he had suggested winning two majors \u2013 to make up for a barren 2013 \u2013 was his year\u2019s aspiration. The context of the remark was lost in the melee as McIlroy did precisely that. \u201cI have never said I wanted to win two majors, four majors, win the FedEx Cup,\u201d McIlroy says. \u201cMy goal always was to become a better golfer. \u201cOne of my goals this year was to be better at replying to people, to be better at getting back to emails and messages. I managed that, I am much better now. Honestly, I used to be terrible; I would read something, say to myself I would get back to it later then never do it. I\u2019d have messages the next week asking \u2018did you get my email?\u2019 That\u2019s an example of how I try to set my goals. \u201cOne of the golf ones this year was to be in the top 40 players at strokes gained from putting. Scrambling was another thing I wanted to be higher up the rankings in. I didn\u2019t quite make that top 40 [McIlroy actually finished 41st on the PGA Tour list] but I definitely improved from last year. The point is those little goals will help you win all these tournaments. \u201cIt\u2019s not just, \u2018I want to win the Masters\u2019. Of course I want to win the Masters but I want to do things the right way that will give me the chance to do that.\u201d Ah, the M-word. Six months still have to run before McIlroy seeks to make his latest bit of history at Augusta but excitement over the prospect was evident almost from the moment he holed the winning putt at the US PGA Championship, at Valhalla in August. It will reach fever pitch by April. \u201cIt is tough,\u201d McIlroy says of keeping Georgia from his mind. \u201cThat is already the one thing I am looking forward to next year. \u201cI was speaking to Willie John McBride earlier. He said: \u2018Just the Green Jacket left, Rory.\u2019 I said, \u2018I know, I\u2019m fully aware.\u2019 That is the last one, I know there is going to be a lot of hype and a lot of pressure going into Augusta but I just have to deal with that.\u201d Recent history suggests he can. A season kickstarted by success at Wentworth\u2019s BMW PGA Championship was rocket-fuelled by a maiden Open triumph in July and boosted further by receipt of the Wanamaker Trophy. Events at Hoylake \u2013 winning the Open on the Wirral \u2013 remain the highlight of a memorable spell. \u201cI think at the time, I didn\u2019t really appreciate it,\u201d McIlroy says. \u201cI did in a way, of the win itself, but seeing that Claret Jug now is just very special. \u201cEven though I haven\u2019t had much time to reflect on it because it has been such a busy year, I still look back at that week and it\u2019s what I am most proud of. \u201cGoing in, there were a lot of questions. \u2018How is he going to play? Links golf isn\u2019t really his forte. How is he going to do on a Friday?\u2019 All this sort of stuff. I was really proud of the performance there. \u201cAnd the one thing that will stand out to me, above all other things this year, is having my mum at the back of that 18th green at the Open. My mum just being there, witnessing it all, was very special.\u201d A laugh follows. \u201cShe had never experienced that before, my dad was the one who had hogged all the limelight at the other wins.\u201d The precursor to all of this, of course, was the cancelling of McIlroy\u2019s engagement to Caroline Wozniacki, at the golfer\u2019s behest, in May. He is understandably reluctant to dwell on matters of a personal nature but one thing is clear; there is now a strong element of tranquillity in his private life which boosts what he does on the golf course. \u201cI am in a really good place,\u201d he says. \u201cI probably had the same back in 2009, 10, 11. I was very settled then, played great golf and was very consistent. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the reasons I have been so consistent again this year. Something I am very proud of is this sense of settledness and calmness, there aren\u2019t other things going on in the background that are distracting me. Everything has just been the way I wanted it. \u201cI now have a formula that I know works for me, to play my best golf and to get the most out of myself. That\u2019s the formula I am going to try to stick to for the foreseeable future.\u201d If this year were to end tomorrow, by his own admission McIlroy \u201cwouldn\u2019t mind\u201d. Barring something miraculous, he would win the European Tour\u2019s Race to Dubai order of merit once again without striking another ball. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t mind calling it a year and getting ready for the next one,\u201d McIlroy says. \u201cBut at the same time, there are still a few events to play and events I feel obliged to play in because I am a European Tour player, I support the European Tour. \u201cThe European Tour has been very good to me and you need your best players to support what you are trying to do. I feel like I\u2019m one of those players. I have four tournaments left this year and the aim is to finish the year off the very best I can.\u201d McIlroy\u2019s base may be in Florida but those in Northern Ireland needn\u2019t worry about imminent or even gradual detachment from their most famous sporting export. In fact, McIlroy\u2019s continued and close association to both his family and roots marks a key character aspect. He has been part of the Northern Irish consciousness for years, long before success on a global stage, given the excitement over McIlroy\u2019s golfing talent which had rippled through the province by the time he was a teenager. Next year, McIlroy\u2019s hosting of the Irish Open at Royal County Down should ensure both a new sponsor for the event and a higher-profile field than has recently been the case. \u201cI am a home bird,\u201d he says. \u201cI try and get home as often as I can. Northern Ireland will always be home.\u201d Even in that environment, McIlroy\u2019s recent success has cranked up attention levels. \u201cYes, of course, things have obviously become a lot different,\u201d he says. \u201cI have really noticed a difference this year, with everything that has happened, the Open, two majors, sort of going to a different level I suppose. \u201cBut nothing has changed with the people who know me. I\u2019m still just Rory from Holywood to them. I\u2019m just that same little boy that was up at the golf club every day, hitting balls around. \u201cI love coming back. I was speaking to [the actor] Jamie Dornan about this last week at the Dunhill Links; the one thing I love is flying into Belfast City airport. Normally you are coming over Belfast Lough, you look left and you see Helen\u2019s Bay, Cultra, Holywood; where I grew up basically. \u201cIt really makes me feel at home. I don\u2019t ever get a sense of that flying in anywhere else but I get it going into that airport. It\u2019s something that is very important to me.\u201d As with so much of what McIlroy does, there is substance to back up such sentiment. On Tuesday, he stood shoulder to shoulder with a 10-year-old cancer sufferer in opening the Daisy Lodge Centre in County Down. McIlroy\u2019s \u00a31m sponsorship of the complex, which offers respite for young people who have been affected by cancer and their families, has emerged as the endearing cornerstone of his charity work. Location is again pertinent here; McIlroy wanted to have an impact on something close to his roots. When he spoke, it was with sincerity and warmth rather than hinting at the tokenism to which global stars often succumb. \u201cEven though I don\u2019t spend as much time here now as I used to, this is my commitment to being proud to be Northern Irish, being proud of where I am from, being proud to help people in the community and especially those who really need it,\u201d McIlroy says. \u201cTouch wood, I have never had an illness that has affected me or my family in a way that has really touched me but I have always felt like I wanted to help kids. I still feel like I\u2019m not too far removed from what they are, I think I can relate to them. \u201cI had been an ambassador for Unicef for a couple of years but I wanted to start something of my own; to make a difference and see a tangible difference. That\u2019s why I set up the foundation. As I\u2019ve become older, I grasped more of a concept of what I can do in society. I don\u2019t want my children to be proud of their dad as a major championship winner, but as someone who was able to help people less fortunate. \u201cI have been blown away with how positive the kids are, considering everything they and their families have to deal with.\u201d McIlroy had privately fretted about the disruption his decision over Olympic participation in 2016 might cause. He was to declare for Ireland, in a move which caused far less controversy than many \u2013 including McIlroy himself \u2013 had earlier feared. In the subsequent blur of achievement, the issue was all-but forgotten. \u201cThe line I wanted to get across was that it is just a continuation of what I have always done,\u201d McIlroy says. \u201cI never had a choice to play for Great Britain, Northern Ireland or whatever. Just because this is a different tournament, the Olympics, all of a sudden you have this choice. \u201cIn reality, there was no choice to make because I always played for Ireland. I was so proud to pull on that green jacket or jersey, to go out and try to win the European team championship or home internationals. Golf is a united Ireland sport, just the same as rugby, hockey or cricket. Instead of kicking it down the road until the very point where I needed to make a decision, I just had to say, \u2018This is what I want to do\u2019. \u201cI was worried about upsetting people, you always are. I think I made the decision that was going to upset less people but that wasn\u2019t the reason I did it; it was because this is what I have always done. There wasn\u2019t much fuss about it. I think everyone understood. Now that it\u2019s over and done with, I can look forward to a couple of years\u2019 time and playing in Brazil.\u201d McIlroy will be 27 by then. It would be unwise to speculate upon how much further his star will have risen.

It was one of those things that friends thought would be a fad, he suggests, but after the millennium dotcom crash and the collapse of the art market, the pandemic spread as the art world panicked and desperately tried to resuscitate itself as an asset class. There are now 50 or more international shows, from Dubai to Shanghai to S\u00e3o Paulo, one for every week of the year, following the money, flogging product. Fischl steered clear of all of them for a long while, but finally went to the shiniest of the lot, Art Basel Miami Beach, a couple of years ago, at the request of New Yorker magazine, for an interview. He became grimly fascinated by the spectacle, took a camera with him there and subsequently to Frieze New York, and to the fair in Southampton up the road from his home in Sag Harbor, Great Gatsby country. Fischl then made Photoshop collages of his hundreds of photos, creating scenes that might have happened. He gestures to the fabulous painting behind me. \u201cThe big sneakers here are from a show of Claes Oldenburg\u2019s. The guy with his back to us was a guard at that show. She on the left was from an art fair at Southampton. That guy was from Miami. I mix and match. Same crowd, different clothes. But always the same experience.\u201d An exhibition of Fischl\u2019s art-show paintings (priced between \u00a3200,000 and \u00a3400,000) will open at the Victoria Miro Gallery, in London, this week, to coincide with the Frieze art fair. He hopes that people can go to Frieze and then come to his show and see what they looked like at Frieze. If you have never been to Frieze, his paintings capture much of its dead-eyed atmosphere, its comic and dispiriting juxtapositions. In Fischl\u2019s Art Fair: Booth #4 The Price, a distracted crowd of buyers cluster around an amorphous Ken Price sculpture, not looking. Behind them, an enormous intimate self-portrait by Joan Semmel goes unremarked. \u201cThe big collectors do this kind of speed-dating thing,\u201d Fischl says. \u201cThey try to get in and out before anyone buys what they are after and certainly before the hoi polloi gets to look. And then you\u2019ve got people who are just there for the social scene. So you have people texting or not paying any attention at all. It is as if the art is not there, or that they think it has no effect on them. But when you stop the moment you can see this weird world that is taking place. They are being regarded and judged by the work itself in some ways.\u201d In my experience, I suggest, Frieze provides exactly the enervating experience of a Saturday afternoon at Brent Cross shopping mall, except some of the stuff on sale is priced in the millions. Wealth becomes the spectacle, not art. \u201cIf you start with the premise,\u201d Fischl says, \u201cand I know it is a romantic and naive premise, but I none the less think it is true, that artists are looking for love, and they are expressing love in their commitment to what they have made. An art fair is designed so they never get any in return.\u201d He speaks languidly and laughs broadly. \u201cLove is complicated, obviously. But the reason artists do what they do on some level is to say: \u2018Don\u2019t look at me, look at this thing I made and you will know the true me.\u2019\u201d Fischl himself developed that particular faith as a young painter in the 1970s when he started to try to express himself on canvas, first at CalArts, the Disney-funded art college outside Los Angeles, and later in Nova Scotia, where he took a teaching job and met his wife, the celebrated landscape artist April Gornik, and finally in New York. In a world of abstract expressionism and conceptualism he became part of that endangered species, a figurative painter, a storyteller. Despite this self-imposed handicap, by 1985 Andy Warhol was describing Fischl in his diary as \u201cthe hot new top artist\u201d; he was the subject of a long Vanity Fair profile entitled \u201cBad Boy of Brilliance\u201d which compared him favourably to celebrity artist peers such as Julian Schnabel and Jean-Michel Basquiat; and his paintings were suddenly selling for hundreds of thousands of dollars. To understand how Fischl found himself at the centre of that world, a version of which he now satirises 30 years on, you have to understand where he came from. The paintings that made Fischl\u2019s name were drawn from an adolescence spent up the road from where he now lives, in a town called Port Washington. His father went into New York City every day selling promotional films to corporations in the days before video. His mother, spirited and beautiful, was also an out-of-control alcoholic, the \u201cunspeakable\u201d open secret that Fischl, his brother and two sisters did all they could to contain in their suburban idyll. Fischl\u2019s early paintings exhibited a disturbing kind of voyeurism, in scenes that might have been written by John Cheever or John Updike. The two defining paintings of that period \u2014 Bad Boy, which depicts a young boy standing before a woman, perhaps his mother, sprawled naked on a bed, while he feels for her handbag; and Sleepwalker, in which a teenager masturbates in a paddling pool, bathed in Edward Hopper light \u2013 were representative of the uncertain boundaries, the disquieting taboos, that became his constant theme. Fischl depicted the fallout of early 1960s America at war with inhibition, and deeply troubled by that fact. In his recent memoir, also entitled Bad Boy, he recalls a youth in which his parents talked openly about their sex life and \u201clounged around their bedroom \u2013 where we\u2019d visit after dinner to watch TV \u2013 completely naked\u201d. When his mother was drinking, which was often, \u201cher whole face seemed pinched and pulled back. Her artificial expression, a Kabuki-like mask, reminded me of a terrifying drag queen. It was impossible to predict what she might do\u2026 \u201d Impossible, that was, until the day, not long after he had started art school, when Fischl was called to say his mother was critically ill in hospital after driving her car into a tree, an act of suicide. Fischl got back home just before she died and was overwhelmed by the fact he had \u201cnot been strong enough, smart enough\u201d to save her from herself. He subsequently became a painter of what had been \u201cunspeakable\u201d because, he wrote, on \u201csome level I wanted to make her life good\u201d. What did he mean by that? \u201cIt was a thing my therapist spent many years trying to get me past,\u201d he says. \u201cThe tragedy of her life was that she was creative and intelligent and stimulating, and if she had channelled that in a different way she could have been amazing. She tried art but she lacked the stubbornness to do it. She couldn\u2019t get past the self-critical thing we all have and she would destroy it or fuck it up or not finish it. When she killed herself, I felt I was making art for her. I thought I could make her pain less by succeeding at this thing where she had failed. Which of course makes it pretty hard to own your own success\u2026 \u201d It took him many years of messing about with abstraction, and other strategies, to realise he had to confront those experiences head on. \u201cI actually found it harder to paint a specific chair in a scene than to paint the woman passed out on the floor. Somehow the woman passed out on the floor could have been any woman. The chair became something closer to my particular experience. The first brave step was doing that.\u201d     Eric Fischl with one of his art-fair paintings. Photograph: Ralph Gibson    Did it feel liberating? \u201cIt was empowering ultimately,\u201d he says. \u201cI suppose if I had gotten crushed by the critical reception the way I feared when I started to make these paintings I wouldn\u2019t have continued. When the pictures were embraced, however, I went further and further into it.\u201d The breakthrough was Sleepwalker. \u201cI started to try to paint in a representational manner,\u201d Fischl says, \u201cand it was a stretch because I had never been trained that way. My drawing skills were iffy. Trying to render flesh. I was learning in this painting and people tried to persuade me off it. I was being told: \u2018You have to find a way of making it look more contemporary.\u2019 I went through a thousand possible ways to do that but it was always everybody else\u2019s idea. In the end I was left with myself. That is something that all artists ultimately have to find: the thing that they can do that doesn\u2019t look like art.\u201d It seems strange to be talking to a contemporary artist about emotional authenticity, about representation, and about the influence of Degas and Manet rather than Warhol and Joseph Beuys. \u201cThere are two kinds of painter, if you like,\u201d Fischl says at one point. \u201cOne is somebody like Hopper who creates an image that burns on your retina and you never forget it. You can see it, walk away and still see it. [With] the other kind you are caught up in the authenticity of the energy. The believable moment. Jackson Pollock, you are right there with him. I am essentially the Hopper artist trying to create a frozen moment. The truth about how it actually was.\u201d Despite that commitment, or because of it, Fischl found himself co-opted into the wild and whirling art world of 1980s New York \u2013 his first experience of the milieu he has lately been documenting. Warhol visited his studio, and offered his blessing. \u201cHe sought out youth, he was always curious about what was going on,\u201d Fischl recalls. \u201cMost of the artists we admired wanted to be outside society looking in. Warhol wanted to be right at the centre of high society and still be radical. It was as if he wanted to infect it from the inside out.\u201d Looking back on what quickly became a frenzy of parties and gallery openings and cocaine and booze and money \u2013 which had little to do with his original change-the-world ambitions for his art \u2013 Fischl admits it was nevertheless \u201call incredibly exciting. It was like a spinning world, it had real centrifugal force. Traditional art magazines couldn\u2019t keep up so the dailies took their place. Artist\u2019s photographs were appearing in the arts and entertainment pages next to those of rock stars and film stars. It was like a wave had picked us up.\u201d Fischl was beached not long after just as surely. After one bender too many, after the opening of a solo New York show, and a near car crash, he knew he had to remove himself from the centrifugal world he found himself in. He has a sense that he inherited his mother\u2019s addictive gene, and that he had welcomed the self-destructive aspect of it in some way \u201cin order to survive it, to prove it could be done\u201d. With premonitions of an art world about to finally sell its soul he packed up his studio in New York, moved with April Gornik the two hours out here \u2013 following an artists\u2019 path trodden by Pollock, Willem de Kooning, Mark Rothko and others \u2014 and swapped his previous narcotic highs for more life-affirming ones. Fischl counts Steve Martin and John McEnroe among his closest friends. After McEnroe opened a gallery in New York on his retirement, Fischl tutored him in art history in return for tennis lessons. He plays most days, sometimes with McEnroe himself, and likes to make connections between his game and his work (\u201cboth are performed in a rectangle, and are about gesture and reach and executing an intention, resistance\u201d). He and Gornik bought some land and built their beautiful, brutal 10,000 sq ft minimalist home on the edge of a salt marsh, complete with matching studios. They moved in on millennium eve and Fischl entered what he calls, with a laugh, \u201chis long mid-career period\u201d. From this vantage, Fischl believes himself to be an outsider to the kind of world he describes in his art-show paintings. His work has continued to sell \u2013 his record for a single picture was the $1.9m paid for his painting Daddy\u2019s Girl in 2006 \u2013 and he has moved on from adolescent angst to document and interpret the worlds he now inhabits. He has cast, for example, his unnerving eye over the plutocrats at play in St Tropez as well as the Hamptons. He is surprised at the way his career has gone. \u201cI had this idea that I was making work that would be shown in museums but that nobody would really want to live with,\u201d he says. \u201cI mean who the fuck wants to wake up and have breakfast with somebody jerking off in a pool? I overestimated museums, though. They were the ones that wanted to put up warning signs in front of the work, whereas the private sector bought it. I would have liked it to be more a public art.\u201d That particular frustration has crystallised recently around two projects, which were the real cause of his decision to turn his painter\u2019s eye to the art world itself. Both projects were made in response to what he saw as the fracture in US culture after 9/11, and the inability of the art world to address it.     Victoria Falls, 2013 by Eric Fischl. Photograph: Courtesy the artist/Victoria Miro, London and Mary Boone Gallery    In 2002 Fischl, who has been working more and more in sculpture since he moved to Long Island, made a public statue, Tumbling Woman, which was to be a permanent fixture at the Rockefeller centre in New York. The life-size bronze sculpture \u2013 he has a smaller version outside his studio \u2013 shows a human figure apparently in free fall, just above the ground, as if in suspended animation. \u201c9/11 was so profoundly shocking \u2013 that we could be that vulnerable, that powerless,\u201d Fischl says. \u201cAnd it was combined with something really freaky: 3,000 people died and there were no bodies. How do you process the mourning? It was like a surreal disappearance. The only way we knew how horrific it had been was in the images of the people who jumped out the windows, that they would choose to die that way. Right away though, the media self-censored and got rid of those images. I thought that was wrong.\u201d When Fischl\u2019s simple human sculpture was unveiled, there was an outcry. A New York Post columnist suggested it was a cruel and self-serving image and accused him of \u201criding on the backs of those who had suffered grief and loss in an effort to revive a moribund career\u201d. After that he became public enemy number one. Who fought his corner? \u201cNobody. My dealer tried to protect me a bit from the hysteria. Friends in the press said I should let it drop. The guy who owned Rockefeller Centre, a big art patron in the city, removed the sculpture. He told me he was getting bomb threats and he couldn\u2019t take the risk.\u201d Fischl laughs bleakly. \u201cI told him: \u2018No one is going to bomb you over a statue.\u2019 But that is the world we live in.\u201d Nearly a decade later, in another effort to use art to help communities come together around an idea of America, he laid plans for a touring art show, a basis for a national conversation called \u201cNow and Here\u201d. The idea was to have the nation\u2019s leading artists and poets and musicians make a travelling event that would offer an alternative to the tribal and polarised nature of political debate. \u201cWe have been screaming and yelling at each other for years. Still are. I believed art could provide images as a starting point for dialogue. I thought the hard part would be getting the artists with these huge international reputations to get together and think about the same thing at the same moment for once,\u201d Fischl says. \u201cBut of course it turned out to be the opposite. The artists were easily persuaded but the money \u2013 we tried for funding from corporations and billionaires \u2013 never was.\u201d Fischl was told again that his idea was just a careerist strategy, as if that was the only reason any artist might do anything. \u201cInstead of any grown-up conversation, what we have instead, what America apparently wants, is artists who are doing very expensive toys,\u201d he says. \u201cJeff Koons is a good example. What kind of culture expresses itself only in childlike behaviour? Shit jokes and childish humour \u2013 and is greeted with huge popularity.\u201d Fischl\u2019s art-show paintings, for all their cool comic appeal, were made to portray the emptiness of that compact. \u201cThat world has just become a celebration of money-making,\u201d Fischl says. \u201cI went to a fair a few weeks ago and in the middle of this thing was a De Kooning painting. I thought \u2018Wow!\u2019 It turned out it was in a booth for a real estate company. They had this De Kooning for sale as well as the $40m homes. You could buy the house and get the painting for an extra $5m or whatever. The barriers have collapsed between the commercial and the art world. It is not irony \u2013 it is just cynicism. The work is not intended to have you look and think twice, which is what irony does. It\u2019s cynical in that they couldn\u2019t give a shit whether you get it or you don\u2019t get it.\u201d Some of the people in his paintings are clearly recognisable, though he is not interested in putting names to faces. Has he had any response? \u201cI did have one experience where a girl in one of the paintings saw it at the New York Frieze show and called me the next day to say she believed she was in my painting. She was really thrilled of course. The thing is we don\u2019t see ourselves as characters \u2013 so I think people will look and not always see themselves. And anyway, 10 years from now no one will know any people in it.\u201d Does he believe that all those who recognise themselves as faces in the art crowd see it as a form of flattery? \u201cI don\u2019t really care, to be honest,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me it is more like an admission that this is my world and this is what it looks like.\u201d Eric Fischl: Art Fair Paintings is at Victoria Miro, London, from Tuesday until 19 December at the Victoria Miro gallery, 16 Wharf Road, London N1 ", "title": "Eric Fischl: \u2018What America wants is artists who are doing very expensive toys\u2019", "sentences": ["There are now 50 or more international shows, from Dubai to Shanghai to S\u00e3o Paulo, one for every week of the year, following the money, flogging product."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-12T08:00:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/oct/15/tv-highlights-waterloo-road-swallowed-by-sea", "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture"], "article": "Golf: World Matchplay Championship2pm, Sky Sports 4 Day one coverage from the London Golf Club in Kent, featuring the opening round-robin matches.

Zanganeh implicitly blamed Riyadh for the situation. \u201cSome of the biggest producers at Opec should reduce their sales,\u201d he said, in what was widely viewed as a criticism of Saudi Arabia.

Iran\u2019s economy, which depends on oil for most of its exports revenue, has faced huge economic problems in recent years due to international sanctions imposed over Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme.  An EU and US oil embargo, strict banking restrictions and trade bans have been among the major measures designed to punish Tehran for its failure to comply with international demands over its nuclear activities.  Falling oil prices will just add to economic woes in a country with the world\u2019s fourth largest oil reserves.  Amir Handjani, of the Dubai-based RAK Petroleum, said that since the west struck an interim nuclear agreement with Iran last November, Tehran has increased crude sales in order to purchase essential commodities and goods.  In 2010, he said, Iran was the fourth largest producer of Opec, whereas today it stands in the eight place.  \u201cIran has been very lucky that in the past eight years oil prices were so high,\u201d Handjani, who was one of the speakers at the London EU-Iran Forum on Wednesday, told the Guardian.  \u201cBut now oil prices are coming down and given the fact that Tehran is already under sanctions, the issue of falling oil prices is going to be very sensitive.\u201d He said it was difficult to predict what would happen if prices continued to drop but said it will certainly have an impact on the country\u2019s economy.  \u201cNo one can predict the future but if you go back to 1998 when the price of oil was 10 dollars per barrel then yes, falling prices today can be catastrophic.\u201d Marie-Claire Aoun, the director of the centre for energy at French Institute of International Relations (IFRI) said the capacity of Opec would determine how the current declining trend will continue.  \u201cWhether there\u2019s going to be a catastrophe or not wholly depends on how Opec is going to deal with it,\u201d she told the Guardian.

Higher output coupled with weaker demand from China and Europe has driven the price of crude down to $85 \u2013 its lowest for four years. The US also now produces 65% more oil than it did five years ago following the boom in shale production. The rise has contributed to the global glut of crude and allowed the US to import 3.1 million fewer barrels of oil a day compared with its peak in 2005. Prices are now well below the level on which many oil exporters have based their budgets. If prices remain weak \u2013 and many forecasters suggest they will \u2013 then from Moscow to Caracas and from Lagos to Tehran governments will start to feel the impact on macroeconomic policy. Brent has averaged $103 since 2010 \u2013 trading mostly between $100 and $120 \u2013 so a continued period of $80 oil, or less, would have an impact across the world, and from multiple angles. The lower price isn\u2019t bad news for everyone. For example, India would not suffer much \u2013 commodities account for 52% of India\u2019s imports but only 9% of its exports (paywall), and unlike Brazil, Russia or South Africa, India would reap immediate advantages from a fall in commodity prices.       Russia Western sanctions against Russia over the Ukraine crisis have yet to cause significant changes in Moscow\u2019s economic or foreign policy. But plummeting oil prices will strike a significant blow to Russia\u2019s economy and could send it into a recession, analysts said. Growing economic troubles could test the Russian business elite\u2019s support for Putin and potentially weaken his popularity, which began skyrocketing after his annexation of Ukraine\u2019s Crimea peninsula and reached an all-time high of 87% in August. Russia obtains more than half its budget revenue from oil and gas, and its economy is highly sensitive to oil price changes. Bank of America predicts Russia\u2019s economy will shrink 1.5% in 2015. The falling oil price has dragged down Russia\u2019s currency. The Russian Central Bank has spent almost $7bn this month propping up the rouble, which nonetheless reached a record low on Wednesday, hitting 41 roubles to the dollar for the first time. In response, the finance ministry announced it will sell off foreign currency reserves to the tune of several billion dollars over the next month in an attempt to soften the shock to the economy. Russian oil companies\u2019 share prices also sank on Wednesday, with state oil champion Rosneft dropping by 1.2% after Bank of America cut its rating to neutral from buy.

Photograph: Yuri Kotchetkov/epa/Corbis    Timur Nigmatullin, a macroeconomic analyst at Investcafe, argued that relatively high oil prices in the first half of the year, when prices were above $100 a barrel, would compensate for the lower prices now. \u201cThe Russian economy is pretty large, even all these shocks and the fall in oil prices can\u2019t cause a drastic, immediate negative effect,\u201d Nigmatullin said. \u201cThey lead to effects half a year later, like spending cuts. Plus the government will soften the blow using its reserve fund. I don\u2019t think it will be as bad a crisis as in 2008.\u201d He predicted the government would seek to mitigate the country\u2019s worsening economic situation by borrowing, reducing expenditures and spending money from the reserve fund built up when oil prices were higher. But all these have negative effects, notably rising debt servicing costs and reduced popularity for the government, he said. The 2014 federal budget was calculated with $93-a-barrel oil prices in mind, while 2015 counted on about $95 a barrel. Strong energy prices have been the rock on which the long record of economic stability of Vladimir Putin (below) has been predicated. But plunging oil prices were responsible at least partly for unseating his two predecessors in the Kremlin, Mikhail Gorbachev and Boris Yeltsin. Konstantin Sonin, a professor at the Higher School of Economics in Moscow, said shrinking oil prices would cause problems for Russia\u2019s budget and lead to spending cuts that could serve as a \u201csignal\u201d to the government that \u201cwe can\u2019t live as we have been\u201d. The political elite is now realising what the true cost of Putin\u2019s aggressive Ukraine policy will be, he said. \u201cThe main correction is to understand that economic policy should be the main one, it is more important than any geopolitical concerns,\u201d he said. \u201cI think that fall of oil price will force the elite and population to more soberly evaluate Putin\u2019s successes and mistakes.\u201d But Nigmatullin doubted that Putin\u2019s popularity would suffer significantly. \u201cUnemployment has the greatest effect on political ratings, and in Russia, unemployment is going down because the working part of the population is shrinking, so by this theory I don\u2019t think Putin\u2019s rating will drop.\u201d Alec Luhn in Moscow Iran Iran\u2019s economy, which depends on oil for most of its exports revenue, has faced huge economic problems in recent years due to international sanctions imposed over Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme. A EU and US oil embargo, strict banking restrictions and trade bans have among the major measures designed to punish Tehran for its failure to comply with international demands over its nuclear activities. Falling oil prices will just add to economic woes in a country with the world\u2019s fourth largest oil reserves. Amir Handjani, of the Dubai-based RAK Petroleum, said that since the west struck an interim nuclear agreement with Iran last November Tehran has increased its sales of crude, especially to fund access to essential commodities and goods. In 2010, he said, Iran was the fourth largest producer in Opec, whereas today it stands in eighth place.     An Iranian technician works at the Balal offshore oil platform. Photograph: Getty Images    Handjani added: \u201cIran has been very lucky that in the past eight years oil prices were so high. But now oil prices are coming down and given the fact that Tehran is already under sanctions, the issue of falling oil prices is going to be very sensitive.\u201d He said it was difficult to predict what would happen if prices continued to drop but said it will certainly have an impact on the country\u2019s economy. \u201cNo one can predict the future but if you go back to 1998 when the price of oil was 10 dollars per barrel then yes, falling prices today can be catastrophic.\u201d Marie-Claire Aoun, the director of the centre for energy at French Institute of International Relations (IFRI) said the capacity of Opec would determine how the current declining trend will continue. \u201cWhether there\u2019s going to be a catastrophe or not wholly depends on how Opec is going to deal with it,\u201d she told the Guardian. Authorities in Iran have been urged to press for an emergency Opec meeting. Iranian officials have pointed the finger at Saudi Arabia, saying it has deliberately kept prices low by manipulating Opec sales. Iran\u2019s oil minister, Bijan Zanganeh, has explicitly blamed Riyadh for the situation. \u201cSome of the biggest producers at Opec should reduce their sales,\u201d he said, in what was widely viewed as a criticism of Saudi Arabia. Other Iranian officials have been more candid with their views about Saudis. Masoud Mirkazemi, a former Iranian oil minister but now an MP said: \u201cWe should have an emergency Opec meeting so that countries like Saudi Arabia that pursue policies against producers\u2019 interests would reduce their sale,\u201d the ex-minister said, according to the conservative Tasnim news agency. \u201cSaudi Arabia, which intends to manage the Opec, serves the interests of the G20 group. We should not let Saudi Arabia to do this and our oil ministry should change its passive response to the issue,\u201d he said. Saeed Kamali Dehghan Saudi Arabia Falling oil prices have forced Saudi Arabia to act to preserve its position in world markets \u2013 but unlike other big producers it can use its huge cash reserves as a cushion against a temporary fall in revenues. Saudi officials have been signalling that they are prepared to see prices sink to as low as $80 per barrel at least for a year or two \u2013 well below the IMF estimate of the country needing a price of $91 to balance its budget. Analysts suggest one motive of Opec\u2019s largest producer may be to make US shale oil unprofitable and force a US production cut at a time when the world market seems to be facing years of oversupply. The Saudis are masters of opacity so their motives are unclear but the conclusion of most experts is that they are taking a long-term view designed to retain their market share in years to come. The conservative kingdom, the largest economy in the Arab world, currently pumps around a third of Opec\u2019s oil, or about 9.7m barrels a day. It has reserves of 266bn barrels of crude.     Petrochemical plant, Jubail, Saudi Arabia Photograph: Kazuyoshi Nomachi/Corbis    The short-term downside of lower prices is that with expensive infrastructure projects under way a growing budget deficit will require dipping into foreign currency reserves \u2013 though at an estimated $750bn that could be sustained for a while. The Saudis also have the benefit of low production costs. \u201cRiyadh\u2019s oil output is its most strategic resource, and one that the government is quick to use to its advantage,\u201d the Stratfor consultancy commented recently. \u201cWith summer temperatures beginning to cool and regional consumption starting to taper off, Riyadh can free up larger volumes to export, even at lower prices. \u201cThe Saudis are also looking to leverage their short-term economic stability over rivals such as Russia, especially as they square off with Iran over the future of the Syrian government.\u201d Other Gulf producers are less exposed, with the UAE needing an oil price of about $73 to balance its budgets and Kuwait $53. Reduced revenues have drawn attention to the perennial problem of the kingdom\u2019s dependence on oil \u2013 suppling 90% of state revenues. On Tuesday, the billionaire Prince al-Waleed bin Talal published an open letter to the country\u2019s oil minister, Ali Al Naimi, warning that \u201cour country faces the danger of continuing to depend almost entirely on oil.\u201d Ian Black Venezuela Even at $100 a barrel, Venezuela was eating into its currency reserves. Experts believe that $80 oil will deepen a fiscal crisis that is already threatening social unrest. Venezuela relies on oil revenues to pay for imports, everything from car parts to basic foodstuffs, and this supply might be compromised if cash runs dry. Anti-government protests across the country left more than 40 people dead in February. \u201cIf prices remain at current levels Venezuela will see its cash flows reduced by $16bn in the next 12 months,\u201d said Alejandro Grisanti, head of Barclays Latin America economic research team.     A worker walks past a mural with a PDVSA logo at a petrol station in Caracas. Photograph: Reuters    \u201cFor a government that is reluctant to adjust and has the worst set of economic policies, this decline in (foreign exchange) income will bring higher inflation, more scarcity and lower purchasing power to the Venezuelans.\u201d Francisco Monaldi, of the Belfer Center, said if prices remained depressed for more than a year Venezuela would suffer more than other Opec countries. \u201cThe economic adjustment required will involve giving up a lot of the gains in poverty reduction that the country had in the previous decade. Politically the government will get into a very difficult level of popular support.\u201d Virginia Lopez in Caracas  Analysis: winners, losers and political uncertainty There have been four major recessions in the West since the mid-1970s and each has followed a spike in the oil price. All downturns have their own peculiarities, but one common thread links the stagflation of the seventies to the mega-crash of 2009: dearer crude. The opposite also applies. A low oil price was a vital ingredient in the post-war Golden Age, and a falling oil price lubricated the strong and sustained growth of the 1990s. Logically, therefore, the 25% decline in the cost of crude since June should mean higher levels of activity. For that to happen, however, the oil price will have to fall a lot further, to somewhere around $50 a barrel. At $115 a barrel the price was consistent with rip-roaring levels of demand. In the meantime there will be winners and losers. The winners are the large net importers of oil and those that have high inflation rates, such as Turkey and India. Business costs will fall and consumers\u2019 incomes will stretch further. The losers are oil producers, which will see growth fall and budget deficits swell. Iran, subject to a crippling western embargo, needs an oil price of more than $140 a barrel to make its budget break even. Anything below $120 a barrel spells trouble for Venezuela and Nigeria. About $105 a barrel is Russia\u2019s cutoff point. At today\u2019s price even Saudi Arabia, the world\u2019s biggest producer, is starting to feel the pinch as it has used a high oil price to fund generous public spending. It needs $93 a barrel to balance the books. The problems are magnified for many of these countries because high oil prices have stunted the development of other sectors of the economy. In Russia, oil and gas accounts for 70% of exports. The country\u2019s struggling manufacturing sector relies heavily on orders from energy companies. Falling oil prices are the result of a glut of supply and an easing of demand from a slowing global economy. Saudi Arabia could try to arrest the decline by cutting production, although a similar ploy was notably unsuccessful in the mid-1980s. Despite having youth unemployment of above 30%, Riyadh would probably live with $80 barrel oil prices if it thought it would discourage Vladimir Putin from turning off the taps to the west. This is where the economics of oil mesh with geopolitics. One theory is that lower oil prices will force Russia to adopt a softer line over Ukraine, and Iran to come to terms over its nuclear programme. But a sharp dose of economic pain in countries that are highly volatile could have the opposite effect. Larry Elliot", "title": "Recession in Russia, revolt in Venezuela?

Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s Godolphin operation recorded its first Group One winner of the European season when Charming Thought, added to the field as a supplementary entry, took the Middle Park Stakes at 22-1 and Aidan O\u2019Brien produced another relative outsider, Together Forever, to win the Fillies\u2019 Mile. Only Estidhkaar, owned by Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s brother Hamdan al-Maktoum, fumbled away a clean sweep for historic racing colours as he failed to justify favouritism behind Roger Varian\u2019s Belardo in the Dewhurst Stakes. The Godolphin racing operation had failed to come up with a single Group One winner in Europe from more than 400 horses spread around the continent as the field went to post for the Middle Park, and Ivawood, the early favourite for next year\u2019s 2,000 Guineas, was expected to win the race at odds-on. Charming Thought travelled well from the off for William Buick, however, and came with a sustained run to wear down Ivawood by a nose. \u201cIt\u2019s great to get the first Group One in England out of the way,\u201d Charlie Appleby, whose only previous success at the highest level came at last year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup meeting in America, said. \u201cIt was the last roll of the dice for us from Moulton Paddocks. \u201cThis is a horse we\u2019ve held in high regard from the spring onwards, we just met with a slight setback in the spring, so we had to be patient with him. We\u2019ll put him away now, that was always the plan, win lose or draw.\u201d John Ferguson, Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s bloodstock adviser, said that the result was vindication for Appleby\u2019s patient approach this season. \u201cThe boss rang me in the paddock beforehand and said, make sure that William knows there\u2019s no pressure,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he handles the ground and goes well, fantastic, but the horse has a future. \u201cWilliam said he knew straight away that he liked the ground and I think he\u2019ll get a mile. Over the last few weeks we\u2019ve had Maftool win for Saeed [bin Suroor], we\u2019ve had Lucida come and win here [for Jim Bolger] and Local Time won the Oh So Sharp, so this is our fourth Group winner in six weeks at Newmarket. \u201cFrom that point of view it\u2019s incredibly exciting for everybody going forward and, as the boss said to me on the phone as he was coming in, \u2018It\u2019s going to be a fun winter, thinking about these horses.\u2019 That\u2019s what he deserves, if he goes up to Newmarket and spends that kind of money [to be top buyer at the Tattersalls Yearling Sales], he deserves a fun winter.\u201d Charming Thought is not a certain stayer on pedigree and can be backed at 25-1 for the 2,000 Guineas, while Ivawood is now 12-1 (from a top price of 8-1) for the colts\u2019 Classic. Together Forever had been beaten in a maiden event earlier in the season but the winner that day was her stablemate Found, a Group One winner since, and she took the Fillies\u2019 Mile under Joseph O\u2019Brien despite being turned out quickly after a Listed win last weekend. \u201cWe were going to leave her off after her last run but she was in such good form during the week that we decided to let her come,\u201d Aidan O\u2019Brien said. \u201cShe\u2019s going to be a lovely filly next year. She has enough pace for the Guineas and [being by Galileo] she could get the Oaks trip.\u201d Belardo had finished behind Estidhkaar, the favourite for the Dewhurst, at Doncaster last time out but Varian had been sure that the colt had not given his running and he had no trouble reversing the form in a first-time hood. When asked for an effort by Andrea Atzeni, Belardo quickened abruptly to go two lengths clear of Kodi Bear at the line with Smuggler\u2019s Cove, from the O\u2019Brien stable, back in third. \u201cIt\u2019s a lovely way to end the season,\u201d Varian said. \u201cYou can\u2019t come into these races and expect to win because they are so hot. On paper, he had to turn around a couple of lengths with Estidhkaar and that one gave us 3lb and a beating at Doncaster.\u201d Atzeni, who will ride as first jockey to Qatar Racing next season, compared the winner to Kingston Hill, who gave Varian his first Classic winner in the St Leger last month. \u201cWhen I first sat on him, I said to Roger that he was one of the best two-year-olds I have ever sat on,\u201d Atzeni said. \u201cWhen I sat on Kingston Hill, he never gave me this sort of feel. \u201cWhen I pulled up, Adam Kirby [Kodi Bear\u2019s jockey] said \u2018that\u2019s a proper horse\u2019 because I went past him like he was standing still.\u201d", "title": "Charming Thought stuns Ivawood to give Godolphin Group One glory", "sentences": ["Qatari billionaires have poured vast sums into British Flat racing in recent seasons and seem likely to continue the spree next year and beyond but, if there was a lesson to draw from Future Champions Day here on Friday, it was that the old powers from Dubai and County Tipperary will not concede the field without a struggle."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-17T18:30:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/oct/19/beast-restaurant-review-jay-rayner", "tags": ["Food & drink", "Restaurants", "Restaurants", "Life and style", "Travel"], "article": "Beast, 3 Chapel Place, London W1 (020 7495 1816). Meal for two, including wine and service: \u00a3200 You could easily respond to this week\u2019s restaurant with furious, spittle- flecked rage. You could rant about the posing-pouch stupidity of the meat- hanging cabinet that greets you as the lift doors open, and the frothing tanks of monstrous live Norwegian king crabs next to it, each 4ft across. You could bang on about the bizarre pricing structure, and the vertiginous nature of those prices; about the rough-hewn communal tables that are so wide you can\u2019t sit opposite your dining companion because you wouldn\u2019t be able to hear each other, and the long benches which make wearing a skirt a dodgy idea unless you\u2019re desperate to flash the rest of the heavily male clientele. You could shake your fists and roll your eyes and still not be done. I think this would be a mistake. Instead you should accept Beast as the most unintentionally funny restaurant to open in London in a very long time. It\u2019s hilariously silly. The most appropriate response is to point and laugh. I don\u2019t even think I\u2019d advise you not to go. As long as you go with someone else\u2019s money, because God knows you\u2019ll need a lot of it. Got any friends who are, say, international drug barons? Excellent. They may be able to afford dinner. It\u2019s worth going to see what the unmitigated male ego looks like, when expressed as a restaurant. If Beast were a chap, he would be a part-time rugby player smelling of Ralgex who\u2019s trying to tell you he\u2019s deep and thoughtful, even though he\u2019ll later be implicated in an incident involving a traffic cone and a pint glass of his own urine. It is a venture by the Moscow-born company behind the admirable steakhouse Goodman, and the clever and ever-expanding chain Burger and Lobster, where you can get only an expensive burger or a cheap lobster, both for \u00a320. Beast is essentially a luxe version of the latter.     Jay Rayner: \u2018The rib-eye, with a carbon footprint big enough to make a climate-change denier horny, is bloody marvellous.\u2019  Photograph: Sophia Evans/Observer    When it first opened a few months ago, it offered only a set menu for \u00a375 a head: a few antipasti of aged parmesan and the like, followed by 400g of bone-in rib-eye per person, and a quarter each of Norwegian king crab, a species which cleverly manages to be both a delicacy and a cause for concern to environmentalists due to the way it is advancing down the Norwegian coast. This is to be eaten at those huge 6ft-wide communal tables, planted with guttering candelabras. There are dry-stone walls and glass-fronted wine cabinets bulging with Montrachet and Pomerol, priced in four figures for men with teeny-weeny penises. I order one of the very cheapest options, a Bordeaux by the glass. A few days before our booking, Beast had introduced an \u00e0 la carte option. Apparently not everyone wanted the full Beasting. Given the apparent intention to make everything more relaxed, the pricing system is utterly dysfunctional. The starters, priced in the mid-teens, are the best value. Thick slices of impeccable yellowfin tuna, seared and then chilled, come with an insistent lemon a\u00efoli. Even better are the grilled red prawns, offering huge head-suckage possibilities. We watch the salty juices pool on the plate, exploding with umami, and conclude we need bread. \u201cI\u2019m sorry sir, we don\u2019t serve bread.\u201d Eh? What\u2019s all that about? I could see this as some stand for a bang-on-trend, carb-free Palaeolithic diet, were it not for the fact they serve chips. Mind you, they\u2019re crap chips, huge fat things that could exclude drafts. Who actually likes their chips this way? They\u2019re advertised as coming with truffle and foie-gras salt, which is like getting a gold-plated, diamond-encrusted case for your smartphone because you\u2019ve run out of things to spend money on. It\u2019s a spoilt person\u2019s version of luxury; the pillowy \u201cchips\u201d do not taste either of goose liver or truffle.     The crab legs at Beast. Photograph: Sophia Evans/Observer    Next we want a single serving of the rib-eye \u2013 400g \u2013 and a single serving of the crab. This is where it all collapses. The beef is listed at \u00a310 per 100g. But the smallest cut they have is 600g. You\u2019re in for \u00a360. With the crab, which costs \u00a375 a kilo, it\u2019s even sillier. You have to buy a whole beast, and the smallest they have is 4.3kg, at a mere \u00a3325.50. Before service. We have to make do with a single spindly leg at \u00a325. It\u2019s served with a cloyingly sweet basil and chilli dressing which makes us bare our teeth. Of course, despite the price, you have to extract the meat from the shell yourself using scissors, picks, crackers and a heart monitor. It\u2019s a messy business for not very much sweet meat. I ask for a finger bowl. They don\u2019t do those either. I am directed to the hard stone sinks around the edges. Maybe I should save on a walk to the men\u2019s while I\u2019m there. It feels like that sort of place. The corn-fed, dry-aged Nebraskan rib-eye, with a carbon footprint big enough to make a climate-change denier horny, is bloody marvellous: rich, deep, earthy, with that dense tang that comes with proper hanging. And at \u00a3100 a kilo it bloody well should be. At that price they should lead the damn animal into the restaurant and install it under the table so it can pleasure me while I eat. We love the buttery truffle sauce that comes with it. We love the bone, which demands to be taken in hand. We especially love a side salad of plump multicoloured tomatoes in a smoky dressing.     The lemon mousse. Photograph: Sophia Evans/Observer    At the end there is a lemon mousse which is too much acidity and nowhere near enough fruit. There is also a \u201cdeconstructed\u201d vanilla cheesecake, which, as too often, is code for: \u201cWe couldn\u2019t be bothered to make a proper cheesecake.\u201d A cushion of whipped vanilla cream lies under a landslide of shattered digestives with a few berries in mourning. And all of this is served with huge solemnity and seriousness. It may be hilarious, but those involved have no idea. It is also full of men, being manly. Looking around I finally conclude that Beast is the sort of restaurant invented solely to be photographed for in-flight magazines determined to present a portrait of your home city you do not recognise. I imagine there will soon be one in New York which will look just like this, with Dubai close behind and Moscow after that. They will all look the same. They will all cost the earth. They will all be completely and utterly absurd.

In what marks a serious blow to the BMW Masters and WGC HSBC Champions events, to be played in Shanghai at the end of this month and the start of next respectively, McIlroy issued a statement on Monday evening explaining he needs a break from competitive action. Earlier in the day Dublin\u2019s commercial court had heard how mediation \u2013 as ordered by a judge \u2013 between McIlroy and the Horizon management company had failed to resolve the multimillion-pound matter. Talks had taken place over Friday and Saturday without agreement. McIlroy said: \u201cI\u2019m going to need time away from tournament golf to prepare for the trial over my legal dispute with Horizon Sports Management. The court-directed mediation process failed over the weekend to resolve the issue.\u201d This casts a late shadow over what has proved an epic year on the course for McIlroy, including winning two major championships. There will be debate as to how his preparations and playing schedule before the Masters next April will be affected by the possibility of up to two weeks in a Dublin witness box. The case between McIlroy and Horizon has been running for a year, with the player suing the Dublin-based firm on the alleged basis he was coaxed into signing an \u201cunconscionable contract\u201d which included \u201cexcessive commissions\u201d. Horizon is countersuing by claiming breach of contract and loss of commissions against McIlroy, who was to set up his own management firm, Rory McIlroy Inc. When signed to Horizon, McIlroy agreed an equipment deal with Nike worth $100m. The plea for an out-of-court settlement came last month from Mr Justice Brian McGovern after it became apparent that the detailed financial business of another golfer and a close friend of McIlroy, Graeme McDowell, may have to enter the public domain. McDowell has also been a Horizon client, and McIlroy\u2019s lawyers claim their client was on \u201cmarkedly inferior\u201d terms to his compatriot despite assurances to the contrary.

For months the received wisdom has been that Rory McIlroy would be spared a Dublin court appearance in early 2015 by the kind of settlement which routinely arrives before the planned culmination of lucrative commercial cases. In September, when a judge all but ordered the legal parties of McIlroy and Horizon Sports Management to resolve their dispute away from a courtroom, that sense was only heightened. There may still be the kind of multimillion pound reconciliation which spares McIlroy from taking to the witness box. On the steps of the court, perhaps. But for now, the unfortunate reality is that the world\u2019s No1 golfer has seen his schedule affected for the first time by the Horizon dispute. And that is wholly significant. Nobody at Horizon will be upset by Mcllroy\u2019s shock withdrawal from the BMW Masters and WGC HSBC Champions events. In fact, those at the 25-year-old\u2019s former management firm will probably take some satisfaction from the Northern Irishman\u2019s core business being affected by a case which has now been rumbling on for a year. The very fact that McIlroy will take an enforced break from golf illustrates the seriousness of this scenario. It shows us McIlroy is concerned, after two days of mediation talks at the weekend failed to result in peace. It also tells us that certain people involved in the dispute want to take it all the way, despite the nastiness and detail which may emerge at a public forum. McIlroy plays his best when calmness is the backdrop. That much has been evident throughout 2014; even the reversion to single life seemed to place him in a state of mind which provided less distraction and hassle. You cannot be the finest golfer in the world without mental tranquillity. Now there is uncertainty over what the upcoming months will entail. McIlroy would routinely play in Abu Dhabi and Dubai to start the new year before crossing the Atlantic to appear at the Honda Classic. With a trial looming in February, or at the latest early March, his schedule cannot be mapped out with any great certainty. This would not be welcome in any year but with the opportunity to secure a grand slam of major titles at Augusta National in April at the summit of his priority list, there is added cause for anxiety. The European Tour will be wounded by McIlroy\u2019s failure to travel to the Far East. This month the four-times major winner used these pages to speak of his desire to continually support the Tour which had kick-started his career. McIlroy will return for the Race to Dubai\u2019s final event in late November but with Tiger Woods also out of the equation, the absence of McIlroy as a marquee figure in China will be keenly felt by organisers and sponsors alike. It hardly needs to be pointed out that background acrimony exists here, with many of those attached to Horizon still particularly wounded by the events which saw McIlroy depart after two years and subsequently set up his own management firm. When McIlroy speaks of a desire to put this affair behind him and move on, it must be recognised that nobody on the opposite side of the row is of a mind to make that easy for him. This is at best a wholly unfortunate situation. McIlroy and Horizon should have been, and to all intents and purposes were, good for each other. The Northern Irishman\u2019s meteoric rise always suggested he might outgrow the management firm but it is sad that the divorce has arrived, and continued, in such open and angry terms. McIlroy is looking to have his Horizon contract declared null and void, which is contested in the strongest terms \u2013 and by way of counter-suing \u2013 by the company which is in the closing stages of its deal with Graeme McDowell. Beyond that, it seems safe to infer that Horizon\u2019s very future is uncertain. In his affidavit to the commercial court, Horizon\u2019s co-founder and director Conor Ridge pointed to the \u201cbrand-development platform\u201d put in place for the \u201clong-term benefit\u201d of McIlroy. This, Ridge claimed, \u201cplayed a significant role in the securing of his current portfolio of lucrative sponsorship agreements, the activation of which now forms the bedrock of his global brand value and marketability as an athlete.\u201d These are not trivial sums; the same statement pointed towards McIlroy\u2019s $100m Nike contract, $50m of which had been paid by September last year. In many ways, they explain why this affair has landed at the offices of a courthouse in the first place. If the personal and professional impact of what has been taking place was not understood before, it has to be now; golf is a poorer place without McIlroy around, with the man himself similarly impacted by time away from his first love.", "title": "Rory McIlroy\u2019s enforced break shows his concern over Horizon dispute | Ewan Murray", "sentences": ["McIlroy would routinely play in Abu Dhabi and Dubai to start the new year before crossing the Atlantic to appear at the Honda Classic.", "McIlroy will return for the Race to Dubai\u2019s final event in late November but with Tiger Woods also out of the equation, the absence of McIlroy as a marquee figure in China will be keenly felt by organisers and sponsors alike."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-21T15:50:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/23/somalia-gets-first-cash-machine", "tags": ["Somalia", "Africa", "Al-Shabaab", "Banking", "Technology", "Business", "World news"], "article": "When 21-year-old student Salma Abdi ran out of cash on a Friday in Mogadishu she used to be without money all day as banks are closed in Somalia. But now Abdi does not need to be bound by bank opening hours as the city has gained its first cash machine. \u201cThere are out-of-hours and weekend days where you cannot find any bank services at all, so the ATM is the one which helps me. Now I need not be trapped,\u201d she says. Safety remains a concern The novel machine is being run by the Salam Somali Bank, a privately-owned financial institution, from the premises of a luxury hotel. Said Mo\u2019alim, the bank\u2019s marketing manager, says they are starting with just one ATM as a pilot project to test the security situation in Mogadishu. \u201cWe have set up the first machine here in Hotel Jazeera because it is a more secure place, but in the future we anticipate extending the machines to other places downtown,\u201d Mo\u2019alim told the Guardian. Mo\u2019alim knows that launching the ATM is not without risk. Armed gangs remain a threat. The installation of the cash machine, however, is the latest indication that Somalia is slowly rebuilding its fractured society after almost two decades of conflict. The ATM\u2019s arrival came as Somalia\u2019s first postal service since 1991 was launched, complete with national postcodes. The Salam Somali Bank is one of around a dozen private banks and investment firms which have opened in Mogadishu after 2011\u2019s ousting of al-Shabaab militants from the capital. Despite these new shoots of activity in the financial sector, many Somalians remain dependent on remittances. A hefty portion of the country\u2019s national income is derived from diasporic Somalians sending money home from countries like the UK. New hope for tourism     Lido beach, north of Mogadishu, was a famous attraction before the war. Photograph: Feisal Omar/Reuters    As Somalia emerges from its years of unrest, there are hopes of attracting increasing numbers of tourists to the country. Mogadishu\u2019s lone cash machine dispenses US dollars, in common use for business in Somalia due to the minimal value of the Somali shilling. At the current exchange rate, one British pound is worth just over 1,239 Somali shillings. Mo\u2019alim believes that the ATM will prove useful for both foreign visitors and members of the Somali diaspora on fleeting trips to the capital. \u201cBankcards used in Europe, USA, Asia or even Africa can be used here, including the Mastercard, Visa, American Express etc,\u201d he said.  \u201cI am glad and also really amazed that I can use my Visa card   Ali Mohamed, a Somalian \u00e9migr\u00e9  visiting Mogadishu from London, greeted the arrival of the machine as an unexpected plus. \u201cI am glad and also really amazed that I can use my Visa card, so that I won\u2019t need any more cash to take in my pocket,\u201d Mohamed said. \u201cBefore this, it would be difficult, as I had to take more cash from Dubai or Istanbul on my way to Mogadishu. But now you can see I have nothing to worry about,\u201d he says. The ATM has already attracted much interest from Somali locals as well, however, with young Somalians particularly intrigued by the technology. \u201cPeople are surprised at how it is possible that this small machine on the wall can bring you cash money,\u201d Mo\u2019Alim said. \u201cWe see some young men coming here to see the machine, even with no bank card to use.\u201d But some of them struggle with one factor in particular: the cash machine\u2019s instructions are all in English. \u201cI speak only the Somali language so it is hard for me to use the ATM,\u201d Mogadishu shop-owner Ibrahim Gule told the Guardian.  \u201cIt is different.

China\u2019s president, Xi Jinping, has called for an end to the light-headed lunacy of weird buildings that have been spawned by the country\u2019s construction boom over the last decade, crowding out skylines with enormous golden eggs and big pairs of pants. In a two-hour speech at a literary symposium in Beijing last week, Xi said that art should serve the people, and called for morally-inspiring architecture that should \u201cbe like sunshine from the blue sky and the breeze in spring that will inspire minds, warm hearts, cultivate taste and clean up undesirable work styles.\u201d  Over the last few years, China\u2019s accelerated urban growth, paired with the emergence of a billionaire business class keen to make its mark, has created a fertile playground for western architects. Lured by the scale of ambition and sheer speed of building, they have been allowed to indulge in fantasies they could never get away with back home, egged on by cut-price construction costs and safely distanced from the cruel realities of migrant labour conditions. Cities have also seen the results of a newly liberated home-grown creative class, allowed to unleash its talents on a scale never seen before. The state-owned architectural institutes have also been infected with a taste for the iconic and exotic, while provincial business magnates continue to do their thing with brassy flair. Take a look at some of the strangest species this warp-speed architectural laboratory has produced. SPACE EGGS National Centre for the Performing Arts, Beijing     Photograph: Andrew Wong/Getty Images    Designed by French architect Paul Andreu, Beijing\u2019s opera house was one of the first specimens of the space-egg genre to arrive in China. It landed next to Tiananmen Square in 2007 like the freshly-laid produce of some gigantic robo-chicken, plopped into a lake. An unlikely success story, given that most Chinese insults revolve around eggs, its ellipsoid titanium dome would go on to inspire a generation of architects with egg-shaped ambitions. Galaxy Soho, Beijing     Photograph: REX/View Pictures    Not to be outdone by a Frenchman, queen of the space egg Zaha Hadid soon laid a clutch of stripy white eggs a little further east, conjoined by rippling ribbons of architectural albumen forming a swooping world of aerial walkways. It proved so popular with its clients, the Soho group, that they commissioned another batch of slightly more pointy eggs across town \u2013 which were then copied by a company in Chongqing before the original was even finished. Henan Art Centre, Zhengzhou     Photograph: Carlos Ott    Beijing might now have a whole basket of space eggs, but Zhengzhou, the capital of nearby Henan province, actually got there first in 2003 and went one better: golden space eggs. Designed by Canadian-based Uruguayan architect, Carlos Ott, the Henan Art Centre is apparently not inspired by eggs at all, but intended to resemble abstract versions of ancient Chinese wind instruments \u2013 the Xun (a kind of ocarina), the panpipes and the bone-flute. Phoenix Island, Hainan     Photograph: Anna Frodesiak/CreativeCommons    Like a cluster of sailing boats undergoing some kind of warp-drive, these globular totems are the work of China\u2019s own spawn of Zaha, Ma Yansong of MAD Studio. Part of a luxury artificial archipelago, built off the coast of Hainan Island in southern China, the development was billed as \u201cChina\u2019s Dubai,\u201d proclaimed to be a \u201cfierce competitor\u201d for the title of \u201ceighth wonder of the modern world.\u201d But reports say that it\u2019s rapidly turning into a ghost island, as investors rush to offload their apartments following the economic downturn. Linda Haiyu Plaza, Beijing     Photograph: Chinasmack.com    More of a space caterpillar than an egg (although its designers claim it resembles a fish), the Linda Haiyu Plaza squats at the corner of Beijing\u2019s Fourth Ring Road, ready to swallow you into its gaping mouth. It takes the futuristic costume of Zaha Hadid\u2019s Soho projects and stretches it over a series of bloated office towers, like an overweight businessman squeezed into a raunchy spandex leotard.  OBJECTECTURE Tianzi Hotel, Hebei     Photograph: Wenn/Alamy    China has a fine history of carving enormous buddhas into mountainsides, and one hotel entrepreneur has been keen to keep up the tradition, erecting a vast trio of habitable gods in the middle of Hebei, east of Beijing. The building takes the form of 10-storey high effigies of Fu, Lu and Shou, the Chinese gods of good fortune, prosperity and longevity. Shou, the beaming chap with the white beard, welcomes guests through a door in his right foot, while his right hand holds the Peach of Immortality \u2013 which houses the hotel\u2019s best suite. Wuliangye Yibin building, Sichuan     Photograph: Chinarchblog.com    It only seems appropriate that the producer of China\u2019s most potent white spirit, baijiu, has chosen to monumentalise its liquor in the form of a gigantic bottle building. Indeed, the whole of its factory and visitor complex in Yibin, Sichuan province, is conceived as an alcoholic Alice in Wonderland theme park, with buildings in the shape of the drink packaging and avenues lined with glistening oversized bottles. Mobile phone building, Kunming     Photograph: David Myers/Alamy    London might have its own building-sized homage to the phone handset, in the form of the death-ray wielding Walkie-Talkie, but in southern China\u2019s Yunnan province they do things much more literally. Rising above Huancheng Road in the provincial capital Kunming, the 11-storey mobile phone building features button-shaped windows and a penthouse office floor that looks out through the screen \u2013 plus a sinister blue hand, emerging from the ground and clutching its sides. Piano and violin building, Huainan     Photograph: Jianan Yu/Reuters    No, it\u2019s not Taylor Swift\u2019s dream mansion, but an experimental building in Huainan, central Anhui province, designed by a group of architecture students at Hefei University of Technology. Conceived as a rehearsal and performance space for music students at the local college, visitors enter through the glass violin atrium, before travelling up a series of escalators into the bowels of the piano, and on to a roof terrace, shaded by the propped-open lid. Locals have allegedly dubbed it \u201cthe most Romantic building in China\u201d \u2013 though perhaps they don\u2019t know that it currently serves as a showroom for the city planners. Teapot building, Wuxi     Photograph: Imaginechina/REX    What shape does a tourist information centre take in an area famous for its red clay teapots? A teapot of course, made all the more spectacular by having been funded by the second richest man in China, Wang Jianlin of the Dalian Wanda group \u2013 which is eagerly buying up chunks of London. The 10-storey pot in Wuxi, Jiangsu province, has received the blessings of antique teapot master Wang Jinchuan, who praised the building\u2019s design as \u201cstrongly reflecting clay teapot culture\u201d. Who\u2019d have thought it. But if you thought all this was bonkers enough, it gets better: the whole thing can rotate. Meitan Tea Museum, Guizhou     Photograph: Meitan Tea Museum    Wuxi\u2019s pot may rotate, but it\u2019s not the biggest teapot building in China. That sought-after title goes to the Meitan Tea Museum in southern Guizhou province, which towers 74m as a proud symbol of the \u201chometown of Chinese green tea\u201d. Coming complete with a neighbouring tea-cup building, if it were ever filled it would hold 28m litres of tea. It trounces the previous Guinness World Record for the Largest Teapot Monument (yes, there is such a category), which was set by the Chester Teapot, built by William \u201cBabe\u201d Devon in West Virginia in 1938 \u2013 which stands just four metres high. Lotus building, Wujin     Photograph: Studio 505    According to its Australian architects, Studio 505, this exhibition and conference centre in Wujin, Jiangsu province, was designed as \u201ca giant series of lotus flowers, in varying stages of their life \u2013 from the young strong and tightly wrapped bud, to the vigorous open flower, through to the mature and fully splayed flower revealing the kernel of new life in the form of the seed pod as the third.\u201d The architects themselves describe it as \u201can essay in elegance and restraint\u201d. God knows what their other buildings look like. Olympic Park, Anhui     Image: Mei Jikui    Clearly bidding to become the world capital of objectecture, already home to the piano and violin building, Huainan City launched an ambitious plan for an Olympic Park in 2011 with venues designed like a load of massive balls. There would have been a main stadium shaped like an American football, a swimming pool like a volleyball, two other stadia shaped like a football and basketball and, crowning it all, a hotel housed in a 150m tall ping-pong bat \u2013 complete with a panoramic restaurant in the handle. Deemed a profligate fancy, it prompted the chiefs of Anhui province to declare a ban on novelty buildings. GATEWAYS Ring of Life, Fushun     Photograph: Ring of Life    Nothing says \u2018Look at our city!\u2019 like a massive glowing circle looming above the horizon. Having abandoned plans for an office building and entertainment complex (the local population was deemed too small to support such a use), Fushun city planners settled on building an enormous empty metal ring to attract tourists to the region. Not to be mistaken for an advert for the Dyson bladeless fan, the Ring of Life houses a viewing platform and is fitted with 12,000 LED lights, making it hard to miss by night. It was originally intended to include a bungee-jumping platform at the summit, but the plan was cancelled when the ring was found to be too high to jump from. Some have speculated on other uses for the great ring. Guangzhou Circle     Photograph: Joseph di Pasquale/AM Project    As if a giant cable reel had rolled into town and come to rest on the banks of the Pearl River, Guangzhou Circle towers 138m above southern China\u2019s largest city like a great copper spool. Housing the world\u2019s largest stock exchange for raw plastic material, it is the work of Italian architect Joseph di Pasquale, who says the form was \u201cinspired by the strong iconic value of jade discs and numerological tradition of feng shui.\u201d How so? Because not only does the 50m-wide hole punched through the centre make it look like an ancient Chinese coin, but when the building is reflected in the river it forms the lucky number eight. And an infinity symbol. And the insignia of ancient dynasty that reigned in this area 2,000 years ago. Sheraton Hotel, Huzhou     Photograph: Sheraton    Like a large doughnut dunked halfway into the waters of Huzhou, in Zhejiang province, the Sheraton hotel is another treat from Ma Yansong and MAD Architects. The 27-storey ovoid arch apparently draws on the region\u2019s ancient humpback bridges, only souped-up into a space-age glass and steel loop. \u201cHuzhou itself is a place famous for traditional ink paintings and splendid water views, and the arch bridge is one of the key elements of traditional architecture,\u201d says Ma. But he neglected to mention the inspiration of the splendid traditional outlet of Dunkin\u2019 Donuts in the local mall. Gate of the Orient, Suzhou     Photograph: Gate of the Orient    \u201cIt\u2019s just a big pair of pants!\u201d raged local bystanders, as the long legs of the Gate of the Orient were joined together with a majestic crotch on the skyline of the ancient city of Suzhou in 2012. Soaring 74 storeys into the clouds, the office building has been declared the largest gateway building in the world \u2013 and no doubt takes the title of the world\u2019s largest trouser-shaped building too. Designed by British practice RMJM, who should know better, the building has been declared \u201chumiliating\u201d by some locals, who say walking through its gaping arch is \u201clike being forced to crawl between someone else\u2019s legs.\u201d CCTV headquarters, Beijing      Photograph: Frederic J Brown/AFP/Getty    While we\u2019re on the topic of undergarments, the headquarters of China Central Television, designed by Dutch practice OMA, has drawn smutty sniggers and been nicknamed the \u201cbig boxer shorts\u201d \u2013 as well as likened to someone squatting above the city, ready to offload a nasty surprise. It is a menacing gateway, modelled on New York\u2019s twin towers bent double and knotted in a precipitous cantilever, and an appropriately sinister symbol of the state-controlled propagandist mouthpiece.

The electronics manufacturer started experimenting with indoor farming in July 2014 to test the feasibility of using its technology to solve a global problem. \u201cUtilising our expertise in engineering, manufacturing and factory automation, Panasonic is able to grow high-quality produce and stabilise food supply, fulfilling a global market need,\u201d explains Fizzah Rahman, corporate communications executive for Panasonic Asia Pacific.  The farm, which measures just 248 square metres, produces 3.6 tonnes of leafy greens, herbs and vegetables per year. Panasonic is one of several high-tech companies allocating resources to agricultural applications. Their contributions extend beyond developing new technologies; many are also operating onsite indoor farms.     Panasonic indoor vegetable farm. Photograph: Panasonic Asia Pacific    Toshiba started cultivating greens like spinach, lettuce and sprouts in an idle factory in Japan earlier this year. The indoor farm uses fluorescent lighting, temperature controls and remote monitoring systems to track growth. Vegetables will be sold through supermarkets, convenience stores and restaurants and Toshiba estimates annual sales will reach 300m yen (approximately \u00a31.74m).  In 2013, Sharp Corporation launched an indoor strawberry-growing operation in Dubai using proprietary technology to manage air quality, temperature and humidity with the goal of managing the farmer-less farm remotely from its headquarters in Japan. After Fujitsu ceased semiconductor manufacturing at its plant in Aizu-Wakamatsu, Japan, in 2009, the international IT services provider decided to leverage its Akisai cloud platform (designed to allow remote crop monitoring) to make its first foray into vegetable production. The corporation harvests 3,500 heads of lettuce per day in the 2,000 square metre former cleanroom. The controlled conditions improve the shelf life of the lettuce and, according to Fujitsu spokesperson Rishad Marquardt, also have a positive impact on the flavour. \u201cThe lettuce is unique in terms of flavour, not bitter like ordinary lettuce,\u201d he claims. Despite the investments associated with launching a high-tech indoor farm (Panasonic, for example, expects to spend an estimated \u00a31.46m by the 2016 financial year to reach its 1,000-tonne production capacity), the consumer cost of factory-grown foods is similar to farm-raised produce and there are significant environmental benefits to high-tech production methods. With the help of efficient lighting, temperature control and computer monitoring, produce grown in indoor farms maintains its nutritional value while using up to 98% less water and 70% less fertiliser than traditional farms and no pesticides, according to the Association for Vertical Farming. (Maintaining a bacteria-free, pesticide-free atmosphere means \u201cfarmers\u201d are often required to wear cleanroom suits and masks to minimise the risk of contamination).     Fujitsu indoor farm. Photograph: Fujitsu    \u201cGrowing lettuce in this environment \u2026 leads to an extremely clean product that can be eaten straight out of the bag without needing to be washed,\u201d Marquardt says. It also allows vegetables to grow up to two-and-a-half times faster than conventional farming. In Japan, Mirai Inc operates an indoor farm in a former Sony semiconductor factory that uses LED lighting developed by General Electric to maximise plant growth. The farm has only been in operation a few months but already cultivates up to 10,000 heads of lettuce per day. The lighting used in the indoor farm, believed to be the largest in the world, uses 40% less energy than fluorescent lamps, according to Kimura Tomoaki, general manager of GE Lighting Japan. While electronics corporations have big plans to contribute to food security in their countries and around the world \u2013 Panasonic set a goal of producing 5% of locally produced vegetables by 2017 \u2013 applying technology to farming is also proving to be good for business. Toshiba hopes to offer retail sales of its equipment for plant factory applications and GE is partnering with Mirai to provide lighting for indoor farms in Russia and China.

The November prior he\u2019d marveled at the velocity of Mitchell Johnson\u2019s bowling in Australia\u2019s home Ashes. When Ryan Harris looked doubtful for the fifth Test of that series, Lehmann saw velocity too in his potential replacements, Doug Bollinger and Nathan Coulter-Nile. In his thirst for that explosiveness and aggression, Lehmann now has an ally in national selector Rod Marsh, who included in his squad for Australia\u2019s current Test tour of the UAE both Mitchell Marsh and Glenn Maxwell. Both would presumably measure high on Lehmann\u2019s velocity index. Marsh was most excited about (the other) Marsh\u2019s capabilities with the ball, particularly his speed, though would effectively install him as a Test number six batsman as well. In contrast to all this searing velocity of recent times, last summer saw staid and steady limited-overs fixture Clint McKay jettisoned from Australia\u2019s limited-overs sides in unceremonious fashion. Though it had never particularly held back his metronomic bowling, McKay is noticeably lacking in velocity. In the wake of his demotion, Lehmann left the bowler in no doubt as to his future prospects: \u201chis speed isn\u2019t up to scratch for us and that\u2019s the message we\u2019ve sent to him.\u201d In fairness this ballsy, aggressive approach is the cornerstone of Lehmann\u2019s success in transforming Australia from also-rans to rankings-toppers, with Mitchell Johnson the sharpest point of his deadly arrow. With Johnson, Ryan Harris and a rampant David Warner blasting away all comers, Lehmann\u2019s reign couldn\u2019t have started any better, but what this bash and crash approach was never likely to do on a long-term basis was disguise the obvious faults that lay elsewhere. Over the past five days in Dubai, as has been the case for so many Australia teams through the past four decades, velocity, attitude and aggression didn\u2019t count for a whole lot on slow, turning wickets and in the presence of late movement. The limitations of Australia\u2019s top six was thus laid bare. As a notable exception there was the resourcefulness and fight of Steve Smith and Johnson late on day five. This doesn\u2019t underestimate Australia\u2019s centurion but as jaw-droppingly magnificent as his first innings effort was, Warner would have hit the same notes if he was playing on Mars. What the Australian top six lacked most throughout this game was an ability to adjust to the tempo that the playing conditions and the ever-lurking dangers in the opposition bowling line-up should have dictated. Lehmann\u2019s brief era in charge has been characterised by brute aggression, which is compelling and highly effective when things go well but has looked guileless and one-dimensional on the handful of occasions when his charges haven\u2019t stuck their landing. All of Australia\u2019s classic batting frailties were on display in this game. The unheralded but constsantly-probing spin pairing of Zulfiqar Babar and Yasir Shah either tied Australia down or else in knots and whatever batsman they couldn\u2019t extract was finished off by the reverse swing and late movement of Pakistan\u2019s pacemen.  This Test could also serve as further proof that after a long spell without Test action, the last team you want to face is the barmy and magnificent Pakistan and the last place you want to do it is on a slow, spin-friendly wicket in the UAE. It\u2019s hard to do justice the glorious unpredictability of Misbah\u2019s team without condescending or diminishing its blinding beauty. Australians have historically tended to believe that Pakistan present a microcosm of cricket\u2019s myriad problems, but when playing like this they actually make the impending sense of cricket\u2019s doom melt away entirely. Smith\u2019s second-innings effort was the type that will probably be forgotten within months, but it showed why outside of Warner\u2019s manic and now-regular demolition jobs, he\u2019s actually the most vital cog in the Australian top six. His 55 from 175 deliveries turned out to be a futile resistance but for a while his unflappability for bred confidence not only in his most willing and patient partner, Johnson, but made you genuinely believe that Australia could pull off a draw.  The contrast with the jittery fragility of Doolan, captain Michael Clarke and Marsh couldn\u2019t have been more stark. Chris Rogers applies himself with such devotion that you find yourself believing entirely in his incredulous, barely-concealed rage upon dismissal. Sadly, there wasn\u2019t much about Alex Doolan that looked believable in this Test. Twice in almost pitiable fashion he labored to a cheap demise. It seems unfair to contrast Doolan\u2019s haplessness against Younis Khan\u2019s serene masterclass for Pakistan, but what they both produced from similar positions in each innings told a story of the game itself. Younis gradually bricked himself inside an impenetrable wall. Less successful in establishing some foundations, Doolan just dug himself into a hole in the first innings and then quickly and haphazardly filled it in the second. Any batsman would have marveled at Younis. The first of his centuries required 220 balls of unwavering attention and came after Johnson had looked likely to blast his way to glory. In that effort Younis employed tantric batting but the undefeated 103 that came in the second innings was something far more passionate and ecstatic and showed a supreme ability to adapt to the game\u2019s biorhythms. By comparison the Australians fumbled around like schoolboys. This match also served to highlight Australia\u2019s worrying reliance on lower-order runs when Warner misses out. So often his side\u2019s savior in the past twelve months, Brad Haddin lapsed to his far less appealing habit of looking utterly culpable when he fails. His first-innings dismissal came from an ostentatiously loose drive that made debutant Imran Khan\u2019s new-ball offerings look like those of his famous namesake. In the second he left the gate open even further for Zulfiqar\u2019s arm ball. Having watched all fifty-seven of Steve O\u2019Keefe\u2019s overs up close, you wouldn\u2019t have predicted that it would be a straight one that would bamboozle the Aussie keeper.  Neither Australian spinner will want to re-watch anything that happened across the five days. O\u2019Keefe looked pedestrian either side of some handy breakthroughs while Lyon threatened in brief patches but also slid into the kind of anonymity that fuels his critics. Likewise, captain Michael Clarke is in a tricky spot; he can\u2019t be written off on account of his mounting failures when his best is as transcendent and masterly as only a Test ago.  Australia\u2019s potential inclusions for Abu Dhabi offer little that the current eleven couldn\u2019t manage, though James Faulkner could consider himself unlucky to have been left out in favour of Marsh here. Aside from the modest returns of the spinners, the greatest strides need to be made by the batsmen. Doolan might be put out of his nerve-jangling misery, though of all the feelings that Phil Hughes inspires, stability is not high on the list. Based on the second innings here, only a partial reverse of the Australian batting order would provide much of that.  With a crushing inevitability, Australia has again been undone by spin and reverse swing. Pakistan comprehensively dictated the cadence of this game: speeding it up, slowing it down and then convincingly taking it away from the tourists.  When Zulfiqar finally claimed the last of his five second-innings wickets to finish the game off, his victim Peter Siddle called for a review. Mostly he did so because Australia had two left and there was nothing to be lost in trying but also, you\u2019d hope, merely to make the opposition wait. As with most of Australia\u2019s attempts in this game, it was futile.", "title": "Australia's gung-ho approach exposed in first Test defeat by Pakistan", "sentences": ["Over the past five days in Dubai, as has been the case for so many Australia teams through the past four decades, velocity, attitude and aggression didn\u2019t count for a whole lot on slow, turning wickets and in the presence of late movement."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-26T23:27:03Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/oct/27/toronto-election-mayor-john-tory-rob-ford-multicultural-project-failed", "tags": ["Cities", "Canada", "Americas", "Race issues", "Mayoral elections", "Local government", "Local politics", "Politics", "Society", "World news", "Migration"], "article": "If I entered Toronto\u2019s heated mayoral race, I would pledge to ban the United Colors of Benetton from the city. While I have no objection to the company\u2019s shirts, coats or knitwear, their advertising, with its image of glossy diversity, must feed the insecurity Toronto feels about its own. As a white male (albeit a non-Canadian one), I bet I\u2019d even do quite well in the election, given the stultifyingly un-diverse leaders that this city of immigrants \u2013 its population is 48.6% foreign-born \u2013 always seems to vote in as mayor. Toronto will almost certainly do the same again today, when the third most multicultural city on the planet (after Luxembourg City and Dubai) will likely vote to replace the white, middle-aged, disgraced Rob Ford with the white, middle-aged, as-yet-undisgraced John Tory. It\u2019s not for lack of options: a reasonably varied range of candidates have entered the running. And although many urbanites I spoke to declared an intention to vote for the Chinese-Canadian Olivia Chow \u2013 widow of leftwing icon Jack Layton and lately the subject of some racially charged abuse \u2013 they also admit to having little confidence in her ability to do the job. So Tory it probably is for Toronto, a city that proclaims itself the zenith of multiculturalism. It\u2019s a concept that has come to represent the city more than anything else \u2013 more, even, than the similar-vintage CN Tower, which for 34 years stood unchallenged as the world\u2019s tallest freestanding structure. \u201cMulticulturalism!\u201d exclaimed Jan Morris in a 1984 essay. \u201cI had never heard the word before, but I was certain to hear it again, for it turned out to be the key word, so to speak, to contemporary Toronto.\u201d It was a city, she wrote, that ostensibly offered \u201call things to all ethnicities\u201d. Growing up near San Francisco and Seattle, I assumed that all major cities offered, at the very least, many things to most ethnicities. Subsequent visits to east Asia and northern Europe altered that assumption somewhat; but for the most part, world cities contain the world. Only the most Blimpish could deny the diversity of London, and in the past half century immigration has transformed Los Angeles (where I now live) from America\u2019s whitest metropolis to its least white. But the process took those cities almost by surprise, and, as a result, they both still experience periodic waves of incomprehension and resentment.     Stuffy marriage ... Toronto mayoral candidates John Tory and Doug Ford. Photograph: Richard Lautens/Toronto Star/Getty    Toronto, however, has supposedly cultivated its multiculture deliberately and methodically, welcoming as wide a range of foreign nationals as possible, giving them space to thrive and trying not to meddle with their traditions, most of which are considerably older than Canada. Just as we might know another city for its \u201cworld class\u201d industry, politics, architecture or lifestyle, Toronto, long eager for a similar designation, has wanted us to know it for its reflection and accommodation of the world itself. It refuses to subject its people \u2013 or rather, peoples \u2013 to anything as imperialist as the American-style melting pot, where you\u2019re American first and whatever else second. You can get a good idea of modern Torontonian multiculturalism at Pearson International Airport, where the world does indeed turn up. Visitors to Canada await entry amid a reassuringly polyglot line of, if not all ethnicities, then surely most of them. A sign above every customs officer\u2019s station announces services in \u201cEnglish and Fran\u00e7ais,\u201d a charmingly ineffectual defence against the veritable Babel that queues up daily before them. The muddle of the city turns out, however, to offer an unexpectedly rich urban texture. Writer Russell Smith, whose novels defined young urban Toronto in the 1990s, took me on a tour of his mid-gentrification neighbourhood on the city\u2019s west side: renowned vegan restaurant by crack-dealing corner by Portuguese bakery by lesbian bicycle co-op.  To Smith, it\u2019s the international aspect that remains, above all else, \u201cthe part of Toronto that\u2019s absolutely electrifying\u201d. He remembers fondly his first bus trips to the city as a college student in the 1980s: \u201cThe excitement for me was to get off in the middle of crowded, bustling, stinky, sweaty Chinatown, with the cries of the food-sellers all around, have a meal that was something very unusual to me, and then a punk rock concert. It was the very definition of urban sophistication and cosmopolitanism.\u201d     \u2018Absolutely electrifying\u2019 ... Chinatown in Toronto. Photograph: Angelo Cavalli/Getty    On the whole, those qualities remain. Toronto avoided the American-style postwar population drain from its downtown core, and still celebrates the legacy of urbanist provocateur Jane Jacobs, who moved here from Greenwich Village (the neighbourhood that shaped The Death and Life of Great American Cities) to live out her days in Toronto as she had in New York: holding back expressways, revitalising housing projects and getting arrested. But as sure as this has produced a desirable 21st-century city, it has also produced an expensive one \u2013 unexpectedly rich urban texture, yes, but also just unexpectedly rich. Does that make it less amenable to the multiculture? \u201cWhereas in the 1970s and 80s, downtown was lower-income and therefore less white, now we have a downtown becoming higher-income,\u201d says Denise Balkissoon, a journalist who observes Toronto\u2019s multiculturalism and its real-estate market. \u201cThat is pushing a lot of racialised communities out to the periphery.\u201d Inner Toronto\u2019s multicultural experience, she says, runs the risk of becoming little more than the freedom to \u201ceat whatever kind of noodles you want\u201d. Exploring the numerous current and historical ethnic enclaves in this so-called City of Neighbourhoods \u2013 the Greek strip east of the Don river, a Koreatown, an unexpected Maltese quarter, several Chinatowns and Little Italys \u2013 reveals no immediate shortage of noodle shops, nor any other kind of business offering the transplanted fruits of foreign civilisations. But even enthusiasts acknowledge that quite a few of these areas have aged, their core immigrant populations unreplenished and their purposes thinned to the touristic. \u201cThe core of Toronto, the old city of Toronto, is an incredibly expensive place to live,\u201d says Shawn Micallef, a Toronto Star columnist who has written extensively on the built and social environment. \u201cThere has been a Manhattanisation, which makes it homogenous. It risks becoming a boring, corporatised, Starbucks-on-every-corner kind of place. Whereas the suburbs are where the exciting stuff is happening, where the actual multiculturalism happens that we, as Torontonians, embody.\u201d     The only local mall that\u2019s open on Christmas Day ... shoppers at the Pacific Mall in the greater Toronto area. Photograph: Andrew Francis Wallace/Toronto Star    And so out I went to the periphery: specifically, to Pacific Mall, an impressive shopping complex located out past the Canadian Tire megastores and strip malls emblazoned with foreign scripts, in a modest Greater Toronto Area town called Markham. Widely known as \u201cthe Asian mall\u201d, it is a warehouse-like structure divided into a glass-and-metal \u201cstreet grid\u201d \u2013 with names like Hollywood and Queen\u2019s Avenue \u2013 of 450 mobile phone stores, cosmetics outlets, ginseng dealers, bubble tea counters, and shelves of DVDs and luxury handbags of routinely questioned authenticity, all of it serving an entirely Chinese clientele.  Almost entirely Chinese, rather: amid all this, I overheard a couple arguing in Spanish about whether to buy one of the mall\u2019s many miniature light-up miniature waterfalls \u2013 a richly multicultural moment, albeit a rarity even out there on the periphery. Canada has defined itself as the \u201cmosaic\u201d rather than the melting pot, and apart from the occasional maple-leaf flag, I saw little in the Pacific Mall that acknowledged the existence of the country around it. Thirty years ago, Morris declared Canadian nationality \u201cno more than a minor social prerequisite, like a driving licence or a spare pair of glasses\u201d. Go as far out as the Pacific Mall (in whose parking lot I also saw a supposedly un-Canadian interracial shouting match over a fender bender), and it counts for even less. Still, given that we have these same sorts of mono-ethnic suburbs in Los Angeles, with all their inconveniences and pleasures (food critics go to the San Gabriel Valley for the finest Chinese cuisine outside China, after all), I had to wonder if they really count as a meaningful strike against the grand multicultural project, or just a reflection of its complications. In certain areas, such as public education, the multicultural Toronto decidedly puts multicultural Los Angeles to shame: in LA, linguistic difficulties alone have led many parents not just to abandon their neighbourhood schools, but to never consider them in the first place. Many of Toronto\u2019s schools, on the other hand, are thoroughly mixed. So why all these old white mayors? Multiculturalism remains Toronto\u2019s \u201cgreat strength on an everyday, personal level \u2013 wherever you go, wherever you work, you will see all sorts of multi-ethnic groups of people working together and enjoying each other\u2019s company,\u201d Balkissoon says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t think, on a representative level, Toronto has really lived up to that promise. Which groups get the biggest say in the media, or which groups have the most power \u2013 that tends to be traditional. There tends to be some stagnation.\u201d     Stuporific ... Rob Ford at Toronto City Hall. Photograph: Aaron Harris/Reuters    That stagnation recently took shape in Rob Ford, he of the crack-smoking \u201cdrunken stupors\u201d, the bike lane removals and the professed admiration for \u201cOriental people\u201d who \u201cwork like dogs\u201d. Yet the disgraced mayor did, in his clownish way, stand for a non-PC, non-cosmopolitan, non-urban outer Toronto that has spent years feeling left out. It\u2019s his natural constituency, Ford Nation \u2013 and to the surprise of some multiculture-loving downtowners it turned out to include no small number of recent immigrants. Rob has cancer, so his brother Doug is running instead, similarly untroubled by allegations of drug dealing, which he denies. But though the voters of Toronto may understandably choose not to elect that particular middle-aged white man, they will still most likely elect John Tory: lawyer, corporate executive, media figure and shining representative of anything but the multiculture. This, in stark contrast to the more than 70% white (and comparatively conservative) city of Calgary, which has twice elected Naheed Nenshi, the first Muslim mayor in North America. Multiculturalism is the sole unifying idea of Canada\u2019s largest city. Whatever else Toronto has impressively achieved in its mission to provide \u201call things to all ethnicities\u201d, however, it clearly still hasn\u2019t had much of an effect on who runs the place. Or who runs the places, given the deepening divergence of what looks increasingly like two separate Torontos. One of them, a more exciting, more urban and indeed more multicultural city than ever, has done quite well for itself. The other, represented in a stuffy marriage between the Ford brothers and the John Torys and the bitter quasi-suburbanites and un-integrated new arrivals who vote them in, produces embarrassing publicity and an uncomfortable cognitive dissonance with the city\u2019s image of diversity. Maybe Toronto can straighten this out \u2013 or maybe, sailing under that off-brand Benetton flag, it will just keep muddling through.  Do cities need a global parliament of mayors?

Just one. I couldn\u2019t find it because, so far as I know, it doesn\u2019t exist. I needed something to capture the embarrassment I felt when I thrust my arm confidently into the air, fully expecting it to be one in a thicket, and found, instead, that I was one of the very few people in the room willing to admit to be being a fan of Shahid Afridi. Raised hands were so few and far between, in fact, that the speaker, that talented man Osman Samiuddin, as he surveyed the rows of seats from the theatre stage, was able to pick me out, a way away in the gloom at the back, and say: \u201cOh look, it\u2019s Andy Bull.\u201d At which point heads turned to see the lone fool with his arm up. Umm \u2026 Hi. I would say Afridi has achieved the impossible and exhausted the patience of the Pakistani fans. Except that he is still in the team. If you\u2019re a neutral, Afridi is an easy player to love. A ball-biting, boundary-hitting, pitch-ripping, wicket-tricking, cricketing lunatic. Even Geoff Boycott loves to watch Afridi play. \u201cFantastic, great for the game,\u201d says Boycott. \u201cAnd daft as a brush\u201d. For many Pakistani fans, on the other hand, Afridi is insufferably infuriating. I thoroughly enjoyed what was, to me, one of the archetypal Afridi performances when, at Lord\u2019s in 2010, recalled to the Test team for the first time in four years, and as captain no less, he was caught at cow corner off his fourth ball. Off the bowling of Marcus North. In a fourth-innings run chase. He then told the press \u201cwith my temperament I can\u2019t play Test cricket\u201d and quit the game for good. Others, those who have an emotional investment in the success of the side, seemed, surprisingly, somewhat less amused by it all. What a curious affliction it must be to be a full-time Pakistan fan, to follow a side who go through such giddy swings of form. Does anyone in cricket suffer so much? And is anyone in cricket rewarded for their suffering with such exquisite performances, such paroxysmic peaks of pleasure? In the last week the world watched, ever-more slack jawed, as they destroyed Australia in the first Test at Dubai. The result gave just as much pleasure to cricket-lovers in this corner of the world as Pakistan\u2019s 3-0 demolition of England in 2011 must have done to those Down Under. And yet it was only a fortnight ago that Pakistan lost two wickets for no runs at all in the final over of an ODI when they only needed two to win. Off Glenn Maxwell\u2019s bowling. They won this Test with a bowling attack who had all of nine caps between them, two rookie spinners, one of them 35 years old, the other a leggie playing his very first game. Their batting lineup was propped up a green wicketkeeper, Sarfraz Ahmed, who rattled along lickety-split at a run-a-ball, and the 36-year-old Younis Khan, who had just been dropped from the ODI side and who was so pissed off with his own cricket board that he made a point of refused to thank them when he was asked to do so. All marshalled by a 40-year-old skipper, Misbah-ul-Haq, who has just dropped himself from the ODI side because of his slow-scoring, and whose own coach attributes his good form in this very Test to the fact that he has put on weight. It has been over five years now since Pakistan\u2019s fans last got to see the team play a Test at home. Among the current side, only Younis, Misbah, and Mohammad Hafeez have ever played an international game on their own soil. And though the first two of them seem to be altogether impervious to the effects of advancing age, it is likely even they will be in retirement by the time the team is able to play in their own country again. There will be an entire generation of Pakistani cricketers who have no idea what it is to play for their country in front of their own fans. An entire generation of Pakistani fans who have only seen their side on TV. And that isn\u2019t the half of it. The current attack is the third Waqar Younis has had to build in his two stints as coach. The first, of course, was torn apart by the spot-fixing scandal orchestrated by Afridi\u2019s successor as captain back in 2010, Salman Butt, who seemed such an impressive skipper at the time. The second was built around the spin of Saeed Ajmal and Abdur Rehman, the first of them now suspended from cricket while he fixes his crooked action, the second dropped from the squad because he failed a fitness Test. English cricket seems to have been torn apart by injuries, egos, and Twitter accounts. Imagine the state of the game here if we\u2019d had to cope with even half of what Pakistan have put up with. For Pakistan, the sacking of the best batsman in the side seems to be an annual event. Younis has been dropped five times in the last four years. Which is nothing at all when you compare it to the hokey-cokey going on with the country\u2019s cricket board. In the last 18 months Zaka Ashraf has been appointed as chairman, suspended as chairman, reinstated as chairman, dismissed as chairman, re-reinstated as chairman, and sacked again. They have had five chairmen in the last two years. And yet, despite it all, they still find a way to win more than they lose, and as often as not they do it in style. It\u2019s a mystery. A glorious, inexplicable mystery. Samiuddin has a book out soon, a history of Pakistani cricket, which has, understandably, taken him years to put together. I\u2019ve rarely felt so much relish for a new publication. I\u2019m hoping to find a few answers in it. Because Pakistan are, to this England fan, a team I\u2019m delighted to watch and at a loss to explain. \u2022 This is an extract taken from the Spin, the Guardian\u2019s weekly cricket email.

Victory at his home event in Basel on Sunday took Federer within 2,230 points of the Serb but with Djokovic defending 2,500 points over the next few weeks having won in both Paris and the season-ending ATP Tour Finals in London last year, his Swiss rival has every chance of turning back the clock. Federer reached the semi-finals of both tournaments last year and boasts a 66-10 win/loss ratio this season \u2013 the best on the tour. Already the record holder for the most consecutive weeks at No1 with 302, the 33-year-old has come through a serious back injury and the birth of second set of twins but would usurp Andre Agassi as the oldest world No1 in history if he manages it in Paris. Roger Federer: the fall and rise of a champion       October-December 2012 After 17 weeks as No1, Federer ceded top spot to Djokovic by dropping points from his 2011 title wins at the Swiss Indoors Basel, Paris Masters and the ATP World Tour Finals. January-March 2013 After a five-set defeat to Andy Murray in the semifinals of the Australian Open, Federer\u2019s power waned as he lost his titles at the Rotterdam Open and the Dubai Championships before succumbing to a back injury at the Indian Wells Masters, which enforced a two-month break from the sport. April-June 2013 Murray climbed to No2 on 1 April above Federer, who didn\u2019t play again until the Madrid Open in mid-May, where he suffered a third-round exit, his earliest since 2003. The Swiss held on to his No3 ranking due to his win at Halle Open \u2013 his only title of 2013 \u2013 but he lost to world No116 Sergiy Stakhovsky in the second-round at Wimbledon. July The form of Rafael Nadal and David Ferrer, and early exits from the French Open in June and Wimbledon, meant Federer slipped to No5. The 31-year-old was now in free-fall: losing in the second-round at Swiss Open, and re-injuring his back in the process. August Federer missed out on ATP points by withdrawing from the Canadian Open, and suffered defeat to Rafael Nadal in Cincinnati in the third-round. Federer fell to No7, his lowest ranking in over a decade, despite maintaining that he was \u201chappy with his progress\u201d. September After an encouraging start to the US Open, Tommy Robredo destroyed him in straight-sets in the fourth-round. Federer\u2019s return to the top five was due to rivals such as Tomas Berdych being unable to accrue ATP points due to Davis Cup commitments. October Federer\u2019s poor form continued: despite playing a game less due to a bye, Federer lost to Ga\u00ebl Monfils in the Shanghai Masters third round. Juan Mart\u00edn del Potro\u2019s win at the Japan Open meant the Swiss slipped to seventh once more. November-December  An encouraging showing at the Swiss Open finished with defeat in the final to Del Potro. Federer then beat the Argentinian at the Paris Masters \u2013 his first win over a top-10 player since January \u2013 qualifying for the ATP World Tour finals as No6 seed. January 2014 Despite a semi-final appearance at the Australian Open, Federer slipped to No8 \u2013 his lowest ranking since 2002 \u2013 due to Stanislas Wawrinka\u2019s victory in Melbourne, which also saw Federer displaced as Swiss No1. February-March The road to recovery begins. Federer fought from a set down to beat Berdych in the final of the Dubai Tennis Championship and narrowly lost to Djokovic in the final of Indian Wells Masters. With his back troubles behind him, Federer jumps to No5 in the rankings. April Federer begins the month with the best record on the Tour \u2013 22 wins, four defeats \u2013 and climbs to fourth after a quarter-final appearance at the Miami Open. May-July Davis Cup distraction and a withdrawal from the Madrid Open to look after his pregnant wife delayed his progress on the Tour, but returning to win at Halle and as a finalist at both Monte Carlo and Wimbledon, Federer moved back ahead of Wawrinka into the No3 ranking. August-October With Nadal sidelined with a wrist injury Federer was a beaten finalist at the Canadian Open, and won the Cincinnati Masters in August \u2013 his 80th ATP singles title. Reaching the US Open semi-final in September further closed the gap on Nadal in second, and he surpassed the Spaniard with his Shanghai Masters title win this month.

Cox says it could turn the downsides of drop-in pitches (Adelaide\u2019s were notoriously slow and lifeless last season) into upsides. In fairness, CA has already started the process of creating pitches that replicate subcontinental conditions at the new National Cricket Centre, which they hope will demystify pitches abroad. Now for them to be useful, all they need is find some net bowlers who can replicate the deliveries sent down by Yasir Shah and Zulfiqar Babar in Dubai. Looking for Abu Dhabi Besides Mitchell Johnson\u2019s first spell, David Warner\u2019s crunching first-innings hundred and some late resistance by Steve Smith, there wasn\u2019t a lot to write home about after Australia\u2019s stumble in Dubai, so attention has naturally turned to changes in both selection and approach. The solution to Australia\u2019s continued problems facing spin bowling? Well, there isn\u2019t one according to Ian Chappell, at least not one that Darren Lehmann can impart on his players. \u201cHe can\u2019t help,\u201d Chappell told ESPNCricinfo, \u201cyou\u2019ve got to learn to play spin bowling from a very young age. You\u2019ve got to learn the correct footwork from a very young age.\u201d  Dean Jones, on the other hand, thinks Australia\u2019s batsmen should be practising without pads. \u201cIf I was \u2018Boof\u2019 [coach Darren Lehmann] now, I\u2019d be asking the boys to practise with no pads to spinners in the nets, I\u2019ll allow thigh pads,\u201d Jones told Fairfax. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to get their hands in front of the pad.\u201d That didn\u2019t work so well for Mitchell Marsh in the second innings, mind you. Lehmann himself says that Australia played for spin that wasn\u2019t there, to which at least Brad Haddin would attest. As for personnel changes, Chappell favours Phil Hughes as the man to replace the struggling Alex Doolan.  Finally, former Test tweaker Ashley Mallet says that Australia\u2019s spin bowling struggles have their roots in the inability of first-class captains to set appropriate fields for slow bowlers. But he did concede to the The Australian that Australia\u2019s first-choice option, Nathan Lyon, at least currently has this going in his favour. \u201cI don\u2019t think a lot of captains have any idea about [field placements],\u201d Mallett said. \u201cI know Michael Clarke does. He sets a pretty good field for (Nathan) Lyon. He\u2019s probably the best captain we\u2019ve seen since (Ian) Chappell because he tries to make things happen.\u201d  Warriors one-day champs again The second year of the condensed-format domestic one-day competition has drawn to its conclusion with Western Australia taking out the Matador BBQs One-Day Cup, the state\u2019s 12th title and first since 2003-04. Any coverage of domestic cricket is most welcome, a fact against which you have to measure any criticism of the patchy commentary work that characterised the GEM broadcasts, but the inclusion of Meg Lanning to the Nine team was a welcome one. The tournament itself has settled well into its new groove as the Australian cricket calendar\u2019s amuse bouche, though questions will rightly emerge as to whether cramming all of it into a single month and staging so much of it in one spot could be having a deleterious effect on the hopes of players to go on and succeed at international level.  A format-hopping schedule with games spread across the entire breadth of the summer doesn\u2019t work either, but along with a few gibes about the TV-friendly early starts, Victoria coach Greg Shipperd raised the valid option of playing half of the tournament in one hit and spreading five more games per state across the rest of the season, allowing players to re-establish form, push for selection and experience a variety of pitch and weather conditions.  One thing is for certain: North Sydney Oval might bolster a few batting averages but it is no great preparation ground for international cricket. The tournament finished amid mild acrimony, with Queensland Bulls coach Stuart Law not backward in coming forward over the decision to award Victorian Cameron White (354 runs at 59) the player-of-the-tournament award ahead of Bulls star Usman Khawaja, who amassed a more imposing run tally of 532 at 74.  \u201cI am heartbroken for him (Khawaja) and I know he is disappointed as well to play as well as he did and get nothing for it,\u2019\u2019 said Law. \u201cI am a bit perplexed because if you are picking on batting surely Usman stands out from the crowd. Looking at it statistically, it does not make sense. \u201cI am not out to start a fight or upset anyone but it\u2019s just sad he has played his heart out and copped a punch in the ribs to go with his broken finger.\u2019\u2019         Get a load of this    KP goes clubbing Those old enough to remember Ian Chappell, Malcolm Marshall, Carl Hooper and Abdul Qadir turning out in Melbourne club cricket ranks might have something to say on the matter, but international recruits don\u2019t come much bigger than newly minted Monash Tiger Kevin Pietersen, who\u2019ll play for the Victorian Premier Cricket side during his Big Bash League stint with the Melbourne Stars. The club has penciled in the walking headline for a T20 clash against St Kilda on December the 13th in a move that is sure to swell spectator numbers well beyond the usual array of dog-walkers and proud parents. \u201cIt will be a landmark moment in the history of our club and in Premier cricket,\u201d Tigers captain-coach Alan Wise told the Waverley Leader. Likely to take his place alongside the recently discarded England star is Cameron White, and the St Kilda line-up should also be strengthened by the likes of Rob Quiney and James Muirhead. This is the only non-pun headline you will see about Mick Jagger and the World Cup Finally, gossip columnists and celebrity reporters around the world have rejoiced this week at the opportunity to lead their stories and headlines with an abrupt scream of \u201cHowzat!\u201d (a special mention must go to The Daily Mail for their pissweak \u201cClean bowled over!\u201d) with cricket-mad Rolling Stones Mick Jagger and Charlie Watts taking a tour of the Bradman Museum and stopping for a photo op with the World Cup trophy.  Jagger joked that it would be the closest any Englishman would be getting to the trophy as Watts gave him a mildly disapproving look. Not quite as cool a photo as Jagger at The Oval during the 1972 Ashes but then what is? Weekend Warriors Though not every state is yet blessed with weather to match, club cricket has resumed in earnest. For the parents of many young players, that means countless hours spent shuttling kids around and watching them play. Or if you\u2019re Bernadette McPhee, mother of Prahran Premier cricketer Maggie, it also means donning the whites yourself. Only three weeks back, Prahran batters Nicole Bolton (143) and Jess Cameron (185) piled on a 322-run partnership in the club\u2019s 77-run Round 1 win over Dandenong, but with the pair missing for the club\u2019s clash with Melbourne at the weekend, the True Blues had to scramble for players at the last minute. In stepped McPhee, who still only swelled team numbers to 10, a situation not helped by injuries to two more teammates during Melbourne\u2019s innings.  With McPhee stepping into the breach, Prahran were bundled out for 17 in reply to Melbourne\u2019s imposing 339. Annabel Sutherland, daughter of Cricket Australia CEO James, top-scored with 6 and McPhee, having never played a competitive game before, padded up and fought valiantly to 4 not out at the close of Prahran\u2019s innings. There\u2019s no word yet on whether she\u2019ll turn out next week and make sure she can at least retire with a batting average.

But now one flight comparison site, which analysed 7.5 billion airfares on its top 100 routes worldwide, believes it has found the answer.  According to the research by momondo.co.uk, the ideal time to book a flight is 53 days in advance, a move that may save an average of up to 29% on your fare. Cheaper fares also depend on the time of the flight. Evening departures between 6pm and midnight are typically cheaper, while Tuesday is generally the cheapest day to fly. For example, a flight from London to Lisbon, when booked 52 days in advance, costs on average \u00a3209 -compared to the average price of \u00a3287.  Flights from London to Dubai are cheapest 51 days ahead of travel, when it will cost \u00a3458 \u2013 20% less than the average fare of \u00a3551.

In January Skyscanner published the results of a three-year study, which found that on average five weeks in advance is the best time to find the cheapest fares. However, Skyscanner also found this varies according to destination. The cheapest flights to Greece, for example, were found to be available just three weeks ahead of departure.

Finally playing in more territories than David Fincher\u2019s film, now is when its greater international reach, founded on horror\u2019s universal appeal, is beginning to tell. A spate of Latin American openings \u2013 including a $10.9m Mexican one that is the country\u2019s 12th highest ever \u2013 helped finally push it to the global No 1 spot, and over the $200m mark. It\u2019s quite a strike for John R Leonetti\u2019s $6.5m-budgeted film, which is tracking ahead of its parent film, The Conjuring, at the same stage by some $40m. In mitigation: James Wan\u2019s original sustained its US audience far more diligently (at weekend four, it had taken $120.7m domestic, to Annabelle\u2019s $79.5m), and slowly built a foreign audience to an eventual $318m worldwide gross. Taking much more of a smash-and-grab release pattern (probably sensible given rough reviews), Annabelle has completed its rollout now, and in all likelihood will start to drop off quickly, though it will still end up more profitable than its $20m-budgeted mother-film. Joining it in the money-spinning category this week is Ouija, the $5m spooker from Jason Blum\u2019s Paranormal Activity production stable, which debuted at $20m in the US. The masala king            Not logged in time for Rentrak\u2019s Sunday-night global box-office chart were figures for Shah Rukh Khan\u2019s Diwali-released extravaganza Happy New Year. We still only have collections for India and about half its other territories, but the picture that\u2019s emerging is a record-breaking one, at least domestically. The strongest estimate ($17.8m) pegs it as the best Indian opening weekend of all time, a smidgeon ahead of Aamir Khan\u2019s 2013 thriller Dhoom 3 ($17.6m). That\u2019s the film the mighty SRK will have to beat to take the overall Bollywood box-office crown ($86m). The Indian market continues to be a grower (about a 10% increase between 2012 and 2013 \u2013 not quite the 30%-plus Chinese rates), and the records are being tested and bested all the time. A total of $86m might not sound like much for an all-time film, but low ticket prices depress the gross.  No one questions India\u2019s rep as a cinematic powerhouse, but what is in doubt is Bollywood\u2019s ability to travel consistently. Happy New Year is a good case in point: the diaspora has turned out for one of its favourite faces, but not to the degree expected. Its ballpark $4.8m opening weekend overseas take is down from SRK\u2019s Chennai Express ($5.9m) last year, with the UK portion \u2013 a key market \u2013 well shy of Dhoom 3\u2019s $1.45m record. One theory might be that diasporic tastes are beginning to diverge from subcontinental ones, and glitzy paneer from the masala school (Happy New Year is about a group of \u201closers\u201d who stage a jewel heist under cover of a Dubai dance competition) doesn\u2019t cut it with newer generations abroad. Other recent Bolly big-hitters have begun to vary things with more unusual settings, such as Bang Bang! (Prague), Kick (Warsaw) and indeed, Dhoom 3 (Chicago).  Everybody loves Lucy     Star firepower \u2026 Scarlett Johansson as Lucy. Photograph: Universal/Everett//Rex    Opening its Chinese account \u2013 its final territory \u2013 with $20.2m to was enough to put Luc Besson\u2019s surprise package in the No 1 spot in that country among a glut of Hollywood product, including Guardians of the Galaxy ($17.8m) and fellow debutant Hercules ($10.8m). In the mid-noughties, Besson started to give the Euro-pudding thrillers he produced a global dimension, and, as director, has cashed in most handsomely with Lucy: with its total gross now standing at $434m, 12th in the 2014 worldwide list, it is Besson\u2019s most successful ever. Impressive, considering it\u2019s not standing on the shoulders of previous franchise instalments like his Transporter and Taken properties; Scarlett Johansson\u2019s ever-increasing star firepower surely helped. South Korean villain Choi Min-sik (Oldboy) (who delivers untranslated dialogue in the film\u2019s strongest early scenes) and the first-half Taiwanese setting added up to a form of Asiasploitation with relative integrity. Asian grosses that have been roughly double of Taken 2\u2019s in 2012 have been the outcome. Cheeringly for followers of the on-going socio-cultural programme (inception: early 1990s) that is the Female Action Hero, Lucy is now the third highest grossing single-female-fronted action film, behind the two Hunger Games. Scar-Jo and J-Law have the world at their feet. Mexican standoff     Underperforming \u2026 The Book of Life    For a film produced by Guillermo del Toro and loaded with Latin voice talent from Diego Luna onwards, Reel FX\u2019s animation The Book of Life is underperforming in its heartlands. In Mexico \u2013 whose Day of the Dead folklore it milks for plot \u2013 its take stands at $6.9m after two weekends, and another key central and south American market, Brazil, is currently at $3.1m. Annabelle, the adult Halloween option, has outflanked it for now in both places (though that may change when Mexico\u2019s Day of the Dead holiday unleashes kids in cinemas this coming weekend). With its cumulative haul at $47.9m, it is lagging behind even other cobwebbed children\u2019s fare that was released in recent years in the runup to 31 October: Corpse Bride wound up with $117.1m globally in 2005, the same year The Curse of the Were-Rabbit took $192.6m; in 2012, Hotel Transylvania managed a beefy $358.3m. The Book of Life should comfortably pass the Mexican takes of those three (Transylvania took $14.6m), but that\u2019s the least it should manage given the familiarity factor. One commentator has suggested that distributor Fox\u2019s relationship with rival animation studio Dreamworks, in effect since 2012, might have dampened marketing efforts for The Book of Life, which was sympathetically reviewed. Perhaps its muted US box office has curbed the fiesta elsewhere. The rest of the world            Comparatively little action outside the Hollywood sphere compared to recent weeks. The Weinstein Company-distributed indie comedy drama St Vincent \u2013 featuring Bill Murray as a Vietnam vet turned maverick babysitter \u2013 took a sturdy $7.7m in the US, landing it in 6th and 17th globally. In 21st position, Chinese smash hit comedy Breakup Buddies, now up to $183.2m, has Lost in Thailand\u2019s $208m domestic record in its sights. And in France, Intouchables followup Samba \u2013 global no 22 \u2013 held well (-9%), but is clearly not going to repeat the miraculous business that made its predecessor the most successful non-English-language comedy of all time.  The future            Fury, Keanu Reeves revenger John Wick and Dracula Untold all continue to dribble out in more territories in the weekend of breathing space before Interstellar and The Hunger Games: Mockinjay \u2013 Part 1 overwhelm the global scene with day-and-date drops. In China, Donnie Yen\u2019s cop martial-arts thriller, Kung Fu Jungle \u2013 opening there against Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles \u2013 is a shot across Hollywood\u2019s bows before December\u2019s flood of major local pics that the government will be banking on to push native market share back in their direction.

By the end of 2015, one in three of the world\u2019s buildings over 150-metres will be in China. Construction of the world\u2019s second-tallest building, the 632-metre tall Shanghai Tower, is due to be completed next year. Few people outside China have heard of Suzhou, a city in the eastern province of Jiangsu with a population of 1.3 million (China now has over 140 cities of more than one million people; America has nine).  Yet if all goes to plan, Suzhou will soon boast the world\u2019s third-tallest building, the 700m Zhongnan Centre. Other Chinese cities joining the upward rush include Shenzhen, Wuhan, Tianjin and Shenyang. By 2020, China is set to be home to six of the world\u2019s 10 tallest buildings, although none will top the globe\u2019s current highest, the 828m Burj Khalifa in Dubai.     The planned 700m Zhongnan Centre in Suzhou, which is set to be the world\u2019s third tallest building when completed    Zoning laws, listed buildings and other well-intentioned hallmarks of democratic society can impede the march of progress; the opposition to London\u2019s Shard would be unimaginable in contemporary China.  The dramatic experiments in skyscraper construction and urban planning in the one-party state will, increasingly, hold lessons for cities the world over. As a response to the dilemma of how to build densely while retaining liveability, the Shanghai Tower may be the closest architects have yet come to creating a \u201cvertical city\u201d.  Designed by the American firm Gensler (pdf), the building forms a spiralling trunk that takes the amenities of the horizontal city block \u2013 homes, shops, offices, galleries, multiplexes \u2013 and stacks them on a vertical plane.  Its \u201csky gardens\u201d \u2013 around one-third of the site is green space \u2013 will showcase flora from around China, countering the predilection of developers to commercialise every square inch. According to Wood: \u201cThe commitment to public space \u2026 that\u2019s what elevates the Shanghai Tower to be a potentially fantastic building.\u201d But this, he adds, is only the start; architects need to be more radical still. \u201cI hear a lot of developers talking about putting so many uses in the building you\u2019ll never have to leave it,\u201d Wood says. \u201cIt\u2019s terrible, is it not? Who would ever not want to leave the building?\u201d      The 632m Shanghai Tower (tallest building, left) under construction. Photograph: Imaginechina/Rex    Instead, he calls for \u201csustainable vertical urbanism\u201d, or the linkage of clustered tall buildings with sky bridges and elevated plazas replicating the ground floor in the air. A building should be responsive to topology as in vernacular architecture \u2013 Calgary and Khartoum should look different \u2013 and be designed in consideration of the buildings around it. \u201cIt\u2019s no accident that every science-fiction film, from Metropolis to Blade Runner through to Star Wars, envisages the dense, multi-level city of the future,\u201d Wood adds. \u201cThe reason is because it completely makes sense.\u201d A proposed development that comes closer than most to this ideal is Cloud Citizen, which co-won a design competition in Shenzhen, a city in southern China.  If built, the 1.7 million square-metre complex would be \u201cas much a strategy for how to build future cities capable of giving back more to the environment than they cost, as it is a singular iconographic mega building complex with an identifiable and striking skyline,\u201d say the architects.  Sky bridges and plazas connect the towers, the tallest of which is 680m, in a cloud-like mass. Cloud Citizen would have offices, parks, cultural facilities and homes with an ability to harvest rainwater, produce food and create power from the sun, wind and algae \u2013 a mini-city within a city.     Shenzen\u2019s Cloud Citizen would be a mini-city within a city - containing offices, parks, cultural facilities and homes with an ability to harvest rainwater, produce food and create power from the sun, wind and algae    Super tall towers are as much about prestige as commercial gain. In China they are also symptomatic of a central government policy that has led to the frantic densification of cities.  Premier Li Keqiang has called urbanisation a \u201chuge engine\u201d for growth as the government attempts to restructure its economy away from a reliance on exports and investment to one based on domestic spending. While most people in China were farmers 30 years ago, 50% of people lived in cities by 2011 and by 2030 it\u2019s estimated one billion people, or 70% of the population, will be urbanites. Getting cities wrong could create slums, exacerbate climate change and encourage social instability. The United Nations Population Division projects that by 2050, 66% of the world\u2019s population will be urban, up from 54% today. Once population growth is factored in, this amounts to 2.5 billion more people living in cities. At the CTBUH conference in Shanghai, architects agreed that sprawl is not a sustainable solution to density. But building towers of dizzying height in a never-ending game of architectural one-upmanship is impractical too. \u201cWe have to find the solution of how to move towards more density but to keep the human scale\u201d, says Yosuke Hayano, principal partner of MAD Architects, a Beijing-based practice. \u201cPeople are very sensitive to space.\u201d MAD designs on a theory they call shan shui (\u201cmountain water\u201d), in reference to the way cities were strategically positioned in ancient China near rivers and mountains.  The Zendai Himalayas Centre, a 560,000 sq m development in the eastern city of Nanjing due for completion in 2017, is a ring of undulating hill-shaped \u201ctowers\u201d around a cluster of low buildings, with vertical louvres creating the impression of waterfalls. This mimicry of nature, MAD believes, imbues urban environments with humanity.     The Interlace residential apartments in Singapore resemble an orderly stack of Jenga blocks.  Photograph: OMA    Ole Scheeren, a German architect based in China and Hong Kong, thinks architects need to \u201cmove away from the isolation that is embedded in the typology of the tower\u201d.  Scheeren co-designed the CCTV Headquarters in Beijing, which houses the state-run broadcaster and is one of the capital\u2019s icons. It\u2019s a striking cuboid loop of tower of 473,000 sq m. Alarmed at the \u201caccumulation of singularities\u201d, or mono-functional towers accruing in Asian cities, Scheeren\u2019s buildings are prototypes for urban centres that need to be dense yet diverse, porous and livable. For Interlace, a residential compound of 1,000 apartments in Singapore, Scheeren was tasked with building 12 towers of 24 storeys organised on a grid. \u201cThe sense of living in a community is not explored well spatially in a configuration like this,\u201d Scheeren says. He toppled the towers, forming an interconnected mesh of buildings that resemble an orderly stack of Jenga blocks, creating space for parks, public courtyards and a running track. \u201cWhere towers used to be relatively monotonous and simple repetitive structures they\u2019re becoming more integrated and connected and also vertically diverse,\u201d Scheeren says. \u201cIn that sense they will, I believe, attain more aspects of the words everybody likes to use: \u2018vertical cities\u2019.\u201d ", "title": "China's obsession with vertical cities", "sentences": ["By 2020, China is set to be home to six of the world\u2019s 10 tallest buildings, although none will top the globe\u2019s current highest, the 828m Burj Khalifa in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-30T09:54:05Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2014/oct/31/millionaire-landlords-fergus-judith-wilson-evicting-families", "tags": ["Buying to let", "Renting property", "Property", "Money", "Housing market", "Real estate", "Business", "Housing benefit", "Society", "Housing", "Money", "UK news"], "article": "Britain\u2019s most controversial landlords, Fergus and Judith Wilson, whose property empire extends to nearly 1,000 homes in Kent, have begun evicting families with more than two children, banned tenants on zero-hours contracts and thrown out extended families where the grandmother comes to stay. Last January, the Wilsons sparked a national outcry after it was revealed they were evicting anyone on housing benefit. They sent the eviction notices to 200 tenants, saying they preferred eastern European migrants who defaulted much less frequently than single mums on welfare. They said at the time that the move was purely an economic decision and was entirely legal as landlords do not have to give a reason before obtaining a possession order on a home. But, in a bizarre twist, the Wilsons have begun evicting many of their eastern European tenants \u2013 because they are having too many children. \u201cI have taken the decision to evict all families with more than two children and also three-generation households,\u201d said Fergus Wilson in a statement sent to the Guardian. \u201cMost of our houses in Ashford go to childless couples. However, after a couple of months there are four, five, six children and I have to evict the family. The tenancy has been taken by deception. We have had a number of eastern European families slip in under the radar with four, five and six children. We have had no British tenants with three or more children for some weeks. They have been evicted as I took the decision to no longer take housing benefit cases. All those British tenants with three or more children have long gone.\u201d We asked Wilson how many families he has evicted on this basis. He said: \u201cEight to date, and at least four more to go.\u201d He added that visiting grannies are also a problem. \u201cThree-generation houses seem to be very popular with east European immigrants. When they move in the children, they move in grandma.\u201d Wilson claims that he has no choice but to evict multiple-occupancy tenants and large families because otherwise he would be in breach of council overcrowding rules. \u201cContrary to what may be depicted by the leftwing media, I do not eat little babies alive \u2026 I do not make the rules, but I do play by them \u2026 welcome to ethnic engineering at the coal face.\u201d But which rules on overcrowding Wilson is referring to are unclear. A property may be considered overcrowded if two children above 10 of the opposite sex have to share the same bedroom. But the Housing Act 1985 counts living rooms as well as bedrooms as available for sleeping, which makes statutory overcrowding in the private rented sector difficult to prove. However, councils can also use health and safety rules to serve a legal notice on the property owner. Like many other landlords across Britain, Wilson has also taken the decision to reject anybody who is on a zero hours contract. Around 1.4 million employees in Britain are now on zero hours contracts, with no guaranteed minimum hours or pay, and are facing mounting problems finding anywhere to live. \u201cI only have experience in rejecting them as tenants,\u201d said Wilson. \u201cNo landlord in his right mind will accept tenants who do not have a guaranteed wage. No rent insurer will accept them, so that effectively makes the landlord\u2019s decision for them. No pay \u2026 nowhere to live. Welcome to the real world.\u201d     Earlier this year the Wilsons evicted Andrzej Koper and his daughter Anya after he complained about a non-working boiler \u2013 they claimed the timing was entirely incidental. Photograph: Sean Smith/Guardian    Rent guarantee insurance has become a product widely sold to buy-to-let landlords, and promises to pay out if a tenant defaults \u2013 usually with a cap of around \u00a32,500 a month for six months \u2013 and may also cover legal costs for eviction. But before granting a rent guarantee, the insurer will require that the tenant goes through extensive credit referencing checks and income verification. In most cases it means that a person on a zero hours contract is declined for insurance and rejected as a tenant. Given that the Wilsons are either evicting certain types of tenant, and rejecting other types of applicant, we asked just how many he had left. The reality, Wilson said, is that demand for property is so intense landlords can still pick and choose. \u201cI asked my agents to let me know how many calls were received from would-be tenants yesterday? Answer: 81. How many were from east European or overseas? 71. How many had children? 15. How many were on zero contacts? Nil. How many on housing benefit? Seven. How many houses available? Three.\u201d Campaigning organisations such as housing charity Shelter argue that the balance of power has swung too far in favour of landlords, against tenants who are chasing a limited supply of property and can be evicted without reason. Roger Harding, Shelter\u2019s director of communications, policy and campaigns, said: \u201cIt beggars belief that a landlord can evict a family simply because they have three children, and the fact that this one has is yet another sign of our broken rental market. \u201cFor many families, private renting is their only option. Families now make up nearly a third of private renters and if more landlords turn them away this will make it near impossible for many to find anywhere half-decent to live. Politicians must make private rented homes a stable place to put down roots, and not somewhere you can be turned away from for no good reason.\u201d Behind the Wilsons\u2019 recent actions lies another motive; preparing their portfolio of homes for a trade sale. In July, they said they planned to withdraw from the property business, selling their entire portfolio of nearly 1,000 homes in the Ashford and Maidstone area in a deal likely to net them at least \u00a3100m. \u201cI have had three firm offers for our property portfolio, and while I am considering these I have to manage the portfolio on a day-to-day basis.\u201d The Wilson are understood to have been in negotiation with investors from Dubai and the far east. The couple first shot to prominence in 2006 when it was revealed that they had built up Britain\u2019s biggest buy-to-let empire, sometimes snapping up a property every day. Fergus Wilson said a bounceback in the local property market to above 2007 levels has prompted him to quit. In an email to the Guardian in July, he said: \u201cWe are selling up the whole lot! The market has recovered and passed the 2007 level.

Next came Alibaba, a Chinese behemoth valued at more than $200bn. Now the Islamic world has launched its own competitor to the great global online giants, in the hope of cornering the mouthwatering trillion-dollar Muslim consumer market. Zilzar.com was unveiled by the Malaysian prime minister, Datuk Seri Najib Abdul Razak, at the World Islamic Economic Forum. \u201cZilzar\u201d means earthquake in Arabic. The global market for halal products and services \u2013 not just foods but anything that conforms to Islamic rules, including financial services, is currently estimated to be worth $1.6tn and forecast to reach almost $2.5tn by 2018. There are 1.6 billion Muslims in the world, a population growing at twice the rate of the global average. Like Amazon and Alibaba, Zilzar provides a platform for businesses and consumers to sell to each other. Its core markets are entrepreneurs, youth and small and medium enterprises. Its chief executive Rushdi Siddiqui, predicts that within two to three months the site will have more halal suppliers than Alibaba. \u201cI am going after their suppliers,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want to shake up the marketplace. This is about empowering the consumer and creating employment \u2013 people can sell their own products. Technology is a great equaliser. Aid has not helped Muslims in emerging markets. I was trying to feed them; now I am teaching them to fish.\u201d Razak told the forum: \u201cThe environment and conditions are perfect for this partnership for economic growth. The halal industry is made up of small and medium enterprises who are globally dispersed and crying out for connectivity.\u201d Although it is dominated by financial and insurance services, other major sectors in the global halal industry include fashion, food, tourism, logistics and recreation as well as pharmaceuticals, vaccines and cosmetics. Halal is an Arabic term meaning \u201cpermissible\u201dor \u201clawful\u201d under Islamic rules. Products should not contain alcohol or pork traces or promote gambling. The tourism industry provides Muslims with access to prayer facilities, halal food and gender-sensitive recreational activities such as women-only pools and beaches. Consumers on Zilzar can trade products from prayer beads and electronic Qu\u2019rans to hijabs and films. All its sellers and products are verified by certification bodies around the world. But Jumaatun Azmi, founding director of the World Halal Forum based in Malaysia, says that problems of accreditation and authenticity persist. \u201cWhen I was in China, I actually came across pork labelled as halal. The industry is so fragmented,\u201d she says. \u201cThere are a lot of problems in terms of proper procedures, standards and implementation. Even within the Muslim world, people argue over the definition of halal \u2013 for example there are different schools of thought on whether you should stun animals.\u201d Accreditation within the halal industry is largely left to the free market. Estimates of the number of halal accreditation bodies worldwide range from 300 to 3000, including mosques, governments, Islamic organisations and individuals. This is most evidently an issue in the halal food market, estimated to be worth $1tn. The leading exporters are the US, Brazil, the Netherlands and Germany. Azmi set up the World Halal Forum to bring together international stakeholders in the industry from governments and producers to scientists and Islamic scholars. \u201cWe want to help people to understand halal in a universal way, along the lines of the fair trade movement and eco movement,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not just about religion, it is about animal rights and health and fairness. The kosher industry has been able to do this for a long time \u2013 the kosher label is associated with good health and quality products. Halal stands for similar values but it doesn\u2019t have the image.\u201d Other non-Muslim countries are now recognising the value of the halal industry. Spain in now planning to create a global halal hub in the south and next year Cordoba will play host to an international halal conference. Tomas Guerrero, researcher at the Centre for Global Economy and Geopolitics in Spain says: \u201cA solid bet for the future of the Spanish economy could be reorienting a great part of our production and services towards the halal market. The possibilities are endless; beyond just agribusiness and tourism.\u201d In June, the UK became the first country outside the Muslim world to issue an Islamic bond. Orders for the bonds, which totalled \u00a3200m were 12 times oversubscribed. South Africa and Hong Kong have since followed suit with Luxembourg soon to do the same. An Islamic index has been created on the London Stock Exchange and the UK government is supporting the development of Islamic loans for students and startups. The Islamic financial sector has experienced 40% annual growth rates over the past decade, with Islamic financial assets estimated at $1.35tn and the potential of Islamic banking assets in core markets to be over $4tn and growing at a rate of 15-20%. Under Islamic rules, no interest on business dealings can be charged. Transactions must also be based on a real trade or business activities and they must not involve anything forbidden under Sharia law, such as gambling or alcohol. Speaking at the conference in Dubai, Andrea Leadsom MP and economic secretary to the Treasury said: \u201c I hope we will see billions\u2019 worth of new investments from the Islamic world in a range of sectors in the UK.

The highs have been plenty for trainer Charlie Hills this year. Just the Judge bagged him a top-flight trophy when she won the Grade I EP Taylor stakes at Woodbine earlier this month. He\u2019s done great trade in the group race department back home, sending out a squadron of nice prospects for next year, including Gimcrack and Acomb victors, Muhaarar and Dutch Connection. And his piggy bank is again showing Wall Street profits \u2013 a mere victory or so short of breaking through the million-marker for the year in domestic earnings. Hills\u2019 low, however, was one that puts all dizzying career accomplishments into a box marked \u201ctrivial\u201d. His older brother John died aged 53 in June of this year from pancreatic cancer \u2013 an especially tough punishment for a racing dynasty that could teach even the Waltons a thing or two about family values. \u201cJohn dying over the summer \u2026 it was very hard for all of the family,\u201d said Hills. \u201cHe meant a lot to all of us. And it would be nice to have a bit of good news, really.\u201d Much-needed good news for the Hills family could come thick and fast this weekend. In Just the Judge and Commemorative, Hills has two solid chances of repeating his Breeders\u2019 Cup success with Chriselliam, who won last year\u2019s Grade I Juvenile Fillies Turf (her last race, sadly, for Chriselliam was put down earlier this year with a severe foot infection \u2013 another kidney punch for Hills). Saturday\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup Fillies and Mares Turf candidate Just the Judge would appear to hold the greater chance of Hills\u2019 duo. And he reports that his horse, having headed straight from Canada to southern California by way of Memphis, has come out of her win bouncing. \u201cIt\u2019s quite a long journey from Canada, seven hours door-to-door, but she got off the plane fresher than she did at Woodbine,\u201d he said. \u201cShe certainly takes her travelling well, which is great to see.\u201d And having settled in well to her sunny surroundings, Just the Judge is poised on the cusp of a bold showing, Hills believes. \u201cShe\u2019s got a nice draw, and as long as she gets away smartly and gets in a good position the first half of the race, I would say that she has a huge chance, really.\u201d he said. \u201cIn my mind, I think she\u2019s been improving between each race this year, And I think she\u2019s even better than she was in the first half of last year when she had those two massive runs [a second in the 1000 Guineas followed by a win in the Irish version] quite close together.\u201d Their greatest obstacle to success appears to be Sir Michael Stoute\u2019s Dank \u2013 last year\u2019s Fillies and Mare\u2019s Turf heroine. \u201cShe could be a massive danger, but I don\u2019t think any filly has ever won this race two years on the trot. It\u2019s such a hard thing to do. She\u2019s been off the track for a long time, but she does look very well.\u201d Then there\u2019s the home team\u2019s Stephanie\u2019s Kitten, who pipped Just the Judge for second in the Grade I Beverly D. Stakes at Arlington in August. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to turn that form around, obviously.\u201d Whatever happens on Saturday, however, it would be fair to say that Just the Judge would have to perform feats of unimaginable horror to tarnish the esteem she\u2019s held in by her trainer. She has been the mainstay of Faringdon Place for a significant portion of Hills\u2019 short training career. She was his first classic winner, when she won last year\u2019s Irish 1,000 Guineas. \u201cShe\u2019s won group races at two, three and four. She\u2019s just been amazing for my career.\u201d And while she is entered in Tattersalls December Sales, Hills intimated that her racing days might not yet be numbered. \u201cThere are lots of nice opportunities for her next year, races in Dubai and maybe Japan \u2013 those types of races,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s owned in a partnership between Qatar Racing and the Sangster Family\u2026Obviously first, something will have to be sorted out.\u201d While the gable is poised over Just the Judge\u2019s racing career, Commemorative\u2019s best years are still ahead of him judging by a commanding victory in the Group III Autumn Stakes at Newmarket last time out. That day, he licked \u2018em from the front, seeing out the stiff mile comfortably. And Hills sees the stamina he displayed at Newmarket as especially beneficial in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Juvenile Turf on the Friday. \u201cWe know he\u2019s going to stay a mile really well, which will be an important factor. I think he\u2019s got a great chance of getting into the first three,\u201d said Hills. \u201cIt looks a pretty open race. Obviously, the likely favorite [Hootenanny] has yet to prove himself over the trip. Commemorative is improving the right way, and he\u2019s got to have a great chance.\u201d Another plus is Santa Anita\u2019s firm turf course. Despite his size, (he weighs 524kg - racehorses can weigh as much as 100kg less), Commemorative has an action built for the road. In a spin on the turf earlier this week at Santa Anita, for example, the way he floated over the green carpet had the touch of a Rudolph Nureyev about it. Hills even toyed with the idea of supplementing Commemorative for the Racing Post Trophy, until the heavens opened over Doncaster, bringing Santa Anita and a crack at the Breeders\u2019 Cup into play. \u201cIt was a bit of an afterthought,\u201d he admitted. \u201cBut he\u2019s a very strong two-year-old, he\u2019s huge. My only concern is that, because he\u2019s drawn four, I wonder whether he\u2019s got the tactical speed to get in a good position.\u201d Irrespective of what happens this year, Hills sees a mile and a quarter well within Commemorative\u2019s compass next year. \u201cWe\u2019ll see how he winters, and see where we are in the spring as to where we go,\u201d he said, not discounting races like the 2000 Guineas. Circumspection though can be forgiven. Given those events since Hills last stood here on world racing\u2019s main stage \u2013 when the likes of Willie Carson, one of Chriselliam\u2019s co-owners, brought a New Year\u2019s Eve atmosphere to the winners enclosure \u2013 it\u2019s no wonder that his thoughts are often underpinned with reserve, if not a little humility. \u201cObviously last year, when we had our winner, it gave us a great thrill. We were all very proud of her,\u201d he said. \u201cSanta Anita, though, it\u2019s one of the greatest tracks in the world, and we\u2019re just very honored to have runners.\u201d", "title": "Top trainer Charlie Hills aims to keep racing dynasty on track at Breeders' Cup", "sentences": ["\u201cThere are lots of nice opportunities for her next year, races in Dubai and maybe Japan \u2013 those types of races,\u201d he said."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-31T15:47:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/oct/31/live-qa-after-aid-how-can-development-work-in-unstable-states", "tags": ["Global development professionals network", "Impact and effectiveness", "Conflict and development", "Live Q&As", "Humanitarian response", "Aid", "Syria", "Iraq", "Afghanistan", "South Sudan", "Somalia", "Central African Republic", "Middle East and North Africa", "Africa"], "article": "Despite claims that we are living in the most peaceful period in history, the past seven years have seen significant declines in levels of stability around the world.

In total, 500 million people (pdf) live in countries at risk of instability and conflict. During conflicts, the primary priorities are providing food, shelter and medical assistance. After a time, and preferably once peace has been re-established, the next step is transitioning to long-term development. But while it is imperative for post-conflict countries to build infrastructure and become self-sufficient, bridging the gap between emergency aid and sustainable development is often fraught with difficulties. Where there is a lack of official institutions there is great potential for trust and authority to be manipulated. Post- and current conflict states such as Somalia, Sudan, Iraq and Afghanistan consistently rank at the bottom of major corruption indicators such as Transparency International\u2019s Corruption Perceptions Index.  Meanwhile, local governance is often taken up by smaller, informal groups such as peace committees. But once formal political organisations are established, difficulties can arise (pdf) in conceding the power they have established. After the immediate needs have been addressed, how can long-term development work in unstable states? How can donors identify which governments to work with and include local communities\u2019 voices in decision-making? And as conflicts in countries like Syria appear to rumble on with no peaceful end in sight, how can development agencies work where a state of war has become the status quo?

He was a cheap horse who came from nowhere to become a hero for a generation, a blue-collar warrior in the midst of the Depression, and there has scarcely been a career path since his 1930s heyday that stands much comparison. On Saturday night, at the Breeders\u2019 Cup in Los Angeles, Santa Anita could see the conclusion of a bottom-to-top story that at least comes close. It started in front of just 504 paying spectators at Wolverhampton racecourse on 1 November 2013, when a colt called Toast Of New York won a \u00a34,000 race by 16 lengths. One year later to the day, the same horse will line up for the $5m Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic at Santa Anita, the final and feature race on American racing\u2019s most valuable card. Rarely has the racing mountain been scaled so quickly or thoroughly, but it is not just the arc of Toast Of New York\u2019s story that suggests a film script. There is an unlikely cast of characters along for the ride too. Jamie Osborne, the colt\u2019s trainer, is an ex-jump jockey whose horses rarely venture higher than middling handicaps. Michael Buckley, his owner, is better known in jumps racing. And then there is Jamie Spencer, the jockey in the last-chance saloon, hoping for one more big winner before hanging up his boots. It is two months since Spencer, one of the leading jockeys of his generation, announced his intention to retire at the end of the season at the age of just 34. He has not spoken publicly about the reasons for his decision and he was not doing so at the track this week either, beyond insisting that even a win in the Classic will not change his mind. \u201cNo second thoughts,\u201d Spencer said. \u201cOnce I commit to something, I commit to it. If he wins, I might just retire a bit earlier then. I\u2019d be able to afford to. \u201cHe\u2019s got a real chance. Obviously the [dirt] surface is a bit of an unknown and we won\u2019t know until he runs, but he\u2019s got a nice draw that means he won\u2019t get the full brunt of the kickback early. That gives me options and he should be fine. He came right back to form last time out and he\u2019s right in there with a shout.\u201d Spencer, at least, is familiar with the sport\u2019s grandest stages. Osborne, though, has spent most of his career doing what he can with average horses, in the hope that one like \u201cToast\u201d might walk into the stable one day. Osborne knew from early on that Toast Of New York was special and even his runs at lowly Wolverhampton were all part of the plan. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t be doing your job very well if you didn\u2019t realise when you\u2019ve got a good one,\u201d the trainer says. \u201cHe clearly was, and he had the physique of a horse that looked like he might get better. He\u2019s a good 30kg heavier now than he was in November last year and that\u2019s just muscle and physical improvement. He\u2019s big and strong, there\u2019s some dirt in his pedigree too and he deserves to be here.\u201d Osborne announced his own retirement from the saddle out of the blue at the annual Lesters awards ceremony, also at the age of 34, but he too is puzzled that Spencer is about to quit the storyline. \u201cIt was different for me, I was in pieces,\u201d he says. \u201cOnly he knows the real reasons and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if he came back one day, but he seems pretty determined for now. \u201cThe next step for us with this horse is probably the [Dubai] World Cup and it\u2019s going to be hard for Jamie to sit there and watch him. But, seemingly, he\u2019s made his decision.\u201d Buckley will be nearly \u00a31.7m richer if his horse comes home in front. \u201cLeaving aside all the joy I\u2019ll get out of it, if they can pull this off, I\u2019ll burst into tears for them rather than myself,\u201d Buckley said. \u201cIt would change Jamie Osborne\u2019s life and a fantastic way for Jamie Spencer to finish.\u201d", "title": "Toast Of New York could emulate Seabiscuit in Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic", "sentences": ["\u201cThe next step for us with this horse is probably the [Dubai] World Cup and it\u2019s going to be hard for Jamie to sit there and watch him."], "publicationDate": "2014-10-31T19:07:28Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/small-business-network/2014/nov/01/small-business-spotlight-tuxedo-money-solutions", "tags": ["Starting a new business", "Guardian Small Business Network", "Business", "Small business"], "article": "What has been your lightbulb moment since joining Tuxedo? My lightbulb moment came before I joined Tuxedo, when I joined Alliance and Leicester as commercial director responsible for its own startup prepaid business. The opportunity to play a part in the revolution of the payments industry was hugely exciting. The plan was to run the new prepaid cards business as a startup within the bank, combining the professionalism of a bank with the entrepreneurial spirit of a startup. Unfortunately, this was a great idea in theory but running an entrepreneurial business within the confines and culture of a bank proved to be rather challenging. Tuxedo was one of the first prepaid businesses in the UK, launching its first prepaid product in 2007 and while it was very entrepreneurial, its business model and approach weren\u2019t quite right. The financial crash didn\u2019t help matters either. When I was approached by Tuxedo\u2019s investors to run the company, I leapt at the chance. What were the first few months like after joining Tuxedo to help change its direction? Busy \u2013 there was a big job to do in completely restructuring the business and its payment propositions, which came with some tough decisions. I needed to get the company into shape in a short period. Getting the business model right and tackling the cost base were key priorities. It was also important to win a few marquee clients in the first 12 months to prove that the business model worked and that a small company like Tuxedo could win some big corporate clients. Talk us through your daily routine When I first joined, the company was based in central London, so I would spend four nights in London away from my family in Shropshire. Early starts and late finishes ensued, as I set about restructuring the company. Since I joined, my focus has been on building the foundations of the business and the service that we offer. Year-upon-year, we have witnessed steady growth, but now we are really starting to see this hard work come to fruition. I am in London one or two days a week but given we now have an operational centre in Chester, as well as offices in Melbourne, Australia, Dubai and one opening in the near future in the US \u2013 I\u2019m still covering a fair bit of ground. What\u2019s been the most important lesson you\u2019ve learned from growing a business? Restructuring a business requires a very different focus from growing a business. Doing both things at the same time is a real challenge that requires a huge amount of drive, energy and tenacity. I\u2019ve also learned that our business is only as good as the people we employ. What do you think are the main reasons business startups are successful? It\u2019s down to people making it happen. Those people need to be capable, hard-working, tenacious and resilient \u2013 and they will need a little bit of luck along the way too. What do you think is the future of the payments industry? Traditionally, payment platforms came in a box and did one thing and one thing only. The emerging payments market is really starting to flourish and some of the new platforms and the level of inter-connectivity they offer will be game-changing. A great example is cross-border payments, which have been traditionally the stronghold of banks, which sent international payments via Swift for a handsome fee. What\u2019s your hiring strategy for your business? It\u2019s quite simple really; we hire people who make a difference. We cannot afford to carry passengers. Any tips for budding entrepreneurs? Just get on with it \u2013 and don\u2019t take no for an answer, there is always a way. There are so many people that talk about doing it but never do. You will make mistakes along the way but the biggest mistake is not trying to achieve what you think you can. Better to have tried and failed and all that. Do you have any advice for achieving a decent work/life balance? I have three children (ages nine, seven and five) and a wonderful wife, three dogs, five chickens, six ducks, and my daughter is now on about a pony and a kitten \u2013 so you could say family life is busy. My family comes first and always will. I make time to see them and almost never miss sports days, school plays or any major milestones in their lives. Your children only grow up once, so don\u2019t miss it. John Sharman is the chief executive of Tuxedo Money Solutions.

Lawyers from the group Reprieve are working on behalf of Ahmad Zeidan, a 21-year-old British student who was sentenced to nine years in prison for drugs charges in the UAE on the basis of a \u201cconfession\u201d given after, they say, being beaten by police officers, hooded, stripped and threatened with rape. They have written to the business secretary, Vince Cable, asking him to explain why his department promoted EmSec, the Emirates Security Exhibition and Conference, which closed this weekend, and ask what checks were made that equipment on sale would not be used for torture. The government\u2019s UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) agency promotes the event on its website and hosted a reception in Dubai during the exhibition. According to UKTI, \u201cEmSec is a premier platform to showcase technologies and solutions for law enforcement and security markets. Designed to support and encourage UK exports, EmSec is hosted by the Dubai police and includes a conference, demonstrations and one-to-one meetings.\u201d In her letter to Cable, Clare Algar, executive director of Reprieve, said Zeidan\u2019s case was far from isolated. \u201cWe have worked on behalf of a number of other victims of police torture in UAE \u2013 indeed, according to our 2013 survey of Dubai central jail, over three-quarters of prisoners report having been abused following their arrest. Crucially, a significant number of the cases we have worked on report that that torture involved the use of police equipment of the kind that appears to be on sale.\u201d Algar said there was a wider principle at stake, concerning whether Britain should \u201cbe supporting without question the supply of policing equipment to a country known to torture bogus confessions out of people, including in cases where such \u2018confessions\u2019 can lead to a death sentence\u201d. She called on Cable to confirm whether his ministry or UKTI had made an assessment of \u201cwhether the equipment being supplied at EmSec could be used for torture or other human rights abuses by UAE police\u201d. \u201cIf so, could you please provide a copy of that assessment?\u201d Algar asked. \u201cAnd if not, will you commit to immediately carrying out an inquiry into this issue?\u201d UKTI said: \u201cWe take arms export responsibilities very seriously and aim to operate one of the most robust export control systems in the world. \u201cThis government supports a responsible defence and security industry that helps meet the legitimate security needs of other states. We rigorously examine every licence application on a case-by-case basis against the international exporting criteria.\u201d But Algar described the UK government\u2019s support for the event as \u201cutterly shocking given what we know about the current epidemic of police torture in the UAE.\u201d Licence applications were \u201crigorously\u201d assessed \u201con a case-by-case basis\u201d.", "title": "Vince Cable questioned over trade show sponsored by Dubai \u2018torture\u2019 police", "sentences": ["The government is under fire for encouraging British security and defence firms to attend a sales exhibition in the United Arab Emirates sponsored by the Dubai police force, which is accused of torture.", "The government\u2019s UK Trade and Investment (UKTI) agency promotes the event on its website and hosted a reception in Dubai during the exhibition.", "Designed to support and encourage UK exports, EmSec is hosted by the Dubai police and includes a conference, demonstrations and one-to-one meetings.\u201d In her letter to Cable, Clare Algar, executive director of Reprieve, said Zeidan\u2019s case was far from isolated.", "\u201cWe have worked on behalf of a number of other victims of police torture in UAE \u2013 indeed, according to our 2013 survey of Dubai central jail, over three-quarters of prisoners report having been abused following their arrest."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-01T20:45:14Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/01/dubai-tops-paris-new-york-luxury-fashion-mecca", "tags": ["Dubai", "World news", "Fashion", "Life and style"], "article": "Dubai is a city of world firsts: the tallest building, highest fountain, an airport terminal that is one of the world\u2019s largest buildings. What it can\u2019t lay claim to is global supremacy as the most popular luxury fashion magnet, because that belongs to London. Dubai is second. Let\u2019s sit with this for a moment. Surely it is inconceivable that a megalopolis in the Arabian desert is the second most popular place in the world to go shopping for fashion? What about Paris, New York, S\u00e3o Paulo? Yet there it is. One of the reasons is Dubai Mall, one of the world\u2019s largest, naturally, and as of last year said to be a global tourist destination with 80 million customer visits a year \u2013 a place where shoppers are reported to spend \u00a33bn a year, while wandering aimlessly around trying to find a way out. When the Louis Vuitton store first opened there in 2008 it sold out in a few days and had to close. The shopping centre is so big that one satirical website plausibly claimed that a man had been lost in there for 13 months. Certainly there is very little requirement to breathe anything other than filtered air in Dubai: all hotels have indoor links to the malls. They come from everywhere in the world to shop. Emiratis make up 15% of the population, the rest are local expatriates and the vast majority are visitors, a truly global blend flying in from mature and emerging markets with cash to burn and Chanel signs in their eyes. They are not coming for the prices; goods in Dubai cost roughly the same if not more than in the UK. They are coming for the retail experience. \u201cOur latest concept, our latest thinking, has to be in Dubai,\u201d says Simon Gaffey of Karen Millen, whose fifth ranking store in the world is in Dubai Mall. \u201cAll the retailers at Dubai Mall have their best and biggest stores there. It\u2019s unique because of its client mix and it resists the other factors impacting the rest of the UAEand the world.\u201d Online retail is not widespread in the United Arab Emirates. For Emiratis, Qataris, Saudis, shopping is a leisure activity, and of course the malls have restaurants, cinemas, kids\u2019 clubs. Everything you can imagine and more. Dubai\u2019s location plays a large part in its growing popularity as a fashion hub; it bridges east and west and is within four flying hours of 2.5 billion African and Chinese people. Not to mention the Russians, who Gaffey says make up 23% of their Dubai customers. To British tastes, the words Dubai and mall will conjure equal parts traditional dress \u2013 many women wear abaya and the majority of men the white kandura \u2013 seesawing with garish, blingy images of expressionless women trussed into bandage dresses tottering along on platforms. Herein lies Dubai\u2019s stumbling block in its quest to be the world\u2019s number one fashion destination \u2013 which, by the way, it aims to do by 2020. Dubai lacks fashion credibility. It doesn\u2019t figure as a trendsetting place in the popular imagination, or somewhere that caters to a creative crowd who want new labels and cult sneakers. The ruler of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid al-Maktoum, addressed this by having one of his allies, Mohammed Alabbar, who owns Dubai Mall, approach Vogue Italia. The result is the Vogue Fashion Dubai Experience, a high fashion festival created in partnership with Vogue Italia and its editor-in-chief Franca Sozzani, which closed after three days of designer talks from the likes of Alberta Ferretti and Roberto Cavalli, a new talent catwalk show, and a fundraiser for the World Food Programme featuring female musicians from around the world, including Ciara. Sozzani is as credible as it gets in fashion, and Dubai Mall is not an obvious bedfellow, so why did she say yes to the collaboration? \u201cBecause they are number one in everything, but only in a retailing way,\u201d she says. \u201cWhen you become very commercial, you miss the side that is the most important. Creativity is what makes these shops come alive. If you don\u2019t have creativity, new blood \u2026 it\u2019s like a wheel, you know, it has to go around. Otherwise you have beautiful shops but \u2026\u201d she shrugs. Sozzani\u2019s aims are disruptive. She selected 28 young designers from across the world to showcase their work to media and the public at a catwalk show on Fashion Street in Dubai Mall. It would be otherwise unfeasible for a new designer to gain exposure to a wealthy, tax-free, fashion-hungry audience. \u201cIt\u2019s about giving a possibility to the young people and participating with Mr Alabbar to help the people in Dubai mature a bit in this way. It\u2019s not important to say \u2018I\u2019m the first\u2019, for me it\u2019s important that we do, \u201d says Sozzani. In return, of course, Dubai Mall is raking in fashion kudos. Among the young designers who benefit are Sarah Angold from London, who created a special collection of gold-dipped acrylic jewellery for her showcase at the Armani Hotel at Burj Khalifa, the world\u2019s tallest building. \u201cWhat\u2019s great for my business is that we are opening up to a totally new market,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd it really is buzzing here. The consumers really appreciate luxury and creativity. People here are open to new ideas, you can feel the energy.\u201d Everyone here is talking about the energy of the place. Even Sozzani is seduced. \u201cIt has huge potential. Honestly, if I was young, I would move here for a while. I have the impression that here everything is possible.\u201d Being in Dubai is certainly an eye-opener. The financial meltdown and collapse of its property market in 2008 are a distant memory. Property prices are said to have risen 173% this year and a new mall that will take the crown from Dubai Mall when it is completed has been announced. \u201cWhen I got here 18 months ago there was never a traffic jam, but now they happen daily,\u201d says Harold Leenen, a Dubai-based banker. \u201cConstruction has started again. Property prices are not yet at pre-crisis levels, but are increasing. Hotel occupancy is at 85%, Dubai is confident. People move here, among others, because it\u2019s tax-free and now because it is booming, exciting, growing and convenient to live as opposed to other regions in the world.\u201d Far from being full of blinged-up women, the stylish women around the malls here look no different to London fashionistas, but in better clothes. And the tourists, well, they look the same everywhere. The local Emirati women wear luxury abayas with eye-popping shoes and accessories, but they are not bad taste, just very luxurious. \u201cThe preference here is for colour, and items that stand out,\u201d says Zeina El-Dana who has run an independent PR company in Dubai since 2007. \u201cBut people are more confident with fashion now than they were pre-crisis. Back then women bought what they knew, what they were comfortable with. Now they have become very sophisticated because of the internet.\u201d The clearest take-out from the Vogue Fashion Dubai Experience is that it\u2019s catering to a growing sense of culture around fashion, present in visitors from all emerging markets. Fashion has become properly global, worth $275bn a year and growing, something that comes to life when observing the melting pot of nationalities in the malls wielding shopping bags. Sozzani is constantly surprised by the fashion knowledge of people she meets. \u201cThey know everything! It\u2019s unbelievable how sometimes people know more than me, an editor who is supposed to know all these things. With Instagram, it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d", "title": "New York, Paris \u2026 Dubai.

The last two races, though, were a reminder of the possibilities, even if Toast Of New York\u2019s extraordinary run in the Classic came up a nose short of perfection. Moments later it seemed possible \u2013 likely, even \u2013 that Jamie Osborne\u2019s brave bull of a colt would get the race in the stewards\u2019 room. Bayern, who made all the running to win, caused interference to two opponents leaving the stalls, so much so that most of the Americans in the press box seemed to believe that in an ordinary race on another day Bayern would have been long odds-on to lose the race. The Classic is a $5m (\u00a33.1m) race and it costs plenty to compete, above all if you are travelling from abroad, so the rule which the stewards used to reach their decision deserves some scrutiny. It says that disqualification should result if interference causes an opponent \u201cto lose stride, ground or position in a part of the race where the horse loses the opportunity to place where it might be reasonably expected to finish\u201d.

Ground, momentum and position lost at the start can be just as significant as it is when lost at the finish, a very basic point that the stewards seem to have ignored entirely in reaching their decision. It is not simply a case of having time to catch up. Being forced to do so must compromise a horse\u2019s chance of reaching the best possible position at the finish. Yet stewards the world over do not like amending big-race results \u2013 remember the Gold Cup in March? \u2013 and it has to be said that Bayern was every bit as courageous and deserving as Toast Of New York and California Chrome in one of the great three-way finishes. Should Toast Of New York have got the race and the $2.6m prize? On any fair reading of the rules, the answer is probably yes. But while the money for second is nowhere near as good, Toast Of New York could hardly have emerged from the race with any more credit, and this, hopefully, is just the start. The British Horseracing Authority\u2019s marketing arm had been pushing the British side of the European challenge in the run-up to the meeting, trying to attract new fans by emphasising how many horses the country sends to races around the world, and how successful they are when they arrive. As it turned out, only France secured a victory, as Karakontie recorded a convincing win in the Mile with Anodin completing a 1-2 for Chantilly. Telescope, Dank and Toronado were all British-trained favourites for their races on Saturday, but they all failed to trouble the judge. While the marketing people\u2019s main focus was on the turf horses, though, they still managed to leave California with an outstanding new ally in their campaign. Toast Of New York is a magnificent racehorse in a relatively small yard who can now set out to conquer the world. The European 1-2-3 in the Mile, a race that had been won by American horses for the last three years, showed once again that, on grass, the best Europeans can always be competitive with the best Americans. But Toast Of New York\u2019s run in the Classic, a year on from War Of Attrition\u2019s close third in the same race, underlined that the right horses \u2013 in terms of pedigree, physique and action \u2013 can give America\u2019s finest a race on the dirt too. The local clockers had been admiring Toast Of New York\u2019s build, attitude and action all week and their optimism about his ability to act on dirt was not misplaced. A smart ride by Jamie Spencer certainly helped, as he got Toast Of New York out quickly and then gunned up to settle behind the leader at the turn, out of the kickback and with all options open, but it was his colt\u2019s raw talent and willing attitude which carried him so close to a historic success. He has put on 30kg in muscle since winning a tiny race at Wolverhampton by 16 lengths a year earlier, and it is quite possible that an even better Toast Of New York will line up for the Dubai World Cup, the world\u2019s richest race, in March. Now that Meydan has reverted from a synthetic surface to dirt, some of the best American middle-distance horses may be tempted by the $10m purse, but on Saturday\u2019s form, Toast Of New York will be a worthy favourite to beat them all. If he can, a campaign geared towards the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic in Keeneland in 12 months time, when the autumnal climate should favour the Europeans, would be the obvious next step. British racing did not leave Santa Anita with a winner at this year\u2019s Breeders\u2019 Cup, but it returned with a new hero instead. That, in the long run, could prove to be much more valuable.", "title": "Toast Of New York creates fairytale despite Breeders\u2019 Cup cruel twist", "sentences": ["He has put on 30kg in muscle since winning a tiny race at Wolverhampton by 16 lengths a year earlier, and it is quite possible that an even better Toast Of New York will line up for the Dubai World Cup, the world\u2019s richest race, in March."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-02T18:36:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/02/jamie-osborne-toast-of-new-york-breeders-cup-inquiry", "tags": ["Breeders' Cup", "US sports", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": " Jamie Osborne, the trainer of the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic runner-up, Toast Of New York, said on Sunday that his colt may never race in Great Britain again now that he has established himself as one of the world\u2019s best dirt horses. The $10m Dubai World Cup in March will be run on dirt for the first time since 2009, and Toast Of New York is the new favourite to win the world\u2019s richest race after finishing a nose behind Bayern and just ahead of California Chrome, the Kentucky Derby winner, in Saturday\u2019s Classic. \u201cI think the obvious thing to do with him for the next couple of years if he stays sound, God willing, is to top and tail his season with the Dubai World Cup and the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cWhat you do in between is the bit to debate, but I\u2019d say it\u2019s unlikely he\u2019ll run in England now. It\u2019s very exciting to have him and yesterday he basically booked his future on the international stage. We can be reasonably confident that we can take him anywhere and compete in these kind of races. \u201cPart of the reason for coming here was to ascertain whether or not dirt was a big no-no for him, and to me, he looked like a horse that had been running on it all his life, he just looked totally at ease on it. His style, that pace that he\u2019s got to travel up there and grind, all those thoughts that we had about him that he had the style of a dirt horse turned out to be true.\u201d It was so nearly a perfect send-off for his jockey Jamie Spencer, who plans to retire in the coming weeks. There was a chance that Toast Of New York might be awarded the race in the stewards\u2019 room, as a subsequent inquiry studied interference caused by Bayern to horses on his inside when he veered to his left leaving the stalls. The officials confirmed the result, however, having decided that the interference had not reduced the chance of those affected achieving the best possible placing. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough about the rules here, I would only be taking my lead from people that know a bit more and clearly there\u2019s an element of doubt in the decision from what I hear,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cBut that\u2019s out of our control and it\u2019s happened and you\u2019ve just got to trust each jurisdiction that they apply the rules as they should be applied.\u201d \u201cI think first and foremost it\u2019s a relief that we\u2019ve been vindicated in our decision to come in this direction. If you\u2019re beaten a few inches in a race, you think, what if there had been slightly different circumstances, a different draw, different fractions, it could have been different. But the reality is that it wasn\u2019t, so we\u2019re just thankful that he\u2019s run his race and we\u2019re happy with that. \u201cI watched it again a few times last night and I thought that even if I was watching it completely impartially, it would be one of the greatest horse races I\u2019ve ever watched. It was great to be a part of it.\u201d At Carlisle on Sunday, Holywell, the ante-post joint-favourite for the Gold Cup at Cheltenham in March, could finish only third behind Many Clouds on his seasonal debut in the Colin Parker Memorial Intermediate Chase. Jonjo O\u2019Neill\u2019s seven-year-old took the Grade One Mildmay Novice Chase at Aintree in April but needed the race on his first run since and faded in the closing stages to finish 15 lengths behind the runner-up Eduard, who battled it out with Many Clouds after jumping the last before going down by a length-and-a-quarter. Many Clouds finished fourth, beaten just over 20 lengths, in the Mildmay, but Oliver Sherwood, his trainer, believes he has improved significantly over the summer. \u201cHe\u2019s a man of a horse this year,\u201d Sherwood said. \u201cHe was only a teenager last season. I thought when he was brought down in the RSA [at Cheltenham in March] that it might be a blessing in disguise as we were planning to for the Hennessy [at Newbury in November] and the handicapper wouldn\u2019t be able to put him up. \u201cHaving come here, I\u2019m a bit worried what the handicapper might do.

Brought excellent form to Australia \u2013 notably a close-up fourth in the 2013 Japan Cup and a second to the brilliant Gold Ship \u2013 but the entire\u2019s stocks lifted even further with his stunning Caulfield Cup win. Promoted to favourite on the back of that and every reason to think 3200m around the wide expanses of Flemington will suit better. His 0.5kg penalty for winning at Caulfield takes his impost to 58.5kg, and you have to go as far back as 1975 and Think Big for the last horse to carry that weight to victory. Still rates as the horse to beat. Odds: $5   Cavalryman  Godolphin UK inmate who is having his second attempt at the Melbourne Cup following a respectable midfield finish in 2012. That is reason to enough to doubt his chances on Tuesday, but Cavalryman seems in better form this time around. Was very good winning the Goodwood Cup over two miles two starts back; third in that race was Brown Panther, who ran very well in Fiorente\u2019s cup last year. Nine-year-olds as a rule don\u2019t win the Melbourne Cup, but stable has gone very close in the past to winning the cup and this horse is in form, likes the trip and is well-drawn. Reluctant to rule out entirely, but a place does look his best hope. Odds: $26   Fawkner  Ultra-consistent type who is attempting to stretch his brilliance to 3200m for the second time after registering a fine sixth in the 2013 renewal. Has always been a top performer but has taken his form to new level this spring, winning the Caulfield Stakes at weight-for-age before running a gallant second to Adelaide in the Cox Plate. The seven-year-old loves Flemington, won\u2019t mind it wet or dry and is tactically versatile, so from gate nine has the option to go forward or back. Probably the best of the local hopes, but the nagging doubt is his ability to run out a strong two miles. Back him on both totes. Odds: $8.50   Red Cadeaux  Ed Dunlop\u2019s international visitor has become a fixture at Flemington on the first Tuesday in November and this year will be lining up in his fourth Melbourne Cup. Has been runner-up in the race twice previously, beaten a lip by Dunaden in 2011 before running into Fiorente at big odds last year. Red Cadeaux has to defy the nine-year-olds hoodoo and his lead-up form is anything but inspiring, but he has turned it around suddenly before and has developed a habit of peaking for this race. Given the gelding\u2019s run well in the race before he\u2019s a must for trifectas and first fours, but it would be a surprise were he to emerge victorious. Odds: $17.00   Protectionist  An intriguing runner bidding to become the first German-trained winner of the Melbourne Cup. Has only had nine starts so is very unexposed, but brings excellent form into the race all the same; is a multiple winner at pattern level, most recently in the Group 2 Prix Kergolay over 3000m at Deauville \u2013 the same race Americain won in 2010 before taking out the Melbourne Cup. Importantly, the five-year-old has had a preparation run in Australia, running on very well for fourth under 59kg in the Group 2 Herbert Power at Caulfield a little over three weeks ago. Expect him to come on greatly for that run. Has Cox Plate-winning jockey Ryan Moore aboard, is well drawn, seems fairly weighted and will handle the trip, so there\u2019s a great deal to like about his chances. Definite winning hope. Odds: $7.50   Seismos  An international visitor from the Newmarket yard of Marco Botti, Seismos is a Group 1 winner over 2400m in Germany and a Group 3 winner of the Geoffrey Freer at Newbury two starts back. Is having his second start in Australia, but will need to improve markedly on his 15th in the Caulfield Cup to figure here. Looks a dour staying type so Seismos should find the line well enough, but doesn\u2019t appear endowed with tactical speed so from barrier one it\u2019s likely he\u2019ll be midfield or worse on the rails and tapped for toe when the pace starts to quicken mid-race. A rough place chance but no better. Odds: $26  Junoob  Represents the all-conquering Chris Waller stable and that is reason enough to respect him. Certainly one of the race\u2019s in-form runners, having won the Group 1 Metropolitan two starts back before not appearing to handle the track but still running well when seventh behind Admire Rakti in the Melbourne Cup. Meets that horse just half a kilogram better off at the weights for a beating of a little over two lengths, so would seem hard pressed to turn the tables on measures alone. Another knock is the fact no horse has won the Metropolitan-Melbourne Cup double since Macdougal in 1959. There also has to be some query over Junoob at two miles, so though he may run well it\u2019s hard to rate him a genuine winning chance. Odds: $26  Royal Diamond     Royal Diamond is one of two runners trained by former top jockey Johnny Murtagh. Photograph: Patrick Scala/Getty Images     One of two runners trained by former top jockey Johnny Murtagh, Royal Diamond is one of three horses in 2014 attempting to become the first nine-year-old to win the Melbourne Cup. His form at home has been patchy at best, finishing well down the track in the Ascot Gold Cup over 4000m before rounding off his preparations with a distant sixth in the Irish St Leger (a race he won in 2012). Has won at the trip and is well drawn, but they are the only positives surrounded by a swathe of negatives. Odds: $51  Gatewood  Trained in England by John Gosden, Gatewood is no stranger to Australian racing having won the Geelong Cup in 2012 before a brief and unsuccessful campaign with Chris Waller last year. Nothing wrong with his recent form, having finished no further back than second in six starts this year (three wins), but he\u2019s been racing on rain-affected going and is likely to encounter quicker conditions at Flemington. The owners, OTI Racing, have said Gatewood is the pick of their four runners, but he\u2019s untried a the trip, is drawn wide in barrier 22 and seems to lack the turn of foot required to win a Melbourne Cup. Odds: $67  Mutual Regard  Johnny Murtagh\u2019s other runner and clearly his better chance of victory. Is a remarkably consistent steed, having missed a place just three times in 17 lifetime starts (seven wins). Was quietly taken through his grades in England and Ireland before hitting a career peak when winning the rich Ebor Handicap at York at his most recent outing. No horse has won the Ebor-Melbourne Cup double though it has proven a fair guide over the years, with both Give The Slip (2001) and Purple Moon (2007) running second here after winning at York. Has only raced on good ground and he\u2019ll get that at Flemington on Tuesday. Is in form, well drawn in 12, has multiple cup winner Damien Oliver doing the steering and is a winner over 3200m, so Mutual Regard ticks plenty of boxes. Rates highly. Odds: $13  Who Shot Thebarman  Another of Chris Waller\u2019s and another of his imports, having been transferred to Sydney from New Zealand after an unsuccessful raid on the Sydney Cup back in April. Was well performed in his homeland, winning a string of good races including the Auckland Cup over 3200m. His tame effort behind The Offer when fancied in the Sydney Cup pours cold water on his chances here, but Waller seems to have taken this galloper\u2019s form to another level this campaign. Won two consecutive races at Flemington, including the Group 3 Bart Cummings over 2500m, before flopping when 13th in the Caulfield Cup, though he was found to have respiratory issues so can be forgiven that failure. Back to Flemington is a positive and from gate 13 Glen Boss should be able to find a good spot for Who Shot Thebarman, so is one of the more likely outsiders. Odds: $26  Willing Foe  The other Godolphin entrant from Saeed Bin Suroor\u2019s UK yard, Willing Foe is a lightly raced eight-year-old whose form ties in closely with some of the other raiders, having finished second behind Seismos in the Geoffrey Freer at Newbury (Red Cadeaux was fourth) before last start finishing fourth in a messy Irish St Leger (Royal Diamond sixth). Is having his first go at two miles (though he did win the 2012 Ebor Handicap over 2816m) and on recent form doesn\u2019t look good enough, but this stable has done very well with similar types in the past so it would be unwise to dismiss his chances. Big odds but a forward showing wouldn\u2019t surprise. Odds: $26  My Ambivalent  One of three participants representing the fairer sex, which has accounted for 16 victories in the Melbourne Cup (Makybe Diva in 2005 was the most recent). My Ambivalent brings layers of quality international form into the race, having finished a close-up third behind Japanese superstar Gentildonna at level weights in the Dubai Sheema Classic over 2400m in March and more recently placing in the Group 1 Coronation Cup at Epsom. Has been off the scene since June and worryingly had a setback which saw the mare miss her lead-up run in the Caulfield Cup. An interrupted preparation for a race of this nature is a genuine cause for concern and it really is guesswork that she will run out 3200m, so place looks best. Odds: $41  Precedence  Another nine-year-old and, along with Red Cadeaux, another lining up for a fourth assault on the Melbourne Cup. Precedence is thoroughly exposed and hasn\u2019t managed to run a place in his three previous attempts in the race. There\u2019s little to get excited about in his lead-up form, too, with a running-on fifth in the JRA Cup at Moonee Valley two starts back the pick of his recent runs. Trained by Cups king Bart Cummings (and now James Cummings, too), so inevitably will get some support on the day, but a midfield finish is the absolute best connections can hope for. Odds: $101   Brambles     Admire Rakti is one of the favourites for the big race. Photograph: Patrick Scala/Getty Images     Trained by Peter Moody (of Black Caviar fame), Brambles is a former winner of the Queensland Derby but is having his best preparation this time around. Beat Signoff four starts back over 1700m at Flemington before running third at the track in the Group 1 Turnbull Stakes, followed by a creditable fourth in the Caulfield Cup when beaten just over a length. No more than a pipe-opener when ninth in the Mackinnon Stakes on Saturday, so on form Brambles has a chance but he\u2019s drawn very wide in gate 21 and there must be a question mark over his ability to stay two miles at this level. Could run a brave race but can\u2019t see him winning. Odds: $41   Mr O\u2019Ceirin  One of the locals trying to repel the strong overseas invasion, but it\u2019s really hard to get enthused about this one. Seems to have been up a very long time and there\u2019s nothing in his form that suggests you should back him in a Melbourne Cup. Suspect at the two miles and has never won on the good going he\u2019s likely to encounter on Tuesday. A great big \u2018NO\u2019. Odds: $151   Au Revoir  Trained in France by master handler Andre Fabre, earning this horse respect points on that basis alone. Is a lightly raced five-year-old, having had just 14 starts, and wasn\u2019t far away when fourth behind the very well-performed Ruler Of The World at Longchamp before venturing out to Australia. Has had the one local run, running a gutsy third in the Group 2 Moonee Valley Cup after leading. Likely to find Flemington more to his liking and though he\u2019s never been tried over 3200m, it wouldn\u2019t be a shock if he handled the journey. Has been done no favours by the barrier draw, but with a kind run Au Revoir is capable of filling a hole at odds. Odds: $41  Lidari  Another of Peter Moody\u2019s, Lidari has had a classic preparation for the Melbourne Cup, running with distinction in the Underwood Stakes (at weight-for-age), Turnbull Stakes and Caulfield Cup \u2013 all at Group 1 level. His form ties in nicely around fancied runner Lucia Valentina, having been beaten a half a length by that mare in the Turnbull; he now meets her one-and-a-half kilograms better at the weights in this race. It\u2019s been a little while since he\u2019s won and he\u2019s not certain to relish 3200m, but he\u2019s well drawn in barrier 10, lightly weighted and in good form, so capable of running well at decent odds. Odds: $41   Opinion  Another of Chris Waller\u2019s imports, Opinion is no stranger at two miles having run second (though well beaten) to The Offer in the Sydney Cup earlier this year. Has been going along well enough this preparation without winning, his close second to Junoob in the Metropolitan his best run this time in. His fifth in the Moonee Valley Cup when favourite was disappointing on face value, but Flemington will suit better and stamina does look to be his forte so prepared to afford him a rough place chance at a big price. Opinion\u2019s chances would be enhanced by a spot or two of rain, but that seems unlikely. Odds: $67   Araldo  This sparingly raced seven-year-old (15 starts) has been brought along steadily this campaign and looks to be peaking for this run. Nothing at all wrong with his lead-up form, including strong running-on efforts in the Metropolitan and Caulfield Cup. Outside of Admire Rakti his was arguably the run of the race at Caulfield. Has never raced at 3200m but has won at 2800m and is certainly bred to appreciate the marathon journey. The big drawback is his draw on the extreme outside; jockey Dwayne Dunn will have no option but to drop back and hope for luck as he tries to pinch runs. Trainer Mike Moroney won the cup with Brew in 2000 from a similarly bad draw, and if the breaks go Araldo\u2019s way he can bely his position in the market. Odds: $21  Lucia Valentina  A leading local contender and one of just three mares in the Melbourne Cup, Lucia Valentina has been near the top of the market ever since resuming with a stunning victory in the Group 2 Tramway Stakes over 1400m at Randwick in September. The four-year-old\u2019s been very good since then, too, running on strongly to beat Lidari in the Turnbull before producing an eye-catching performance to swoop into third place in the Caulfield Cup. She was taking ground off Admire Rakti late in that race, so her supporters will be optimistic of her staying two miles at the first time of asking. The fact remains, however, that she\u2019s never won past 2000m. Has a good alley in number two and brings the right form into the race so must be given a chance, but not sure she represents value at the current price. Odds: $7   Unchain My Heart  Cemented her place in the line-up when Green Moon was scratched on Saturday morning, meaning trainer David Hayes (and Tom Dabernig) could scratch from the Lexus Stakes and focus on the Melbourne Cup. Well beaten in the Caulfield Cup and there\u2019s nothing in her prior form to suggest this eight-year-old is capable of winning a Melbourne Cup. Thus she will start at massive odds, but it must be said there are some factors in her favour: she loves Flemington (four wins at the track), will get a good run from barrier five, will get the firm going she needs and stays all day (is two from three at 3200m). So while class is an obvious issue, don\u2019t be surprised if Unchain My Heart finishes in front of some of her more-fancied rivals. Odds: $201   Signoff  Rocketed into Melbourne Cup calculations with an impressive victory in Saturday\u2019s Lexus Stakes, the same race Shocking won in 2009 before annexing the big one the following Tuesday. Like Shocking, Signoff was very strong at the end of 2500m and gets into the Melbourne Cup with a luxurious weight of just 51kg. He\u2019s been taken along slowly this preparation by trainer Darren Weir with one race in mind, so there\u2019s a sense of timing about Signoff and undoubtedly he will be at his peak in the cup. With just 13 starts under his belt (for seven wins) it\u2019s unlikely we\u2019ve seen the best of him yet, so as a lightly raced stayer on the way up he deserves the utmost respect. Will push forward from barrier 16 under star international jockey Joao Moreira and is sure to give his backers a great sight.

Yildiz, the new owner, promised it would invest in the Middlesex-based firm, which has a 4,600-strong domestic workforce, with the chairman, Murat \u00dclker, tweeting: \u201cUnited Biscuits is our new star.\u201d In a statement, he added: \u201cWe want to grow United Biscuits to be a global player as part of Yildiz. This will include enhancing its position in the UK, where Yildiz currently has minimal presence, so we will continue to invest in the UK and Europe.\u201d Yildiz, which owns Belgium\u2019s Godiva Chocolate, is thought to have fought off competition from Kellogg\u2019s in the US and rival biscuit maker Burton\u2019s. United Biscuits employs about 7,100 people in total with about 4,600 in the UK at sites including London, Manchester, Carlisle, Glasgow, Halifax, Liverpool and Leicestershire. The sale of United \u2013 whose brands include Jacob\u2019s, Twiglets, Mini Cheddars, and Carr\u2019s \u2013 will deliver a substantial payday for its private equity owners, Blackstone and PAI Partners, which teamed up to buy the business for \u00a31.6bn in 2006. Two years ago United sold off its KP Snacks arm for more than \u00a3500m to the German group Intersnack, and the deal with Yildiz brings to an end a lengthy exit for the owners who, at one point, favoured floating the company on the stock exchange. \u201cUnited Biscuits is a great business and has been an excellent investment for us,\u201d said Lionel Assant, European head of private equity at Blackstone. \u201cYildiz is the best home for the company and will allow [United Biscuits] to fulfil its international growth ambitions.\u201d The existing management team, led by chief executive Martin Glenn, is to remain in place. \u201cWe look forward to being part of Yildiz as we continue to fulfil our growth potential both in the UK and abroad where we are looking to expand our share of the biscuit and snacking markets and where there is huge potential for all our brands.\u201d \u00dclker, whose father and uncle founded the business in 1944, owns the biscuit and chocolate company Ulker Biskuvi Sanayi but also makes drinks, dairy products and frozen foods. Istanbul-based Yildiz remains privately owned with estimated sales of $7bn last year. The deal combines two businesses with complementary geographical footprints as at present Yildiz has a minimal presence in the UK \u2013 where United Biscuits is the market leader \u2013 but a strong presence in North America, the Middle East and North Africa, as well as China and Japan. The deal was cautiously welcomed by union officials. Rhys McCarthy, national officer for the Unite union, said: \u201cToday\u2019s news ends a period of speculation over United Biscuits and we trust will lead to a future of certainty for the workforce that makes some of the nation\u2019s favourite biscuits. \u201cOver the coming weeks we will be seeking assurances from the new owners about the workforce and new investment to ensure that United Biscuits remains a market leader. \u201cWe will also be seeking assurances that there will be no change in the respectful relations we have with management and that the new Turkish owners recognise the important role that independent trade unions play at United Biscuits.\u201d The topic of foreign takeover of UK snack companies is a thorny issue following the acquisition of UK chocolate maker Cadbury by the US cheese slice group Kraft in 2010. The American firm pledged there would be no compulsory redundancies in manufacturing for two years \u2013 but a year later said that 200 jobs would have to go. Kraft subsequently spun off its snacks business \u2013 which included Cadbury \u2013 into a new business called Mondelez International. Other recent deals include Tyrrells, the upmarket crisps brand that began as a sideline for a struggling Herefordshire potato farm, which was sold for \u00a3100m last year to Dubai-based luxury brands investor Investcorp. Meanwhile, in February, the sausage snack Peperami was sold to US meat snacks firm Jack Link\u2019s by consumer goods giant Unilever, which in recent years has also sold Skippy peanut butter, its frozen meal businesses in the US, and the UK and Irish rights to cooking sauces Chicken Tonight and Ragu. Digested biscuits  The sale of United Biscuits is the latest chapter in the two-century history of a company that was formed in 1948 with the merger of two Scottish family firms dating back to the early 19th century \u2013 Edinburgh\u2019s McVitie &amp; Price and Glasgow\u2019s MacFarlane Lang. McVitie\u2019s had begun producing the digestive biscuit in 1892, adding chocolate in 1925. The Jaffa Cake began life in 1927. During the first world war, the firm was asked by the government to use its knowledge and production facilities to supply \u201ciron ration\u201d plain biscuits. After United was created in 1948, the firm expanded at home and abroad, with acquisitions including Terry\u2019s of York \u2013 later sold. In 2000 it was bought by Finalrealm, a consortium of investors. Blackstone and PAI bought United for \u00a31.6bn in 2006.", "title": "Jaffa Cakes and McVitie\u2019s maker sold to Turkish food group in \u00a32bn deal", "sentences": ["Other recent deals include Tyrrells, the upmarket crisps brand that began as a sideline for a struggling Herefordshire potato farm, which was sold for \u00a3100m last year to Dubai-based luxury brands investor Investcorp."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-03T20:40:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/04/protectionist-wins-melbourne-cup-2014", "tags": ["Melbourne Cup", "Horse racing", "Australia sport", "Melbourne", "Sport"], "article": "The 154th running of the Melbourne Cup has gone to Germany, with Protectionist bolting away to win by three lengths. But the race was soured by news that the pre-race favourite Admire Rakti died in his stalls after finishing last. A second horse, Araldo, was later put down after breaking a leg. In one of the more emphatic Cup wins of recent times, English jockey Ryan Moore turned in a peach of a ride to save ground, avoid traffic, peel off the tiring horses and steer Protectionist to victory.  The remarkable Red Cadeaux, who hit the lead in the straight, was runner up for the third time. The frequent flyer, who has competed in Japan, Dubai, Hong Kong and the UK, always saves his best for Melbourne but once again found a better competitor on the day. Who Shot Thebarman ran third and Signoff fourth.  In his fourth start in the race, Precedence finished a credible sixth for the grandfather/grandson training combination of Bart and James Cummings.  A five year old, Protectionist is one of the most inexperienced horses to win a Melbourne Cup. Tuesday was just his 10th race start. But his form was strong, having taken out the Prix Kergorlay - a 3000m race in France, considered one of the strongest overseas betting guides. When he flashed home for fourth in the Herbert Power Stakes, bookmakers kept him safe, sending him out at 8-1 for the Cup. He had the perfect barrier, the right jockey and conditions to suit  The usual pre-race bedlam and high winds seemed to get to Protectionist but once the gates opened he relaxed and settled as good stayers do. In the final furlong, he was the only horse lengthening his stride. Moore, as understated as ever described the win as \u201ca pretty good feeling\u201d. In little under a fortnight, the globetrotting jockey has pinched Australia\u2019s two most esteemed races, the Melbourne Cup and the Cox Plate. Trainer Andreas Wohler was a little more effusive, declaring he and connections would celebrate long into the night. Kris Lees, whose great hope Lucia Valentina wasn\u2019t a factor in the race, will take over the training duties with Protectionist, starting on Wednesday. But the 2014 Melbourne Cup may well be remembered for all the wrong reasons. The old racing adage \u2018weight stops a train\u2019 proved true in the case of Japan\u2019s Admire Rakti. A noted swooper and lugging 58.5kg, the favourite surprisingly raced handy to the speed but was under pressure 800 metres from home. Less than 20 minutes later, one of the grandest stayers in the world was pronounced dead. An autopsy will be held at quarantine headquarters at Werribee.  \u201cIt\u2019s a shame. We had such a nice, clean-run Melbourne Cup,\u201d the chief steward, Terry Bailey said. Racing Victoria\u2019s chief vet, Brian Stewart, told Fairfax Media that Admire Rakti died from a heart attack or internal bleeding. He added that such a death would occur in the death of only around 0.0075% of race horses.  \u201cIrregular heartbeat, which progresses to a condition, called ventricular fibrillation, which means the heart beats in a bad rhythm and is similar to a heart attack in simple terms,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cIt happens very, very rarely. Ventricular fibrillation of the heart in racehorses can be stress related. Adrenalin plays a role.\u201d Ward Young, a spokesman for the Coalition for the Protection of Racehorses, condemned the death. \u201cWe are distraught to learn of another horse dying at the Melbourne Cup,\u201d Ward said. \u201cThese events are more common then we would like to believe.\u201d Seventh-placed Araldo became spooked by the rowdy crowd following the race, fracturing a cannon bone. He was taken for surgery but vets were forced to put him down. The horse\u2019s trainer, Michael Moroney, said Araldo was startled by a member of the crowd waving a flag.  \u201cThey\u2019ve run 150 Melbourne Cups and nothing like that has happened before,\u201d said Moroney. \u201cIt\u2019s shattering for my owners, my staff and myself. We have just lost a great young stayer who was lightly raced and had just run seventh in the Cup. My staff are shattered. Everyone here is sticking together. We don\u2019t blame anyone.\u201d", "title": "Protectionist wins Melbourne Cup 2014 but two horses die", "sentences": ["The frequent flyer, who has competed in Japan, Dubai, Hong Kong and the UK, always saves his best for Melbourne but once again found a better competitor on the day."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-04T04:08:23Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/04/ryan-moore-melbourne-cup-win-protectionist", "tags": ["Melbourne Cup", "Ryan Moore", "Horse racing", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "article": "Two previous Melbourne Cup reverses had left segments of the Australian media \u2013 and many racing fans here too \u2013 less than impressed with the skills and talent of Tuesday\u2019s winning rider Ryan Moore. For all of his success and prowess on the world stage, the fact he had failed aboard Mount Athos and Dandino in their A$6.2m feature event meant he was worthy of castigation. The tide began to turn somewhat when he flew into Australia a little under two weeks ago for his first ride at the tight Moonee Valley track, not too dissimilar to Chester where an outside draw can be race-ending before the stalls have opened. On that occasion he defied stall 13 of 14 to land the Cox Plate \u2013 their premier weight-for-age race \u2013 with a daring dash around the field aboard the appropriately named Adelaide. But if the tide was to change slightly on that occasion, a tsunami ripped through Flemington on Tuesday as he brought the German-trained Protectionist from the back of the field to leave 21 rivals in his wake. The win was the 31-year-old\u2019s 19th Group One race victory in the last 12 months, with those wins having been achieved in eight countries and on four different continents. While Richard Hughes relaxed at home in Britain with another champion jockey title under his belt, Moore spurned the chance to be crowned leading rider for a fourth time in favour of chasing the world\u2019s biggest prizes. That hunt has seen him capture two races worth over \u00a33m to the winner in the space of 10 days, but the ever quiet and modest jockey is keen to stand behind the achievements of the horse. When told he would go down in Australian racing history following the Cox Plate victory, he replied: \u201cThe horse might, but I won\u2019t,\u201d and it was a similar story following his win in Tuesday\u2019s Melbourne Cup. While returning with a broad smile in his royal blue, black and white colours, Moore was certainly proud of his achievements, but remained grounded. \u201cI rode two very good horses. I am lucky to be riding them. You take your chances when they are good enough and it is all you can do,\u201d was his cool assessment of his Cox Plate-Melbourne Cup double. \u201cRacing is a leveller. I wouldn\u2019t put the win above an Arc or a Derby but it is not behind them either,\u201d he added. \u201cI thought I would have a couple of winners at the Breeders\u2019 Cup [last weekend] but that never happened. I was pretty keen on my rides [in America] and thought I would have a good day there on the Saturday but they all got turned over, and that is racing for you. Some days it works for you and others it doesn\u2019t. Today it has.\u201d That pragmatic approach has been part of Moore\u2019s success and so has his dedication to the cause. Shrewd Australian racing brains realised Moore had put in an inordinate amount of homework before the Cox Plate and he again had studied each and every runner ahead of the Melbourne Cup. \u201cFortunately I knew a lot of the horses coming into the race but I had to get to know some of the local horses who I wouldn\u2019t have seen so I have been watching plenty of races,\u201d he said. \u201cThere weren\u2019t too many horses in the field who looked as though they were still progressing. We felt this horse had the potential to be better than he had been showing and he has found the extra.\u201d That dedication is seen through his commitment to racing. After riding in the Cox Plate on the Saturday he jetted to Los Angeles for the Breeders\u2019 Cup meeting before flying back to Melbourne. From here he goes to Japan for seven weeks, then on to Hong Kong, before returning to Japan and arriving home on Christmas Eve \u2013 no doubt to the delight of his partner and three young children. \u201cI\u2019ve got to thank Michelle at home because I\u2019ve been away a lot. You need to win these races for it to be worthwhile,\u201d said the non-drinking, non-smoking Moore. The jockey was taken to task for once describing an Oaks win at Epsom as \u201cnot a Derby\u201d but it is these worldwide events which motivate the Sussex-born rider. He once named the Kentucky Derby, Melbourne Cup, Japan Cup and Dubai World Cup as the races he would like to win but had not. He has since triumphed in Japan and Melbourne but while most Australians would give an arm to win a Cup, a race so engrained in their country\u2019s culture and psyche, Moore failed to elevate his victory above other achievements during his glittering career. \u201cThis is similar to winning the Cox Plate,\u201d he explained. \u201cFrom a purist\u2019s point of view it [the Cox Plate] is the most important weight-for-age race in Australia \u2013 it is like a King George or an Arc. This is a race a bit like the Grand National at home where the whole country is taken up by it, but this and the Cox Plate are both important and I couldn\u2019t split them.\u201d Moore, along with the winning trainer Andreas Wohler, addressed the 100,000-strong crowd from the winner\u2019s podium in Victoria \u2013 in which the raceday remains a State bank holiday \u2013 before riding in the next event. After showering and changing he came to a press conference to be addressed for 10 minutes by the racing media, before being whisked away for television and radio interviews that will stretch on long into the night. While appearing a taciturn character on occasion on lesser British racedays, the contentment of a job well done at the top level would appear to be one of his motivating factors. \u201cWith racing the good days are hard to come by and there are plenty of bad days so you just keep going,\u201d said Moore in the press conference. \u201cDon\u2019t get too excited and look for the next disappointment. I always find with racing that sometimes things will really work out for you and sometimes they won\u2019t. \u201cI just try and keep as levelheaded as I can and hope that things work out \u2013 try and get the horses relaxed and comfortable and try and find a clear path. If connections at home have a horse good enough to run here and they want me to ride then I am delighted to come. It depends where you are needed and if you are needed you go.\u201d With his bulging Group One haul over the last 12 months, and a growing fan base in Australia, Moore is likely to be in greater demand than ever.", "title": "Ryan Moore\u2019s Melbourne Cup win is coming of age for world-class jockey | Martin Kelly", "sentences": ["He once named the Kentucky Derby, Melbourne Cup, Japan Cup and Dubai World Cup as the races he would like to win but had not."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-04T11:55:56Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/nov/05/live-racing-wednesday-5-november-2014", "tags": ["Horse racing tips", "Horse racing", "Sport"], "article": "11.45am Gold Cup winner Windermere set for Durkan return Tony Paley: Jim Culloty has vowed to have Lord Windermere as fit as possible for the Cheltenham Gold Cup winner\u2019s planned reappearance in the John Durkan Memorial Chase at Punchestown on December 7. \u201cI\u2019m very happy with him and the John Durkan is the plan,\u201d Culloty said. \u201cIt\u2019s a slightly inadequate trip, but he\u2019ll be fit and well. It\u2019s his first run, so we\u2019ll see how we go. \u201cThen it will be on to the Lexus, Irish Hennessy, the Gold Cup, that kind of plan at the moment. He\u2019ll be as fit as I can get him. It\u2019s a Grade One, so it\u2019s probably going to be a hard race. They need to be fit in order to take those races. It\u2019s 22 days to the Lexus after that, so you need to be fit going there. It\u2019s December 7, so hopefully the ground will be softish and safe. That\u2019s the main thing.\u201d Meanwhile, Culloty is concentrating on a crack at the Crabbie\u2019s Grand National with Spring Heeled. The seven-year-old is likely to have two prep runs before heading to Aintree for the world\u2019s greatest steeplechase on April 11. The Mallow trainer revealed last season\u2019s Kim Muir winner at the Cheltenham Festival had returned to training this week after a break following his fourth place behind Road To Riches in the Galway Plate. \u201cHe ran a blinder in Galway and the form has worked out great,\u201d Culloty told At The Races. We put him away with a view of going for the Grand National. He runs well fresh and we have to mind his handicap mark. He started back quietly on Monday and he\u2019ll probably get a run in February and run somewhere in March and on to Liverpool.\u201d Today\u2019s best bets, by Chris Cook The British Horseracing Authority has confirmed the jaw-dropping news that broke last night, that its next chief executive is a career bookmaker who has served 18 years with Ladbrokes over two stints. Clearly there is going to be some controversy about that, to put it very mildly indeed, and I\u2019d be interested in hearing any views that all of you may have. On a cheerier note, I see from this morning\u2019s Racing Post that Red Cadeaux is now sixth on the all-time prizemoney list of European-based racehorses, having gone past Sea The Stars and Goldikova on Tuesday morning by running second in the Melbourne Cup for the third time. That was worth another \u00a3483,000, taking him to more than \u00a34.5m for his career. Less than a fifth of his total earnings has come from races he actually won. He\u2019s bagged a lot more by making the frame in some of the world\u2019s most valuable contests, having also been second in a Dubai World Cup and a Coronation Cup, third in Japan\u2019s Tenno Sho and third and fourth in two runnings of the Hong Kong Vase. He hasn\u2019t actually won for more than two years and he\u2019s a gelding without stud prospects, which is why he\u2019s been campaigned so widely. He is not, therefore, one of your glamorous types. But it takes a horse of exceptional fortitude and grit to hold his form after 47 races and endless hours on flights all round the globe. He has not been blessed with the sort of natural ability that would make racing an easy experience for him. It is a hard slog every time he takes on some top-class rivals in their own back yards but every time he puts his head down and gets on with it. Red Cadeaux should be a poster horse for those of us who would like to see Flat racers run more often and more ambitiously. He is a magnificent animal and it is pleasing to hear that he will be around for at least another year. Odds-on in novice chases is not my normal way of doing things but Grumeti (2.30) appeals even at 10-11 at Warwick today. He has already shown he can do this job, after all, by whizzing around Bangor\u2019s chase course in May, and his achievements over hurdles suggest he could take high rank over the larger obstacles. Alan King, his trainer, won this race last year with Balder Succes, who, like Grumeti, was carrying a penalty for a previous chase success. Grumeti\u2019s main rival is chasing debutant Vibrato Valtat, an animal with quite a bit of unexposed talent. Alas, the reason it remains unexposed is because he seems a bit reluctant to reveal it. \u201cHe travels but finds nothing off the bridle,\u201d his trainer has said. There will certainly be opportunities for Vibrato over fences but the suspicion remains that, if he can\u2019t win easily, then he won\u2019t win at all and I fear we might see some more of the latter behaviour today. Thomas Crapper is the other promising beast in this field but I think we\u2019ll see the best of him over fences when he\u2019s stepped up in trip. Philip Hobbs is the man in form just now and I\u2019ll give another chance to his Trickaway (1.30) in the earlier novice handicap chase. He was fancied for a similar race at Huntingdon last month but made life hard for himself with some hesitant leaps and got tired. He should know a bit more and, although he has form on deep going, a drier surface today might help him with his jumping. You can get 9-2, whereas he was evens for a more valuable contest last time.

His decision to stand down after nine years in office, as revealed by the Guardian on Wednesday, has been confirmed by the Tour. The 65-year-old, who will assist with the search for his successor and subsequently take on an ambassadorial role, will speak publicly and at length about his tenure before the DP World Tour Championship in Dubai this month. \u201cIt is a shame that George is stepping down,\u201d said Justin Rose, on the eve of the HSBC-WGC Champions tournament in Shanghai. \u201cBut I think he\u2019s had a good reign, he\u2019s had a lengthy reign, obviously, at the top. There\u2019s no doubt there have been challenges. The economy and the markets in which the European Tour has been involved have been difficult, mainland Europe especially, so there\u2019s been some challenges. \u201cJust in recent times one of the things I\u2019ve been talking to George about is trying to get some of the historic events back on the European Tour; the British Masters, for example, stuff like that. As he rolls out of his position hopefully tournaments like that will come back on to the calendar and he can take some credit for that.\u201d Another challenge has been keeping peace among Tour members. The Final Series, which is now under way for a second year, earlier received criticism from leading players because of scheduling demands so late in the season. O\u2019Grady had to defend the Tour in person against players and their representatives. \u201cWe do our best to support the European Tour as best we can,\u201d added Rose, who is one of a number of high-profile European players who compete mainly in the United States. \u201cObviously, over the last couple of seasons, they have also made the tough calls of upping the number of required events from 11 to 12 to 13 as well as toying with other ways of making us commit to the Tour. \u201cAnd some of it has been needed and some of the other things maybe have gone a little too far. So the European Tour has done their best to make us play as much as we should play and I think it\u2019s at a fair level right now.\u201d He added: \u201cObviously, you\u2019ve got to accept that there\u2019s big tournaments all around the world and I think guys who are at the top end of the game have the good fortune of being able to pick and choose where they want to play. Obviously, for me, supporting the European Tour is very, very important and playing some of the key events on the European Tour is exactly where I want to play my golf.\u201d O\u2019Grady\u2019s replacement will be only the fourth chief executive in European Tour history. David Williams, who was appointed as chairman last December, will play a key role in the search. \u201cThe European Tour and its players are admired throughout the world of golf and George has played a key part in building global relationships and developing the Tour,\u201d said Williams. \u201cHe has always respected the traditions of the Tour and built on the strong foundations put in place by John Jacobs and Ken Schofield. \u201cThe Tour is now embarking on a new phase in its development and that is why George has considered that it is the right time to ask the nominations committee to find his successor.\u201d Sergio Garc\u00eda controversially skipped last week\u2019s BMW Masters in Shanghai, instead opting to play on the PGA Tour despite still having a chance to overhaul Rory McIlroy at the top of the European Tour\u2019s money list. McIlroy will not feature in China this week but Garc\u00eda will play both here and in the Turkish Airlines Open before the European Tour season\u2019s final event, in Dubai. \u201cI\u2019m not really thinking about that too much,\u201d said Garc\u00eda of the prospect of overhauling McIlroy. \u201cI just want to have three good tournaments to finish with.

Bravo was named on Wednesday in the official one-day team of the year selected by an International Cricket Council judging panel, and had told the media in Durban, where he is to play for the Dolphins in the new Ram Slam Twenty20 competition, that the dispute between the players and the West Indies Cricket Board is \u201call sorted out\u201d. But there has been no direct response yet to subsequent claims that a Barbados radio station has reported that Bravo, the one-day captain, would be sacked as well as his counterparts in Test and T20 cricket, Denesh Ramdin and Darren Sammy respectively. Ramdin, the 29-year-old wicketkeeper who has been a West Indies regular for almost a decade, has confirmed that he has been sacked as the captain of Trinidad and Tobago, claiming that he was being \u201cvictimised\u201d for his involvement in the abrupt departure from India. \u201cI think it is more victimisation because they were asking me questions about India and my lawyer said not to talk about it so I think they were trying to get more information on that aspect,\u201d he told ESPN Cricinfo. \u201cI think they are trying to victimise me and some of the other players, but I am not going to let it disrupt me mentally. I am just trying to get back into the right frame of mind to play and I know we [T&amp;T] have a couple of games before going to South Africa so I will just try to get myself mentally prepared.

Friday\u2019s best bets, by Tony Paley The best bets for Friday, ahead of a weekend when the Flat turf season comes to an end at Doncaster on Saturday, are at Hexham. One For Arthur (1.20) appeals as a solid favourite in the SIS National Hunt Novice Hurdle. The selection has been placed on three outings for Lucinda Russell since being bought after winning an Irish point-to-point and while he was below his best on his reappearance he has an obvious chance here if back to his best following that seasonal debut. The BBC radio racing correspondent, Cornelius Lysaght, is likely to be celebrating after the minimum-trip handicap hurdle in which the part-owner is represented by Northern Acres (2.50). The eight-year-old is just 4lb above his last winning mark and has obvious claims in a weak event.

He is guarding a Sunni neighbourhood in what eight years ago was the heart of insurgent territory. From 2008, when violence ebbed for a while, until early this year, when it returned with a vengeance, Ghazaliyah had been held up as a symbol of how things were getting better in Iraq, a place where people from both sects could again move freely, and maybe even overcome the wretched, recent past. Not anymore. Ghazaliyah, like much of Baghdad, is a cantonment, where communities are again splintering along sectarian lines, families are hunkering down and reconciliation \u2013 the buzzword of the past five years \u2013 is openly scorned. Not far away, behind blast walls, Iyad Allawi, the man tasked with bringing Iraqis back together, readily acknowledges that his job description is fraught. \u201cThis is the last chance for this country to survive as a single entity,\u201d said the newly named vice president for reconciliation, who admitted to the Guardian that he had reluctantly been sworn in. \u201cI believe reconciliation has a role now. I am trying to convince people to take part in it. Nobody can feel as though they\u2019re outside the net anymore.\u201d In the Ghazaliyah living room where Ahmed Jabouri and his brother Haithem have sat and smoked through the worst of the past decade, they say the renewed uncertainty is, for the first time, making them want to leave the country for good. \u201cHow can people live together again,\u201d said Ahmed. \u201cI had stayed because there was hope. Even in the darkest days, there always seemed like there would be something better, some day. Now the horizon is black. It\u2019s not easy being Sunni in Baghdad anymore. Every checkpoint (where the brothers\u2019 identifiably Sunni name is checked on their ID cards) means delays, or even detention. \u201cAsa\u2019ib Ahl al-Haq are looking for us,\u201d he said of the much-feared militia unit that lurks near the main checkpoint leading into his neighbourhood. \u201cIt\u2019s only because the officer is strong that they don\u2019t cause havoc here. But they have taken away some Sunnis. We don\u2019t know what happened to them.\u201d Nearby, in another former flashpoint area, Hai al-Jamea, which before the war was a co-existent hub of Sunnis and Shias, an elderly Shia resident described his ordeal at the hands of kidnappers whom he believes were Asa\u2019ib. \u201cThey stopped me under the bridge,\u201d he said. They put cotton wool on my eyes and a blindfold and they forced me down on the back seat of my own car. We drove around the city for 60km and were waved through every checkpoint. \u201cThey wanted to know my sect. When they believed I was Shia, they released me and gave me my car back. If I was a Sunni, I was finished.\u201d About 20 miles to the west, where the Islamic State (Isis) insurgency laps at Baghdad\u2019s doorstep, entry to the capital is forbidden to all but a few. The road to Anbar province is blocked by soldiers and militia men west of Abu Ghraib, meaning Fallujah and Ramadi, most of which were overrun by Isis last December are, for now, severed from the rest of the country. Here and on Baghdad\u2019s southern outskirts, which share Anbar\u2019s predominantly Sunni demographics, community leaders openly say they believe that Iraq within its current borders is no longer viable. \u201cWe fought al-Qaida before,\u201d said Mustafa al-Samarie, a teacher from the town of Latifiya, south of the city. \u201cWhen the awakening started, we paid a huge price and we have been killed by the terrorists ever since. Now we are being called terrorists by the Shia government that abandoned us and the fight [we fought] for them.\u201d \u201cHow can there be trust when there is no justice,\u201d said Ahmed Abu Risha, the Anbar tribal leader who led the awakening movement in 2007, which at the time was credited with saving Iraq from splitting along sectarian lines. \u201cWe have been asked to help them win this fight, but on their terms,\u201d he said of the new Iraqi government. \u201cThere is a long way to go in this country before people can ever start to reconcile with each other. There is no real power sharing. There is no inclusiveness.\u201d Iyad Allawi said re-empowering Sunnis, and giving the Kurds of the north a stake in the country, was essential if Iraq was to remain a nation state within its current borders. \u201cThere has to be parallel schemes, to abolish or freeze some of the (discriminatory) laws, especially de-Ba\u2019athification and article 4 of the counter terrorism laws (both of which had previously been applied disproportionately to Sunnis). \u201cThere has to be measures of trust among the people. Some deserve compensation.\u201d Allawi says he supports talking directly with former Ba\u2019athist leaders who are playing prominent roles in the insurgency alongside Isis. Some former senior members of Iraq\u2019s military are credited with giving the insurgency a steel and military rigour that it would have lacked if left solely to the jihadis. \u201cWe have to talk on a bilateral basis with those who are making the problems,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause they have been severely disenfranchised. \u201cWith the Kurds, either we consider them part and parcel of Iraq, or as an enemy. I look at them as brothers, I don\u2019t see them as outcasts.\u201d Allawi said he planned to organise a conference backed by the United Nations to reinvigorate reconciliation in Iraq and reintegrate the country within the region. \u201cWe have work to do with everyone,\u201d he said. \u201cNeither Iran, or any country, can feel secure while the rest of the region is boiling. Isis has been manufactured by the political realities here and elsewhere. We have to do something fast.\u201d To many in Baghdad, co-existence has been shredded. At a money change office in the east of the city, the Guardian watched as the owner refused to give a Sunni woman $400 that had been sent from her family in Dubai. After she left, despondent, he said: \u201cShe can go and pick it up from Fallujah.\u201d", "title": "Iraq returns to risk of splitting along sectarian lines", "sentences": ["At a money change office in the east of the city, the Guardian watched as the owner refused to give a Sunni woman $400 that had been sent from her family in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-07T18:27:24Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/08/rickie-fowler-unease-us-ryder-cup-aftermath", "tags": ["Golf", "Rickie Fowler", "US sports", "Sport", "Graeme McDowell", "Martin Kaymer"], "article": "Rickie Fowler, who will form part of a task force aimed at ending United States\u2019 woes in the Ryder Cup, has admitted to unease about the circumstances that followed his nation\u2019s comprehensive defeat to Europe in September. European success at Gleneagles was partly overshadowed by an extraordinary episode between Phil Mickelson and Tom Watson. After earlier tension behind the scenes, Mickelson offered heavily implied criticism of Watson\u2019s captaincy during a Sunday evening press conference at which the entire US team were present. \u201cThe part that is unfortunate is stuff that I feel happens in the team room, that is said to the team behind closed doors, should stay there,\u201d said Fowler on Saturday. \u201cI thought Tom did a great job as far as talking to the guys. \u201cHe had been there plenty of times. I enjoyed the time I got to spend with him. I respect him, he is a legend within the game. Some of the stuff may have gotten blown a little bit out of proportion. But we didn\u2019t play as well as we needed to play to win.\u201d Having lost six of the last seven Ryder Cup contests, the US must first choose a captaincy strategy for Hazeltine in 2016. At 25, Fowler is comfortably the youngest on the 11-man panel. \u201cI am looking forward to getting together with the guys, everyone that is involved, and seeing what everyone has to say,\u201d Fowler added. \u201cWe want to win the cup. It is not like there has been a lack of motivation or anything like that. It sucks losing. Everyone is aware of that and everyone wants to win.\u201d Rory McIlroy may be the undisputed player of 2014 but Martin Kaymer could make a late bid to at least challenge that status. Kaymer\u2019s success at the Players\u2019 Championship and US Open owed everything to dedication. There may be better to come; Kaymer hovers within two shots of the leader, Graeme McDowell, going into the final round of the WGC-HSBC Champions tournament. McIlroy\u2019s double major success and WGC triumph at Akron place him above any of his peers but, with back-to-back appearances in Turkey and Dubai to follow this one, Kaymer has scope to endorse existing evidence of depth at the summit of world golf. \u201cThis has been a great year in those big tournaments that I have won but not apart from that,\u201d Kaymer said. \u201cI haven\u2019t been consistent in all the other events. It is important that every Thursday when I stand up on the 1st tee, I want to win.\u201d Such comments offer a snapshot of Kaymer\u2019s ferocious competitive edge. So, too, does the fact that for the past seven years, Kaymer has been alone at his Phoenix base during the festive season, preparing for the challenges of a new season. He will spend this one in Germany with his family. Kaymer carded a final round of 63 here to win in 2011. The course set-up at Sheshan is considerably tougher than it was three years ago but the 29-year-old has the specific memories of success that can prove so useful in sport. Kaymer went so far as to insist his Saturday 66 could have been better. The player closest to McDowell is Japan\u2019s Hiroshi Iwata, who is one adrift. McDowell was bluntly honest when asked what he knew of this 33-year-old who has enjoyed decent success on his home tour. \u201cNothing,\u201d he replied. \u201cGenuinely, I had never heard of him. No disrespect meant.\u201d When in playing company on the final day, McDowell will at least see what is a wonderful Iwata swing at close quarters.", "title": "Rickie Fowler admits unease at US Ryder Cup defeat aftermath", "sentences": ["McIlroy\u2019s double major success and WGC triumph at Akron place him above any of his peers but, with back-to-back appearances in Turkey and Dubai to follow this one, Kaymer has scope to endorse existing evidence of depth at the summit of world golf."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-08T10:11:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/nov/08/uk-condemned-arms-sales-repressive-states", "tags": ["Arms trade", "Human rights", "Politics", "Liberal-Conservative coalition", "Business", "Defence policy", "Peter Hain", "Saudi Arabia", "Israel", "Russia", "Egypt", "World news", "UK news"], "article": "The government has been accused of dishonesty over arms sales as new figures reveal that the value of British weapons sales to \u201ccountries of concern\u201d has already hit \u00a360m this year. Former Tory defence minister Sir John Stanley, who chairs the Commons committees on arms export controls, says ministers failed to come clean on a \u201csignificant change in policy\u201d that makes it easier to export arms to countries with a poor human rights record. He said in a recent parliamentary debate that the government has not acknowledged that such a change has taken place, and it \u201cshould consider most carefully whether they should now offer an apology to the committees\u201d. The government used to reject arms export licences where there was concern they might be used for \u201cinternal repression\u201d, but now a licence will be refused only if there is a \u201cclear risk\u201d that military equipment might be used in violation of international law. Former Foreign Office minister Peter Hain, who established the strict criteria on arms sales, last night demanded that the government be transparent about the change and called for parliament to be allowed a vote. He said: \u201cThe present government has run a coach and horses through our arms export controls, circumventing the legislation we put in place by putting a particular spin on it. It has enabled them to sell arms to countries and for purposes that should not be allowed under the legislation. \u201cThere is a clear policy in the legislation that arms should only be sold to countries for defensive purposes and not for internal suppression or external aggression. In the case of Gaza over the summer, that has clearly been flouted. Bahrain is another example.\u201d Data from the Department for Business, Innovation and Skills reveals that in the first six months of 2014 the UK granted licences worth \u00a363.2m of arms sales to 18 of the 28 states on its official blacklist, countries about which the Foreign Office has the \u201cmost serious wide-ranging human rights concerns\u201d. Israel, Saudi Arabia, the Central African Republic, Sri Lanka and Russia were among the countries that Britain approved military equipment for. Saudi Arabia was the biggest beneficiary, with licences approved for more than \u00a320m of military equipment, including hand grenades, sniper rifles, weapon nightsights and components for combat vehicles. More than \u00a38m of arms were approved for export to Sri Lanka, including shotguns, assault rifles and ammunition. The island\u2019s security forces have been accused of the rape and torture of detainees, and there are reports of intimidation of journalists, activists and opposition politicians, pressure on the judiciary and sectarian violence. By the end of June, licences for \u00a39.1m of equipment were granted to Russia, including small arms ammunition and sniper rifles, although a number are on hold because of the Ukraine crisis. Andrew Smith from Campaign Against Arms Trade said: \u200b\u201cBy the government\u2019s own admission, it has sold over \u00a360m of weapons into some of the most authoritarian and war-torn countries in the world. Arms sales like these don\u2019t just facilitate human rights abuses, they also give political support to the regimes that are carrying them out. It is totally inconsistent for the government to be talking about human rights and democracy at the same time as it is actively promoting arms sales to authoritarian regimes like Saudi Arabia.\u201d The consequences of the coalition\u2019s support for British arms exports have been highlighted this year, with British-made teargas recently used in Hong Kong against pro-democracy protesters. A review overseen by business secretary Vince Cable identified 12 licences for ordnance that was likely to have been used in the bombing of Gaza, but the government has refused to suspend any licences unless there is \u201ca resumption of significant hostilities\u201d. The new data shows that \u00a37m of military equipment for Israel was approved by Cable\u2019s department in the first half of the year, including and surface-to-air missiles. Other countries which are officially \u201cof concern\u201d but are still highly controversial destinations for British arms include Bahrain, which has increased its purchases of UK-approved military equipment despite a worsening of its human rights situation. Arms sales to Egypt have also resumed, with \u00a32.7m of sales approved during a period that saw the controversial detainment of al-Jazeera journalists. The United Arab Emirates has bought \u00a337m of arms from the UK in 2014, including machine guns, shotguns, ammunition and weapon sights. Cable\u2019s department recently encouraged British security and defence firms to attend a sales exhibition in the UAE that was sponsored by the Dubai police force, which is accused of torture. Activists say Britain\u2019s export of arms is unlikely to decline. When foreign secretary Philip Hammond was asked about British arms being used in Hong Kong, he said: \u201cCS gas is available from large numbers of sources around the world. I think that is a rather immaterial point. They could buy CS gas from the US.\u201d David Lowry, independent policy consultant, said: \u201cSurely ministers should recognise that promoting the interests of international arms dealers over regional security is counterproductive.\u201d", "title": "UK condemned over arms sales to repressive states", "sentences": ["Cable\u2019s department recently encouraged British security and defence firms to attend a sales exhibition in the UAE that was sponsored by the Dubai police force, which is accused of torture."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-08T20:11:22Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2014/nov/09/letters-david-cameron-tax-morality", "tags": ["UK news"], "article": "  David Cameron\u2019s tax credo may well be incoherent and economically illiterate but it is not immoral (\u201cCameron\u2019s tax credo is incoherent, immoral and economically illiterate\u201d, Comment). There are, indeed, good a priori arguments, as well as a body of empirical work on ourselves as well as other primates, that suggest that, as Will Hutton puts it, there is a \u201cfundamental human appetite for fairness\u201d. But contra Hutton, a sense of propriety need not require \u201cproportionality of contribution\u201d: depending on the circumstances, it could well be that our sense of what is right is satisfied by other contributory principles. In any case, even if \u201cproportionality of contribution\u201d did \u201crepresent\u201d our appetite for fairness, cutting the higher marginal tax rates on the rich would better satisfy that appetite rather than run counter to it. Dr William Dixon and Dr David Wilson London Metropolitan University London E1 Why guns must be outlawed   Three small words, in John Vidal\u2019s otherwise excellent report on the world\u2019s \u201cmurder capitals\u201d, help explain the phenomenon of hyper-violence accompanying rapid social transition in the cities of the global south (\u201cMurder capitals of the world: how runaway growth fuels city violence\u201d, News). The estimated 480,000 people, he notes, are killed \u201cmostly by guns\u201d. As the UN also acknowledges, these rapidly expanding cities are among the most highly weaponised areas in the world. A combination of profound inequality and small-arms proliferation, driving chronic insecurity, accompanied by state failure, cultivates a dangerous faith (no doubt fostered by US myths of individual freedom) in personal weaponisation for self-defence. Even one of the most privileged gun-toting citizens of a grossly unequal, high-crime society, Oscar Pistorius in South Africa, must now realise that the privatised use of lethal force is no contribution to public safety. Peter Squires Professor of criminology &amp; public policy, University of Brighton Limitations of speed limits   In Bristol, we have a 20mph speed limit throughout the city. This was recently introduced by our mayor on the grounds that it will reduce accidents and make them less serious with fewer casualties, a policy that is in line with Christian Wolmar\u2019s arguments in the New Review (\u201cAre lower speed limits a good idea?\u201d). What is not clear yet is the evidence to support their case and were it subsequently to be proved that lower speed limits did reduce accidents would they then advocate a 15mph speed limit to eliminate them further? This is not to argue against all speed restrictions, as there would seem to be a prima facie case for having relatively low limits on selected roads in the vicinity of hospitals, care homes and schools, as opposed to the blanket city-wide approach we now have. Also my recent experience of being tailgated by a clearly impatient and inconsiderate driver, when observing the new 20mph limit on a quiet Bristol road, suggests that this speed limit might well have the unintended consequence of increasing road-rage incidents in our city, with a potentially detrimental effect on road accident statistics. Mick Beeby Bristol Less of this clock watching I can\u2019t understand how so many learned people in last week\u2019s Big Issue can write such nonsense about the issues of being on Central European Time (\u201cWe\u2019re still in the dark ages when it comes to time zones\u201d). How is it that several million Scandinavian children seem quite capable of adapting to life for six months when it\u2019s pretty dark most of the time and for the other six months when it\u2019s constantly light all the time, the severity of which depends on your latitude? The standard of education in all these countries is typically admired, as well as them having the lowest rates of traffic accidents. Arguably these countries also have more equal and social welfare orientated societies compared to ours, so maybe there is something more in this argument than whether our kids can cope with one hour\u2019s difference. Quite a ridiculous argument in all honesty.

Dellal\u2019s delight in the aesthetic of Old Hollywood glamour, the black and white films she watched with her mum as a kid, is everywhere in her Mayfair shop \u2013 from the elegant fittings to the designer\u2019s hair. Dellal\u2019s favourite film is Gilda, and every week her hair is set in Rita Hayworth-esque curls. All this is the \u201cta-da!\u201d of the finale, the visual dazzle of the Charlotte Olympia brand. But Dellal has a deeper understanding of glamour. That the swan pedals hard beneath the surface, that Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did, but backwards. That it is an illusion created by careful preparation, hard work and a keen sense of that fine line between camp, humour and beauty. It is this that has seen Charlotte Olympia develop since its launch in 2008 from a sweet line of high heels \u2013 her signature \u201cisland platform\u201d \u2013 to a distinctive international brand of shoes and clutch bags to the launch of this month\u2019s leather handbags range. There are now six stand-alone shops. As well as the London store, there are shops in Hong Kong, Dubai and there are three in America. This year Charlotte Olympia is shortlisted again for the accessory designer prize at the British Fashion Awards, the biggest accolade in UK fashion. Dellal went to the London College of Fashion to become a clothing designer. \u201cThen my tutor pointed out I was designing accessories for every outfit. So I went to Cordwainers College [it specialises in leatherwork], and once I physically made my first shoe, I realised that was what I wanted to do. I also test the shoes myself. What kind of female shoe designer would I be if I made uncomfortable shoes you couldn\u2019t walk in?\u201d     High society: (from left) Eternally Dolly, Unleash the Dragon and Debbie. Photograph: Alex Lake/Observer    It\u2019s a promise you\u2019re glad she\u2019s made when you see her designs. Dellal happily acknowledges the influence of Ferragamo and Elsa Schiaparelli on her fanciful and elaborate footwear. The autumn/winter collection Shanghai Express has an oriental inspiration. So there\u2019s the Imperial, held up on an improbable tower of Chinese beads. The Jasmine appears to be balanced on a platform made from a lacquered box. The heel of her Cheeky shoe is made from a woman\u2019s legs and bottom. \u201cI like to accessorise my accessories,\u201d she admits. \u201cMore is more for me. It\u2019s easier to tone things down than dress them up. There is subtlety, though. My fan bag might have a novelty aspect, but it\u2019s taken from a beautiful feminine object. I want to make beautiful objects wearable.\u201d While her love of heels is apparent, Dellal\u2019s biggest hit to date has been the Kitty slipper \u2013 a smoking slipper decorated with a cat\u2019s face \u2013 which has been worn by Alexa Chung, Beyonc\u00e9 and Sarah Jessica Parker. That Dellal\u2019s flamboyant designs have celebrity fans is no surprise, but she has always had strong connections with the fashionable and the famous. If that Dellal name rings some bells, it\u2019s because her mother is Andrea Dellal, a Brazilian model who was one of the biggest names of the 70s fashion scene working for Yves Saint Laurent and Valentino. Her sister is Alice Dellal, who has modelled for Chanel and Agent Provocateur and is drummer in the all-girl rock band Thrush Metal. When Charlotte holds a dinner to celebrate the launch of her handbags, Mario Testino (who, along with Mick Jagger, is godfather to Alice) and Naomi Campbell are on the guest list. But Charlotte talks more of her father\u2019s influence. Guy Dellal followed his father, the property tycoon and avid gambler \u201cBlack\u201d Jack Dellal, into property development and has done very well. \u201cWhen I told my dad I wanted to make shoes he asked if it was going to be a business or a hobby. I said: a business. So he taught me the importance of the business plan. From an early age, my dream has been to build a brand. I\u2019ve grown the business slowly, adding products when it was appropriate. I\u2019d love to open more shops, but that won\u2019t happen until it works for the business.\u201d     \u2018I can\u2019t be super-serious\u2019: at a Halloween ball last month.

One shoe collection came with matching-coloured stockings in the box. Her transparent lucite clutches come with three coloured pouches for women who don\u2019t want to display the contents of their handbag. (\u201cI don\u2019t have many secrets, so I\u2019m fine without them,\u201d shrugs Charlotte as she shows me.) Nowhere is this attention to detail more apparent than in the new leather handbag range. The Leading Lady collection has four styles \u2013 Astaire, Gable, Bogart and a big old fat tote bag called Brando. Each comes with elbow-length matching-coloured leather gloves, a gloves holder, an internal pouch bag and a beautiful comb that doubles as a make-up mirror. Thoughtful extras. Why call the Leading Lady handbag collection after men, though? \u201cBecause I\u2019d rather have a man on my arm,\u201d says Dellal with a chuckle. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t want Astaire on their arm? It\u2019s fun. I like names \u2013 they enhance the design: the Great Wedge of China, or Tiger Tiger. The transparent clutches were the bags that \u2018clearly\u2019 go with everything. Then there\u2019s the 9 Till 5 collection which are work shoes \u2013 and the heel heights are between 9cm and 5cm.\u201d I wonder if the wordplay comes from her being bilingual. \u201cActually I\u2019m trilingual,\u201d says Dellal. \u201cI speak Portuguese as my mother is Brazilian, but I lived in France as a child. There should be an exclamation mark at the end of most of my designs.\u201d She waves her arms around to take in the walls of shoes. \u201cLook \u2013 I can\u2019t be super-serious.\u201d She starts to gather up the shoes and bags she\u2019s pulled off the shelves to show me the details. \u201cI feel like I should end on a pun now,\u201d she says.

Buick and Doyle have been fabulously successful in 2014 as retained riders for the John Gosden stable and owner Prince Khalid Abdullah respectively. But the jockeys flew to Dubai from Heathrow on Saturday evening to confirm their new deals. Eye-bulging sums of cash must have been on offer to secure their signatures. There is, however, an air of some desperation about this new move by Godolphin. Despite huge expenditure on bloodstock the sheikh has endured another dismal year in comparison with the continued success of the Ireland-based Coolmore operation and growing competition from big-spending Qatari interests. Buick and Doyle, both 26, will be first jockeys to the sheikh\u2019s two trainers at Newmarket: Buick for Charlie Appleby and Doyle for Saeed bin Suroor. They will also wear the sheikh\u2019s royal blue silks on horses trained in Ireland, France, United States, Australia and Japan when required. Their first contractual role to Godolphin will be to ride for their respective yards throughout the 2015 Dubai Carnival which climaxes with the \u00a319m Dubai World Cup meeting in March. Mickael Barzalona will continue to ride for Godolphin in France but Silvestre de Sousa \u2013 who started this year winning the Dubai World Cup on the Bin Suroor-trained African Story \u2013 is out in the cold. Buick said: \u201cI have been very fortunate to have been employed by John Gosden since I completed my apprenticeship and without his faith and wise counsel I would not be in the position that I am in today to take what is, in my opinion, the most coveted position in world racing. \u201cJohn has shown me great loyalty and given me access to Classic winners and success on a world stage. No jockey has had a better mentor. Now I am looking forward to sharing the Godolphin riding arrangements with my very good friend James. \u201cBoth of us have had to make hard decisions but no one has made a commitment to world racing like Sheikh Mohammed and it is an honour for both of us to be invited to be a part of his team.\u201d Doyle rode the Abdullah-owned Kingman, a brilliant colt who this season won the Irish 2,000 Guineas at The Curragh, St James\u2019s Palace at Royal Ascot, Sussex Stakes at Glorious Goodwood and the Jacques Le Marois at Deauville. Kingman has since been retired but it remains a particular shock that Doyle is not renewing his contract with Abdullah. Doyle had also played a leading role at Ascot last month, getting Lady Cecil\u2019s Noble Mission home in the Champion Stakes for an emotionally-charged success. Doyle said: \u201cI have had a wonderful season riding for Juddmonte and Prince Khalid during which I was fortunate to ride the best horse of my career so far in Kingman. \u201cNoble Mission was another great racehorse produced by Juddmonte that helped bring my career forward. \u201cI shall always be eternally grateful for that one-year contract which leaves me with great memories. Now I look forward to sharing riding duties with William at Godolphin and continue to achieve great things in the world of horse racing.\u201d John Ferguson, Sheikh Mohammed\u2019s bloodstock advisor said: \u201cSheikh Mohammed has always respected both William and James and when their availability was confirmed at the end of this season he was keen to secure their services for the future. \u201cI think this is yet another clear indication of Godolphin\u2019s continued pursuit of excellence in both horses and humans.\u201d Appleby said: \u201cI honestly could not be happier because I will now be able to use two of the best jockeys in the world. William has global experience at the highest level and worked very closely with me this season. We have already had group one success with Charming Thought in the Middle Park and having James to call on as well is a massive bonus.\u201d Bin Suroor added: \u201cThis is a great arrangement. I have already had success with both James and William. James has ridden Group horses for me this year and has proved himself on a world stage and I will also have access to William which is terrific.\u201d In a move announced on the Godolphin website, the new contracts will not come into effect until both jockeys have fulfilled their current riding arrangements, completing all contractual obligations to their present employers. The jockeys will interlink with each yard and form crossover cover when commitments allow. They will ride Godolphin horses in the UK trained by Gosden and other trainers.

Donors largely make decisions on a case-by-case basis, and this isn\u2019t especially consistent. Stephanie Brigden, programme coordinator, Oxfam, Oxford, UK, @OxfamGBPolicy Deliver emergency aid and development together: Humanitarian work can be described as a \u2018sticky plaster\u2019 providing life-saving intervention in the most demanding, complex and hostile environments. But does humanitarian intervention act in isolation? Rarely, nor should it. Despite images of whole communities destroyed in conflict, informal and formal community-based structures exist. Understanding and engaging with these structures are critical to rebuilding effective and just states after conflict. Don\u2019t think of citizens of unstable states as victims: Individuals and the communities they came from can be considered as \u2018victims\u2019 and not as individuals with agency. International actors or national powers may engage with those who have taken up arms in negotiation, but it is less common that the voices of those who have chosen not to take part in armed conflict \u2013 nor represent the elite \u2013 are heard. Support civil society for sustainable state-building: Supporting civil society demands only a small amount of funds, yet has a multiplier effect. Where we have seen lasting effects is where local civil society groups or individuals have managed to secure representation in structures where decisions are made. These \u2018wins\u2019 are often made at the local level first. Zane Kanderian, director for Afghanistan, Middle East and north Africa, Adam Smith International, Dubai, UAE, @adamsmithint Work with local organisations with similar goals: In general, donors cannot decide who is legitimate and who is not; all they can decide is who they do and don\u2019t want to work with. What they need is a process of understanding who they are working with.  Engage communities to help build governance: Our approach is to get communities to decide what they want, and to work together to govern the use of money provided for basic services. Some of the communities are at the very heart of the conflict and yet we are still able to work with them to identify what they want and give them the means to get it.  Claire Schouten, consultant, International Budget Partnership, London, UK, @ClaireCSchouten Promote social accountability: In Palestine, the Ministry of Education, the Teacher Creativity Centre, and schools are enabling students to conduct social audits; tracking policies and how funds are spent on infrastructures and services, such as education, water and sanitation. Contractors and authorities have become more responsive and accountable, delivering more effective projects. Maha Yahya, senior associate, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, Beirut, Lebanon, @mahamyahya Involve citizens in peace-building initiatives: In Syria, there have been scores of local ceasefires followed by some peace-building initiatives, including restoration of services over the past year. The challenge here is that they are politically fraught. Trust is a critical component in these contexts; trust that you will honor the agreement and trust that you can deliver. Elisabeth King, associate professor, New York University Steinhardt, New York, USA, @nyusteinhardt Don\u2019t just cancel a project if it\u2019s not working: Even if a development project or programme isn\u2019t having its intended impact, it might not be so simple as simply stopping the programme. That too can sometimes produce negative results since the intervention usually has some sort of impact on communities. Daniel Hyslop, research manager, Institute for Economics and Peace, Sydney, Australia, @DanHyslop Shift the focus to violence prevention: Currently, the international community and donors don\u2019t do this very well. According to a FCNL report (pdf), for every $1 spent on conflict prevention, $1,885 is spent on military budgets. Once a conflict breaks out, many development gains can be destroyed. Suda Perera, research fellow, Developmental Leadership Programme, London, UK, @DrSudaPerera Start development projects sooner: The need for donors to be seen to \u201cdo something\u201d in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) has meant that, despite being declared officially \u201cpost-conflict\u201d for more than a decade, aid agencies are still delivering humanitarian aid and not thinking beyond that. Congolese people are greatly frustrated by the short-termism of this approach and the de-skilling effect it is having on the population. Use development as a catalyst for peace: Someone I interviewed in eastern DRC asked me: \u201chow can we focus on employment and education when people are starving and killing each other?\u201d My personal belief is that lack of employment and education may be one of the reasons violence is happening in the first place. One of the very first comments on this thread said: \u201cFind peace first. Then you can start to build the future.\u201d I would disagree with this.

Of course, the primary reason for a custodial sentence is punishment for a crime committed. But then to that can be added further elements. There is the idea that society seeks retribution or vengeance. Then, in some cases, comes the need to protect the public. A sense that a sentence might act as a deterrent to others committing an offence is a fourth consideration. Finally, often disregarded, comes education and rehabilitation. The vast majority of offenders are released eventually, most sooner rather than later, and it serves no purpose simply to eject them through the prison gates without a further thought to their well-being, or that of the society into which they are thrust. Along with Salman Butt, the Pakistani pace bowlers Mohammad Asif and the teenager Mohammad Amir received prison sentences for their part in the 2010 spot-fixing scam during the Lord\u2019s Test against England. Butt, the suave and hitherto impressive Pakistan captain at the time, but the man who inveigled his team-mates into wrong-doing, received 30 months, Asif a year, and Amir six months with all released early, Amir having served half of his sentence. Additionally, each received a five-year ban from cricket in all its aspects. In case memories need jogging, the offence involved the deliberate bowling of no-balls (not in itself an offence except against the spirit of the game: pace bowlers have often \u2019gone through the crease\u2019 to soften up batsmen) to order at a specific time. It was done not for direct financial gain, certainly of the bowlers anyway, but as a result of a businessman, caught up in a newspaper sting, demonstrating that he could organise such things in future: a bragging shopwindow in other words. At his sentencing, Amir was described by the judge Mr Justice Cooke, as \u201cunsophisticated, uneducated and impressionable\u201d and \u201creadily leaned on by others\u201d. He was 18 at the time of the offence. I have no beef with the treatment of Butt, who used his position of considerable influence to lure others into an offence: there is little doubt he would have done so again in future. Asif too had been around for too long not to understand fully the nature of what was going on. Amir, though, I see as different, and his status as one of the world\u2019s most promising young cricketers an irrelevance. We still don\u2019t really know what underlying threats may have dragged him into it all but he was certainly a vulnerable junior in a very hierarchical environment. Even the unsophisticated nature of the no-ball delivered, missing the crease by a massive margin, was at odds with that of Asif. Reduced as it was, his sentence was harsh. But then there is the other sentence which in its way may have proved considerably more punitive than the three months he spent in Portland young offenders\u2019 institute. A five-year ban, effectively the same as Butt, half of whose 10 years was suspended, has removed the formative years of his career and deprived someone from a very humble background of the one thing in his life that appeared to have any real meaning. I am not suggesting that the offence should not be recognised, but rather pointing out that three of the tenets of a custodial sentence \u2013 punishment, retribution and deterrent \u2013 are similarly being served in the ban, but hitherto there has been nothing in the way of acknowledging the need for rehabilitation. Except that now, thanks to the reorganisation of the ICC\u2019s Anti Corruption and Security Unit (ACSU), and amendments to its code, there might be. Already the chief executive officer of the ICC, Dave Richardson, has flagged the possibility that offenders such as Amir, given certain conditions, could be eligible not so much to have the ban lifted in toto but rather to allow a period of reintegration into the game through domestic cricket. It makes sense. The idea that a cricketer could one day be forbidden to participate in any form of the game and the next be eligible to play for their country doesn\u2019t wash. In effect, the ban would be extended by that period of time it took to rediscover the game, and regain fitness. \u201cThere is a provision now in the revised code,\u201d says Richardson, \u201cwhich will allow a player who has been banned internationally to play domestic cricket a certain period up from his ban coming to an end.\u201d This with certain conditions having been met. At last week\u2019s ICC meeting in Dubai, things were firmed up. \u201cWhen exercising his discretionary powers in this regard,\u201d said the ICC chairman, N Srinivasan, \u201cthe chairman of the ACSU will consider a number of factors, including the level of remorse shown by the player, his/her cooperation with the ACSU\u2019s education programme and/or if the player has helped the ACSU by disclosing all information that, in turn, has helped it to enforce the anti-corruption code in respect of others engaged in corruption conduct.\u201d Already, back in August, the Pakistan Cricket Board made representations to try to get Amir released from the constraints in time for the forthcoming World Cup in February. That, as Amir himself acknowledges, is just not going to happen. But he does understand the debt he owes to the game, and his new position as an ambassador, if you will, for the whole issue of anti-corruption in the game. \u201cWhat I did was wrong and I got lost in all the fame and wealth,\u201d Amir said recently. \u201cI went down the wrong path.\u201d That he did, but now he deserves to get back on the right one and to be helped in that. His ban is officially lifted in September of next year and, if he is allowed to play cricket in the interim, he might be there to torment England in the Emirates.

Few would disagree on the need to make progress on these issues. The most interesting global issues however, are often those that remain unseen by the international political elite.  Scholars in the sustainability sciences are increasingly exploring and debating humanity\u2019s proposed entrance into a new geological epoch where the dynamics of planet Earth are fundamentally shaped by humans \u2013 the Anthropocene. Discussions are intense and diverse, but have one important issue in common \u2013 the possible emergence of novel, complex and connected global risks.  Global risks have been on the international agenda for a long time. Nuclear proliferation, pandemics, cyber-terrorism, financial crises, terrorism, organized crime, critical systems failure and food insecurity, just to mention a few. One fact that policy-makers have trouble addressing however is that global risks cannot be treated as separate and easily-managed problems. On the contrary, and as the World Economic Forum recently explored in Dubai, increased global connectivity lays the ground for connected risks and shocks. Bluntly put: on a globalized planet, large-scale shockwaves that surface in one sector (say, a financial crisis) easily cascades to others (say, decreased investments in public health or global food price volatility). State boundaries may be clear, but risk boundaries are not.  The risk of global shockwaves induced by connectivity might be applicable to full-size ecological shocks: major droughts and floods, collapses of marine resources, rapid losses of agricultural production, and similar threshold effects in a number of ecosystems (often called \u201cregime shifts\u201d). \u201cMight\u201d is an important word here since the scientific debate is far from settled. The opposite position can be summarized with the words of American geography professor and biologist Erle Ellis: \u201cOur \u201ceggs\u201d are in many baskets, and our baskets are in many hands\u201d. That is, ecosystems such as agricultural landscapes around the world are likely to respond very differently to stresses such as climate change, which makes large-scale or synchronized collapses unlikely. That might be true, but global connectivity surely is creating new connections between \u201cbaskets\u201d, and between \u201chands\u201d.  Unfortunately, not even the ambitious work on connected risks advanced by the World Economic Forum in its Global Risks reports is able to provide clarity on this issue. Robust methodologies to explore these enmeshed planetary social, ecological and technological connections are missing; data gaps are pertinent; and scientific groups have a hard time crossing disciplinary silos.  As international policy-makers grapple with this new reality, it should be clear that the issue is not only about climate science or ecology. It is at its core about politics, international institutions, and global governance \u2013 what are the features of the next generation of international institutions, partnerships, and organizations able to address highly complex, contested and fluid global environmental risks?  This is normally where the public and policy-makers turn to social scientists for answers \u2013 or at least insights that could prove useful as the global community tries to navigate emerging Anthropocene risks. Having spent years and years in academia writing papers, and attending scientific conferences, workshops and meetings I\u2019ve come to realize that social science scholars, including myself, are failing. The social sciences clearly have a lot of important things to say about global risks. But knowledge is becoming so specialized and fragmented, that I sincerely fear it is loosing touch with the risks posed by the interacting environmental and socio-technological unfolding around us.  Here is an example. The 2013 World Social Science Report by the International Social Science Council was entitled \u201cChanging Global Environments\u201d, clearly an attempt to make a solid contribution to ongoing debates about global environmental risks, politics and governance. The report includes 108 individual chapters. Yes, over a hundred separate contributions! You can look at the scientific diversity presented in this report in two ways. Either as a science fair, or as a football stadium. In the fair scenario, visitors are impressed and energized by the massive diversity of perspectives, issues and methodologies. In the football stadium scenario however, visitors are instead so overwhelmed by the chaotic noise, screams and annoying vuvuzuelas that no meaningful reflection and dialogue is possible. If I were a policy-maker, activist, concerned citizen or business leader, I would probably perceive the state of social sciences research as a chaotic football stadium. With the audience cheering a countless number of different teams.  This fragmentation is not only troubling but also downright dangerous. The next generation of decision-makers and social scientists not only need to disrupt disciplinary barriers, but also base their work from the observation that tomorrow\u2019s global environmental risks are dynamic. When the G20 this weekend gathers to discuss proposals to reform global institutions, the emphasis should not only be placed on the international community\u2019s ability to prevent and respond to global risks. It should also explore alternative models of governance able to help break paralyzing political \u201cgridlocks\u201d; navigate the potential transgression of devastating ecological and biophysical thresholds; and promote innovation that span beyond quick techno-fixes. And last but not least: promote international institutional reforms that are perceived by the general public as transparent, and legitimate.  These are not questions that can be left to a single, imaginary and omnipotent world government. Nor will a magic global tax do the trick. These are fundamentally issues about how we consolidate a multitude of international collaborations and institutions in the Anthropocene. A robust, and not the least collective, answer from the social sciences requires the trailblazing integration of insights emerging in fields such as political philosophy, institutional analysis, international politics and law, resilience thinking, complexity science, crisis management and innovation studies.  Social sciences scholars: we desperately need to get our act together. At least if we want people beyond academia to take notice of our work.

A number of senior Iranian officials, mostly from the Conservative Front, were among the crowds railing against \u201cthe Great Satan\u201d. But President Hassan Rouhani, whose government has engaged in direct diplomacy with the US over Tehran\u2019s nuclear programme, was not among them. There remains a deep suspicion of the US in Iran, but even the most conservative factions of the Islamic republic hope for a way out of the current nuclear stalemate. A few hours of marching and chanting \u201cdeath to America\u201d and \u201cdeath to Israel\u201d ended with the participants issuing a statement expressing their support for the president\u2019s nuclear diplomacy and his negotiating team, who are travelling to Vienna next week in what amounts to a critical moment in the latest round of nuclear talks. Speculation is high about what will happen there. Mohammad Marandi, a Tehran University professor close to the Iranian establishment, told the Guardian that Iranians wanted the negotiations to succeed and that in his view, the Americans could not afford for them to fail. \u201cI don\u2019t think that the talks will fail because the United States is facing too much trouble. Americans and Europeans are facing major economic problems at home, tensions with Russia are very high, Russia and China are moving towards Iran, tensions with China are gradually increasing over the South China Sea and of course the US-Saudi alliance has led to the Isil [Isis] disaster that is a major security threat to western countries. I don\u2019t think the Americans are really in a position to escalate tensions.\u201d Seyed Hossein Mousavian, a former spokesperson for Iran\u2019s nuclear negotiating team who has worked with Rouhani in the past, said a nuclear agreement in Vienna would strengthen the Iranian president\u2019s administration. Rouhani owes his victory in last year\u2019s presidential elections to promises of ending the nuclear crisis. Mousavian told the Guardian: \u201cIt would have a great impact on the economic situation, improve the image of the US and the west in Iran, would open the door for broader cooperation with the world powers on the regional crisis and would be a great achievement for the Iranian administration.\u201d Last month, a group of Iranian and foreign investors gathered in London\u2019s Iran-EU forum studying business opportunities in the Islamic republic should the talks bear fruit and international companies could return to Iran. Esfandyar Batmanghelidj, who organised that event, struck a more optimistic note and said investors were hoping for a return. \u201cI think the mood is cautiously optimistic,\u201d he told the Guardian. \u201cEveryone is following the talks. There\u2019s an interesting situation where they are following the political analysis, they are keeping up to date with the news and people are hopeful the P5+1 [UK, China, France, Germany, Russia and US] and Iran are serious about coming to an agreement but however many positive signs there are, there are also worrying signs like the outcome of the elections in the US and the very significant resistance to the deal that is coming from certain special interest groups.\u201d According to Batmanghelidj, if the negotiations lead to a comprehensive deal that includes easing sanctions, there will be a great deal of business opportunities in Iran. \u201cTypically when individuals are talking about the opportunities in Iran, the first thing people think is of is big oil and energy contracts but I think the real opportunities and the one that is going to mean the most for Iran in the long term in terms of it developing into an advanced economy, is opportunities around Iran\u2019s consumer marketplace,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a country of 80 million people \u2013 young, educated, they have pretty good purchasing power. They are hungry for the best international products and brands, everything from cosmetics to cars to healthcare products, I think the industries that touch the end consumer are going to be the ones that are most successful.\u201d Amir Ali Handjani, an Iranian-American energy executive based in Dubai, said foreign companies were waiting on the sidelines to see if the negotiations with Iran and the P5+1 culminate with a deal. \u201cUntil then multinational companies will remain on the sidelines and look for a clear and unambiguous signal from their respective governments that the political process is going forward in a positive direction and it\u2019s permissible to enter the Iranian market \u2013 without that green light the risk far outweighs the rewards,\u201d he said. \u201cI think if there\u2019s a deal, internally there\u2019s going to be some jockeying for position to both implement it and block it by different factions in Tehran. I do think that if there\u2019s a gradual lifting of sanctions, business will return to Iran as long as they receive a green light from their respective governments that they will not be penalised, fined or targeted for doing business with Iran.\u201d But if the talks fail, Handjani said Iran\u2019s economy would suffer a lot. \u201cIf the talks fail, Iran is going to suffer tremendously because the economy is hitting a perfect storm of sanctions, lower oil prices, inflation and devaluation of the rial. With the declining price of oil, Iran\u2019s revenue base is dwindling. It is not able to sell its oil unencumbered and when it does it is not able to access the proceeds of its sale freely.\u201d", "title": "Iranians and multinationals hungry for nuclear deal that will end sanctions", "sentences": ["They are hungry for the best international products and brands, everything from cosmetics to cars to healthcare products, I think the industries that touch the end consumer are going to be the ones that are most successful.\u201d Amir Ali Handjani, an Iranian-American energy executive based in Dubai, said foreign companies were waiting on the sidelines to see if the negotiations with Iran and the P5+1 culminate with a deal."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-14T17:14:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/15/the-agenda-jo-rowsell-manchester-revolution-series", "tags": ["Cycling", "Boxing", "Golf", "Roger Federer", "ATP World Tour Finals", "Tennis", "Sport"], "article": "ELITE CYCLING ...

G20 Brisbane Good morning. It was a busy weekend in Brisbane, where world leaders came together at the G20 summit to approve a package of 800 measures for economic growth, including moves to tackle corporate tax avoidance \u2013 but there are concerns it promises far more than it can deliver. The final communique, which you can read here in full, calls on countries to contribute to a green climate fund which Tony Abbott has previously derided.

A 16-minute video released by Islamic State appears to show US aid worker Peter Kassig being killed, as well as a mass beheading of several captured Syrian soldiers. 26-year-old Kassig was known for his commitment to improving the lives of others, and founded the humanitarian group Sera. Tony Abbott has condemned the group as a \u201cdeath cult\u201d and \u201cutterly barbaric\u201d. A former British army chief has said that British combat troops could be required to fight in Iraq and Syria to eradicate the threat posed by Isis.

He seems particularly sought-after by coaching compatriots, with Manchester United\u2019s Louis van Gaal ready to rival the Saints\u2019 Ronald Koeman for the multi-surnamed ace. The race is on to sign Dortmund\u2019s Marco Reus, with Arsenal, Chelsea, Liverpool, Manchester United and Real Madrid (in alphabetical order) all circling. Jos\u00e9 Mourinho is hoping that an offer of Andr\u00e9 Sch\u00fcrrle in part-exchange will swing a deal in his favour. Manchester United could use similar tactics to trump a handful of predictable mega-rich Premier League sides to the signing of Real\u2019s Gareth Bale, with the Spanish side \u2013 whose B team gave Zinedine Zidane\u2019s son a debut over the weekend \u2013 having the name of United goalkeeper David de Gea at the very top of their shopping list. Talking of Bale, this morning\u2019s Metro reveals \u201cwhy Bale won\u2019t sign for Chelsea\u201d. Somewhat disappointingly, the rather prosaic reason is that he\u2019d be much too expensive. Talking of extraordinarily expensive things, Arsenal and United are also both keen on Reus\u2019s Borussia Dortmund team-mate, the defender Mats Hummels, and will be encouraged to hear that he is semi-officially for sale. They will be less encouraged to hear that the asking price is an ambitious \u00a347m. This is approximately double Ars\u00e8ne Wenger\u2019s January transfer budget, so it\u2019s probably safe to rule them out of the running. In other United news, the Telegraph exclusively reveal \u201cthe truth behind Radamel Falcao\u2019s fitness woes\u201d. And the truth is, he\u2019s fine. Relax. Tottenham scouts were in Argentina this week to eye up the Colombia striker Te\u00f3 Guti\u00e9rrez, a man previously fined for \u201cinciting mass disorder\u201d, and who once pulled a gun on a team-mate he didn\u2019t much like (and as a result had to make his own way to and from matches as nobody would sit on the same bus as him). Apparently, though he didn\u2019t score, the 29-year-old played well enough to have impressed, so British fans \u2013 and armed police \u2013 should brace themselves for fun times ahead. Apparently River Plate have set bail at a budget \u00a35m. Spurs are also keen on West Bromwich Albion hotshot (not that way) Saido Berahino and still-crocked Saint Jay Rodriguez, but won\u2019t have enough cash unless someone spends serious money on Roberto Soldado. Newly-reappointed Internazionale coach Roberto Mancini is, according to the Mirror, \u201cplanning a January spending spree in the Premier League\u201d. Full details of the Italian\u2019s shopping list remain very much under wraps but Aleksandar Kolarov is believed to be on it, as are Tottenham\u2019s Erik Lamela, Liverpool\u2019s Fabio Borini and Arsenal\u2019s Joel Campbell, with rumours also circulating that he may offer Steven Gerrard a chance to end his career in Italy. Napoli are quite keen on Lucas Podolski and may be confused by the mixed messages on the German\u2019s future today, with tuttomercatoweb saying he\u2019s available for just \u00a34m, and the Mail reporting Wenger\u2019s bullish insistence that \u201che is not for sale\u201d.

You\u2019ll never catch their passengers in town, socialising or hanging out. You only hear stories of Saudi hunters camped out in the wilderness, having brought the entire infrastructure and staff of the hunt with them, including cooks, food, beaters and handlers. They shoot desert species of gazelle, oryx and Nubian ibex, and take them home as trophies. There are reports that sometimes they don\u2019t even bother to fly through Khartoum airport, choosing instead to construct makeshift landing strips in the middle of the wilderness that are dismantled after they depart, sometimes apparently in massive military C-130 planes. Quietly, under the radar, they get their game, and someone gets paid. How these expeditions are set up, who arranges them and exactly who gets paid is a mystery \u2013 but it couldn\u2019t happen without Sudanese government involvement. While some of the more outlandish stories of playground hunting might be apocryphal, the latest reports from Tanzania are not. In one of the most dramatic cases of large-scale hunting in Africa by Gulf tourists, the Tanzanian government has reneged on a promise not to dedicate 1,500 sq km of Masai land to a Dubai company that arranges hunting trips for members of the Dubai royal family. The government offered the Masai the paltry sum of \u00a3370,000 to relocate \u2013 money they have no intention of taking. As a result of the ensuing media attention, Gulf hunting culture in Africa has been exposed in its starkest, ugliest form. Arabs in their Ray Bans with their new money and shotguns on the one side, and the exploited Masai on the other. It would be easy to dismiss this as an example of the filthy rich doing what they do best \u2013 trampling over the rights of others in order to have a good time. It\u2019s a little bit more complicated than that, however. None of these expeditions would happen without government sanction and, indeed, encouragement. It\u2019s easy money for cash-strapped African treasuries. And if the hunters seem to have no respect for the traditions of those whose property and way of life they know will be sacrificed, that is only because of the eagerness of Tanzanian politicians to strike a deal; for them, the relocation of a few people (40,000, in this case) is deemed a price worth paying. There is without doubt a \u201ccheque-cutting\u201d relationship between some African countries, specifically those in the east and north of the continent and in the Gulf, where random amounts of money are handed over in dodgy transactions that are neither aid nor debt. And the deals made are usually at the expense of the citizens these governments are supposed to represent. When Osama bin Laden \u2013 incidentally also fond of hunting in Sudan \u2013 sought refuge in Khartoum, it was mistakenly seen as an indication of the Sudanese government\u2019s sympathy with his ideology. In fact, his money was the main attraction. At one point it was reported that bin Laden was the single largest landowner in the country. When he was forced out, the land reverted to the government and he was never compensated. There is a view \u2013 and perhaps this acts as an incentive, who knows? \u2013 that those from the Gulf who choose to do business in Africa are, shall we say, easily parted from their money. As far as local intermediaries are concerned, these hunters are simply the latest bunch of rich eccentrics, coming to or travelling through Africa either to hunt like the white explorers and colonialists, or go on safaris like honeymooners. In countries with few other resources, the land\u2019s natural gifts are one means of earning money. And the Arabian peninsula has a long history of trade with east Africa, just across the Red Sea. The Arabic language as well as Islam travelled with traders to and from the region. Even the word Swahili is derived from the Arabic for coastal. This relationship has always had an exploitive edge, particularly when slaves and material resources have been concerned. There is arguably still a certain sense of entitlement among the Gulf Arabs, not unrelated to racial disdain. But in this case it is as much the greed of the Tanzanian government that perpetuates the anguish of the Masai as it is the desire of Arabs to make a playground out of Africa.", "title": "Rich Gulf Arabs using Tanzania as a playground?

At times the US has been directly involved, and at other less friendly times, indirectly \u2013 but never in the years since, to great alarm if not outright panic, the world discovered that Iran possessed a nuclear programme have we been as close to resolving its fate as we are now. The reasons are myriad; certainly primary among them is the election of a pragmatist US president in 2008, one who, unlike his we-don\u2019t-talk-to-evil predecessor, promised to engage directly with Iran on its nuclear program as well as on other issues of contention between the two countries, and the election of an Iranian president in 2013 who, unlike his predecessor, promised to pursue a \u201cwin-win\u201d solution to the crisis. There are other reasons long debated in foreign policy circles. None of them, however, correctly stated or not, are important now. What is important is to recognise that with only days left to reach a comprehensive agreement \u2013 one that would satisfy the minimum requirements of the US and Iran (and the truth is that it is only theirs that matter, despite the presence of other powers at the table) \u2013 there may not be another opportunity for a generation. This is the diplomatic perfect storm, if you will, to begin the process of US-Iranian reconciliation. Such a reconciliation would entail a realignment of western interests \u2013 many shared with Iran \u2013 in the region that is far more important than numbers of centrifuges, kilograms of enriched uranium, months to theoretical \u201cbreakout\u201d, or years that a deal will be in effect, that appear to be the last stumbling blocks. Those are technical issues that may be difficult, but not impossible, to resolve before 24 November. What has taken years \u2013 35-plus to be precise \u2013 for many Americans to understand is the motivations behind Iran\u2019s Islamic revolution. And it is these motivations which are behind what appears to be, if for peaceful purposes, an illogical nuclear ambition. Beyond building the world\u2019s first modern theocracy, which some revolutionaries and perhaps a large percentage of the then silent population never bargained for, the revolution was as much about Persian dignity and greatness as it was about overthrowing a despotic monarchy. It isn\u2019t just pride, as some suggest, that governs popular support for the nuclear programme (or any other technical accomplishment), although Iranians are proud \u2013 perhaps overly so \u2013 of their 5,000-year history and culture, and can be accused of faith in Persian exceptionalism in much the same way the US has in its own. It\u2019s certainly a belief in exceptionalism, sometimes with racist undertones, that has rubbed Iran\u2019s neighbours up the wrong way for centuries \u2013 far more so than the greatly debated Sunni-Shia divide \u2013 which partly explains why many Iranians, even those opposed to the Islamic system, are quick to ask that if lowly Pakistan and western-supported Israel can have nuclear weapons, why shouldn\u2019t Iran have at least its own nuclear energy? Indeed, pride and a sense of exceptionalism can explain some Iranian behaviour, but more than anything it is dignity that drives the Islamic Republic\u2019s foreign policy; a restored dignity that was promised its people in the revolution of 1979. After at least a century of being dictated to by foreign powers, in 1979 the people of a once-great nation \u2013 arguably the world\u2019s first multi-ethnic state \u2013 chose dignity over subservience, whatever the cost. It didn\u2019t matter that the shah and his father before him had wrested, by force, their nation out of its 19th-century stupor and into a 20th-century modern state. What mattered was that they, and particularly the younger shah, had done so at the cost of their dignity. In the waning years of the second world war, the great powers had removed occupied Iran\u2019s first Pahlavi king and replaced him with his unprepared 21-year-old son; it was decided at the Tehran conference in late 1943, attended by Roosevelt, Stalin and Churchill \u2013 who couldn\u2019t even be bothered to pay a courtesy call to the monarch he helped install, the self-proclaimed \u201cking of kings\u201d and \u201clight of the Aryans\u201d. Iran\u2019s independence was guaranteed, but in the minds of most Iranians nothing could be as humiliating as having their fate decided by three farangis, or foreign powers. The 1953 CIA- and MI6-backed coup against the democratically elected prime minister Mohammad Mossadegh only confirmed their sense of helplessness. The Islamic revolution put an end to that notion \u2013 Iran was never again to play a subservient role, in the region or in the world. It has, over the years, paid a great price to maintain that one aspect of its revolution that still resonates with its populace \u2013 for both Islamic and republic aspects have been in question to many, if not from the regime\u2019s birth then certainly since the \u201cgreen\u201d uprising of 2009. It is therefore unlikely that those who control power in Iran, whether conservative, moderate or reform leaning, will surrender the nation\u2019s dignity, along with the vestiges of their own legitimacy, by accepting the dictates of western powers. No: any deal, nuclear or otherwise, will have to take that into account, and it is not a matter of allowing Iran a \u201cface-saving\u201d deal but affording it and its people the dignity they believe they deserve. My own father, a supporter of Mossadeq who subsequently served the shah as a diplomat and a fan of all things American, only ever railed against the king \u2013 in private, of course \u2013 when he felt Iran\u2019s dignity had been surrendered to the west, over matters both momentous and trivial. Late in his life, in exile in Britain and having been deprived of his Persian dignity by the revolution that discarded him, he said to me of the nuclear talks that were seemingly stalled forever that the Americans \u201charf-e zoor meezanan\u201d, which translates roughly as the US \u201cis talking with the language of imposition\u201d. While on an extended stay in Tehran in the last years of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\u2019s presidency I heard my optician, ever cynical about the Islamic system, use exactly the same phrase when we discussed the nuclear crisis. Few Iranians, regime supporters or not, would willingly surrender to \u201charf-e zoor\u201d, the \u201clanguage of force\u201d or \u201can unfair demand\u201d. For all this, it isn\u2019t hard to imagine a nuclear deal. Iranians recognise that they can compromise without loss of dignity, and the US recognises it must make concessions which, while seeming to be appeasement by some, in fact make no real difference to whether Iran can rush to a bomb or not. It is also not hard to predict the effects of a deal and the subsequent normalisation on Iranian people. For more than 35 years they have yearned for an end of isolation and ostracisation by the west \u2013 some of it their leaders\u2019 fault \u2013 and are as hungry as a people can be for interaction \u2013 business, social and cultural \u2013 with the farang. Iranians have long looked to the Persian Gulf (and to Turkey) with some indignation. If it were not for the animosity with the west, Tehran would be a destination far more attractive to business than Dubai, they believe, and Isfahan to travellers than Istanbul. In an irony or ironies, Iran is also now, to quote Jimmy Carter from a different time, \u201can island of stability in one of the more troubled areas of the world\u201d. Iranians look around them and don\u2019t like what they see: revolution, unrest and civil war are not for them, but progress \u2013 social, political and technological \u2013 and healthy relations with the international community are. Iranians, especially the young, the vast majority highly educated but whose prospects are bleak, have been patiently waiting for this day \u2013 promised by a president they elected a year-and-a-half ago. They have no doubt that happier times await them if the west engages Iran in d\u00e9tente, if not an entente cordiale. A nuclear deal, if it comes on 24 November, will bring dancing in the streets \u2013 forbidden by law \u2013 and many toasts \u2013 forbidden but enjoyed behind Persian walls \u2013 and dignity. On that day the authorities \u2013 themselves with smiles on their faces \u2013 will surely turn a blind eye.", "title": "Iran will do a deal with the west \u2013 but only if there\u2019s no loss of dignity | Hooman Majd", "sentences": ["If it were not for the animosity with the west, Tehran would be a destination far more attractive to business than Dubai, they believe, and Isfahan to travellers than Istanbul."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-18T20:00:09Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2014/nov/18/compass-group-whistleblower-case-uk-karim-pabani", "tags": ["Compass", "Food & drink industry", "Business", "Employment tribunals", "Work & careers", "Money", "Employment law", "Law", "UK news"], "article": "A whistleblower who was sacked last year by a subsidiary of the FTSE 100 caterer Compass Group after making repeated allegations of corruption has won the right to have his employment tribunal heard in the UK.

Claims made directly against the group holding company were struck out. In his judgment, Judge Fowell wrote: \u201cThe dismissal took place in the UK, to a UK citizen and resident. In deciding that claim it is not relevant to decide whether the whistleblowing allegations are true; the focus is on whether they were made in good faith and that the claimant had reasonable grounds to believe that the respondent had committed a relevant breach.

Why is Rory McIlroy so confident that a heavy distraction, namely the climax to his legal dispute with his former management company, Horizon Sports Management, won\u2019t affect his golf in the lead-up to the Masters? \u201cI have got used to it [the distractions],\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cThat\u2019s what it is. I am better at compartmentalising between stuff that is happening off the course and being able to focus on what\u2019s going on on the course. It is just something that has been part of my life for the last couple of years, so that\u2019s why I handle it better now.\u201d There is evidence behind McIlroy\u2019s claim. He has swapped managers, equipment, jilted his fiancee and finds himself as the No1 player in world golf. At Augusta next April he will seek to complete a grand slam of major championships before the age of 26. Still, this legal affair is highly significant. McIlroy recently withdrew from two high-profile events in China to prepare for a trial which remains likely to take place in Dublin\u2019s commercial court in the new year. \u201cI had to get a few things tied up and it had to be done by a certain deadline,\u201d said McIlroy of his absence from the BMW Masters and WGC-HSBC Champions tournaments. \u201cSo there was a lot of time that I needed to put into what I had to do. It went until the Tuesday of the HSBC event, something like that. So I could have gone there but I would have been totally ill-prepared to play and there is no reason to go to an event without having your best stuff there. \u201cIt was frustrating because I would have preferred to have been playing golf, that\u2019s for sure. But these things happen and there was an opportunity before these events to put it all to bed and it didn\u2019t quite work out. So then there was extra work needed from my side to get a few things done, to get ready.\u201d Indeed, two days of mediation between the two parties last month failed to resolve what is a multi-million pound issue. \u201cOf course I am annoyed that it is still going on,\u201d McIlroy admitted. \u201cBut it is what it is. I have been saying that a lot recently \u2013 it is what it is, I can\u2019t do anything about it. We tried our best a few weeks ago to come to some sort of resolution and it didn\u2019t work. \u201cIt\u2019s not the best thing to be going through but it will be over and done with a good bit before I have to go down Magnolia Lane in April and that\u2019s fine by me.

The researchers, inspired by the sticky toes of geckos, created hand-sized silicone pads covered with tiny ridges that are capable of adhering to smooth surfaces. They then built a harness with each hand pad supporting the weight of a foot rest, to which it is connected by a pole. The pads feature rows of microscopic slanting wedges that temporarily bond to the surface of the glass when weight is applied. Previous attempts to copy gecko feet failed but scientists at Stanford University, working with the US Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa), found a way of sharing the load between 24 postage-stamp sized tiles on each pad. This allowed researcher Elliot Hawkes, a biomimetics student at Stanford, who weighs 11 stone, to climb a 3.5 metre tall vertical glass wall.            They now hope to develop the technology to allow climbers to move faster and more smoothly. It could eventually lead to gloves similar to those used by Tom Cruise\u2019s character in the film Mission Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol to climb up the outside of the world\u2019s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. Prof Mark Cutkosky, a biomimetic engineer at Stanford University who led the research, said of past efforts: \u201cUnfortunately \u2018spider suits\u2019 ignore some basic ergonomic issues. People have much greater strength in their legs than in their arms. \u201cTherefore we think one needs a system where the hands are used to gently attach and detach the adhesive tiles. A system of cables and links transfers the load to the feet.\u201d The researchers developed the adhesive pads, which are not sticky and can be repeatedly reused, as part of the Darpa Z Man project \u2013 aimed at helping soldiers scale buildings and other obstacles more easily. They made the breakthrough after studying the way the Tokay gecko, a native of Asia, climbs. Their results are published in the Journal of the Royal Society Interface on Wednesday. Geckos use tiny bristles on their toes called setae, each of which is split into nano-sized tips called septulae. Weak electrical interactions between the molecules in septulae and the surface they are walking on provide grip that allows geckos to even climb upside down. Cutkosky and his colleagues developed adhesive pads from a silicone material called polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) that is moulded into microscopic slanted wedges. These grip the smooth surfaces, including glass, plastic, wood and painted metal, in a similar way to the gecko\u2019s feet when they have a load pulling against the tips of the wedges. The adhesive pads can be removed by lifting the weight from the pads. Hawkes found that by using small tiles meant the pads could conform to a surface more easily than a single adhesive surface. He also found that sharing the load through a system of \u201ctendons\u201d and springs allowed the pads to support adult human weight \u2013 and even outperform geckos themselves. Cutkosky said: \u201cAs the load increases, the tendons and springs ensure that all tiles converge to the same maximum load. \u201cWithout this provision, one tile somewhere in the array will become overloaded and will fail. Then its neighbours will fail and so on. The failure proceeds like an avalanche across the entire array.\u201d However, on rough surfaces the microwedge material does not perform well. Hawkes believes this could be overcome by using smaller tiles or adhesive materials better suited to rough terrain. He said: \u201cThe synthetic adhesion system may be able to outperform a gecko on relatively flat, smooth and clean vertical glass, on other surfaces, it has poor performance compared with the gecko. \u201cTo adhere to surfaces with more curvature, the tile size could be decreased at the expense of greater system complexity and for rougher surfaces, the adhesion system could be outfitted with one of the gecko-inspired adhesive materials that have been developed for use on these surfaces. \u201cOn contaminated surfaces, even geckos have trouble producing adhesion. The PDMS microwedge adhesive can be cleaned between steps by touching a material of higher surface energy like sticky tape and it may be possible to achieve self-cleaning.\u201d The researchers believe their suit could find other uses beyond climbing and are also working with Nasa to develop ways to help grasp space debris. Cutkosky said: \u201cControllable dry adhesives are one of very few technologies that will work in space \u2013 they don\u2019t require suction, they work at low temperatures and they don\u2019t require external power.\u201d", "title": "Geckos inspire scientists in US military-developed Spider-Man suit project", "sentences": ["It could eventually lead to gloves similar to those used by Tom Cruise\u2019s character in the film Mission Impossible \u2013 Ghost Protocol to climb up the outside of the world\u2019s tallest building, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-19T00:01:02Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/nov/19/jamie-donaldson-fitting-finale-race-to-dubai-rory-mcilroy", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "European Tour", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "The main Race to Dubai may be run but interest should remain in who can finish best of the rest. Or, basically, second to Rory McIlroy. The Northern Irishman has rightly taken umbrage to the suggestion that he claimed the European Tour\u2019s order of merit without hitting a ball. That is to say, McIlroy didn\u2019t participate in last weekend\u2019s Turkish Airlines Open, after which his status was confirmed. \u201cYou have got to remember the first 10 months of the season, where I actually did play and played very well,\u201d McIlroy acknowledged. The same applies to others, who by implication from McIlroy\u2019s stunning year have been left firmly in the 25-year-old\u2019s wake. With one event to go, Henrik Stenson holds a narrow lead in second place over Jamie Donaldson. Stenson, a former Dubai resident, has to be highly respected on a course he triumphed on a year ago. Yet should the Welshman usurp the Swede, few could grudge him such prominence. Donaldson\u2019s tale is one of steady and suddenly stunning progress, which included the sealing of the Ryder Cup for Europe at Gleneagles in September. \u201cIt was destiny that it came down to my game, my shot, which was great on my part,\u201d Donaldson says. Having recently turned 39, Donaldson is in his golfing prime. His was a career that threatened to be over before it properly began, owing to a serious back problem which played a major part in relegation to the Challenge Tour as recently as 2007. He only won his first European Tour event, the Irish Open, two years ago. Since then there has been no looking back. Donaldson begins his latest event as the 24th ranked player in the world. That\u2019s higher than Ian Poulter, Patrick Reed, Keegan Bradley, Luke Donald and Lee Westwood. He may leap above Tiger Woods by Monday, although the 14-time major winner\u2019s own back problems must be counted as a mitigating factor there. \u201cThe seasons have been getting better and better as things have gone on,\u201d Donaldson says. \u201cThis year has been special in a lot of different ways, mainly with the Ryder Cup. \u201cEvery year I have reassessed where I want to be and what I want to be doing. It will be a case of sitting down again at the end of this year and re-assessing. Obviously I want to play better in the majors, that\u2019s the main thing. The WGC events come after that; I obviously just want to keep this pattern going, getting ready to prepare myself to get in the next Ryder Cup team.\u201d When Donaldson did qualify for Gleneagles, it was through adding extra events to his schedule in order to deal that place. He went to the Czech Masters, for example, and won. This is a golfer who takes nothing for granted, who has attitude to match ability. Some European players, and particularly those from Britain, have been reluctant to cross the Atlantic at every opportunity to sample life and competition on the PGA Tour. Not so Donaldson, who spent three months based in Florida this year and will do the same \u2013 at least \u2013 in 2015. \u201cThe best thing to do seems to be setting a family base up, getting settled and preparing properly for all the events over there,\u201d he says. \u201cI will come back right in the middle of the season, around Wentworth, like I did this year.\u201d Donaldson has cause to feel good about himself over four days in Dubai. Should he finish second to McIlroy, it would be a fitting recognition of his efforts. All aboard the Hull express A long-awaited success for Christina Kim on the LPGA Tour understandably claimed headlines on Sunday. It would be a shame, however, if Kim\u2019s win overshadowed yet another fine performance from Charley Hull. Hull claimed sole second place at the Sanya Ladies Open in China, thereby moving herself into second place in the Ladies European Tour order of merit. In this, Hull\u2019s second full year on tour, she has already won more than \u20ac240,000, already more than \u20ac100,000 more than last season. And the key part \u2013 she is still only 18. There is a regular danger that Hull doesn\u2019t receive the recognition she is due, an issue which is in part representative of ladies golf in the UK. That will have to change soon, if only because it only seems a matter of time before the Kettering teenager wins a major championship. It also appears inevitable that Hull will move to the United States in the not-so distant future, where her talents can be rewarded more handsomely in a financial sense. She has already proved herself well capable of mixing it with the best players in women\u2019s golf, something people in her home country should probably be quicker to recognise. Dome saviour to turnaround the Tour? The European Tour don\u2019t appear to be in any rush to replace their outgoing chief executive, George O\u2019Grady, but that hasn\u2019t stopped a wave of speculation over who might take on the post. For now, nothing at all can be said with confidence or certainty. Of the numerous names who have been rumoured \u2013 and it is no more than that \u2013 in golfing circles, that of Pierre-Yves Gerbeau is perhaps the most intriguing. The French businessman, better known as PY, was credited with the turnaround in fortunes of the Millennium Dome and is regarded as something of a sporting entrepreneur. He would hold obvious appeal to the Tour; whether that interest is reciprocal remains to be seen. After his Dome experience, Gerbeau became chief executive of X-Leisure, building up a portfolio thought to be worth in the region of \u00a3600m. After selling a stake in that business for a figure reportedly in excess of \u00a3100m, the 49-year-old has spoken of his desire for a fresh, \u201cturnaround\u201d challenge.

I still want to enjoy my childhood, I still have lots of other things in my life that I want to enjoy and I think I should be enjoying at my age. It\u2019s something I would be in more of a rush to have tied down if I was 22 or 23. If I do get that tour card, I will still pick and choose when I will play in America. I want to play there but I still wouldn\u2019t spend loads of time over there just yet.\u201d This is an enviable position to be in. It is one undoubtedly backed up by Hull\u2019s knowledge that she will inevitably reach the riches of the LPGA Tour in the not so distant future. If she insisted it was to happen now there would almost certainly be a detrimental impact on the Kettering player\u2019s performance. Hull was in no rush to turn professional in the first place; her career to date has been a lesson in careful planning. She starred as a debutant in the Solheim Cup last year, a stage she is certain to return to in 2015. Her admirably unaffected character should not mask her ability or focus. In this, only her second full year on the Ladies European Tour, Hull has amassed winnings in excess of \u20ac240,000 (\u00a3190,000) to lie second on the order of merit. She is the 34th-ranked woman in the world, has a professional victory to her name and finished runner-up in last week\u2019s Sanya Ladies Open. Placed into further context, you must drop down to 69th for the next English player in those world standings. In typifying the difficulty women\u2019s golf has in attracting attention, Hull\u2019s rise has not really been afforded the praise it deserves. The sad reality is it may take a move to the US to boost her profile, when those at home should be quicker to recognise a genuine sporting star. \u201cI am very happy with the way this year has gone,\u201d Hull says. \u201cIt has been great to have a lot of high placings, to have built up world-ranking points and being in contention for majors as well. The best thing has probably just been being in contention a lot of times. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to answer whether I have met my own expectations or exceeded them; I don\u2019t tend to think that way. I go out every week to do my very best, it isn\u2019t a case of having expectations of myself every time I go into a tournament.\u201d There is, however, an increased level of attention towards Hull\u2019s performances which others would regard as a distraction. Let alone, that is, one so young. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the job, isn\u2019t it?\u201d Hull asks of life in the spotlight. \u201cI think you only get a lot of pressure, a lot of media attention, a lot of people talking about you, if you are playing well. That\u2019s the way I see it; if people are interested in me, I must be doing something right. It isn\u2019t something I have thought of as a problem.\u201d Hull insists she \u201cdoesn\u2019t set targets\u201d but may yet win the European order of merit title. For that she would require a strong finish both in China this week and on her return from Q-school, at the Omega Masters in Dubai next month. In Hull\u2019s previous four tournaments, she has finished no worse than 10th; last season\u2019s rookie of the year is of a mind to finish this one in eye-catching style, regardless of how a trip to the United States plays out.", "title": "Charley Hull: \u2018I\u2019m only 18 so there is no rush to go and play in the US\u2019", "sentences": ["For that she would require a strong finish both in China this week and on her return from Q-school, at the Omega Masters in Dubai next month."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-19T18:50:19Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2014/nov/20/tv-highlights-life-story-babylon-puppy-love", "tags": ["Television", "Television & radio", "Culture", "European Tour", "Paul O'Grady", "David Attenborough", "The Fall", "Gore Vidal"], "article": "European Tour Golf: The DP World Tour Championship8am, Sky Sports 4 The European Tour Race to Dubai finally comes to a close in, er, Dubai.

Sicily is a long way from Dubai, where Nibali is on vacation with his wife and baby daughter, but the memories tumble through him. For a while, at least, it hardly matters that his romantic story from the past is framed by a bleakly familiar backdrop of cycling controversy. We can even briefly set aside the uncomfortable fact that Nibali\u2019s triumphant Tour has since been tainted by four positive drug tests for riders associated with his team, Astana, which is managed by Alexander Vinokourov, who was suspended for two years himsel after blood doping in 2007. \u201cIt\u2019s true that my hero was Marco Pantani,\u201d Nibali says as he recalls a compatriot who won both the Giro and the Tour in 1998 \u2013 a year scarred by the infamous Festina affair, which reduced the sport to a circus of cheating. Nibali was only 13 then and he struggled to understand the problems that engulfed his icon after Pantani\u2019s immersion in doping led to isolation, depression and his eventual death. Everything that is tawdry and tragic about professional cycling can be found in the fate of Pantani, who died in 2004. But for the teenage Nibali, racing around Messina in Sicily, Pantani was simply Il Pirata (The Pirate). \u201cI was only really interested in having fun,\u201d Nibali says, \u201cwhich meant cycling with my cousin and friends. Everyone wore the bandana like Pantani. Everyone wore his yellow shoes and kit. \u201cAll us kids had fun imitating Pantani. We loved his image but his style of climbing and sprinting fascinated us \u2013 and the way he kept his hands so low on the handlebars. We loved that cool style of riding.\u201d I had heard that Nibali, as a boy, sold photographs he had taken of amateur races in Messina so he could buy a replica of Pantani\u2019s skull-and-crossbones saddle. \u201cYes,\u201d he exclaims in English before switching to Italian. \u201cAbsolutely. I did it so I could buy the saddle and other components. Then my dad started taking pictures of us riding and we could sell those too. It helped because the cost was really high.\u201d Nibali\u2019s extraordinary triumph this year marked the culmination of a long journey of sacrifice. In Sicily there had been few opportunities for an aspiring cyclist. Nibali had to leave home at 16 to travel to Tuscany and carve out a new life in the unforgiving world of road racing. It has taken him 14 long years but he is now only the sixth rider to have won all three grand tours (joining Jacques Anquetil, Felice Gimondi, Eddy Merckx, Bernard Hinault and Alberto Contador). He had already conquered the Vuelta a Espa\u00f1a in 2010 and a snowy Giro d\u2019Italia in 2013. In this summer\u2019s Tour de France he finished 7min 37sec clear of the second-placed rider, Jean\u2011Christophe P\u00e9raud. \u201c[Chris] Froome and Contador were ahead of me at the Crit\u00e9rium du Dauphin\u00e9 [in June],\u201d Nibali says, \u201cbut I arrived at the Tour in peak form. I did fantastic altitude training and I could feel it. Boom. I was in great shape. It was the first time I\u2019d prepared for just one race and we saw the impact from the start.\u201d Nibali\u2019s face lights up as he remembers \u201cthe amazing first two days in Yorkshire. The crowds were incredible but they made the roads even narrower. There was stress \u2013 but winning in Sheffield was beautiful. I took the yellow jersey for the first time and I was very happy. Even if it seemed a bit soon I knew the significance. On that stage Froome attacked first \u2013 and then Contador came. I closed them down because we\u2019d discussed it as a team. It was very important to win that day and take control, with your team car in front, for the cobble stage.\u201d His stage two victory in Sheffield featured a clinical attack that suited his nickname. The Shark dominated the rest of the race. Froome fell twice and retired during the brutal fifth stage across 10 miles of rain-slicked cobbles while Nibali looked astonishingly controlled. \u201cIn the morning I was scared. But the first pav\u00e9 was easier and gave me confidence. By the time I hit the third stretch, the really tough one, I felt ready. The rain meant you needed special bike-handling but it became better. I felt fantastic \u2026 afterwards.\u201d Nibali always regarded Contador as his main rival \u2013 but he was in charge of the race when the Spaniard crashed on stage 10 and broke a leg. It is hard to believe either Contador or Froome could have beaten Nibali. He rode with supreme conviction and skill in one of the year\u2019s great sporting performances \u2013 which made the subsequent controversy surrounding Astana so galling. Nibali should be credited for allowing over half of our two hours together to concentrate on doping. He shakes his head and grimaces when asked to describe his feelings after hearing last month that one of his nine team-mates at the Tour, Maxim Iglinskiy, had tested positive for the blood-doping agent EPO in early August. \u201cApart from the obvious reaction \u2013 anger \u2013 my main feeling was that this was unbelievably stupid. It did not make any sense. He had just renewed his contract. He did not have a massive goal to chase. Our sponsors in Kazakhstan weren\u2019t happy at all. We were in Kazakhstan the week after [at the Tour of Almaty] and there was such a feeling of betrayal because he is a Kazakh rider.\u201d At the time Nibali said: \u201cThe mother of the imbecile is always pregnant.\u201d He smiles sadly. \u201cWe say this in Italy but it sums up my feelings perfectly. The great things we\u2019re trying to achieve can be jeopardised by a single rider. That\u2019s why it\u2019s so upsetting. One mistake can ruin so much. But I believe cycling is the cleanest sport because of all the doping controls.\u201d Iglinskiy\u2019s brother, Valentin, had already been suspended in September after failing a test for EPO. \u201cSame family,\u201d Nibali shrugs. The problem for Nibali is that Maxim Iglinskiy, if not his brother, was part of his Tour team. \u201cYes,\u201d Nibali concedes. \u201cBut he was not part of my training team. I have a training team of seven and he was never part of it. The two other members of the team are chosen at the last minute. They are like a filler.\u201d Did he speak to Iglinskiy after the positive result? \u201cNo,\u201d Nibali exclaims. \u201cHe disappeared.\u201d Nibali would love to win some of the Classics and it must infuriate him that, in 2012, he finished second to Iglinskiy in Li\u00e8ge\u2013Bastogne\u2013Li\u00e8ge. \u201cYes, yes,\u201d Nibali says, raising his hands helplessly. \u201cIt\u2019s normal to feel that. But the past is the past.\u201d Last month, a third Astana rider, Ilya Davidenok, tested positive, this time for anabolic steroids. \u201cThis guy is not from our team,\u201d Nibali insists. \u201cAstana has a satellite team of youngsters. It\u2019s a completely different team. I dug up a little info on him because I didn\u2019t even know who he was. I discovered he was racing with the Kazakh national team. So only the brothers were really associated with Astana and the Kazakhstan federation has been very tough on them. It\u2019s right that they should.\u201d On Wednesday it was announced that a second rider for Astana\u2019s reserve team, Victor Okishev, had tested positive for steroids in May. The catalogue of failed drugs tests could have severe ramifications for Astana in 2015. Does Nibali feel bitter that he has been tainted by association? \u201cNo. I\u2019m just surprised. Today we have a biological passport, regular doping control, race controls. If you are doping, you will be caught. Even if the technique of doping can be advanced you will still be caught in another four years. It makes me laugh. Risking and cheating today is for stupid people.\u201d Did he have any doubts signing for Vinokourov, the general manager? \u201cNo. I didn\u2019t actually sign with Vino. I signed with the team owner and with Giuseppe Martinelli [Astana\u2019s team-manager] who I know well. The key thing is that they agreed I would take my whole group. This gave me the opportunity to lead my own team.\u201d Nibali smiles when asked if there is anything he could do differently. \u201cIf I think too much about the doubters it would not be good.\u201d He is still tied to his deeply flawed hero, for Pantani was mentored and managed by Martinelli at Carrera and Mercatone Uno. During this year\u2019s Tour de France Martinelli defended his reputation. \u201cI\u2019ll never deny my past with Marco,\u201d Martinelli said, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve pretty much nothing to worry about.\u201d Pantani and Nibali are also linked by Emilio Magni who worked as a doctor at Mercatone Uno. Is Nibali still working with Magni? \u201cYes. He comes from [Nibali\u2019s former team] Liquigas and I\u2019ve been working with him only as my nutritionist. Magni just advises me what I need to eat \u2013 and when. He\u2019s the key guy when it comes to weight and getting it down.\u201d Magni and Nibali were both at Fassa Bortolo, before joining Liquigas \u2013 whom the rider represented until joining Astana in 2012. A judicial inquiry into doping at Fassa Bortolo was held in 2001 but Nibali stresses that Magni\u2019s good reputation is completely intact. \u201cIn 2006 I started with Magni and I took him to Liquigas and I have been with him since. That\u2019s all.\u201d In 2011, Liquigas denied claims by one of their former riders, Leonardo Bertagnolli, that he was given permission by team management to work with Dr Michele Ferrari \u2013 one of cycling\u2019s most notorious figures. There have also been recent internet rumours that Ferrari might be in contact with people on the fringes of Nibali\u2019s team. It is an allegation Nibali has quashed in the past. Nibali shakes his head when I ask him if he has ever met Ferrari himself. \u201cNo,\u201d he says emphatically. How does he respond to the suggestion that members of his group might have met Ferrari recently? \u201cMaybe in the past they did \u2013 but, for sure, not now. I don\u2019t know anything about them seeing him.\u201d Nibali moves on to safer terrain and confirms that his 2015 season will begin in February with the Tour of Dubai \u2013 which he rode last year. \u201cIt\u2019s great that cycling is becoming more international. And, for me, it\u2019s especially good to start the year in Dubai. I like the race. The weather is perfect and in Europe, in February, you can\u2019t really train. I will start very happily here in Dubai.\u201d Will he consider an audacious attempt to emulate Pantani \u2013 the last man to win both the Giro and the Tour in the same year? \u201cIt\u2019s not decided yet. The chances are that Fabio Aru [his team-mate] will do the Giro and I\u2019ll focus on the Tour. But I don\u2019t want to close the door on the Giro yet.\u201d Is it still possible to win both in the same year? \u201cNothing is impossible. Maybe it\u2019s possible for older riders with the right approach. I think it\u2019s doable but next year they have chosen a very hard Tour route.\u201d He is more amused in dismissing the Russian team owner Oleg Tinkov, who offered \u20ac1m to cycling\u2019s top four riders \u2013 Nibali, Contador, Froome and Nairo Quintana \u2013 if they race all three grand tours in 2015. \u201cI want to have a life and see my family too. I can understand the fans\u2019 dream but the chance of anyone competing for all three is almost zero.\u201d There is still time for Nibali to remember his tribute to Pantani after winning the Tour. \u201cI decided near the end of the season to go to the Pantani museum and give them one of my jerseys. Not many people know I received a yellow jersey from Marco\u2019s mother. It meant such a lot to me. It was the same when I went to the museum. I learned a lot about Marco that I didn\u2019t know \u2013 that he liked painting. It was very good and touching to remember how much he meant to me as a kid.\u201d Is Pantani still his hero \u2013 despite everything? \u201cAt the time he was my hero because he won the Giro and the Tour in the same year. It\u2019s difficult to change your view of that hero even when you grow up. I was a kid but I saw the slow decline. I don\u2019t really know what happened but, as a fan, it looked [as] if Pantani was a scapegoat. Everyone pointed a finger at him. That\u2019s our general perception in Italy.\u201d Nibali makes no further mention of Pantani or the Iglinskiy brothers as, after our interview, he charms everyone at a press conference to announce the new route of the Tour of Dubai. Late that afternoon, driving around Dubai with his wife, Rachele, and daughter Emma, it is striking to see Nibali at his most relaxed. In the back seat he blows raspberries on Emma\u2019s neck, making her squeal with delight. The problems of cycling, and the enduring questions around Astana, recede briefly. Even the thought of turning 30 seems to please him \u2013 especially as the future seems more crammed with meaning than the fact that he has already won every grand tour. \u201cI don\u2019t think about it,\u201d Nibali says in the fading desert sunlight. \u201cMaybe later I will enjoy the significance but not now. The only thing I realise is that I am with a select group in cycling history. That makes me happy \u2013 and determined to improve as a rider. Everyone always told me when you hit 30 you have reached your peak years. That\u2019s what I hope and I expect. I still have a lot to give.\u201d", "title": "Vincenzo Nibali: \u2018Today if cyclists are doping, they will be caught\u2019", "sentences": ["Sicily is a long way from Dubai, where Nibali is on vacation with his wife and baby daughter, but the memories tumble through him.", "I don\u2019t know anything about them seeing him.\u201d Nibali moves on to safer terrain and confirms that his 2015 season will begin in February with the Tour of Dubai \u2013 which he rode last year.", "And, for me, it\u2019s especially good to start the year in Dubai.", "I will start very happily here in Dubai.\u201d Will he consider an audacious attempt to emulate Pantani \u2013 the last man to win both the Giro and the Tour in the same year?", "That\u2019s our general perception in Italy.\u201d Nibali makes no further mention of Pantani or the Iglinskiy brothers as, after our interview, he charms everyone at a press conference to announce the new route of the Tour of Dubai.", "Late that afternoon, driving around Dubai with his wife, Rachele, and daughter Emma, it is striking to see Nibali at his most relaxed."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-20T13:44:00Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/20/rory-mcilroy-dp-world-tour-championship-golf", "tags": ["Rory McIlroy", "Golf", "Sport"], "article": "Bare statistics relating to Rory McIlroy at Dubai\u2019s Earth Course offer ominous reading for the other 59 players at this weekend\u2019s DP World Tour Championship. Bookmakers understand that much; after just 18 holes of this event, the world No1 is priced at only marginally odds-against to win it for the second time in three years. Others would never be afforded such betting prominence. McIlroy\u2019s opening round of 66 means he has played his last 21 rounds here in a combined 80 under par. Even his average rounds tend to be excellent in any other context. on Thursday, McIlroy missed chances to record what would have been his finest score at the venue. He has carded 66 no fewer than six times and has returned five 67s at a course which measures an astonishing 7,675 yards at full stretch. He has never shot over par. \u201cI feel like the course really suits my style of play,\u201d said McIlroy, with more than a hint of understatement. \u201cI can be aggressive with the driver, that can set me up to hit shorter irons into greens and obviously gives me a lot of birdie opportunities like I had today. I didn\u2019t feel like I took as many of them as I could have but it still added up to six under and I\u2019m very happy with that.\u201d McIlroy had raced to four under after just five holes. But for a missed 6ft putt, it would have been five through five. That form was even more notable given McIlroy hadn\u2019t played a competitive round since signing off at the Dunhill Links Championship in early October. Six weeks off have done their bit for his competitive juices. \u201cI felt really comfortable coming into this week after the long stretch off,\u201d the 25-year-old added. \u201cI probably feel fresher than quite a lot of guys, so hopefully that can be to my advantage over the next few days. I was really looking forward to just getting out there and feeling what it was like again. I was excited.\u201d Key to McIlroy\u2019s bogey-free round was a terrific par save on the 12th. After missing the green right and at the bottom of a sharp slope, he produced a delicate flop shot before converting from four feet. Birdies at 15 and 16 further boosted his scorecard. Henrik Stenson, McIlroy\u2019s first-round partner, had cause to be content with his 68, aided by an outrageous piece of fortune by way of \u201cbounce of the year\u201d from his approach to the 18th. The Swede was victorious in this tournament 12 months ago and is an obvious danger to McIlroy from now until Sunday. \u201cRory came out firing on all cylinders,\u201d Stenson said. \u201cHe was pretty much in position off the tee all day and it becomes easy from there on. He is a stellar player, he has had a fantastic year and he is going to be tough to beat round here this week. \u201cI knew I had to play well, that I had to be focused, to keep up with him. If you\u2019re playing a bad round here and shoot level par or something when he shoots six under, it\u2019s going to be a long week to try and catch up. So I am pleased with the start and pleased I have got him within arm\u2019s length.\u201d McIlroy will spend day two in the company of his close friend Shane Lowry, who also signed for a six under par start to claim joint leadership. Lowry\u2019s goal in Dubai is clear, given he lies 52nd in the world and a top 50 placing after this tournament would be sufficient to hand him a Masters debut at Augusta National next April. Lowry had 25 putts on day one in Dubai, four fewer than McIlroy. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot at stake this weekend,\u201d Lowry acknowledged. \u201cI have been thinking of the Masters for the last while. It\u2019s been playing on my mind.

And with good reason. Twelve months ago, Henrik Stenson cantered to a six-shot victory at the DP World Tour Championship. The Swede, a former Dubai resident, reached 25 under par after 72 holes. Stenson\u2019s rise up the leaderboard on Friday, courtesy of a second-round 66, was notable and not just because he is seeking to defend a title successfully for the first time. It was not missed by McIlroy, who trails Stenson by two shots with two rounds remaining. \u201cHe is very comfortable on this course,\u201d McIlroy said after signing for a 70. \u201cI can\u2019t let him get too far ahead tomorrow. I have to get off to a fast start and try and put a bit of pressure on him.\u201d McIlroy had endured a curious day, if one that offers him consolation on account of it not being particularly damaging. He is still to card more than 72 on the Earth Course, emphasising the difference between McIlroy\u2019s problematic rounds and those of others. When the world No1 birdied the 1st, the script seemed written. But not this one; a run of pars was broken by his first bogey of the tournament, at the 12th, birdies at 14 and 15, a three-putt dropped shot on the 16th, birdie at the penultimate hole and tee shot into the water hazard on the last. I\u2019m in a good position,\u201d McIlroy said. \u201cI\u2019m only two back. There\u2019s 36 holes to play. I have definitely been in worse positions after two days and won. I just didn\u2019t quite have it today. I had to dig in a little bit, there were some good up and downs. I felt I did well in that I ground out a score.\u201d Stenson admitted to fatigue as early as the 12th hole on Friday, which rendered his playing of the final stretch in three under par even more impressive. \u201cI felt like I was running out of steam,\u201d he said. \u201cIt was difficult mentally from there on. I had to really focus hard and drag myself over the finish line. \u201cEven though I was drinking well and getting plenty of energy, I felt like I hit the wall on 12. If it\u2019s one or two holes left, you normally feel like, \u2018I can hang on.\u2019 But it was a bit uphill from where I was. I managed to finish in good style anyway, so I\u2019m pleased with that. \u201cI came in here knowing that I have got a good game plan. So far, so good, so I\u2019m sticking with that and hopefully I keep on producing birdies.\u201d Stenson\u2019s putter has not been particularly warm; he has used it 61 times over two rounds. McIlroy\u2019s 30 putts on Friday illustrates how he has not quite clicked into top gear on the greens either. If the prospect of McIlroy and Stenson going head to head is an enticing one, it would be unfair to discount the other names on a compacted leaderboard. Richie Ramsay, Shane Lowry, Thorbjorn Olesen and Justin Rose lie within three of Stenson\u2019s 10-under halfway score. Rose had been four over par for his first six holes on Thursday and was still four over after 10, but played the remaining eight holes in five under and maintained that form on Friday with seven birdies and one bogey in a 66. Lowry, who played with McIlroy on Friday, upstaged his close friend with a hole in one on the 13th. Lowry\u2019s prize? A two-night stay at a five-star hotel, besides the honour on the 14th tee. \u201cIt never looked anywhere else,\u201d said McIlroy, who has never recorded a European or PGA Tour ace. \u201cAs soon as it left the club face, it looked like it had a chance of going in. I think it was his first one in competition, as well. \u201cWe both had our struggles out there, but hopefully we can have better days tomorrow.\u201d If they do not, Stenson appears of a mind to take full advantage.", "title": "Henrik Stenson in prime position to retain World Tour Championship", "sentences": ["The Swede, a former Dubai resident, reached 25 under par after 72 holes."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-21T16:46:57Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/22/agenda-rugby-world-cup-tickets-rory-mcilroy", "tags": ["Rugby World Cup 2015", "BBC Sports Personality of the Year", "Rugby World Cup", "Rugby union", "Tennis", "Sport"], "article": "WORLD CUP TICKETS ...

Rory McIlroy acknowledges as much. One of the reasons the 25-year-old is more complete now, as a player and a person, than when he first shot to rankings prominence in 2012 comes as a result of the acceptance of what life now involves. \u201cI used to be uncomfortable,\u201d McIlroy says. \u201cYou get to the point where there\u2019s added scrutiny and there\u2019s added criticism or whatever it is but I learned to deal with it. It\u2019s just part of the title now, world No1. That\u2019s what it comes with. I\u2019ve become comfortable with it. \u201cI\u2019ve spent more than a year of my career at world No1, so if I\u2019m not used to it by now then there\u2019s something wrong. So I obviously enjoy it. It\u2019s where I want to be. I want to be the best player in the world and I want to keep it for as long as I possibly can.\u201d Lewis Hamilton\u2019s success in Abu Dhabi on Sunday, only hours after McIlroy had completed his European Tour season along the road in Dubai, triggered a debate as to who is more likely to be named the BBC Sports Personality of the Year in Glasgow next month. The matter need not really be open to discussion; every element of logic tells us McIlroy must win the trophy. The key, after all, is in the title. At least it should be. It is McIlroy\u2019s personality, open and unaffected by fame, which endears him to so many. The approach of Hamilton in the immediate leadup to the final race of the F1 season, sullen and put-upon, would be totally alien to McIlroy, not least when on the verge of something so fantastic. It is actually the golfer\u2019s straight talking and honest default position that has triggered headline-making controversy. None of this is to say McIlroy is not capable of being single-minded or ruthless, as recent history tells us he can be precisely that. Yet there is a maturity and willingness to engage fully in the wider world that other sportsmen without a portion of McIlroy\u2019s talent would shy away from. McIlroy\u2019s cross-community appeal and determination to hang on to his roots marks him out as the marquee figure of modern, redeveloped Northern Ireland. There are further, significant strands. Golf has not been afforded a sports personality winner since 1989, a ludicrous scenario for a sport so widely played and supported in the UK. Golf has been the winning sports personality sport twice, F1 three times that. Cycling has triumphed three times since 2008, hinting at a middle-class fad rather than anything more meaningful, with eventing also prevailing since golf, via Nick Faldo, was properly recognised. It should be further highlighted in any review of the year in the context of Paul McGinley and his European Ryder Cup team. Golf\u2019s image may be of offensive, all-male stuffiness but the reality, in most cases and certainly where McIlroy comes from, is altogether different. If golf is seen as a sport for the haves in society, goodness knows what that makes the flash, commercial beast that is F1. In short, golf has a more positive impact on the youth of today than does motor racing; McIlroy has shown a generation of British and Irish youngsters what can be done, with so many taking on that challenge. People of any age cannot just \u201ctake up\u201d F1, as is possible with golf. Sniffy comments relating to physical exertion not being a key aspect of golfing success need only glance towards McIlroy\u2019s arduous training regime. He is an athlete, in every sense of the word. On the course, McIlroy has used this year to set himself apart. His two major victories in 2014, won in altogether different circumstances, highlighted his development. So, too, did a wider consistency. The big stage was good to McIlroy; he triumphed, too, in one World Golf Championship and in the European Tour\u2019s flagship event, at Wentworth in May. Not since Tiger Woods was in his prime has a player taken on such a dominating position in the world rankings. At four, McIlroy has moved within one major title of Seve Ballesteros and two of Faldo, the most dominant European golfer of his era. It is inconceivable McIlroy will not surpass those greats. Should McIlroy prevail at the Masters in just under five months time, he will become only the sixth player in history to complete a majors grand slam. The buildup to that event around McIlroy will verge on hysterical, in itself a telling scenario with regards to how far he has progressed in the wider consciousness. It might seem churlish to decry Hamilton\u2019s latest success or dismiss his own impressive rise from humble beginnings. He will inspire others, of that there is no question. Nonetheless, most educated onlookers will admit the superiority of the car the British driver had at his disposal meant the only legitimate world championship race was between Hamilton and his team-mate, Nico Rosberg. McIlroy enjoys no such advantage over his peers; the upper echelons of professional golf have arguably never had as many players capable of winning on the big stage. Setting oneself apart is extremely difficult. Perhaps McIlroy places little value in the sports personality award, just as plenty of others regard it solely as an overhyped television show. Luke Donald took to social media on Sunday evening to point out how the prize would never be at the top of a high-level competitor\u2019s wishlist. Trophies, Donald stressed, and not something voted on, matter most. There is merit in that argument. Similarly, though, if McIlroy is overlooked this time around then golf and its blue-chip player has cause to wonder when the barren run may ever end.

As the headquarters of the city\u2019s council, the building\u2019s huge leather-clad doors, vast chandeliers and abstract art embody not just a strident modernism, but two bigger ideas that seem to have been frozen into every tile and fitting: a determination to pull Newcastle away from long industrial decline, and a belief that city government has the power to do so. In that sense, though it was conceived before he took office and opened after he had moved on to other things, the civic centre embodies the visions of T Dan Smith, the notorious Labour leader who once gloried in the unofficial title of \u201cMr Newcastle\u201d. Smith, who ruled the city from 1960 to 1965, was eventually jailed for corruption, and provided the inspiration for Austin Donohue, a central character in the BBC\u2019s epic drama Our Friends in the North. He said he had come to transform a place he thought was \u201cmoribund\u201d. \u201cCities are what men make of them, on land that is given by God,\u201d he said; he dreamed of turning Newcastle into \u201cthe Brasilia of the north\u201d.       Whereas Smith drove around Newcastle in a Jaguar with the number plate DAN 68, his latest successor owns a two-door VW Fox whose only remarkable feature is a souvenir teddy bear from the National Railway Museum, tucked into the cup holder next to the passenger seat. Such frugality fits the role forced upon Nick Forbes, who has had to implement drastic cuts since becoming leader in 2011. Forbes and his city are caught in a pincer movement, split between Westminster\u2019s unrelenting austerity and a rise in demand for local services \u2013 driven by poverty, economic instability, and an ageing population. As things stand, there is no obvious way out. Five decades after Smith\u2019s ideas had reached their hubristic peak, I met Forbes, 39, in the council leader\u2019s office; lined with wood panels and plush red carpet, it was recently used by a Japanese television crew as the location for a drama set in 1960s Tokyo. The hallway outside is dominated by a wooden model of Newcastle, which emphasises the more ambitious elements of the city\u2019s architecture, and seemed to symbolise the manic optimism of Forbes\u2019s most renowned predecessor. By contrast, the computer screen on Forbes\u2019s desk displayed a graph that suggested mounting doom. When we first met, in early 2013, he had showed me the same image: two green stripes, representing everything the city could spend on a range of services, which dovetailed to a point representing absolutely nothing. Since that first meeting, the situation had only become worse. \u201cBy 2017-18,\u201d Forbes said, \u201cour estimate is that we will have less than \u00a37m to spend on everything the city council does, above and beyond adult and children\u2019s social care. So it\u2019s completely untenable.\u201d     T Dan Smith, centre, was the Labour leader of Newcastle City Council from 1960 to 1965. Photograph: NCJ    In fact, the city\u2019s predicament already seemed impossible. The council cut \u00a337m from its spending in 2013-14, and another \u00a338m is set to follow this year. Then, according to current projections, there will be further annual cuts of \u00a340m, \u00a330m, and \u00a320m. Over a third of the money the council once spent must go, so Newcastle is in the midst of a dire squeeze on funding for children\u2019s centres, youth services, rubbish collection, parks, aid for homeless people, swimming pools, museums, and the arts. Back in 2011, Forbes said, when he and his colleagues had first confronted the depth and breadth of what they faced, a lot of them lapsed into silence. \u201cPeople went white,\u201d he told me. \u201cThey literally went white, at the prospect of it. There was a sense of disbelief about what it all meant, and the scale of cuts we would have to make.\u201d Newcastle is hardly alone. Birmingham is in an even more precarious position, as is Liverpool. Last week, the National Audit Office published a report warning that more than half of all local councils in England are at risk of \u201cfinancial failure\u201d within the next five years. \u201cI think that once the first or second wave of councils has gone down, somebody, somewhere, will have to think again,\u201d Forbes told me. But something in his voice suggested that he was less than certain. * * * Two years ago, Nick Forbes said that unless policies being pursued in London were seriously changed, cities such as Newcastle \u201cwill see the eventual disappearance of many of our public services, increased inequality, rising crime, a greater sense of desperation and resentment and a feeling of helplessness\u201d. In the civic centre, such words might still sound theoretical and abstract, but you do not have to go far to understand what he meant.  Ten minutes\u2019 drive to the west of the city centre, and north of the River Tyne, sits the area of Benwell. It is one of those places where the post-industrial condition seems to fill everything with a low melancholy; a sense of something that once happened here having been inexplicably snatched away. On a clear day in early October, at the backs of houses, there were great piles of rubbish every 15 or 20 yards \u2013 bits of plastic furniture, soggy children\u2019s clothes, discarded food. The bins were overflowing. A few passersby suggested that newly arrived Roma people from Slovakia were to blame; others said that was unfair, and pointed out that the city council had lately halved its bin collections, and reduced street cleaning. One woman stared out at a shabby alley from a first-floor window: \u201cNot me do rubbish,\u201d she said in halting English, and then disappeared inside. Denise Kelly, 22, led her three-year-old son Aaron-Lee through the mess, on their way back from a play session at a nearby nursery. \u201cI don\u2019t like living here,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a shithole, and it\u2019s got worse and worse.\u201d Around a year ago, she had moved back to Newcastle from Glasgow; now, she said, she wanted to return to Scotland. A few minutes away on West Road, I dropped into the As New shoe repair shop, a business that has been in the same family for 75 years. Peter Brien, 70, was behind the counter, lamenting the decline of the cobbling trade and the stilling of local street life. \u201cIt\u2019s all takeaways \u2013 that\u2019s all there is now,\u201d he said. He put the neighbourhood\u2019s uneasy calm down to simple hardship: \u201cPeople don\u2019t have as much money, so they don\u2019t get as much done.\u201d He still mended the odd pair of shoes, always handed back to their owners in crisp white paper bags bearing the legend \u201cExecutive shoe repairs\u201d. But his key-cutting machine broke a year ago, and two grand was too much to spend on a new one; he said he would be closing the shop in the summer.     Pre-school age children play at Riverside community centre in Newcastle. Photograph: Christopher Thomond    He talked about the area\u2019s history: the armaments plant owned by Vickers-Armstrongs, the Parsons factory that had once made turbines for power stations, local shipyards, and the sturdy terraces of workers\u2019 houses that were still here, extending towards the Tyne. Now, only a matter of yards away, there stood a signifier for harder times: a branch of Cash 4 Clothes, offering money for \u201call good quality reusable clothing, paired shoes, belts, handbags, jewellery, perfumes, and soft toys\u201d \u2013 a de facto pawnbroker for people with precious little left to pawn. A kilogram of castoffs paid 60p; for a tonne, they\u2019d hand over \u00a3600. In a compact playground to the side of the Riverside Community Health Project on Atkinson Road, a dozen or so toddlers were playing with scooters and trikes. The project\u2019s chief executive, Anne Bonner, 58, explained what it offers: help for recent arrivals from eastern Europe (\u201cthe most disadvantaged ethnic group in this area at the minute\u201d), cookery classes, a toy library, support for victims of domestic violence and \u201cactivities so that parents learn to play with their children\u201d. Some blame parents\u2019 seeming inability to engage with their kids on their constant use of mobile phones; Bonner put it down to stress \u2013 about money, more often than not. She recalled a woman brought up in care, who had moved to Benwell and come to the project for help. When she had quietly raised her worries and fears at one of the centre\u2019s mother and toddler groups, the project\u2019s staff had helped her get qualifications in basic maths and English, and eventually make it on to a childcare course, as well as helping her through a few bad relationships. One of her children had been bullied at school. \u201cShe was nervous about going to see the head, so someone from the project went with her.\u201d Now, both this woman\u2019s children were at university.Almost half of the project\u2019s funding comes from Sure Start, the initiative introduced by the Blair government in 1998, to improve children\u2019s lives by teaching parenting skills, offering support to parents who are struggling, and more. When I spoke to Nick Forbes, he said that Sure Start \u201cwas a symbol that we were a progressive country. It was a statement of intent to invest in the next generation of young people.\u201d It was perhaps understandable that he spoke in the past tense, because the programme\u2019s reach is now shrinking across the country: a survey by one children\u2019s charity recently found that spending on Sure Start had fallen by 20% over the three years to 2014, and a third of children\u2019s centres are now reckoned to be at risk of closure. In Newcastle, the city\u2019s spending devoted to children and families, centred on Sure Start, is about to be cut by 40% \u2013 a calamitous drop. In a hall at the back of the Riverside health project, Lorraine Morris, 38 \u2013 a mother of six, aged between two and 18 \u2013 was sorting out clothes and toys for a jumble sale in aid of the project\u2019s women\u2019s group. All her kids, she said, had been helped by Sure Start or were still benefiting from it. \u201cPeople have got used to cuts,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil things aren\u2019t there, they won\u2019t notice. We\u2019re very good at just making do. We\u2019re very \u2026 resilient. And maybe we\u2019ve had it so bad for so long that we just think that\u2019s just the way it is.\u201dThey might be used to cuts, but she and her neighbours were seeing new manifestations of austerity. Last winter, when temperatures were below freezing, they had received a delivery of grit, and been asked to spread it over their street themselves. Over Christmas in 2012, she said, their bins had sat unemptied for eight weeks, while \u201cthe rats bred like Jack Russells\u201d. Since last winter, Bonner said, her staff had been giving food vouchers to people in danger of going hungry. \u201cEven on a snowy day,\u201d she said, \u201cthey\u2019d be queueing up outside, and we\u2019d be giving out 100 vouchers a day.\u201d Almost exactly half the project\u2019s funds, she said, come from the Sure Start budgets now being hacked back. She had already lost \u00a350,000 of annual funding; chasing donations from charities, she said, now took 10 times more effort than it did even a year ago. Closure, she said, was \u201csomething we face all the time. We\u2019re always on this knife-edge.\u201d  * * * Nick Forbes speaks in a softened north-east accent, seems to never swear, and is unfailingly courteous. Quietly, he has become one of the country\u2019s most highly-rated Labour politicians, winning elections while the party\u2019s leaders pinball from bad headline to bad headline. Jon Cruddas, the senior Labour MP charged with producing the party\u2019s policy review, who speaks regularly to Forbes, describes him in deeply admiring terms. \u201cHe sees the future of the Labour party as being very different. He really understands big questions about democracy, and he has a real understanding of the crisis of politics. What he\u2019s dealing with is terribly difficult, no question \u2013 but he\u2019s stepping up to how it changes the role of people in his position. Labour leaders outside Westminster have been in that situation for four years now, and it\u2019s given them a real maturity. He\u2019s really interesting.\u201d Forbes grew up about 30 miles from Newcastle, in Weardale, County Durham \u2013 \u201can idyll or a nightmare, depending on how old you are\u201d. His father was a postman, who then founded a museum devoted to the history of local lead-mining; his mother looked after Forbes and his two younger sisters. At home, they did not talk about politics much; Forbes got his ideological bearings from his maternal grandmother, a former primary school teacher in a pit village \u2013 who, he said, was \u201cdriven by an understanding of poverty, and the scars that it leaves on people\u201d.

Photograph: Christopher Thomond    The fact that he is gay made his school years very difficult. \u201cI didn\u2019t really know what gay was at the time, but I was bullied for it,\u201d he said. \u201cPretty mercilessly. I used to come home covered in bruises; I had a bloody nose a couple of times. Chinese burns, cigarettes put out on my arms \u2013 all that kind of stuff.\u201d Forbes made it to Cambridge, where he studied social and political sciences, and was elected president of the student union. Though he had resolved to stay away from the north-east, towards the end of his time at university, his parents were involved in a serious car accident \u2013 which, he says, reminded him of the importance of family. So he returned, and spent three years as a trainee manager in the NHS, while tentatively taking his first serious political steps, as a city councillor. Back then, he wanted to be an MP, but he now thinks that a life in Westminster would have been no life at all. \u201cI kind of look back and think I wasted 15 years of my life trying to get into an institution which is bust. Why would I want to do it? For me, what\u2019s much more exciting is the idea that collectively, by bringing together the assets and resources that we have here, we can make this a kind of modern-day Jerusalem. That\u2019s a much more exciting prospect.\u201d After just over 10 years as a councillor, he became leader of the city in May 2011, when a rout of the Liberal Democrats in local elections across England brought Newcastle back to the Labour party. He kept his job as the chief executive of a health charity called Involve North East; his days are split between the two roles, meaning that he often does not finish work until around 9pm. For his work as the leader of the council, he is paid \u00a316,000 a year; an absurdly small amount, perhaps, but one that austerity has locked down. Other cities have faced even more drastic economies than Newcastle. But the way that Forbes has chosen to deal with his council\u2019s predicament has put him in the foreground of a national story. Three years ago, rather than approach his financial challenges year by year, he decided to take the long view, and baldly set out the impact of the cuts, up to 2016. \u201cWhat I said internally, was, \u2018We have to understand what these cuts mean for us. We can\u2019t simply stagger through year to year, on the basis of shaving off a bit here, and a bit there,\u2019\u201d he told me. \u201cIt was becoming increasingly untenable to do that, given the scale of the problem. So I challenged the organisation to profile what three years of cuts would look like.\u201d The basics were clear enough: the real-terms loss of around 40% of the money the council used to get from central government to cover an array of services, along with rising costs \u2013 which combined to spell deep financial trouble. To make things worse, there was what he still sees as the simple iniquity of the government\u2019s actions, which arguably had a distinct flavour of class war, waged from the top: drastically cutting council funding per head in predominantly Labour areas, while more affluent, Tory-inclined places were comparatively untouched. In Guildford in Surrey, for example, the cuts between 2010 and 2013 worked out at \u00a319 per resident; in Newcastle, it was \u00a3162. \u201cEven civil servants have given up trying to justify it as objective and rational,\u201d Forbes told me. \u201cIt\u2019s entirely political. And I think it denotes an intent by the government to push mainly Labour-run councils into bankruptcy.\u201d The government response to such charges has tended to be curt: according to official statements from the Department for Communities and Local Government, the funding settlements in question have been \u201cfair to the north and south, and fair for rural and urban areas\u201d, and councils can apparently \u201cprotect frontline services and save the taxpayer billions in cash if they share back-office services, tap into their healthy reserves and cut out the non jobs and waste\u201d. If they fail to do such things, they are \u201cletting down their hard working residents\u201d. For a time, Forbes became notorious in his home city. There was resentment about how much basic services were to be cut, while the council was also attempting to fortify the city\u2019s economy via capital investment in housing, broadband, and redeveloping parts of the city centre, which was to be sizeably funded by borrowing. As Forbes pointed out at the time: \u201cIn the same way that you could get a mortgage to buy another house but couldn\u2019t get one to pay for food and daily living expenses, the council cannot borrow more money for its day-to-day expenditure.\u201d But such clear points were rather lost in a haze of anger, and personal attacks.     Nick Forbes earns \u00a316,000 a year as leader of Newcastle City Council. Photograph: Christopher Thomond    \u201cI did not go into politics to oversee this level of damage,\u201d Forbes said at the time. However, Lee Hall, the Newcastle-raised author of Billy Elliott, accused Forbes of \u201ctrying to cut as much as possible\u201d for \u201chis own political aggrandisement\u201d: in essence, hyping up the severity of what he faced and then decrying the government so as to raise his own profile. The very real cuts that have since been forced upon Newcastle and other councils rather suggest that this accusation was misplaced. Forbes himself says that his categorical rejection of a career in Westminster shows he was hardly set on making any kind of national name for himself. But the hostile noise was inescapable: led by Hall, a number of celebrities born and raised in the city \u2013 Bryan Ferry, Sting, Mark Knopfler \u2013 put their names to a letter claiming a proposed 100% cut to the council\u2019s arts funding would \u201cdecimate the cultural life of the city\u201d, and ensured that a small part of Newcastle\u2019s predicament got the attention of the national media. It was perhaps a shame nobody famous chose to speak up for youth centres, swimming pools, respite care for disabled children, or road-sweepers. During the six months or so when the city had to digest the scale of what was on the way, Forbes was assailed by strangers in the street; on one occasion, he was attacked by a man holding a placard with his own face on it. \u201cThere happened to have been a march on: I didn\u2019t know about it. The picture had a dotted line across my neck, with the words \u2018Cut here\u2019 on it.\u201d For a few months, he made sure he did not go out alone. Even now, he is occasionally still the focus of very personalised anger: after a recent Hallowe\u2019en protest organised by a group called Parents Against Cuts who are opposing the council\u2019s moves on Sure Start, the local Chronicle carried a picture of a white-faced protester dressed as \u201cthe ghost of regular bin collections\u201d, carrying a placard that decried \u201cSlasher Forbes\u201d. \u201cI worried, and worried, and worried,\u201d he said. \u201cI could sense that a lot of this would be deeply politically unpopular in the city. I was worried about the public reaction; I was worried about the political confidence of my relatively new group, in power, taking big decisions like this. I knew this would mean big job losses: there was a heavy human cost to this.\u201d He recalled regularly \u201cgoing home, late in the evening after long, intense difficult, emotionally challenging meetings with officers, talking about the detail of what we were going to have to cut \u2026 it was very, very difficult \u2026 Being the leader of a council in those circumstances is a lonely place to be.\u201d     Forbes was assailed by strangers in the street; once, he was attacked by a man holding a placard with his own face on it    What kept him going, he said, was his relationship with his partner, a lecturer at an FE college, and weekly rehearsals with the Royal Northern Sinfonia. \u201cI\u2019d go home and listen to all his problems at work, and that would make mine pale into insignificance,\u201d he said, emitting a dry laugh. \u201cAnd there was music. I\u2019ve always been a musician, so I sing. Baritone. My two and a half hours on a Sunday was the thing that kept me sane.\u201d I assumed the Labour leader would have been in touch, to hear from someone running such a big city. So I asked if he and Ed Miliband talk, reasonably frequently. \u201cUm \u2026 er \u2026 in passing,\u201d said Forbes. Miliband, he said, had recently visited Newcastle on his way back from a campaigning stint in Scotland and done a campaigning tour of the city\u2019s covered market, but they had not spoken since. What about Ed Balls? \u201cThe only conversation I\u2019ve had with Balls,\u201d Forbes said, \u201cended in an argument \u2013 about whether devolution [within England] is the right approach. I think it is, but his view was, \u2018We can\u2019t all move at the same speed, and therefore we\u2019ve got to move at the speed of the slowest\u2019 \u2013 to paraphrase.\u201d This exchange happened at a fundraising dinner, as Balls toured the tables. \u201cI was irritated, because it reinforced the Westminster-centric mentality: the idea that you get into power, to pull levers to make lives better for people,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cBut I think that experience has shown that they\u2019re rubber levers. People pull them but nothing happens. It makes our politics look even more hollow.\u201d When Forbes\u2019s anxiety about the cuts was at its height, he had regular discussions with other Labour leaders of English cities, but the party\u2019s national organisation never called them together to work out any collective stance. \u201cWe were on our own. Everywhere was on its own,\u201d he said. To that, there was one obvious response: That wasn\u2019t very good, was it? Across the country, the Labour party was \u2013 is \u2013 faced with a grave set of circumstances. And of the national leadership wasn\u2019t interested in that, it wasn\u2019t much of a signal to send out, surely? \u201cI don\u2019t want to be critical of individuals,\u201d Forbes told me. \u201cBut for a party that has solidarity as one of its core values, there wasn\u2019t a great deal of it on show.\u201dWhen I first met Forbes in early 2013, just as popular fury about the cuts was growing, he sometimes had the air of a man in a state of shock, thrown by the business of having to push through economies of which he really wanted no part, and the hostility he had kicked up. Indeed, when I followed him to a meeting about the government\u2019s plans for the benefits system, held at a women\u2019s centre close to Benwell, he came close to looking downright scared. Eighteen months on, he was much more assured, and the qualities that set him apart from much of his political milieu were all the more evident. When he met a dozen-strong group of Labour councillors from other parts of the north-east to discuss radically changing the arrangements for local buses \u2013 Newcastle\u2019s fares are a big source of grievance in the city \u2013 he was the only person in the room under 50: urbane and drily funny where others were often gruff and withdrawn. At one point, he spent an hour going through a diary which included everything from plans for visits from Chinese trade delegations to a desperate letter a man who had just become homeless (According to the city council, rough sleeping in Newcastle has trebled since 2011.) Soon after, he met four newly-elected Labour councillors \u2013 all women \u2013 who bemoaned the city council\u2019s seemingly institutionalised conservatism, and talked about the effects of the cuts on their local wards. Some of them represented affluent parts of the city, but still mentioned the visible decline of Newcastle\u2019s physical and aesthetic fabric: park lawns left unmowed, trees unpruned \u2013 and rubbish, always rubbish. From time to time, Forbes talked more enthusiastically than ever about the current vogue for devolution, the delicate negotiations it entails with national politicians, and how Newcastle might benefit: he thinks taking back power from Whitehall will \u201chelp set citizens free from a sense of hopelessness and neglect\u201d. His big problem is the fact that on current projections, his ideas about city government as a powerful force may soon fade into nothing, as Newcastle effectively goes bust.   * * *      The Millennium Bridge and Baltic Mill art centre. Photograph: Paul Thompson/Getty Images    Newcastle has attributes that can make any visitor quickly fall in love with the place: a deep sense of history, dizzying Saturday-night hedonism, the swirl of energy and creativity around its two universities, and an addictive sense of life being lived far from the shadow of London. The elegance of much of its city centre rises to a peak on Grey Street, the perfectly proportioned thoroughfare that is arguably England\u2019s most breathtaking example of 19th-century urban architecture. I walked from my hotel on the south bank of the Tyne, past the hulking Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art (opened in 2002), over the Millennum Bridge and into the city. On the undulating roof of the Sage, the concert complex designed by Norman Foster, built at a cost of \u00a370m and opened in December 2004, two men tethered by ropes were polishing the glass panels, one by one; on the north side of the water, people were emerging from well-appointed apartment blocks. It was one of those clear autumn mornings when metal glints and the sun\u2019s rays bounce off water. Superficially, Newcastle and neighbouring Gateshead looked like the embodiment of the post-industrial dreams \u2013 \u201cliving on thin air,\u201d as one former adviser to Tony Blair put it \u2013 that defined the giddy opening years of New Labour, many of whose prime movers \u2013 Blair, Peter Mandelson, Alan Milburn, David Miliband, Stephen Byers \u2013 had parliamentary seats in this part of the country. This patina of success reflects the story of Newcastle United, the 25th richest football club in the world in terms of annual revenue, who in 2010 were restored to the Premier League. But other aspects of their recent history speak of more troubling aspects of life in the city. The club\u2019s owner \u2013 none too popular with many fans, and said to be preparing to sell up \u2013 is Mike Ashley, the billionaire behind the retail chain Sports Direct, 85% of whose staff are on zero-hours contracts. The team\u2019s shirts once bore the insignia of Northern Rock, the north-east institution whose demise kicked off the financial crash in Britain; they now feature the logo of the payday lenders Wonga \u2013 which even adorned replica kits for children (until they recently decided that this was not quite in keeping with the ethics of a \u201cresponsible lender\u201d). In Newcastle, even the escapist pleasures of sport are weighted with the reminder of dire issues: the \u00a383m that has been taken out of the city\u2019s economy every year by benefit cuts, or the fact that the Northeast has the highest rate of unemployment in the UK. At the Citizens Advice on Nelson Street, where Georgian and Victorian architecture nudges up against the brutalist Eldon Square shopping centre (another monument to the visions of T Dan Smith), I spent two mornings observing encounters with people at the sharp end of those problems, who had come in seeking help. At 10am, they began crowding into the reception area: most accepting the wait, with the odd person crashing in and venting their frustration to anyone who would \u2013 or wouldn\u2019t - listen. Most of the people I observed trying to address seemingly intractable problems were women. One had registered for jobseeker\u2019s allowance, assumed all was well, and had what she assumed would be free dental treatment \u2013 only to be hit with a \u00a350 bill, and \u00a3100 penalty for saying she was on out-of-work benefits before her claim had been officially signed off. Another woman who worked as a carer on a zero-hours contract \u2013 for \u00a36.50 an hour, she said \u2013 had been confronted with a \u00a31,500 demand for overpaid tax credits, those supposed kindnesses designed for a world in which people\u2019s hours did not wildly vary. She now also owed \u00a3617 in unpaid council tax, and had been threatened with a visit from bailiffs. Debt collectors had proposed that she pay off the debt at the rate of \u00a345 a fortnight. \u201cI told them I couldn\u2019t afford that,\u201d she told me, \u201cand they said, \u2018Well you\u2019ve got to\u2019.\u201d\u201cWhat\u2019s changed is the amount of work that we now do that would have previously been done by the state \u2013 by civil servants, or the city council. Particularly for vulnerable people,\u201d said Shona Alexander, the bureau\u2019s chief executive. A quarter of her paid staff had gone. She said she worried that the demise of preventive support would only cause more problems to fester. And within 10 minutes, she mentioned reductions to Sure Start. \u201cWe just dread to think what\u2019ll happen when that\u2019s cut back,\u201d she said. \u201cThat will be absolutely massive. Without that support, a lot of families will struggle.\u201d Here was a clue to another aspect of the city council\u2019s problems: it is currently owed \u00a312.5m in unpaid council tax. One woman I met said that until recently, she had worked full-time at a barber\u2019s shop, for a boss who never gave his employees payslips. Determined to get a better job, she had then started training as a lecturer in hairdressing, which meant going from full-time to part-time, and claiming housing benefit. But the latter required the payslips she couldn\u2019t get \u2013 and very quickly, she found herself behind on her rent and council tax, and \u00a3800 in arrears for both. She had left the old job, and was still trying to get her payslips, to no avail; she had been to the city council for help and advice, but evidently not got very far. She glanced at a poster about domestic violence. A couple of years ago, she had exited an abusive relationship. \u201cI left with two black bags and my two daughters while he was out,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then, I was just putting my life back together, but I keep thinking I\u2019ve done something wrong, because all this has happened.\u201d She broke down in tears. And then she said something so straightforward that it might easily have sounded banal, had it not reflected both her travails, and those of the whole city. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain,\u201d she said. \u201cYou work hard your entire life. And then you need help. But you just don\u2019t seem to get it.\u201d At a six-day-a-week youth club rub by the YMCA in the faded Newgate shopping centre, nine of its teenage regulars answered my questions with a very adolescent mixture of wry amusement and flashes of insight. Most of them had parents who had come to the city from abroad \u2013 Nigeria, Brazil, Zimbabwe and Angola. They made disaffected noises about the cost of higher education, older siblings on minimum wage jobs, and the sense that in the last five years, the opportunities presented to people their age had shrunk. But they talked most ruefully about the council\u2019s closure of the huge City Pool, opened in 1927, where the Newcastle Amateur Swimming Club recently trained three Olympians. \u201cThey should never, ever have closed that,\u201d said Marcelo Neves, 16. Until last year, he had gone there every Friday; now, he said, he had stopped swimming altogether. They were watched by Jeff Hurst, 52, an \u00e9migr\u00e9 from Croydon who moved here \u201cfor love\u201d, and is now the YMCA\u2019s chief executive. Entry charges to swimming pools transferred from the council to a new trust, he said, have recently gone up by nearly a quarter. At the same time, the increasingly parlous state of the city\u2019s parks was clearly diminishing their appeal. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 50% of six-year-olds in our city who are either overweight or obese. We\u2019ve got some of the least active people in the country, and some of the poorest people in the country,\u201d he said. \u201cSo where\u2019s the sense in that?\u201d Among his biggest concerns, he said, was the council\u2019s drastic cuts to youth services and play centres. More cuts in help for young people would affect drug and alcohol advice, and programmes for teenage pregnancy. Hurst mentioned that the recent Jay report into child sexual exploitation in Rotherham had made repeated reference to the importance of youth work, and worries raised by the people involved in it about the consequences of cuts. Newcastle has its own sexual exploitation case, focused on the west end of the city, with grimly familiar elements (taxi firms, takeaways, vulnerable girls and young women), which has so far led to over 50 arrests. \u201cYoung people need someone they can trust, someone they can go to without it triggering a formal intervention,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd if you can take away youth workers, they have only have their family. And for a lot young people, the last people they\u2019ll go to are their parents. \u201cQuite soon,\u201d he said, \u201cwe\u2019ll see the results of that.\u201d  * * *  When I spent time with Forbes in early October, there were moments when grim stories would momentarily give way to flashes of optimism, and he and his colleagues would enthuse about the creative ways some of the cuts had been parried. Partner organisations and volunteers had saved nine of 10 libraries that had been threatened with closure: in the middle-class suburb of Jesmond, I spent an hour at a volunteer-run library that now worked as kind of meeting-space and cultural centre, though the people in charge lamented the fact that they had been cut loose from the city\u2019s library system, so that they couldn\u2019t access books kept elsewhere. The city\u2019s arts budget is now to be handled via an independently-managed \u201cculture fund\u201d which will guarantee half the old budget, and offer low-interest loans to arts groups, as well as being able to solicit money from charity. On the face of it, these stories might feed a fantasy about councils doing \u201cmore with less\u201d. But in Newcastle, as elsewhere, they have proved to be exceptions: strangely enough, cuts tend to lead inexorably to what politicians would call negative outcomes. In October, when anyone mentioned Sure Start, a crackle of anxiety would pass through the room. Four weeks on, in early November, the council had decided how it would cut nearly \u00a35m a year from the relevant budgets: folding what was left of a whole host of services for children and families into a new creation called Community Family Hubs, focusing their efforts on communities with the highest level of deprivation. The only certainty was that money would go, and some of the city\u2019s 20 Sure Start centres would close. Once again, I met Forbes at the civic centre, where he emerged from a long meeting about the city\u2019s new ways of funding the arts, wearing his customary pin-stripe suit. He agreed that there would inevitably be needy children and families who would fall just the wrong side of the council\u2019s new \u201cdeprivation\u201d line. He also sympathized with the revulsion about this latest cut, which was bound up with the abandonment of a very powerful idea \u2013 that a lot of Sure Start services are universal, and therefore don\u2019t come with the stigma of targeted help for the poor. \u201cI absolutely understand that,\u201d Forbes said. \u201cBut if we have no money, what else can we do?\u201d    But we\u2019ve got to keep our eyes on a far horizon. Because if we don\u2019t, then we simply wallow in self-pity  Nick Forbes     On paper, I suggested, perhaps \u00a34.7m wasn\u2019t that much. \u201cIt is when the council has virtually no money to do anything else with,\u201d he said. So, metaphorically speaking, he was now down to counting out change. \u201cIn budget discussions, we\u2019re down to talking about the last thousand. Seriously: we argue about where the decimal point goes.\u201d And were these cuts the most painful yet? \u201cNo. No,\u201d he said. What could be worse, I asked. \u201cTransport for kids with special educational needs and disabilities.\u201d He paused. \u201cThat is in the pipeline.\u201d Looking ahead, he seemed to worry about one part of the council\u2019s responsibilities more than most. Government funding for children\u2019s social care, he said, has already fallen by a third, while need in Newcastle has gone up by 40%. \u201cWe haven\u2019t cut children\u2019s social care to nearly the same extent that we\u2019ve cut other areas of the council\u2019s budget,\u201d he went on, and he said the council\u2019s role in the city\u2019s ongoing sexual exploitation case proved it. \u201cWe had the teams in place to go in, and make sure children were safe and they were protected from further harm.\u201d He paused. \u201cAnd my very real concern is that \u2026 well, if this level of cuts continue, even our statutory responsibilities, like children\u2019s social care, will be affected. What frustrates me like nothing else is how deaf government is to this argument.\u201d \u201cI think we\u2019re into the realm of impossible cuts,\u201d he said. What, I wondered, keeps him going? What is it to be a progressive politician when most of what you do comes down to the administration of a nightmare? \u201cPart of the progressive nature is dealing with the challenges of today, but also thinking about what tomorrow will look like,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not leading a city in decline. I\u2019m not prepared to lead a city in decline. This is a city with some difficulties, certainly. But we\u2019ve got to keep our eyes on a far horizon. Because if we don\u2019t, then we simply wallow in self-pity.\u201d To have his picture taken, he went up on the roof. The lights of Newcastle were gleaming; traffic was backed up along the Great North Road. In some inexplicable way, and if only for a moment, the scene seemed of a piece with Forbes\u2019s belief in how Newcastle might sooner or later get back on the right track. But then my thoughts flitted back to Benwell, a place staring into the future with much more uncertainty. That morning, above an off-licence, I had glimpsed a spectacularly incongruous billboard announcing high-end flights on Emirates, advertising a new daily service from Newcastle to Dubai. \u201cEnjoy business class to over 140 destinations worldwide,\u201d it said, to no one in particular. Bottom right, it featured the airline\u2019s current strapline, which in among the piled-up rubbish and endless worry, was so dissonant that it seemed almost absurd: \u201cHello Tomorrow.\u201d Follow the Long Read on Twitter: @gdnlongread \u2022 This article was amended on 25 November.

Top Bollywood stars such as Shah Rukh Khan and Salman Khan, idolised by tens of millions in south Asia and beyond, are among those who have been threatened in recent months. \u201cThe threats serve a purpose. The target is not the celebrity as such. The aim is to make other people think that if the extortionist is prepared to go after such high-profile people then they had better pay up and keep quiet,\u201d a senior police officer dealing with crime in Mumbai said. Though India\u2019s economic boom has faltered in recent years, two decades of growth have generated vast amounts of money and thus, police say, many wealthy individuals who are prime targets for extortion. Investigators have intercepted communications indicating that gunmen have been told not to hurt top film stars but simply to scare them. \u201cWhen there was a serious attempt on one star\u2019s life, we were listening to the instructions to the gunmen and heard him being told: \u201cThis time, shoot this one properly,\u201d the senior officer said.     Bollywood star Salman Khan has also been threatened. Photograph: Rafiq Maqbool/AP    Targets appear to have also been chosen to generate maximum attention. Anything involving top stars will be widely reported across India\u2019s raucous media, while Bhatt, the director, is known for speaking out on a range of issues, and particularly links between the film industry and criminals. For many years Bollywood, which produces more than 350 films each year, generating an estimated $50bn-plus revenue, has been almost synonymous with the notorious gangs of Mumbai, a city of more than 20 million people. The relationship has long been a tempestuous one. Black money flowed into often high-risk productions which would otherwise have not received funding while some actors and gang members became close. Wanted criminals were regular guests at big Bollywood weddings and other functions. \u201cIn the 1990s they were everywhere \u2013 funding, planting their people inside, even deciding casting,\u201d said Hussain Zaidi, one of India\u2019s best-known crime reporters and an expert on the Mumbai underworld. At the end of the decade, a series of directors and producers were attacked and several killed, while many more secretly paid large sums or handed over lucrative rights to criminals. Now big corporations are more likely to back major productions than underworld dons. New legal structures, based on practices elsewhere in the world, also protect actors and directors from extortionists. Previously, criminals regularly demanded that producers gave them rights to overseas distribution. Now rights are held by anonymous trusts or companies, which cannot be intimidated. The gangs themselves are also much weaker. Many suffered significant losses at the beginning of the last decade from specially formed armed police units that shot hundreds of suspected members on sight. These \u201cencounter specialists\u201d were later disbanded but not before many of the most notorious gang leaders were forced into exile or killed. Zaidi, the crime writer, said that most of those involved in the recent threats to Bollywood celebrities were not major underworld figures. \u201cAll the big guys have pretty much retired so these are just desperadoes trying to establish themselves and cash in on the fear factor,\u201d he told the Guardian. Police say the threats have come from a gang leader called Ravi Pujari, who they believe is now based either in Australia or the west coast of the US.     Bollywood films such as the Gangs of Wasseypur show India\u2019s fascination with the underworld    Many top criminals once based in the Gulf have now moved further afield and use digital communications technology to disguise their location when making threats. Pujari was born and raised in Mumbai\u2019s northern suburb of Andheri and started his criminal career with the gang of an established mafia boss. Wanted in India on charges relating to more than 30 cases of extortion, the 43-year-old high school dropout had been \u201cbelow the radar\u201d until the recent series of threats to Bollywood figures, police officers said. \u201cOne possibility may be that with economic growth picking up, developers are more active and he thinks now is a time to make some money,\u201d one told the Guardian. Another suggested that the gangsters were \u201cin search of a new business model\u201d. Dawood Ibrahim, suspected of masterminding a devastating bombing campaign in Mumbai in 1993, remains the most-wanted Indian underworld figure. Indian police believe Ibrahim fled Mumbai for Dubai before finding a safe haven in Karachi, the port city in Pakistan. Last week Rajnath Singh, the home minister, said the fugitive criminal was hiding somewhere on the neighbouring state\u2019s border with Afghanistan. The success of gangster films such as Satya, Company, Shootout At Lokhandwala, Gangs of Wasseypur and Once Upon A Time In Mumbaai testifies to the enduring fascination of the underworld for Indians. In many cases involving Bollywood and the gangs, life has a habit of imitating life as well as vice versa. Abu Salem, described as \u201cone of the most colourful gangsters in the pantheon\u201d by local media, is reported to be writing his memoirs in prison.

Quantum Siege, a fast-paced thriller about a terrorist threat to India, is his first novel and draws on his experience of day-to-day life in the police. His friend, Hussain Zaidi, is a popular author of crime fiction, which he bases on the stories he learned during his former career as a journalist. Here they discuss the reality and perception of policing in Mumbai ...     Brijesh Singh    Hussain Zaidi: \u201cWhat inspired you to write your novel, Quantum Siege?\u201d Brijesh Singh: \u201cI wanted to paint a plausible picture of what happens when Lashkar-e-Taiba or a similar terrorist group calls up the prime minister of India and says, \u2018Choose between Mumbai and Kashmir: you can save only one - and you have only this much time.\u2019\u201d HZ: \u201cDid you put yourself in the shoes of the protagonist while writing the book?\u201d BS: \u201cThis is a difficult question to answer. The protagonist has a very similar profile, he is a law enforcement officer \u2013 yet this question was not in my mind when I wrote the book. However, I have been in law enforcement for almost two decades now, so it\u2019s like breathing: all these situations we see in the novel, in some measure one has been through them.\u201d HZ: \u201cLet\u2019s talk about the real-life police force. What do you think about Mumbai police officers? I mean, they do all kinds of unconventional things. I heard that the Mumbai police is the only police force in the country which resorts to \u2018encounters\u2019 rather than going for a proper investigation.\u201d BS: \u201cNo, there were times when these kinds of allegations were raised, but those were unusual times which demanded unusual solutions. The gangs were killing each other and killing citizens left, right and centre. At that time, these people also came into conflict with law enforcement; they were armed, they were ready to shoot, and they were determined and skilled.  \u201cIt was a situation where, if you come across such a person, either he shoots or you shoot. Fortunately, times have changed and we don\u2019t face such organised crimes to that extent now. But we have a worse enemy, which is lurking in the background.\u201d HZ: \u201cWhat about this allegation of cops being used by rival gangs to settle their scores and eliminate their rivals?\u201d BS: \u201cLaw enforcement is a job that is shrouded in mystery; there will always be allegations. Even in a simple case, there will always be somebody who is the affected party and has a very different version [of events]. People\u2019s sense of justice is much more dependent upon how they are treated and what they get as an outcome.\u201d HZ: \u201cWhat about the politicisation of the Mumbai police? I heard that they have been reduced to mere pawns by powerful politicians.\u201d BS: \u201cIn my many years of service, I don\u2019t think anybody has ever called me to influence any investigation. In the course of your job, you learn to take these calls and ignore them, or to give the proper response to anybody daring to make such a call.\u201d     Hussain Zaidi    VIP security HZ: \u201cWe see policemen being used for VIP security and trying to clear the entire road for the entourage to pass. Is that a misuse of power?\u201d BS: \u201cI think VIP security is an essential issue in India. If you look at political assassinations, Indira Gandhi was assassinated and her son Rajiv Gandhi was too, and the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh also faced a serious assassination attempt.  \u201cWe know there are lots of forces both across the border and within the country that are bent upon taking down very important targets. So, while I agree there is an element of public inconvenience involved, I don\u2019t think we can compromise on VIP security at any cost. Given the traffic on our roads and given the way our [public] places are crowded, it\u2019s a very difficult thing to handle VIP security \u2013 but still it\u2019s being handled right. HZ: \u201cDon\u2019t feel bad, but I don\u2019t have too high a regard for the Mumbai police. This is a police force who I like and who I also hate. Like, because they are really working against all odds to police a city with 15 million people, and have to be on their toes constantly from one festival to another providing security on so many counts. \u201cBut at the same time, looking at the capability, looking at the talent, looking at the skills, I realise they could be much better. So, when I see them faltering, I feel very bad. After the 26 November 2008 terrorist attack, I realised the Mumbai police could have done much better.\u201d BS: \u201cI have to be; it\u2019s my alma mater and my bread and butter. And I have seen how the force is constrained, from resources to the legal structure to the general environment in the country. Within these constraints, whatever performance we are getting is very good.\u201d Memories of 26/11 HZ: \u201cWhere were you during the 26 November 2008 attacks?\u201d BS: \u201cI was in Nagpur at that time, 1,000km away. But I was on the phone with my wife and kids. My house is just adjacent to the Cama Hospital and all night there was firing going on. Yet I couldn\u2019t even take a gun and, you know, rush into it. It was very bad! \u201cI used to be in charge of that area until two or three months before [the 26 November attack], when I was shifted to a paramilitary force: the state reserve police force. But I still knew that area like the back of my hand, and I knew what was going on.  \u201cVery early on, when the phone calls started pouring in, I knew it was a terrorist attack. But at that time there was so much confusion, so much information flowing from everywhere \u2013 in retrospect we know that this many people came from here, but at the time it was just mayhem.\u201d HZ: \u201cSenior officers, such as Mr Karkare and Mr Kamte, I think they got killed close to your house, in the same area that you live?\u201d BS: \u201cYes, it was very close to my house.\u201d HZ: \u201cSo was there some fear when you heard they were prowling in your area and around your place?\u201d BS: \u201cI was continuously on the phone to my family. I told them to put all the lights off. Even so, there was so much firing going on in the vicinity that a stray bullet could definitely have entered.\u201d HZ: \u201cHow do you compare the policing in this city with other metropolises in India such as Delhi, Bangalore and Kolkata?\u201d BS: \u201cBroadly speaking it is similar, but I think the Mumbai police is one of the best forces in the world. Its rate of detection and investigation is phenomenal. There probably hasn\u2019t been a single case of terrorism that the Mumbai police or the Maharashtra police has not cracked. I think they do very well.\u201d HZ: \u201cThe detection levels might be good, but there are statistics to prove that the conviction rate has been dismal in the courts.\u201d BS: \u201cWhat happens with convictions is not within the line of the police. Conviction is about fitting a story to the law. The law understands and decides things to be in a very particular strict logical order. All this is post facto studied in a very ideal atmosphere; there is a very learned lawyer who is paid very well by the opposite party, who may be a criminal, to poke holes. But I should say in recent years, conviction rates have been rising in Maharashtra and Mumbai. A lot of effort has been made to improve investigation and conviction has been steadily rising.\u201d Mumbai police HZ: \u201cYou have been associated with the Mumbai Police for a long time. Don\u2019t you find that your lead character, Rudra Pratap, is in contrast with real policeman? They are a bit different.\u201d BS: \u201cIn what sense?\u201d HZ: \u201cWell, this guy is into Zen philosophy. Even in the worst of crises, when people are looking into a very difficult scenario, this guy comes up with some anecdotes, some story to tell them and to learn from it.\u201d BS: \u201cWhat people see of policemen is not even the tip of the iceberg. I have colleagues who are very intelligent, who are very learned \u2013 especially those from the state civil services or union public service commission. They are people who have been chosen among lakhs [hundreds of thousands] of people, they have taken a variety of subjects to get through this exam. They are very well read and very well informed. \u201cI have seen this in interaction with various police forces across the world. I have seen that we are, if not better, then on a par with everybody. This does not come out because normally we are reticent; we are not allowed to speak; we have various kinds of rules and regulations that prevent us from speaking about various topics. And this gives rise to a subculture of silence. But in our internal talks, in our internal discussions, they are as lively as anyone else.\u201d HZ: \u201cThe police chief in your story relies very much on one particular guy, the hero. Does it happen in real life too? That they bank on only one main capable guy, while the police force consists of many officers?\u201d BS: \u201cCertain situations demand a certain mix of skills. But my book is a very microscopic view of two-and-a-half days, so there are things that probably are not in focus in this book that, in a real situation, may be happening. With the limitation of the craft, you have to focus on a certain individual \u2013 otherwise it would become like a documentary.\u201d HZ: \u201cIt\u2019s a pleasure to know that a cop can write so well and can be such a good spin-master about stories. Have you ever thought about changing your vocation?\u201d BS: \u201cPresently, I think policing is still satisfactory, I am satisfied with my job.\u201d HZ: \u201cA lot of your seniors have joined politics. Have you ever just thought about it?\u201d BS: \u201cNot even remotely ...\u201d HZ: \u201cYour former police commissioner is now a member of the national parliament. Others have been in the fray, trying to contest \u2026\u201d BS: \u201cI think it\u2019s great that they are wanting to contribute to the public good even after retirement or leaving their job. If you have a member of parliament or member of the legislative assembly who is so educated and has seen things from the inside, then I think it\u2019s boon. I just don\u2019t think I have it in me \u2013 I may rather sit back and write books!\u201d Ancient Indian history HZ: \u201cI heard that after Quantum Siege, you are bringing out a book on Indian history. Is that true?\u201d BS: \u201cMy ancient Indian history book is almost complete. It\u2019s gone to the editor.\u201d HZ: \u201cCan you tell us briefly about the story?\u201d BS: \u201cIf you look at Indian history, there was a very famous war of Kalinga wherein Emperor Ashoka routed the state of Kalinga, which was a very developed country in 260BC. So this happened in 261BC and, by Ashoka\u2019s own account, 100,000 people were killed and 150,000 were taken prisoners of war.  \u201cMy story is of the resurgence of Kalinga nationalism under one dynasty: not only did it reconstruct Kalinga as a vibrant nation, it also went on to capture Magadh, the seat of Ashoka, 100 years after his demise. It\u2019s a wonderful story about the rise of a people from the ashes, and the personal journey of the protagonist.\u201d HZ: \u201cAnd when is it coming out?\u201d BS: \u201cI am yet to confirm dates, but I think it should definitely come out next year.\u201d HZ: \u201cHow does it feel, being a cop, that you are also such a sought-after author?\u201d BS: \u201cI don\u2019t know \u2013 I am new to this world of writing so I have no parameters. I have just been fortunate and have been guided by the best in the field.\u201d HZ: \u201cWhy didn\u2019t you think of doing a sequel to Quantum Siege, instead of jumping to such serious subjects?\u201d BS: \u201cI got sort of exhausted with this one novel \u2026 let\u2019s say, I do it every day for a living this crime business. So after I wrote it, it was out of my system.\u201d HZ: \u201cYes, but if the people enjoyed it so much, it definitely should inspire you to do a sequel. If I were in your place, and since it\u2019s only your first book, I would try to ensure that I brought out all that is in me about the thriller genre.\u201d BS: \u201cHow about you, what are you writing next?\u201d HZ: \u201cAbu Salem, the third book in my mafia trilogy, is out in November. That\u2019s the last of my mafia books \u2013 then let\u2019s see next year.\u201d BS: \u201cI heard you are planning something serious on terrorism\u2026\u201d HZ: \u201cYes, I have signed a three-book deal with Penguin; one is called Mafia Queens of India, then there is Six Decades of Terror in India. The third title is still undecided.\u201d BS: \u201cHow do you feel about shifting from being a successful figure in the press to being a very successful author?\u201d HZ: \u201cI don\u2019t know about that. But it was easy to shift gears, because whatever I have gathered in my 20 years\u2019 experience, all those notes and all those stories can be brought into a book form. Instead of trying to write 30 articles over a period of six months, you just compile all of them together to make a book.  \u201cThat\u2019s how it happened in Mafia Queens of Mumbai and in Dongri to Dubai too; it was a compilation of the lives of so many gangsters, which became one collective book with so many characters. People love to read that kind of stuff, so I would say I was lucky.\u201d BS: \u201cI\u2019ve heard that you are the most sought-after writer in Bollywood\u2026\u201d HZ: \u201cBollywood is a content-starved industry, they don\u2019t have original content. So either they take content from Hollywood or they take it from books. Now, there is a certain segment of filmmakers who like to make movies of Indian mafia or who like to take stories from real life. It\u2019s this section who have chosen to pick up my books and have started adapting them into movies.\u201d BS: \u201cAnd the movies are also doing very well.\u201d HZ: \u201cBlack Friday did very well. Wadala made money, but was not quite so successful.\u201d BS: \u201cWhat are your future plans?\u201d HZ: \u201cI think I have said goodbye to journalism, but I will keep writing books, because that\u2019s my bread-and-butter now. As long as people are reading me and are ready to tolerate me, I will keep writing.\u201d", "title": "Mumbai after 26/11: policeman Brijesh Singh meets fellow author Hussain Zaidi", "sentences": ["\u201cThat\u2019s how it happened in Mafia Queens of Mumbai and in Dongri to Dubai too; it was a compilation of the lives of so many gangsters, which became one collective book with so many characters."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-26T08:20:17Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/26/adam-scott-rory-mcilroy-australian-open-golf", "tags": ["Adam Scott", "Rory McIlroy", "Henrik Stenson", "Golf", "The Masters", "Australia sport", "Sport"], "article": "Adam Scott is far too polite to publicly speak of revenge missions. Still, it is hardly a leap of faith to infer the 2013 Masters winner will have precisely that on his mind during the Australian Open. Twelve months ago, a horrible spell for Rory McIlroy at least ended on a professional high. He recovered from four shots adrift of Scott with 18 holes to play in Sydney to claim his only title of the year. Scott, who had already won the Australian Masters and PGA Championship on his visit home, was wounded despite what he admits was a \u201cfantastic\u201d Sunday of golf. \u201cI played great but it really hurt me that I didn\u2019t win,\u201d Scott says. \u201cBut Rory was flawless, exactly how you need to be when you are starting four shots back. \u201cI had my opportunities on 16 and 17, didn\u2019t take them and Rory made a couple of nice putts to stay in it. I made an error on the last which was very disappointing because it would have been nice to sweep them all.\u201d Scott believes the notion the Australian Open was the one juncture which kick-started McIlroy\u2019s return to top form is a simplistic one. \u201cIt was going to happen anyway,\u201d he says. \u201cHe was looking pretty good but you might be drawing a bit of a long bow; it was another eight months before he really played the way we are now thinking he was playing [all along]. \u201cRory was on the way back, he looked really solid that day in the position he was in. It was inevitable that we would be playing great golf again.\u201d Henrik Stenson\u2019s victory in Dubai on Sunday means the Swede leapt above Scott and into No2 in the world rankings behind McIlroy. Scott is admirably open about his desire to challenge McIlroy\u2019s position. \u201cIt is a big thing, absolutely. I would like to get it [No1] back. I believe Rory and myself have the ability to really separate and I would welcome anybody else as part of that challenge. \u201cThis summer Rory has lifted the bar again and it is good when people do that. It spurs me along. Hopefully I can raise my game and push everyone else along.\u201d This time of year marks Scott\u2019s annual visit to Australia. He will spend Christmas there, along with his wife, Marie. The development of golf in Australia, which was boosted significantly by Scott\u2019s triumph at Augusta National, is clearly important to the 34-year-old from Adelaide. \u201cEspecially coming off last year, winning a couple of events at home, but it is a big deal for me being back,\u201d Scott says. \u201cThere has been a bit of momentum around golf in Australia over the last couple of years, even three or four, so it is great to try to keep that going. If I play well, that helps. Having Rory there helps. Jordan Spieth is also going to be there so there are a lot of exciting things about the event. I feel like my game is in a good spot, I had a good spell of rest recently and I\u2019m ready to go. \u201cThere has been a huge change to the way I am received. Everyone loves a winner, I suppose. That particularly applies to Aussie sports fans. It was a big deal winning the Masters because I was the first Aussie. The reception I received everywhere at home last year was amazing. It is incredible to think how far that one tournament reaches; it goes way beyond the game. It had a big impact not only on golf but on my profile at home.\u201d He adds: \u201cI was really lucky to grow up at a time when we had the No1 player in the world [Greg Norman] for a pretty long period of time. With Greg, there were a lot of other major champions as well. These people became great role models for my generation. I have reached that age now where I have got to try to do the same thing; hopefully through playing good golf around the world then coming home and playing some more, another bunch of kids get the same feeling as I did.\u201d Annoyance is Scott\u2019s sentiment when the issue of banning the anchored putting stroke is been raised.

Denmark Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 The Danes have a superb health service, egalitarian wealth distribution, low-cost or free childcare, 52 weeks\u2019 fully paid parental leave and an admirable community spirit (40% do voluntary work). According to the University of Warwick, they may also be genetically predisposed to happiness.  But more likely \u2026 They don\u2019t expect much excitement out of life. The world\u2019s best preserved bog man, in Moesg\u00e5rd Museum, is visited by more than 160,000 people each year, many of them locals.  2. Norway Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 Norway has superb public health care, high life expectancy and the one of the world\u2019s highest per capita GDPs.  But more likely \u2026 The Norwegians have a refreshing approach to rank and honours. In 2008, they actually knighted a penguin. \u201cNils Olav\u201d, mascot of the King\u2019s Guard, was already a colonel-in-chief. 3. Switzerland Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 The Swiss are the healthiest population in the western hemisphere, and have the eighth-lowest rate of depression in the world. Plus they haven\u2019t been at war since 1815.  But more likely \u2026 They can look themselves (or at least their pets) in the eye. It\u2019s illegal to keep just one guinea pig in Switzerland. You must have them in pairs and there is a \u201crent-a-guinea pig\u201d service to provide companionship for lonely animals in their twilight years. 4. The Netherlands Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 Nearly 75% of 15- to 64-year-olds have a paid job, and 82% of people say they have more positive experiences in an average day (pride in accomplishment, enjoyment, etc) than negative ones (pain, worry, sadness, etc).  But more likely \u2026 The average Dutch person drinks 76 litres of beer a year, according to the Kirin Beer University. Britons manage just 69. 5. Sweden Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 Sweden is the second-best country in the world in which to grow old, according to Global Age Watch. But more likely \u2026 The Swedes ingeniously export their misery in the form of self-assembly furniture. 6. Canada Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 Canada has high average life expectancy, high average incomes, minimal corporate or political corruption and robust social ties. But more likely \u2026 Canada\u2019s vainglorious neighbour the US comes only 17th in the UN happiness table. That, plus maple syrup and impossibly cute moose, is bound to put a spring in the step. 7. Finland Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 Despite a reputation for suicides, depression, alcoholism and cold, dark winters, Finland scores high for education, health, economic dynamism and political stability. But more likely \u2026 Finns have a superb sense of humour. Here\u2019s a traditional Finnish joke. Two Finns are in a bar. After hours of silence, one man raises his glass to the other and says, \u201cCheers\u201d. The other man snaps back, \u201cI didn\u2019t come here for conversation\u201d.      Some typical Austrians. Photograph: jodelweg.at     8. Austria Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 With average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita of $29,256 versus the OECD average of $23,938, Austria has been only marginally affected by the economic crisis. But more likely \u2026 The natural endorphin booster that is yodelling is a national pastime. If you want to try it for yourself, the Internet Yodel Course promises you can learn the art in 10 free lessons. 9. Iceland Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 Icelanders remain stoically upbeat (73% say they are content, compared with only 50% of western Europeans and 33% of North Americans), despite volcanic eruptions, earthquakes, and the 2008 financial collapse. But more likely \u2026 A majority of Icelanders believe in elves, which gives them a humbler and therefore happier relationship with a world that would otherwise be cold, materialistic and spiritually bankrupt. 10. Australia Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 Australians have the fifth-highest per capita income in the world, as well as good education and health services, and economic and political freedoms.  But more likely \u2026 Australians get to watch free kangaroo boxing from their suburban homes while they drink beer and fire up their barbies.  11. Israel Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 Despite enduring Arab-Israeli strife, Israel scores highly for wealth, freedom and education. Plus it enjoys a higher life expectancy than Germany or the Netherlands.  But more likely \u2026 The country is a hotbed of innovation. One Israeli startup has developed a suitcase that swells from carry-on to full size using a built-in electric pump. It also turns into a table.  12. Costa Rica Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 The highest-scoring developing country in the UN happiness index, Costa Rica, has a 96% literacy rate and life expectancy of 77 years for men and 82 for women. But more likely \u2026 The country recently had a president called Chinchilla. You\u2019d have to smile, wouldn\u2019t you?     Some typical New Zealanders. Photograph: Getty Images    13. New Zealand Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 The world\u2019s best place to raise a child, according to HSBC\u2019s Expat Explorer Report, New Zealand scores well for health and education too. But more likely \u2026 Sheep outnumber humans seven to one. Who could be miserable among so many lamb chops? 14. United Arab Emirates Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 According the OECD, the UAE rates highly for life expectancy, job security and quality of family life. But more likely \u2026 In Dubai, petrol is generally cheaper than drinking water, and the local police force uses Lamborghinis to catch speeding motorists, which sounds like fun. 15. Panama Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 Panama has a thriving economy, thanks to a cautious banking sector, as well as strong family ties and a beautiful landscape. But more likely \u2026 Panamanians can swim in the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean in the same day, all the while devising palindromes such as, \u201cA man, a plan, a canal \u2013 Panama!\u201d 16. Mexico Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 Despite low incomes, poverty and rampant corruption, Mexicans are happier than their North American neighbours, possibly because they know money is not the secret of happiness. But more likely \u2026 In Oaxaca, a special Christmas festival celebrates the radish, typifying the Mexican attitude to life. It\u2019s the little things that make us truly happy.  17. US Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 Americans are increasingly realising that riches aren\u2019t the same as happiness. While 43% of Americans surveyed in last year\u2019s LifeTwist Study said that they\u2019ve experienced a financial setback, more than 50% said that such experiences have helped them realise what\u2019s truly important in life. But more likely \u2026 One in seven Americans has at least 10 credit cards, thus demonstrating a deludedly upbeat attitude to the future. 18. Ireland Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 Ireland has a strong sense of community \u2013 95% of people believe that they know someone they could rely on in a time of need. But more likely \u2026 The country is snake-free and lacks several species common elsewhere in Europe, such as weasels and polecats, any one of which would shoot up your trousers and administer a nasty nip given half the chance. All of which is good for national morale. 19. Luxembourg Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 Average household net-adjusted disposable income per capita is $35,635 per year, much higher than the OECD average. And life expectancy is 81 years.  But more likely \u2026 Though surrounded by overbearing giants like France and Germany, the Grand Duchy has retained Luxembourgish as an official language. Which means the natives can be as rude as they like to tourists without losing their custom. 20. Venezuela Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, the Venezuelan government decided to keep investing in social welfare. The result? In 2010 some 84% of Venezuelans reported they were \u201chappy\u201d or \u201cvery happy\u201d. But more likely \u2026 At Christmas the streets in Caracas are blocked off so the people can rollerblade to church. Now, that\u2019s a society that knows how to have a good time. 21. Belgium Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 Belgians have a healthy work-life balance, along with a GDP per capita of $49,888. But more likely \u2026 Belgium produces 220,000 tonnes of chocolate per year. This amounts to 22kg of chocolate per inhabitant.      A typical Briton. Photograph: Getty Images     22. UK Maybe it\u2019s because \u2026 The feelgood factors of the 2012 Olympics and Diamond Jubilee, according to the Office for National Statistics, may have encouraged Britons to revise their life satisfaction upwards despite the effects of recession.  But more likely \u2026 Britons could never admit to being less happy than the French (25) or Germans (26).

Royal Australian Air Force corporal Clinton Burchat\u2019s ominously named Skynet builds on plans by Amazon and Google to deliver small packages by drone. The tech giants are struggling to secure regulatory approval for drone delivery, which the Amazon boss, Jeff Bezos, predicts is still at least four or five years away.  Burchat foresees more practical challenges to the plan. \u201cI think the final few metres of the delivery will be the hardest part,\u201d he said.  \u201cAmazon wants to land a drone in your backyard. Google wants to hover above your backyard and drop the package by string. But that\u2019s no good if you don\u2019t have a backyard; or it could come into contact with children or pets.\u201d       Enter Skynet. Along with his tech-savvy partner on the project, the electronics engineer Grant Bajema, Burchat has designed a barcoded and GPS-tagged net that he believes could be mounted on the homes, balconies and backyards of the near future. GPS could guide the drones to within sight of the net, and LED lights mounted on its corner would shepherd the aircraft the final few metres.  \u201cFrom there, they\u2019d read the barcode on the net, confirm it\u2019s the net that it\u2019s looking for, and then drop the delivery.\u201d Their concept was one of 20 to make the semi-finals of Drones for Good, a prize set up this year by the United Arab Emirates, in a region where drones have particularly terrifying connotations. The opulent gulf state wants to lead what it predicts will be a $10bn industry by 2025, and has offered a US$1m prize to the most promising concept. Burchat will fly to Dubai in February for a two-stage competition, involving a five-minute presentation on the first day followed by a second, more detailed pitch to the judges the next. Yet to be invented is a sensor, mounted on the drone, that could recognise the LED lights on the net then scan its unique barcode \u2013 though a million dollars would certainly help move development along. A long-range search-and-rescue drone that could fly in rough weather to deliver aid and collect information in sea disasters is another contender for the prize money.

The same sentence was extended to her husband, and to Mir Shakil-ur-Rahman, owner of the Jang-Geo media group which broadcast the TV show. All three were ordered to surrender their passports and fined 3m rupees (\u00a38,000).  The offending scene involved Malik re-enacting her own wedding to businessman Asad Bashir Khan while a religious song played in the background. There was outrage following its original broadcast in a daytime programme on Geo TV in May, with blasphemy cases filed against the channel\u2019s owner and the show\u2019s anchorwoman, as well as Malik and her husband. On 26 May, the senior vice president of the Gilgit-Baltistan chapter of Muslim religious organisation Ahle Sunnat Wal Jamaat lodged an official complaint alleging the show had defiled Ahl al-Bayt \u2013 the family of the prophet Muhammad \u2013 in playing \u201ca contemptuous Qawwali\u201d.            Geo TV and the anchorwoman issued apologies, while Malik and Khan left the country as the subsequent investigation took place.  Announcing the verdict on Tuesday, judge Raja Shahbaz ordered the police make arrests under Section 19 (10) of the Anti-Terrorism Act in case of disobedience, as well as sell the properties of the offendants. \u201cAfter evaluation of the entire evidence of the prosecution, I am of the considered opinion that the prosecution has proved its case against proclaimed offenders and absconders,\u201d Shahbaz said.

She also expressed scepticism about its legitimacy.  The order was enforced in Gilgit, whose control is shared between Pakistan and the India-claimed Kashmir region, and verdicts delivered by its courts tend not apply to the rest of Pakistan. \u201cTwenty-six years is a lifetime,\u201d said Malik. \u201cBut I have faith in higher courts in Pakistan.

It may be a manipulated perspective on life, but 200 million people across the world now use the photo app, sharing 60m pictures a day. Yet for some users, Instagram is generating more than appreciative likes and comments as they document their lives, travels and eating habits on their smartphones. From Nike to the Namibian tourist board, brands and organisations are turning to the most followed users in the pursuit of a broader and younger audience \u2013 and are paying handsomely for their services. Cue the rise of the Instagram professionals, users who began using the app for fun but are now earning six-figure salaries and being flown around the world to take photos to share with their thousands, sometimes hundreds of thousands, of followers. One of the most sought after is New Yorker Liz Eswein, 25, who joined Instagram just after it launched in 2010 and began posting pictures of her home city under the account @NewYorkCity as a hobby. She now has more than 1.2 million followers and has been dubbed the \u201cden mother of Instagram\u201d. For each job with a brand, Eswein demands $1 (64p) per like under each sponsored picture on Instagram, on top of a separate fee based on the number of images she takes. Recent sponsored photos have attracted more than 23,000 likes each. Two scenic pictures taken of the Andes during an all-expenses paid trip generated 19,386 and 20,462 likes.

Photograph: Liz Eswein    \u201cInstagram has taken me around the world\u201d said Eswein. \u201cI recently came back from Chile for a project we are working on. I worked with the tourism board for Namibia. I recently went to Shanghai and before that Dubai and Turkey, all for clients. There aren\u2019t words to describe how amazing an experience it\u2019s been, to travel the world and be paid to go to all of these places to take pictures, which is something I love.\u201d Eswein joined forces with Laundry Service, a New York social media agency, to set up an arm of the business to connect her and her network of 1,000 influential Instagram users with some of the world\u2019s top brands. Jason Stein, the agency\u2019s founder, said commercial demand for these photographers in the past year had been \u201ccrazy \u2013 it\u2019s completely out of control\u201d. He added: \u201cContent on Instagram has higher engagement than any other platform in the history of the internet and its free. Companies have realised that one photo on the Instagram account of someone with over 100,000 followers is reaching more people directly than any traditional ad campaign.\u201d The stats may explain why Amazon, fashion brand Michael Kors and others have been recruiting Instagram photographers through Stein\u2019s agency: 90% of users of the app are under 35; more than half of them use it daily; 1,000 comments are posted every second; and 1.6bn likes given every day.     Beacon Falls trail by Brian DiFio. \u2018On average an Instagrammer that\u2019s got 100,000 followers is consistently putting up great photos ... can be making between $5,000 and $10,000 a month.\u2019 Photograph: Brian DiFio    Stein said Instagram photography had become a day job from which \u201csome people are making over six figures\u201d a year. \u201cIt\u2019s become a career. It\u2019s taking what a traditional brand or ad photographer used to be and kind of pumping it with steroids because you own and control all distribution now too.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019d say that these days social media celebrities carry more influence than normal celebrities because people can relate to them. You are following the story of their lives through their photos, it becomes almost a traditional storytelling narrative, and that\u2019s what people gravitate towards \u2013 it\u2019s very similar to the YouTube vloggers and their massive followings.\u201d One of the first people to use the app for commercial means was Brian DiFeo. Like Eswein, he joined Instagram as a 33-year-old with no professional photography experience. But after gaining popularity on the platform, in March 2011 he speculatively emailed the organisers of a New York music festival asking for a free ticket in exchange for taking photos of the event and putting them on to his feed. It proved so successful that sports brand Puma then invited him and fellow Instagrammer Anthony Danielle to document the Volvo Ocean Race in Abu Dhabi, all expenses paid. It was, said DiFeo \u201ccompletely surreal\u201d. In March 2012, after being approached by several other firms for their services, he and Danielle set up The Mobile Media Lab, the first company designed solely to connect the growing Instagram community with companies and brands. It proved to be savvy timing: Facebook bought Instagram the following month in a $1bn deal that made the headlines. Last year The Mobile Media Lab generated more than $1m in revenue.     Anthony Danielle\u2019s photo of 61 street Woodside. Puma recently invited him to document the Volvo Ocean Race in Abu Dhabi, all expenses paid. Photograph: Anthony Danielle    While DiFeo now mainly takes a managerial role, in 2012 he travelled round the US and abroad taking sponsored pictures on Instagram. \u201cFor me the peak was being taken to France [by the champagne house] Veuve Clicquot on a three-day whirlwind tour to pick grapes\u201d he said. \u201cIt was amazing. We stayed in the Veuve Clicquot mansion and drank wine that was bottled before the world war two \u2013 it was a completely mind-boggling experience. And I was just there taking photos on my phone.\u201d To be part of DiFeo\u2019s network, Instagram photographers need a minimum of 10,000 followers each \u2013 with their value directly linked to how many likes and comments they average on their account. Demand over the past year has driven up that value radically. \u201cI remember the first job I took was something like eight photos for $300, as we had no idea of our value back then,\u201d DiFeo said. \u201cNow we pay everybody per photo \u2013 so it could be $250 to $3,000, depending on how many likes and engagements they have. The most we\u2019ve paid for a single photo is $4,000 \u201cOn average an Instagrammer that\u2019s got a good 100,000 followers is consistently putting up great photos and their audience really likes what they\u2019re doing can be making between $5,000 and $10,000 a month. What we see emerging here is a whole other crop of Instagrammers who are now taking this on as a career, are chasing down the jobs and commanding really high price for their work. These are the people making upwards of $70,000 or even $100,000 a year just on Instagram.\u201d Authenticity is important, with Instagrammers keen not to lose followers and therefore value. Full disclosure of all sponsored photos is vital, according to DiFeo.     A photo from Aiala Hernando\u2019s instagram. She sees her commercial Instagram photography as a \u2018fun complement\u2019 to her day job. Photograph: Aiala Hernando    \u201cThe key is finding jobs for Instagrammers that are a really good fit for their feed and that way it doesn\u2019t become to overly commercial and turn off audiences. \u201cIt can occasionally cause some backlash in the comments or the photographers being accused as sellouts but with all of these jobs the photographers have creative control and they know what photos are going to sit well with their audience. As a company we tell all our Instagrammers to have full disclosure of sponsored pictures, either by overtly saying they are very excited with working with a certain brand or by hashtagging the picture with \u2018sponsored by\u2019.\u201d Professional photographers have realised its earning potential. Aiala Hernando, from San Sebasti\u00e1n, Spain, sees her commercial Instagram photography as a \u201cfun complement\u201d to her day job. It earns her an extra $3,000 a month. \u201cRecently I went to Rome to do some work for a hotel, to document these rituals they have,\u201d she said. \u201cI went there for 24 hours three weeks in a row, which was great fun. For a travel job like that I will earn between $2,000 and $5,000 a day. One of my main worries when signing with an agency was making my Instagram feed too commercial, so what I try to do is only accept jobs that match with my content and not post anything too harsh for my audience. I always take photos in my specific style.\u201d DiFeo dismisses the idea that Instagram \u2013 and the commercial photography on it \u2013 is a passing fad. \u201cOver the past year, Instagram has really infiltrated everyday society \u2013 it\u2019s mentioned on TV, it\u2019s mentioned in the news daily \u2013 so it\u2019s here to stay,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in terms of commercial influence, I don\u2019t even think it\u2019s reached its apex.\u201d", "title": "Instagram users turn flash into cash, as companies eye new advertising market", "sentences": ["I recently went to Shanghai and before that Dubai and Turkey, all for clients."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-27T19:10:46Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/nov/27/international-premier-tennis-league", "tags": ["Tennis", "Eugenie Bouchard", "Andy Murray", "Roger Federer", "Sport"], "article": "Tennis is at an intriguing point in its development. The left-field experiments being tried at the end of another draining season will either augment the established, imperfect model that has nonetheless served the game well enough for decades or collapse in acrimony. The first of the new models will be showcased across Asia this weekend. Gathered in four cities thousands of miles apart from Friday until 13 December are players of genuine star quality, whose involvement will be brief and lucrative, as well as some not so well-known outside the game and a few old favourites. If the inaugural International Premier Tennis League (IPTL) does not disintegrate in a financial quagmire, it has a chance of surviving, and players generally will be pleased with that. If you are prepared to play in front of a few puzzled locals for $10,000 in, say, Cambodia, multiplying that purse by a factor of a hundred or more for some inconsequential matches in front of much bigger television audiences against the game\u2019s elite is an attractive alternative. Bruno Soares, for instance, is a lucky guy. So too, is Daniel Nestor. Treat Huey celebrates Christmas early, as well, as do Sania Mirza, Rohan Bopanna, Malek Jaziri and Nenad Zimonjic. All are excellent players, mainly in doubles, and they are the makeweights sprinkled among the 21 major champions and former stars in the four franchises, from Manila, where Andy Murray is based, to Singapore, to New Delhi and Dubai. Missing will be Hong Kong and Kuala Lumpur, whose franchise applications folded. Murray caused a stir on his arrival in Manila this week when he met the nation\u2019s sporting hero Manny Pacquiao, who retained his WBO welterweight title at the weekend and remains on course for a lucrative showdown with Floyd Mayweather in 2015. He will be courtside for boxing fan Murray, who will do his best to be ringside if Pacquiao ever does fight Mayweather. The knock on the IPTL is that it is a contrived competition with no established fan-base, no history, an uncertain future and no compelling reason to exist as a sporting event \u2013 although that might be said of many competitions that have gone on to become accepted. What the IPTL does have is the potential to make a few people a good deal richer in a short time. The total prize money has been quoted as $29.7m, although the breakdown will not be equal. Murray will return to London early next week at least $1m to the good after a few days of what can politely be called glorified exhibition tennis. So, too, will Roger Federer, Novak Djokovic, Serena Williams, Maria Sharapova, Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras. Rafael Nadal, whose representative Benito Perez-Barbadillo is a prime mover, will miss the tournament while recovering from appendicitis. Eugenie Bouchard, the sparkling young Canadian, will not be among them, pulling out injured on Wednesday with a training injury \u2013 and that is another concern. The tournament is eating into players\u2019 rehab schedules in a sport that makes heavy physical demands. The tournament has a few quirky rule changes: a player receiving serve can double his or her score by nominating one power point per set; there will be no advantage points in a race to six games for a point and the match; the team with most points wins the tie in a round-robin format. It is a lot of change to take in but it might work. Will they all go back next year? If it is still going \u2013 and there has to be doubt about that. The organisers think they have a winning product. \u201cModelled after successful sports franchise concepts,\u201d says the blurb, \u201cthe IPTL combines world-class sports and entertainment in a format that keeps spectators and TV viewers completely engrossed.\u201d As tennis grows into its new skin, compromise is likely, in the way that cricket accommodated short forms to refresh interest while hanging on to the traditional four-day and five-day versions, although there has been a downside there from which tennis could learn. Test cricket outside the Ashes series is struggling, one-day and Twenty20 are still strong, especially in India where the IPL, the template for tennis, is the richest tournament in the game. There are more experiments to come: in the WTA, with a similar format, and in Sydney in the New Year, when Federer and Lleyton Hewitt will launch a pared-down form of the game, again with no ad scoring and no lets, tie-breaks at 3-all and the winner first to four games. Tennis Australia\u2019s chief executive, Craig Tiley, a fan of IPTL, incidentally, calls it a \u201cgame-changer, set to revolutionise the game of tennis\u201d.

And it has not even been built yet. The flat is one of 254 luxury apartments that were launched off-plan in May at a lavish marquee party where prospective buyers were serenaded by Elton John. Prices for studios started from \u00a3800,000, while one-bed flats cost \u00a31m or more and four-bed homes carried price tags of \u00a34m or more. Construction has not yet started and they are due to be completed in late 2018. Henry Wiltshire, an upmarket estate agent that is setting up an office in nearby Vauxhall, is close to being appointed to handle the resale of the studio apartment on the fifth floor of the power station. Kyle Spence, the firm\u2019s sales director, said the vendor was \u201csomeone we met at Cityscape [a property conference] in Dubai,\u201d who hopes to resell the apartment for between \u00a31.4m and \u00a31.5m. Homes in the former power station, a Grade II* listed 1930s brick colossus whose four white chimneys are instantly recognisable on the south London skyline, will have access to more than 1.5 acres of rooftop private garden. The apartments have polished concrete floors and worktops, raw brass fittings, copper bathtubs and other industrial features, and will be about 40% larger than the average new-build home in London, the developers claim. Chris Innes-Ker, associate at John D Wood &amp; Co, one of the largest estate agents in Battersea, said the new price was credible. \u201cIt\u2019s an entirely separate market from what\u2019s going on in the real world,\u201d he said. \u201cIt seems to be defying all logic. It\u2019s creating a market of its own.\u201d The Malaysian consortium that is turning the 42-acre site into a huge complex of apartments, shops and offices in an \u00a38bn project has sold more than 1,300 homes so far in three rounds. The first two phases all but sold out before a single brick was laid. Only 560 (16%) of the planned total of 3,444 new homes will be affordable housing. In the wider market, figures published on Friday by the Land Registry suggested the frenzy that characterised the first half of the year in the capital had eased. Its data for sales registered in October, which does not include new-build homes, showed growth of 0.7% during the month in London \u2013 but it found rises of 1.2% and 1.6% respectively in the south-east and east of England. October\u2019s growth in London reversed a fall of the same magnitude in September, but is a far cry from the 2.7% rise recorded in August. Annual price growth in the capital has also dropped off since the summer, to stand at 18.6% in October, with the average price of a property at \u00a3460,060. The figures for Wandsworth, the London borough that is home to the power station, showed a 0.6% month on month price rise and annual growth of just under 23%. Across England and Wales, the Land Registry said prices were up by just 0.1% over the month and by 7.7% since October 2014, standing at an average of \u00a3177,377. Separate figures from the UK\u2019s biggest building society showed growth slowing as the market moved into the winter. Nationwide said the price of a typical home had risen by 0.9% over the three months to the end of November, the lowest quarterly rate since May last year. The annual rate of growth also fell, to 8.5%. The society, which bases its figures on mortgages it has agreed during the month, put the average cost of a UK home at \u00a3189,388. Nationwide\u2019s chief economist, Robert Gardner, said that there was \u201csomething of a disconnect\u201d between the slowdown in the housing market and wider economic indicators. \u201cForward looking indicators, such as new-buyer inquiries, point to further softness in the near-term. However, if the economy and the labour market remain in good shape and mortgage rates do not rise sharply, activity is likely to pick up in the quarters ahead.\u201d", "title": "Battersea power station home prices \u2018defying all logic\u2019", "sentences": ["Kyle Spence, the firm\u2019s sales director, said the vendor was \u201csomeone we met at Cityscape [a property conference] in Dubai,\u201d who hopes to resell the apartment for between \u00a31.4m and \u00a31.5m."], "publicationDate": "2014-11-28T19:52:39Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2014/nov/30/iptl-future-tennis-retreat-to-present-maria-sharapova-andy-murray", "tags": ["Maria Sharapova", "Andy Murray", "Tennis", "Sport"], "article": "The opening day of the thunderously-hyped International Tennis Premier League lasted a shade under six hours. But it only took seconds for Maria Sharapova to give the game away. On court Sharapova is usually ice-hearted and merciless: a tennis equivalent of Elsa from Frozen, who tries to conceal, not feel. But having rallied from 2-5 down to beat the world No67, Kristina Mladenovic, 6-5 after a five-minute shootout, she started joyously pumping her hands to the uncomplicated Euro-disco beat, before laughing and high-fiving her Manila Mavericks team-mates. The ITPL organiser claims \u201cthe revolutionary new league promises to change the manner in which the world enjoys the top sport\u201d. Sharapova\u2019s reaction told you otherwise: this was fast-food tennis, fun but utterly disposable. It probably mattered less to her than any match she played on the Tour this year. Even so, as the Russian cheered on her team-mate Carlos Moy\u00e1 against Fabrice Santoro in a legends\u2019 match, the television commentators stressed its relevance. \u201cMany people have suggested that this is just a glorified exhibition but these guys get here in a crowd and an arena like this and it does matter,\u201d said one. \u201cYes, these guys have got so much pride,\u201d added the other. \u201cThey have been grand slam champions and world No1s \u2013 they don\u2019t want to be embarrassed out here.\u201d Watching Santoro, his belly now expanded to half-Depardieu, going through his full range of Gallic shrugs suggested that embarrassment came a distant second to the piles of cash on offer. Those riches have tempted the cream of the current crop \u2013 including Novak Djokovic, Roger Federer, Serena Williams and Andy Murray \u2013 as well as past greats such as Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras. Organisers claim they want to \u201cchange the face and future of the game\u201d. Little wonder, then, this four-team, fortnight jaunt through Manila, Singapore, New Delhi and Dubai is compared to cricket\u2019s Indian Premier League. It is nothing of the sort, even if it has swallowed much of the template: franchises, loud music, scantily-clad cheerleaders dancing during timeouts \u2013 something that seems appallingly backward and mid-20th century. The format (one set of men\u2019s singles, women\u2019s singles, men\u2019s doubles, mixed doubles and legends\u2019 singles) is also skewed towards men: Sharapova was the only woman who played for the Mavericks, who had five men in action. It feels like a wasted opportunity given tennis is one of the few sports where women match men in ratings.     Maria Sharapova celebrates with her Manila Mavericks team-mates after defeating Kristina Mladenovic on day one of the IPTL. Photograph: Dennis M Sabangan/EPA    The scoring changes, designed to make the game fresher, feel like unnecessary tampering with a classic recipe: the equivalent of adding Brazil nuts to an apple crumble to make it stand out. At deuce, there is no advantage, simply next point wins. At 5-5 there is a five-minute shootout to decide the set. Once during a set, players can opt for a happiness powerpoint \u2013 which as any middle manager could you tell you, sounds like a contradiction in terms \u2013 where the next point counts double. They add nothing. Only one change truly works: a maximum 20 seconds between points, the last five seconds of which are sounded out by a ticking clock. You wonder how the injured Rafael Nadal would manage without the time to towel down and adjust his pants. By Sunday\u2019s third day, early-onset old-fartism was in full swing. Then again, perhaps we should not be so quick to judge. New concepts usually meet resistance. Exactly 36 years ago on 1 December, in the formative days of World Series Cricket, the Guardian dismissed Kerry Packer\u2019s rebranding of the game as \u201cexcruciating\u201d, adding that \u201cit possesses an undeserved breathlessness which the non-stop talking commentators \u2013 Trueman, Lawry, Benaud and company \u2013 will surely find it hard to maintain in the glum days\u201d. Similar thoughts were expressed at the embryonic stages of the IPL. But there is a big difference between the IPL and its wannabe equivalent. With Test cricket taking five days, there was a clear gap in the market for a speedier, more TV-friendly version of the sport. Most tennis matches take a couple of hours. They don\u2019t need tweaking. Another difference: the IPL, for all its froth, matters to players: bowling and batting figures are filtered into their career averages, while match-winning performances can increase their auction value and thus their salary. The IPTL is just about money. Which isn\u2019t a terrible thing per se: tennis is a short career after all. But given Sharapova made $24.4m (\u00a315.6m)between June 2013 and June 2014 while Murray made $19.2m over the same period, money surely matters less than the need for recuperation after a long season. But no: it is a case of forget the grind, think about the greenbacks. It is telling that the ATP Tour\u2019s executive chairman, Chris Kermode, does not see the IPTL as a threat, telling the BBC that while it is \u201cgreat\u201d that tennis is being taken into virgin territories \u201cI think we just have to be very clear it is a series of exhibitions\u201d.

In his entry to the competition for the design of a new capital, architect Lucio Costa did not submit volumes of economic and population projections. He simply drew a cross, the meeting of two axes. Adjusting for topography, these became the skeleton for a simple form: a bird, or a plane, or a new capital city. Brasilia is the urban equivalent of the building conceived on a paper napkin.  The authority of the architect, with the will of a powerful patron \u2014 President Juscelino Kubitschek \u2014 and the labor of thousands of migrants turned ink on paper into mounds of dirt, tons of concrete, asphalt and, in just three years, roads, buildings and institutions. The logic is irrefutable, the myth powerful. An architect draws a picture, making a city. But can a city have an author? Costa\u2019s bird\u2019s-eye view gives shape to the city as a whole, but it does not account for what\u2019s on the ground. Terrain, ecology, people, culture are all left out of the picture. In fact, after its planners failed to consider that Brasilia\u2019s builders would want to stay there once their work was done, the city was quickly surrounded by informal \u201csatellite cities\u201d just outside the plan, but essential to Brasilia\u2019s functioning.  The desire to draw up a city, and to project its logic directly on to the ground, is not so different from new settlements today in Abu Dhabi, South Korea or anywhere that development is rampant. Costa\u2019s drawing posits Brasilia as unique, a city as a work of art, but drawings also allow for copy-and-paste cities, with designs replicated from one place to another.  We often see cities as a visual image: the Parisian pentagon with the arc of the Seine; the skyline of New York; or the fronds of Palm Jumeirah Island in Dubai. These abstractions are central to their identity. But when citizens are just specks, where do they fit in on the ground?

The yellow note, now 10 years old, was produced in Kingston crown court on Monday in the trial of Graham Dudman, the paper\u2019s former managing editor. After a brief objection by the prosecution, which had not seen the note, it was passed around the jury. Brooks, the former Sun editor, wrote \u201cPPC, Staff performance, Project Hal, Lorna, Courses \u2013 CRD advise, PA \u2013 Philipps/Marie, Corporate News\u201d on the Post It. Dudman explained the list referred to his responsibilities to liaise with the Press Complaints Commission \u2013 the industry regulator now replaced by the Independent Press Standards Organisation \u2013 take responsibility for the company\u2019s new printing press initiative \u201cProject Hal\u201d, to liaise with the paper\u2019s then PR manager Lorna Carmichael, to train staff, and to take charge of the two personal assistants in the managing editor\u2019s office. Dudman is on trial for a conspiracy to cause misconduct in public office by allegedly agreeing payments to public officials for tips and stories, charges he denies. He was appointed managing editor in 2004 after a meteoric rise through the ranks. He talked the jury through the system of expenses at the paper, explaining that in some circumstances they were considered payment in lieu of overtime. \u201cSome people were claimed up to \u00a3200 a day. The company knew what was happening,\u201d he said. \u201cReporters never got any overtime.\u201d The practice was common across Fleet Street when he was a reporter in the 1980s and 1990s, he said. Dudman regaled the jury with what he described as a famous example during the outbreak of the first Gulf War, when a \u201cpack\u201d of reporters were in Dubai and unable to get expense receipts. \u201cAfter three or four weeks, it became clear that we did not have enough expenses. One of the guys from the Express found a printing shop and got several pads of expenses printed up, which he shared round our dinner that night \u2026 So everyone had a similar amount of expenses claims when we came back to Britain.\u201d The expenses budget would run to \u00a35m annually he said, against a total editorial budget of \u00a363m in 2011, the last year he held the post, Dudman said. When he became managing editor, he had responsibility for everyone\u2019 expenses other than the editor\u2019s, he explained. Dudman described how the Sun had a safe containing \u00a325,000 in cash which would be topped up every week to make cash payments. He explained that some people wanted cash because they didn\u2019t have a bank account, or because \u201cpeople didn\u2019t want their spouses, or did not want anyone else, to know they were selling stories to a newspaper\u201d. \u201cCash payments were the tiniest of payments, less than half of 1% of what was going out every week,\u201d said Dudman. Jurors heard a \u201cbatch of A4 paper on landscape\u201d with the list of payments for stories would be \u201cwrapped together in huge industrial rubber bands and plonked on my desk\u201d. The list would run to \u201cthousands\u201d of stories a week, explained Dudman, who was responsible for every department and the Scottish and Irish offices. Dudman described the Sun\u2019s coverage of the Hillsborough football disaster in 1989 which claimed 96 lives as \u201cwithout doubt the darkest hour in the paper\u2019s history\u201d. Questioned by his counsel, Oliver Blunt QC, he told jurors he was not on the paper at the time, but had been deputised by Brooks to try to reach out to the people of Merseyside who were boycotting the paper ever since the controversial claims put on the front page by her predecessor Kelvin MacKenzie. The paper\u2019s front page headline \u201cThe Truth\u201d which was based on false information given to the paper \u201ccaused immeasurable hurt and harm in Merseyside,\u201d Dudman said. It was \u201cbeyond appalling\u201d. He met with the Hillsborough family support group but said he failed to persuade them of the paper\u2019s remorse over the headline.

The League has ruled Cellino, the colourful Italian who took control of the Championship side in April, must resign as a club director within 28 days and take steps to ensure that he is not acting as a \u201crelevant person\u201d at Leeds. Cellino indicated to the Guardian he would appeal against the decision \u2013 representations have to be made within 14 days \u2013 and asked: \u201cWhy is this club hated so much?\u201d In theory, however, he could be removed as owner for a brief period before returning in March, something the club described as \u201cdestabilising\u201d and \u201cnot in the best interests of any party\u201d. In March Cellino was found guilty of evading almost \u20ac390,000 (\u00a3305,000) of import-tax duty on his boat, the Nelie, in 2012, a first-grade conviction in Italy that he is appealing against. The Football League\u2019s owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test disqualifies individuals who \u201chave unspent convictions for offences of dishonesty\u201d. The League initially attempted to block the former Cagliari owner\u2019s purchase of Leeds. But Cellino launched a successful appeal against that decision in May after an independent QC, Tim Kerr, ruled that the offence could not be proven \u201cdishonest\u201d until the full written reasons were made available by the Italian courts. Judge Sandra Lepore\u2019s written reasons \u2013 obtained by the Guardian in September \u2013 ruled Cellino set up a \u201cbogus corporate screen\u201d as part of a \u201cMachiavellian simulation\u201d to evade paying import tax on the yacht. The League\u2019s board met to consider the case last week and, following advice from lawyers who received a copy of Lepore\u2019s full ruling in November, unanimously agreed Cellino be disqualified under the organisation\u2019s owners\u2019 and directors\u2019 test, commonly known as the fit and proper persons test. The League has also requested that an independent football disciplinary commission consider whether Cellino and/or Leeds breached League regulations \u201crelating to the timely disclosure of relevant information\u201d regarding an owner\u2019s status. League sources say there are no limits to the potential sanctions for this, although any penalty would be proportionate to the offence. Cellino\u2019s company Eleonora Sports bought 75% of Leeds for \u00a335m from Gulf Finance House Capital, a Dubai subsidiary of a Bahrain-based investment bank. Two members of GFHC remain on the Leeds board and Cellino was on Monday in the Middle East to discuss further investment in the club. Cellino told the Guardian: \u201cNow I have to appeal, more money for lawyers \u2013 what for? I\u2019m paying everything, I\u2019ve paid \u00a335m in six months. I\u2019m doing everything for the club, for the fans. They deserve something. \u201cThe League is here to protect football. To make sure clubs are run the right way, that money is spent the right way. Everyday something comes up \u2026 Red Bull are buying the club, the problems with [Giuseppe] Bellusci \u2013 what has this club done wrong to the people? Why is this club hated so much? It is a lovely club.\u201d Following a recent change to the Rehabilitation of Offenders\u2019 Act Cellino\u2019s conviction for tax evasion regarding the Nelie becomes spent in the British legal system on 28 March 2015, 12 months after the original ruling in Italy. \u201cWe have today received a notice from the Football League disqualifying Mr Cellino from being a director of Leeds United Football Club until 18 March 2015,\u201d read a Leeds statement. \u201cThe club is in the process of taking legal advice on the reasoning of the decision. In the interim, the club notes that nothing has changed since the decision of the Football League\u2019s professional conduct committee in April 2014. The steps that the League wishes the club to take \u2013 to remove Mr Cellino only to re-appoint him in three months\u2019 time \u2013 will be destabilising for the club, its supporters and sponsors and cannot be in the best interests of any party.\u201d Giovanni Cocco, Cellino\u2019s lawyer in Italy, had argued the Nelie case was not a \u201cfinal\u201d and complete verdict in the Italian legal system and therefore Cellino should only be considered \u201caccused\u201d and \u201cnot yet \u2018convicted\u2019\u201d.

I don\u2019t know.\u201d You can understand why people might think he\u2019s laid-back. Shmurda \u2013 real name Ackquille Jean Pollard \u2013 is one of this year\u2019s breakout hip-hop stars. He\u2019s just been signed to Epic Records, a division of Sony Music Entertainment, and his track, Hot Nigga, has more than 40m views on YouTube.  Halfway through the video, Shmurda breaks out into a juttering dance \u2013 a mix of drunken auntie dancing and street swagger. He says he made it up on the spot, a throwaway moment not meant to make the cut. Only it it did. Within a few days of the video going up, Hot Nigga had been christened \u201cthe Shmoney dance\u201d, prompting thousands of imitators on Vine. Everyone from Beyonce and Jay Z to Rihanna and Miami Dolphins wide receiver Brandon Gibson got in on the action. It even got the Jimmy Fallon seal of approval, who invited Shmurda to perform the dance on The Tonight Show.         Shmurda Inc    But Shmurda says it\u2019s not all celebrity shoutouts and six-second viral loops. The contrast between what you see on screen and real life is evident when I ask him what was he doing this time last year. \u201cI don\u2019t know,\u201d he says. \u201cProbably selling crack.\u201d There\u2019s a line in Hot Nigga where Shmurda talks about selling drugs since he was in the fifth grade. I ask him if this is true. He answers by recalling the first time he was arrested. \u201cI was selling on Wilmohr and 98th, but I got locked up \u2026 right over by the chicken store.\u201d There\u2019s a gallows humour to his matter-of-fact depiction of a childhood most of us have only read about in books like Clockers, or seen on television shows like The Wire. When I ask Shmurda to describe his neighbourhood growing up, his go-to reference is New Jack City, Mario Van Peebles\u2019s 1991 film about a sociopathic crack dealer. When we talk about the case of Akai Gurley, who was fatally shot by a police officer in a housing block not far from where Shmurda grew up, he expresses a cynical, seen-it-all-before attitude at the fact the police officer involved got off with a mere suspension. \u201cSuspended for killing someone. Liteesha!\u201d he says, using his own slang word meaning something is amazing. \u201cStuff like that influences a lot of people, man. When I see someone getting away with that I think, \u2018Why can\u2019t I do that?\u2019\u201d Shmurda was born in Florida and moved to Brooklyn. He was disruptive at school and lost interest in it before eventually moving into music. He\u2019d come up with his own words for hip-hop tracks, like Young Buck\u2019s Stomp, rapping into cups and play-acting, but he only began taking it seriously a year ago. The first time he knew his music was starting to cut through was when his usually frosty neighbourhood started warming to him. \u201cMy block is a nasty block and when I saw people coming through and screaming \u2018That\u2019s him!\u2019 I was thinking \u2018What the hell?\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThen we started getting fans, like actual fans. It was crazy.\u201d On his latest EP, the gloriously named Shmurda She Wrote \u2013 though he claims to have no idea who Jessica Fletcher is \u2013 there are boasts about being asked to perform all over the world: London, Paris, Dubai. The problem is he can\u2019t. Shmurda is dealing with a felony gun charge, which means he can\u2019t leave the country. And, although he has another song called Wipe The Case Away, in which he talks about a seemingly magical solicitor who can make his legal woes disappear, it doesn\u2019t look like that will happen anytime soon.  The disconnect between the real world and the rap world is a key tenet of hip-hop\u2019s theatrical appeal, but a fast-moving industry means not being able to build on early success could stymie a career that\u2019s barely even started. Cautionary tales are everywhere in hip-hop\u2019s recent past. Two years ago, Trinidad James had a huge hit with All Gold Everything. Everyone wanted to do a remix of it, and he eventually signed a record deal with Def Jam rumoured to be worth $2m. Fast forward to 2014, and Trinidad James has been dropped without an album ever being released. In the same year, Chicago drill bellwether Chief Keef released I Don\u2019t Like. It quickly spawned an official Kanye West remix, and Keef eventually signed a deal with Interscope rumoured to be worth $6m. A year later, after releasing one album, he\u2019s also been left high and dry. The similarities between the three artists are obvious: one huge hit that goes viral, pursuit by several labels/artists and then \u2013 for James and Keef at least \u2013 a tumultuous 18 months topped off by an unceremonious divorce. But Shmurda is defiant. He\u2019s different, he says. Special. \u201cI feel like everything I\u2019ve been doing has been the best,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen you have that type of confidence you don\u2019t worry about anything. I never worried about anything since I was a little kid.\u201d But it\u2019s not just a similar career trajectory that pairs Shmurda with Chief Keef. It\u2019s his sound. Traditionally, New York rappers embraced boom bap. In the genre\u2019s golden era, between 1988-1993, groups from the east coast laid out a blueprint of slower, sample driven hip-hop that valued flow and lyrics over the faster call-and-response fare of southern styles like trap and the bellicose drill of Chicago. In the 2000s, New York artists such as Nas criticised the southern style, saying the music reinforced negative stereotypes of black people. But Shmurda\u2019s sound has a southern tinge. Hot Nigga was produced by Jahlil Beats, whose most well-known work was for trap godfather TI and Meek Mill. Yet Shmurda isn\u2019t buying the comparison. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say that. People say that because we\u2019re both young, we\u2019re both black and we\u2019re both rapping about similar things. We\u2019re too different. We\u2019re two different things,\u201d he says.

I am humbled to be in the presence of you, his family, his friends and his community. He was so proud of Macksville and it is easy to see why today. Taken from the game, his family and loved ones at the age of just 25, he left a mark on our game that needs no embellishment. I don\u2019t know about you, but I keep looking for him. I know it is crazy but I expect any minute to take a call from him or to see his face pop around the corner. Is this what we call the spirit? If so, then his spirit is still with me. And I hope it never leaves. I walked to the middle of the SCG on Thursday night, those same blades of grass beneath my feet where he and I and so many of his mates here today have built partnerships, taken chances and lived out the dreams we paint in our heads as boys. The same stands where the crowds rose to their feet to cheer them on and that same fence he sent the ball to time and time again. And it is now forever the place where he fell.            I stood there at the wicket, I knelt down and touched the grass, I swear he was with me. Picking me up off my feet to check if I was OK. Telling me we just needed to dig in and get through to tea. Telling me off for that loose shot I played. Chatting about what movie we might watch that night. And then passing on a useless fact about cows. I could see him swagger back to the other end, grin at the bowler, and call me through for a run with such a booming voice, a bloke in the car park would hear it. The heart of a man who lived his life for this wonderful game we play, and whose soul enriched not just our sport, but all of our lives.     Michael Clarke, third left, helps carry the coffin of Phillip Hughes. Photograph: Daniel Munoz/AP    Is this what indigenous Australians believe about a person\u2019s spirit being connected with the land upon which they walk? If so, I know they are right about the SCG. His spirit has touched it and it will forever be a sacred ground for me. I can feel his presence there and I can see how he has touched so many people around the world. The tributes to him from cricket lovers kept me going. The photos, the words, the prayers and the sense of communion in this loss from people across the globe have shown me his spirit in action. It has sustained me and overwhelmed me in equal measure. And the love of my band of baggy green and gold brothers and sisters have held me upright when I thought I could not proceed. His spirit has brought us closer together \u2013 something I know must be him at work because it is so consistent with how he played and lived. He always wanted to bring people together and he always wanted to celebrate his love for the game and its people. Is this what we call the spirit of cricket? From the little girl holding a candlelight tribute, to masters of the game like Tendulkar, Warne and Lara, the spirit of cricket binds us all together. We feel it in the thrill of a cover drive. Or the taking of a screamer at gully, whether by a 12-year-old boy or by Brendon McCullum in Dubai. It is in the brilliant five-wicket haul, just as significant to the players in a Western Suburbs club game as it is in a Test match. The bonds that led to cricketers from around the world putting their bats out, that saw people who didn\u2019t even know Phillip lay flowers, and that brought every cricketing nation on earth to make its own heartfelt tribute. The bonds that saw players old and new rush to his bedside from wherever they heard the news to say their prayers and farewells. This is what makes our game the greatest game in the world. Phillip\u2019s spirit, which is now part of our game forever, will act as a custodian of the sport we all love. We must listen to it. We must cherish it. We must learn from it. We must dig in and get through to tea. And we must play on. So rest in peace my little brother.

In the US, much has been made of rugby\u2019s return to the Games after 90 years, largely because America\u2019s men are the reigning Olympic champions. Rather less has been made of the fact that Olympic rugby sevens will also be contested by women. The players who will take the field in Dubai on Thursday are the US Women\u2019s Eagles. Women\u2019s rugby has a rich tradition in the US, not least because the Eagles were the first official world champions, in 1991. Women still represent a minority in a minority sport (according to USA Rugby there are around 100,000 players of all ages and levels in the US, around 20,000 of them female), but their game is growing. Furthermore, the women are, arguably, better placed to make it to Rio. International exposure is coming. \u201cThe USA qualifying will have a big effect on women\u2019s rugby,\u201d says Julie Prentice, co-founder of Serevi Rugby, a Seattle-based company which is helping to drive the national search for Olympic talent. \u201cIn sports it\u2019s still not known. When I mention women\u2019s rugby, if I say my daughter plays, I still get a lot of \u2018Oh, really?\u2019 And raised eyebrows. \u201cTo the mainstream sports enthusiast, to know that women\u2019s rugby is out there, to know it\u2019s played with exactly the same rules as the men, I think that will do a lot for the game. Obviously it will just be the beginning, but it\u2019s a generational thing and I look at where soccer was in this country in the late 80s, the 90s, with Mia Hamm and the World Cup, and I think rugby is on that trajectory.\u201d Prentice\u2019s mention of soccer shows the thinking of many people in women\u2019s rugby \u2013 that the girls\u2019 game is at an important, fertile stage of growth. She herself is \u201ca rugby mom as well as a rugby business person\u201d; her daughter was named in this year\u2019s inaugural women\u2019s high-school All-American team. But to many parents and daughters, rugby for girls can seem a little outlandish, even dangerous. \u201cIt\u2019s there, it\u2019s interesting,\u201d Prentice says of such concern. \u201cIf you look at our numbers for our youth programming, the number of girls doing that is closer to 25%. This is boys and girls playing [largely non-contact] after school. But then you jump to high-school programming and above and it\u2019s 40% female participation. So I definitely think that at that younger age there is a definite concern about safety and about the sport.  \u201cBut I think for those who get to know rugby, they get to understand that the tackling is different [to American football]. For outsiders, the emphasis gets to be on \u2018collision, collision\u2019, but you talk to someone like [English sevens great and Serevi board member] Ben Gollings and he will tell you it\u2019s game of evasion.   If it comes down to you and another person and you have no pads and no helmet, are you going to run into that person or are you going to look for space on the field?  Prentice and others like her believe there is space on the field for women\u2019s rugby. Development programmes, run by the likes of Serevi and the charity Play Rugby USA, are bringing the game to schools in New York, Chicago and Los Angeles. The game has also been embraced by an increasing number of colleges. \u201cSo far, we have seen smaller, regional schools pick up [women\u2019s] rugby as a varsity sport in an effort to help distinguish themselves,\u201d says Karen Fong Donoghue, owner and founder of college rugby advisory consultancy The Rugger\u2019s Edge, citing the likes of Notre Dame College in Ohio, Pennsylvania\u2019s West Chester University and Norwich, in Vermont. Asked if the women\u2019s game has a chance of becoming a major college sport in the near future, Fong Donoghue says: \u201cSeeing that women\u2019s rugby has been an emerging NCAA sport for well over seven years and has yet to meet the requirements to be an actual NCAA sport, we are going to need a lot more support and interest from colleges to make it a reality.   My best guess? At least five more years \u2013 or a medal at the Olympics in 2016.  Making it to Rio is of profound importance. In Dubai, the first tournament of six that make up the World Rugby Women\u2019s Sevens Series, the US are drawn with New Zealand and two nations less famous for rugby but very familiar with Olympic success: Russia and China. A top-four finish on the series books a place in Brazil \u2013 the US managed that in 2012-13 but fell to seventh last time out. Miss the top four and the Eagles will be sent into regional qualifying, wherein the presence or otherwise of rivals (and rising power) Canada would do much to determine their chances of success.

Photograph: Jordan Mansfield/Getty Images    The players who will begin the attempt to qualify for Rio work at the Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, California. In his search for talent, coach Ric Suggitt has cast his net wide. Elana Meyers, an Olympic bobsleigh medalist, trained with the team this year; the squad for Dubai includes former Western Oregon basketball players Melissa Fowler and Lorrie Clifford and a star of field hockey and American football, Jessica Javelet.  \u201cWe have good athletes that are pretty confident,\u201d said Suggit, on announcing his squad. \u201cBut what we lack is that consistency in international competition. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re fully aware of the pressure yet. I think they\u2019ll feel it when they start to play.\u201d Such crossover talent, attracted to rugby by its Olympic status, represents an immediate development pathway. The work being done at the grass roots by Serevi, USA Rugby and others represents another, longer view. \u201cThe US development squad recently went to Fiji for the Coral Coast Sevens and competed at a fantastic level,\u201d says Prentice. \u201cSome of them were crossover athletes. You always want to look to a wide variety of sports.  \u201cBut ideally down the road you get the rugby opportunities for kids, so there are better entry points on the development pathway earlier and then there will be more experience in the sport as a whole.\u201d Prentice is hopeful that converts will keep coming. \u201cI think women and girls are really drawn to rugby,\u201d she says. \u201cI think girls are sometimes frustrated by some of the more mainstream sports, because there really is no opportunity to be physical. Sometimes they can be penalised in soccer for being too aggressive or just outside the norm of how a girl should be on the field.  \u201cSo I think there is this pent-up desire for an option for girls to play such a sport, and there is a generation of girls looking for an opportunity.\u201d If all goes well on the road to Rio, that opportunity could soon be upon them.", "title": "US women's rugby seeks gold on road to Rio Olympic Games", "sentences": ["On Thursday, in Dubai, a squad of American rugby players will begin their attempt to qualify for the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio.", "The players who will take the field in Dubai on Thursday are the US Women\u2019s Eagles.", "In Dubai, the first tournament of six that make up the World Rugby Women\u2019s Sevens Series, the US are drawn with New Zealand and two nations less famous for rugby but very familiar with Olympic success: Russia and China.", "Elana Meyers, an Olympic bobsleigh medalist, trained with the team this year; the squad for Dubai includes former Western Oregon basketball players Melissa Fowler and Lorrie Clifford and a star of field hockey and American football, Jessica Javelet."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-03T13:32:41Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/03/dubai-palm-jumeirah-islands-palm-trees-from-space", "tags": ["Cities", "Photography", "Dubai"], "article": "This image is a day-time photograph of Palm Jumeirah taken by NASA Commander Leroy Chiao from aboard the International Space Station in 2005. Jumeirah was the first of a series of new islands off the coast of Dubai designed to add hundreds of kilometres of private coastline to the city.  The islands were developed through a process of dredging sand from the floor of the Persian Gulf and spraying it to form shaped land masses. This photo was taken as work on the land mass itself was being completed and in advance of the start of construction of villas and hotels that would house 65,000 people. It was featured in various newspapers and websites shortly after it was taken. What only becomes obvious from the heightened perspective is that the island is constructed in the shape of a palm tree (the crescent around the perimeter serves as a barrier). The spacebourne vantage point reveals the landscape in both the pictorial and geographic senses. Palm Jumeirah\u2019s positioning, of course, enacts a rather simple visual pun in which the palm tree pretends to grow out of Dubai\u2019s main coastline.  For Dubai\u2019s real estate holding corporation, Nakheel Properties, this distinct shape, which they claimed in their marketing campaigns is visible from the moon (which is difficult to confirm), was a key selling point. It is difficult to tease out how substantial of a role it played in the pricing of villas and other properties on Jumeirah prior to the onset of Dubai\u2019s 2009 crisis. However, it is clear that the island\u2019s value as real estate and elite socio-economic status are intertwined with its qualities as a picture. But why was this transformation of land into symbols visible from space, but for the most part only accessible to the majority of us non-astronauts via photographs, so resonant? A landscape intervention at this scale is remarkable in and of itself, but beyond this, it signifies a breakdown in cultural distinctions between land and media.  The shaping of the island itself was aided by the passage of signals between the boats that sprayed the sand and the global network of GPS satellites that provided location data to the required precision. The island is dotted with mobile phone masts that are designed to appear as palm trees. While these kinds of examples are by no means unique to Palm Jumeirah, the shape of the island seems to amplify their significance to contemporary and future changes in the built environment.

The manager has been told he does not have to work to a particular budget as the club is prepared to sanction a world record transfer bid in line with the policy of last summer, according to senior figures. Van Gaal wants to add a midfielder, a right-back, one or two central defenders, a wide player and potentially a striker. The Dutchman is targeting Roma\u2019s Kevin Strootman, who would cost around \u00a330m, Borussia Dortmund\u2019s Mats Hummels who may be priced up to \u00a335m, Atl\u00e9tico Madrid\u2019s Diego God\u00edn \u2013 in the region of \u00a325m \u2013 Barcelona\u2019s Dani Alves, for around \u00a315m, and may potentially move for Arjen Robben, with the Bayern Munich winger costing no less than \u00a340m. If United decide against taking Radamel Falcao permanently from Monaco \u2013 it would cost \u00a343.5m to take up the club\u2019s option \u2013 then Van Gaal would also be in the market for a striker. The potential outlay could take United\u2019s total spend in two years past \u00a3350m after the \u00a327.5m paid for Marouane Fellaini and the \u00a337.1m deal for Juan Mata in last January\u2019s window. The manager is also to offload a number of players when embarking on a second close season of rebuilding that is viewed as a vital window to ensure United are able to seriously challenge again for the title and in Europe. Last summer 11 players left while nine more went out on loan and six were recruited, making for an overall turnover of 26.     Germany\u2019s Borussia Dortmund defender Mats Hummels. Photograph: Christophe Simon/AFP/Getty Images    Those who are vulnerable this year include a host of players currently out on loan, such as Nani, Tom Cleverley, Javier Hern\u00e1ndez, Nick Powell, Reece James and Michael Keane, plus the reserve goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard. The latter\u2019s future is in the balance as Spain international Victor Vald\u00e9s is training at United as he continues rehabilitation from a serious knee injury. The club are yet to decide whether to sign Vald\u00e9s when he returns to fitness though his relationship with Van Gaal, who managed him previously at Barcelona, means the manager is particularly familiar with his ability. Darren Fletcher and Anderson have deals that finish at the close of the campaign, with the latter almost certain to depart. There are no plans to pay the Brazilian\u2019s contract up and for him to leave in January. David de Gea, the established No1, is yet to renew terms that expire in summer 2015 although the club are relaxed about the Spaniard committing his long-term future despite reported interest from Real Madrid. Michael Carrick\u2019s terms expire at the end of the season but United have a one-way option to extend his stay and it would be a surprise if this was not taken up by the club. The United executive are understood to be encouraged by the team\u2019s progress this term, although they accept results might have been better. As Van Gaal has guided the team to fourth place in the Premier League before the start of the busy festive programme despite having to implement new ideas following the difficulties of a sizeable overhaul and an unprecedented run of injuries, the hierarchy view the future with optimism. The club had expected Phil Jones, Jonny Evans and Chris Smalling to have their best seasons of availability yet, so there is surprise that all have suffered from injuries. With United not playing in Europe this season the forecast had been based on these players having the optimum recovery time between matches. With Van Gaal understood to rate Evans the pick of the trio, that may mean the futures of Jones and Smalling are in the balance.The lack of European football means United may take a mid-season break and while there are no current plans to do so it is understood Van Gaal would be able to order warm weather training at the last minute due to the ease of arranging a trip.

The competition features Argentina\u2019s San Lorenzo de Almagro, Australia\u2019s Western Sydney Wanderers, Algeria\u2019s ES S\u00e9tif, Mexico\u2019s Cruz Azul, New Zealand\u2019s Auckland City and Morocco\u2019s Moghreb T\u00e9touan but is chiefly of interest through the participation of the seventh side: Real Madrid. They are on a club-record run of 16 wins across all competitions (last defeated by Atl\u00e9tico Madrid on 13 September), an achievement they will not want to see dashed against largely inferior competition. The quarter-finals are on Saturday but seeding means Real and San Lorenzo are not involved until 16-17 December at the semi-final stage BIG FIGHT ... Amir Khan takes on Devon Alexander next Sunday at a proper boxing venue: the MGM Grand in Las Vegas, (Sky Sports 1undercard begins 2am, , fight from approximately 4am) with the winner looking to book a slot against the WBA super and WBC welter-weight world champion, Floyd Mayweather. The American \u2013 \u201cAlexander the Great\u201d \u2013 is a former two-time world champion but Bolton\u2019s Khan is a real draw in the US and he needs to win convincingly to go after Mayweather. Both are clever boxers and this is a match-up made for an impressive and entertaining bout. Kahn currently has the edge but if Alexander gets into his rhythm he is a tough fighter to beat. OLYMPIC DECISION ... The full IOC membership meet in Monaco on Monday and Tuesday to make final decisions on the 40 proposals set forth for the future of the Games in the Olympic Agenda 2020 which was revealed in November. Among the changes that may be implemented is allowing hosts to hold events outside the Olympic city or even outside the country - in an attempt to offer smaller nations a chance to hold the Games. It has also been proposed that the bidding process be made more transparent and cheaper, limiting the number of\u00a0 international meetings for presentations. On the sport front, the committee will consider allowing new events, specific to each Games, to maximise their impact in the host country. Tokyo 2020, for example, would expect to be allowed to add baseball and softball to their programme. While the reaction to homophobia around Sochi 2014 has led to non -discrimination on sexual orientation being suggested as an addition to the Olympic charter. TOUGH TEST ... Playing India in their first match since the death of Phillip Hughes will not be easy for Australia. The first Test was postponed from Thursday, the day after the funeral, and the series will now begin in Adelaide on Tuesday (Sky Sports 2, midnight). It will be a difficult and emotional time for everyone.

With average prices up 15% in a year, the country is top of an influential global house price index, ahead of Dubai and the UK. Estate agent Knight Frank, which compiles the index, said Ireland had enjoyed a remarkable turnaround in fortunes over the past 12 months. As recently as summer 2012, it was ranked 54th out of 55 countries surveyed, when house prices were falling by almost 10% a year following the damage wreaked by Ireland\u2019s economic crash of 2008. The firm\u2019s latest index puts the UK in fourth place, with prices up 10.5% in the year to September, making it one of only six countries to achieve double-digit price growth. At the bottom of the table is Cyprus, where prices were down more than 9% over the same period. Ireland\u2019s strong performance is largely down to the strength of the property market in Dublin, especially in desirable neighbourhoods such as Ballsbridge and Ranelagh. Over the past year the market has seen the return of bidding wars, with properties frequently selling for as much as 20% above the asking price. Ireland is set to be the fastest growing eurozone economy this year, with Brussels predicting it will achieve 4.6% growth, although the latest data will exacerbate fears of a new house price bubble. Knight Frank said that house prices in Ireland were still 39% below their pre-crisis peak of 2007 despite the 15% surge. Nevertheless, it said the country had pulled off a remarkable comeback, considering that it had \u201clanguished at the foot of the table\u201d for most of the period from 2009 to 2012. Turkey is in second place in the table, up 14%, with Dubai third, up 12.5%. Australia is ninth after a 9.1% rise and Hong Kong is 20th place, after rising by 6.3%. China only manage 42nd place as property prices were down 1.2% year-on-year, with 58 of the 70 Chinese cities tracked recording a decline. Knight Frank said Ireland was not the only country to enjoy a bounceback over the past year. The UK has also seen an upturn; in the summer of 2012 the UK ranked a lowly 37th in the index. The index was created in 2006 and is compiled using official government statistics or central bank data where available to allow investors and developers to compare the performance of mainstream residential markets across the world. In the United States the price of a typical family home was up by 4.8% over the 12 months, although some US cities managed to perform a lot better. In Miami prices were up 10.3% year-on-year. Kate Everett-Allen at Knight Frank\u2019s international residential research arm said: \u201cFewer countries are reaching the heights of double-digit price growth, but it\u2019s not all bad news.

Dewani was thought to be heading back to the family home in Bristol but faces an uncertain future as his late wife Anni\u2019s family are vowing to fight on to force him to give his account of what happened under oath. Dewani, 34, left Cape Town airport on Tuesday morning 24 hours after a judge cleared of him plotting Anni\u2019s murder in November 2010. He flew back to Gatwick airport via Dubai and left through a side entrance guarded by police before being driven away in a black people carrier shortly before 7am on Wednesday. Armed police officers were on guard at the airport preventing reporters from approaching the exit used by Dewani. Wearing a white shirt, jeans and a jacket, he sat in the middle rear seat of the car flanked by a man and a woman. A Sky TV producer who spoke briefly to Dewani in the first-class compartment said Dewani and his family had made it clear that this was not a time for congratulations. He said he seemed elated and relaxed but had a \u201cedge of nervousness\u201d. It is thought he has gone to stay with family in London rather than return to his home in Westbury-on-Trym, an affluent suburb of Bristol. A woman who brought a tray of tea and biscuits to reporters and photographers waiting outside Dewani\u2019s Bristol home said he was not returning on Wednesday. \u201cI do know he\u2019s not coming today. Tomorrow ... I asked the family,\u201d the woman said. Asked how Dewani and his family were, the woman, who did not give her name, replied: \u201cThey are happy, happy.\u201d Dewani was free to return to the UK after the judge, Jeanette Traverso, dismissed the case against him, describing evidence against him as being \u201criddled with contradictions\u201d. The collapse of the trial in Cape Town left his wife\u2019s family devastated and Anni\u2019s uncle, Ashok Hindocha, said they were exploring the possibility of taking legal action in the bid to find answers. Hindocha said the decision to halt the trial before Dewani gave evidence meant there were \u201choles to be filled\u201d in the story about his niece\u2019s final days. Speaking from Sweden, he told the Guardian: \u201cWe were hoping for closure. We still do not have that but hope that we will have it in the near future. We need to get the family together here and see what options we have, what possibilities we have to continue the process. \u201cThere is still determination to continue. Otherwise we will have sleepless nights for the rest of our lives. We choose determination.\u201d The family will gather in Sweden over Christmas to plan their next moves. \u201cWe need to be together; we\u2019ve been away from each other for a long time now \u2013 some of the family here, some in the UK, some in South Africa. All we\u2019ve had is telephone contact. We really need to speak all together and speak to lawyers and see what options we have.\u201d Hindocha said the family\u2019s \u201cnumber one\u201d option was some sort of legal action in the UK. Hindocha said Dewani, whose legal team said in court that he was bisexual, had lied to the family and to Anni about his sexuality. \u201cHe lied the moment he told Anni that he loved her and they were in a serious relationship. He lied to the priest in India [where the couple married]. He should have spoken the truth and said: \u2019Look Anni, I love you but I\u2019m gay, bisexual.\u2019 I think that is a crucial thing. When you go into a long-term relationship you must be honest.\u201d Of the legal process in Cape Town, he said: \u201cWe didn\u2019t get the full story out of South Africa. The judge wouldn\u2019t allow it. There were crucial points to be debated.\u201d He conceded there were holes in the evidence of taxi driver Zola Tongo. \u201cBut I\u2019m sure many of those holes could have been filled if Shrien had been cross-examined. We never got the answers. We never got the chance to know. He\u2019s never been cross-examined. The judge in South Africa bought everything that Shrien\u2019s lawyer said.\u201d Asked about what he thought of the image of Dewani leaving South Africa via Cape Town airport, Hindocha said: \u201cWe never said who is guilty, who is not guilty. Our objective has been that we want to know the truth. We did not get it from South Africa.

Despite scepticism in many quarters that he would be able to turn his back on race-riding at the age of just 34, Spencer had insisted that his mind was made up, and that he was looking forward to the new challenge of a management role in Sheikh Fahad al-Thani\u2019s Qatar Racing operation. Spencer was Qatar Racing\u2019s retained jockey in 2013 and 2014 but Andrea Atzeni was hired to replace him from 2015 shortly after Spencer revealed his decision to retire and it subsequently emerged that Spencer had been told before making his announcement that his retainer would not be renewed in 2015. Spencer has now decided to turn down Sheikh Fahad\u2019s offer of a behind-the-scenes role in the hope of continuing to compete in the saddle at the highest level. His most high-profile ride in 2015 promises to be Toast Of New York, who was touched off by Bayern in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic in early November and is being prepared for a possible rematch with the winner in the Dubai World Cup, the world\u2019s richest race, on 28 March. In a statement released on Sunday afternoon via the sports PR agency Nicholas Whittle, Spencer said that while \u201cSheikh Fahad and Qatar Racing offered me a wonderful opportunity to become part of their management team\u201d, he had \u201cdecided that at this stage in my life, I am not going to accept it\u201d. He continued: \u201cI have discussed at length with Sheikh Fahad my decision to carry on riding and he fully understands and supports me. He appreciates that riding is what makes me happy and the last thing he wants to do is to stand in the way of that. \u201cI will be riding as a freelance but obviously I have certain existing links and relationships with trainers that I will be utilising. I am looking forward to being entirely free and available for the first time in six seasons and developing new associations. I have no specific targets other than to continue to be successful. \u201cThere have been a few close confidants that have helped me in making this decision and I\u2019d like to thank them for their support. At the time of their offer, I thought I was ready to retire from race-riding and take up a position with Qatar Racing. \u201cSheikh Fahad understands completely why I no longer feel I can accept the offer, and that is what is most important to me. I am less concerned about what others may think or say.\u201d Jamie Osborne, the trainer of Toast Of New York, said on Sunday that he was delighted to hear his horse would not need a new jockey when he travels to Dubai in March. \u201cI always felt that maybe the decision was, perhaps, slightly knee-jerk and I hoped that given more time to reflect he could change his mind,\u201d Osborne said. \u201cHe obviously has done that and I\u2019m delighted he has.\u201d Kevin Ryan, another trainer who has booked Spencer regularly in the past, also expressed his happiness at the news that the dual champion jockey had had a change of heart. \u201cHe\u2019s been a big part of this yard for a long time and, from our point of view, we\u2019re delighted he\u2019s not giving up,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe\u2019s too talented a rider and too young to walk away from the game now. \u201cWe all make decisions. Sometimes they\u2019re right and sometimes they\u2019re wrong, and he has obviously changed his mind. He\u2019s had a very good end to the year and I think maybe riding at the big meetings has whetted his appetite again.\u201d Gordon Elliott got the better of Willie Mullins in the weekend\u2019s main race in Ireland for the second week running on Sunday as No More Heroes stayed on strongly to beat Shaneshill by one-and-three-quarter lengths in the Grade Two Navan Novice Hurdle. Shaneshill was the leading bumper horse of the 2013-14 season and went to post as the 4-9 favourite to follow up a debut win over hurdles at Fairyhouse last month. He moved up to challenge No More Heroes, the 3-1 second-favourite, jumping the final flight and briefly headed him, but the winner responded generously when asked for a final effort by Barry Geraghty and ran on strongly to secure victory. No More Heroes is the new favourite for the three-mile Albert Bartlett Novice Hurdle at Cheltenham\u2019s Festival meeting in March at a best price of 8-1, while Shaneshill has eased from 7-1 to 10-1 for the Neptune Investment Management Novice Hurdle. \u201cI think he\u2019s a very nice horse,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cBarry said they didn\u2019t go fast enough for him, and he was a bit guessy at a few of them. \u201cI\u2019m not sure where he\u2019ll go next and Naas [for the Grade One Lawlors Hotel Novice Hurdle on 4 January] may come a bit quick for him. He\u2019s a three-mile horse for Cheltenham and I\u2019d be looking at the Albert Bartlett.\u201d Elliott also confirmed that Don Cossack, who beat Mullins\u2019s Boston Bob in the John Durkan Memorial Chase at Punchestown last weekend, is likely to go straight to the Cheltenham Gold Cup in March. \u201cHe\u2019s come out of the race very well,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cHe\u2019ll definitely not be turning up at Christmas and I doubt if he\u2019ll turn up in the Hennessy [at Leopardstown in February]. I\u2019ll have to talk it over [with Michael O\u2019Leary, Don Cossack\u2019s owner] but he could go straight to Cheltenham.\u201d Pineau De Re, the winner last season\u2019s Grand National, was pulled up in a handicap hurdle at Carlisle on Sunday, a month after beating only one horse home on his seasonal reappearance at Cheltenham. \u201cI was a bit disappointed with him today,\u201d Dr Richard Newland, Pineau De Re\u2019s trainer, said. \u201cHe travelled well for two miles and, for whatever reason, he weakened very quickly. He seemed fine after the race, but he got very tired. The ground probably wasn\u2019t ideal and there wasn\u2019t much pace in the race, but overall I am disappointed. \u201cWe\u2019ve been going softly, softly with him and we\u2019ll keep chipping away.

A decison last month by Opec, which supplies about 40% of the world\u2019s oil, to keep production unchanged despite the price fall only served to send crude sliding even lower. On Sunday, the United Arab Emirates energy minister, Suhail Al-Mazrouei, said Opec would not cut crude output even if the price dropped as low as $40 a barrel.

It said that although the increase was from a low base, it was significant because insolvencies in the sector had been rare over the last five years. Jeremey Willmont at Moore Stephens said: \u201cThe fall in the oil price has translated into insolvencies in the oil and gas services sector remarkably quickly. The oil and gas services sector has enjoyed very strong trading conditions for the last 15 years, so perhaps they have not been quite so well prepared for a sustained deterioration in trading conditions as other sectors would have been. \u201cThere was a sharp drop in the oil price during the financial crisis, but the sense that oil prices could be depressed for some time is much more widespread this time around. \u201cIt is clear that oil and gas majors are already cutting costs. Both Shell and BP have recently announced cuts to investment in a number of major projects. Smaller players are also reconsidering their capital deployment. If this retrenchment continues the result will be less work for oil and gas services companies.\u201d Energy consultancy Wood Mackenzie has estimated that 32 potential European oil field developments worth more than \u00a355bn are waiting for approval and could be at risk if oil prices continue to slump.

Hamilton\u2019s odds came in from their original 3/1 price but, even still, the margin of his victory is an indication of how many underestimated the esteem in which his second drivers\u2019 title was held by the public. McIlroy was graceful in defeat, even if many of the golfing fraternity were perplexed at the decision. Ian Poulter tweeted: \u201cObsolutely [sic] ridiculous that @McIlroyRory has not won Sports Personality 2014. Huge respect to @LewisHamilton but come on.\u201d He added: \u201c@BBCSPOTY has turned into a complete joke. It\u2019s such a great shame. Huge congrats to @LewisHamilton, but he had 1 person to beat all year.\u201d Joey Barton wrote: \u201cMcIlroy, wins multiple golf Majors and Ryder Cup. Froch, boxing World champion. In fact every other nominee was more deserving the [sic] Hamilton.\u201d McIlroy played some sublime golf on the way to a first Open title at Hoylake in July, made it back-to-back majors with the US PGA at Valhalla, and was part of the European Ryder Cup-winning team in September, during which he demolished his good friend Rickie Fowler in the singles on the final day. Hamilton\u2019s second title, though, ensured he became the first F1 winner of the Sports Personality since Damon Hill in 1996. Perhaps it was simply that the public perceived Hamilton\u2019s achievements as superior to McIlroy\u2019s \u2013 86,000 votes suggest that was certainly the case. Yet there may have been other factors at play. McIlroy\u2019s majestic success at Hoylake was five months ago. In contrast, Hamilton secured his second title in fine style only three weeks ago in Abu Dhabi, a performance of impressive mental fortitude to stay ahead of his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Fresh in the public\u2019s memory, the timing of these respective victories may have proved crucial to the voting. It is also worth noting that McIlroy\u2019s other successes \u2013 his win in the Kentucky dusk at Valhalla and the European victory at Gleneagles, were not shown on free-to-air TV. Both were shown on Sky \u2013 as was his year-ending success in European Tour\u2019s season climax the Race to Dubai \u2013 while a significant number of Hamilton\u2019s races, including the finale at Abu Dhabi, were broadcast by Sky and the BBC. Hamilton certainly received ample support before the Spoty vote and perhaps the result should not have been so surprising. His official Facebook page has 2.9m likes compared to McIlroy\u2019s 708,000, while he has 2.5m followers on Twitter to the Ulsterman\u2019s 2.2m. In the digital age of social media power, this could also have proved key. The hashtag \u00a3VOTE4LH44 was used numerous times online, as were pictures of Hamilton draped in a Union Flag. It means that golf has not had a Spoty winner since Sir Nick Faldo prevailed in 1989.", "title": "Lewis Hamilton could owe Sports Personality win to social media age", "sentences": ["Both were shown on Sky \u2013 as was his year-ending success in European Tour\u2019s season climax the Race to Dubai \u2013 while a significant number of Hamilton\u2019s races, including the finale at Abu Dhabi, were broadcast by Sky and the BBC."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-15T16:14:25Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/dec/16/steve-smith-the-accidental-tourist-finds-his-home-in-the-captaincy", "tags": ["Steve Smith", "Australia cricket team", "Cricket", "Australia sport"], "article": "Steven Smith is Australia\u2019s Test captain. That isn\u2019t something I was supposed to write this season. It\u2019s not something I ever imagined I\u2019d write a year ago, let alone two. But Michael Clarke\u2019s failing body and Brad Haddin\u2019s advanced years have led selectors to look to the future.  In the preferred scenario, Smith will only lead three Tests in the next few weeks before handing back to Clarke. But there remains the prospect that this could be a full-time appointment, and either way, the succession plan is clear. Viewed in its entirety, the path Smith has taken to this point is a series of happy accidents gummed together with outrageous talent. Only 25, Smith has already been through half a dozen cricketing incarnations, and it was only against England at Trent Bridge last year that his most recent and stable upgrade was gradually made public. First he was a cricketing hunch, a leg-spinning batsman who had taken 7/64 in a Sheffield Shield game in 2010. He debuted in Tests at No 8 against Pakistan in England, took a couple of wickets, made no runs in three innings, then belted an ODI-style 77 with the tail in his fourth. Six months on, Marcus North\u2019s dwindling returns saw Smith come in at No 6 for the last three Tests of Australia\u2019s 2010/11 Ashes hiding. A brisk 54* in a lost cause was his biggest reward, along with endless comments that he\u2019d never make a Test batsman. For the next two years he drifted, becoming the quintessential limited-overs player: handy bowling, great in the field, can whack. He did well captaining the Sydney Sixers without being distracted by their glaring uniforms, but he wasn\u2019t quite enough of anything. His selection in the 2013 Test squad to India was hard to believe. The rationale was that he was strong against spin, but buckling in alongside Glenn Maxwell, Moises Henriques and Xavier Doherty, the impression was of a Test squad full of domestic limited-overs plonkers. Even then, he wasn\u2019t supposed to play: the batting was set and Usman Khawaja was next in line. But when coach Mickey Arthur\u2019s faltering grip saw Shane Watson and Khawaja suspended, Smith was the last man standing. Australia\u2019s batsmen were being tied in knots in a series where India\u2019s spinners would take 82% of the wickets. Smith walked out to the dry pitch and played them with ease, lofting four down the ground from his fourth ball, a picture of serenity as he skipped to the pitch in attack and in defence. But that was still supposed be that. Runs in Mohali didn\u2019t count for much in Manchester. It was March 2013, and for the final close call of Smith\u2019s rise, he wasn\u2019t even included in Australia\u2019s extended Ashes squad for the tour in June.  But when Clarke had back problems (sound familiar?) and David Warner got suspended (sound familiar?), Smith\u2019s century for Australia A got him the nod as a back-up batsman. Somehow, in the days leading up to the first Test at Nottingham, he got a further nod. When we settled into the stand at Trent Bridge I wasn\u2019t expecting to see him on the team sheet, but there he was. I wasn\u2019t expecting to see him in the middle, either, but at 3/22 he was out there in quick time. It still created unease. Steve Smith? Really? But there he was, after 6.2 overs, taking strike.  Compact, jittery, constantly moving. He held the bat cocked back like a wasp sting, twitching as the bowler ran in, then going gloriously still for an instant before that backlift became a flash through the line of the ball. Steven Finn went for four boundaries in no time. Graeme Swann came on, the esteemed spinner, six overs from stumps, Australia four wickets down now. Smith cantered down to put his fourth ball in the crowd. Then through cover for four. The next morning in glorious sunshine, Smith cracked a few more shots and then nicked a drive on 52, one of those dismissals where you feel there must be some mistake because he\u2019s been playing so well. As it happens, another dewy-eyed young pup showed off some elegant strokes that day, as Ashton Agar got within a whisker of a century from No11. The crowd went wild and Smith\u2019s innings was lost in the wash. But that was the moment his rise really began, as someone who could play spin in India or seam in England.  Now you can add the deserts of Dubai and the wiles of Pakistan, the bounce of home and the Ashes rescue jobs, the tracks and attacks of fierce South Africa, and you have something of the story Smith has written in those 18 months. Most impressive of all was the Test just gone, joining with NSW team-mates Warner and Clarke to deliver a trio of centuries in memory of a departed friend.  It seemed a different Smith who took off his helmet to salute that milestone: broader of chest, surer of stance, and providing the lasting image of the match as he pointed to the memorial 408 painted on the Adelaide Oval turf. Smith didn\u2019t need to be asked to take responsibility, he was already taking it. His resoluteness and reliability down the order was already leadership. His energy in the field was already infectious. As unlikely as it may have seemed, Smith made himself a Test player. Once that was done, he made himself indispensable.  Now that\u2019s been achieved, his country has made him captain. It\u2019s so much the right call that it no longer even feels strange writing it down.", "title": "Steve Smith: the accidental tourist finds his home in the captaincy", "sentences": ["Now you can add the deserts of Dubai and the wiles of Pakistan, the bounce of home and the Ashes rescue jobs, the tracks and attacks of fierce South Africa, and you have something of the story Smith has written in those 18 months."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-16T00:47:07Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2014/dec/16/pills-philanthropy-and-parasitic-worms", "tags": ["Global development professionals network", "Infectious diseases", "Medical research", "Philanthropy", "Burundi", "Africa", "Partnership"], "article": "In 2006, staff from Legatum, a Dubai-based investment firm, read in a Financial Times article that the worst neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) could be controlled for just 50 cents per person per year. Subsequently, the firm made an investment into integrated-NTD treatment and developed a model for programmes in Africa.  The global movement to end NTDs has seen significant momentum in recent years. One of the most promising aspects of this is that new partners have joined the efforts, including private philanthropists who may never have even heard of these diseases a few years ago. Burundi was selected for Legatum\u2019s trial investment due to its size and feasibility, and schistosomiasis was chosen as one of the diseases to target. Also known as bilharzia or snail fever, schistosomiasis is a parasitic worm infection that leads to stunted growth and cognitive underdevelopment in children. In adults, it can cause chronic illness through damage to the liver, intestines, lungs, and bladder that, if left untreated, may result in death. Symptoms are not easily identified by rural health clinicians and it is easy for schistosomiasis to go undiagnosed. Schistosomiasis disproportionately affects the rural poor in sub-Saharan Africa. The chronic symptoms of the disease force children to miss school and adults to miss work, causing families to suffer decreased household income. These effects and conditions contribute greatly to the cycle of poverty within endemic areas, making economic and social development an even more challenging goal. The Burundi NTD programme adopted World Health Organisation guidelines for control and elimination of schistosomiasis using community-wide distribution of a drug called praziquantel. This preventive chemotherapy treatment, donated by German pharmaceutical company Merck Serono, was distributed through mass drug administration (MDA).  As a disease that only affects specific populations living and working near water with freshwater snails, schistosomiasis requires precise mapping of endemic areas. Mapping is conducted through testing urine samples to understand the exact geographic distribution of the disease, and to plan a targeted treatment campaign.  Mapping was completed in Burundi in 2008 and endemic areas were targeted with integrated MDA, coordinated by the health ministry\u2019s NTD team and the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative (SCI).  A new concept at the time, integrated MDA combines treatment for NTDs with the distribution of micronutrients and vaccines for children. This keeps costs down and ensures the maximum benefits for patients; children and adults received praziquantel drugs to treat their schistosomiasis, as well as other medicines for intestinal worms, trachoma, and onchocerciasis (river blindness).  In the four years of this programme, Burundi reached 90% of school children at risk of schistosomiasis through eight rounds of MDA. At the end of the programme in 2011, national prevalence of schistosomiasis had been reduced from 12% to 1.4%. These efforts to control schistosomiasis showed enough promise of ending the disease that Burundi was selected as a pilot country by the Schistosomiasis Consortium for Operation Research and Evaluation (Score) to assess the potential of moving beyond control to elimination.  What can be learned from Burundi to inform progress on NTD control elsewhere? Firstly, a committed health ministry is essential to prioritise and coordinate integrated treatment efforts and achieve high coverage, both in terms of geography and distribution. These elements are crucial to reaching treatment goals.  Successful collaboration with the water, sanitation, and hygiene (Wash) and nutrition sectors also strengthens the sustainability of the programme. In addition, the ongoing commitment of a dedicated funder was essential for reaching these targets. With continued coordination, shared learning, and dedication, there is a strong chance we can realise the goals of the WHO Roadmap to eliminate NTDs.

A little more feverish, a little more overblown, and generally a bit more like life might look lived entirely inside a cartoon operetta peopled by one-note superheroes whose time is divided up between exhilarating acts of high-definition athletic drama and trying to sell you a soft drink. As is now apparently compulsory, the year was dominated by football, with the Brazil 2014 World Cup the centrepiece over six furious weeks in June and July. This was a tournament that had looked at one stage as though it might struggle to actually happen at all, beleaguered by infrastructure overspend and social unrest. But which in the end provided a fairly standard Fifa tournament, a familiar mix of glossily packaged homogeneity through which, invariably, football itself still manages to captivate and charm. Germany won, becoming the first European country to win on South American soil, reward for a 12-year Bundesliga revamp that spawned the current generation of technically supreme academy products. Argentina were beaten finalists, condemned by overly cautious tactics to judder through the tournament with Lionel Messi an increasingly soft-pedalled influence. This was a World Cup of vivid moments: Brazil\u2019s tear-stained, astonishingly brittle 7-1 semi-final hammering by Germany in Rio de Janeiro; some wonderful counterattacking play by Colombia, Chile and Holland; and a record-equalling total of 177 goals, driven mainly by an unusually open group stage. England, almost entirely detached from the central spectacle, stank the place out once again, departing after five days of competitive football.     Team Europe pose with the trophy as they celebrate retaining the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles, Scotland. Adrian Dennis/Getty Photograph: Adrian Dennis/Getty    The Ryder Cup came and went in a flurry of polyester at Gleneagles, Europe taking the trophy for the third time in a row with a display of unrelenting power-golf, leading from the start to canter home by five points. Europe celebrated with the usual champagne-drenched speechifying. America celebrated with a public hatchet job by Phil Mickelson over the \u201cmanagement philosophy\u201d of team captain Tom Watson. Rory McIlroy was player of the year, winning the British Open, the World Golf Championship and the US PGA Championship in a run of brilliance that arrived shortly after he\u2019d broken off his publicity-drenched engagement to Caroline Wozniacki in the course of a 10-minute phone call, the first five of which she apparently thought was a practical joke. It was, just about, Australia\u2019s year in Test cricket as Mitchell Johnson\u2019s fast-bowling-for-the-ages saw the Aussies complete a 5-0 Ashes whitewash in Sydney before beating the World No\u00a01 team South Africa over three Tests. Their subsequent annihilation by Pakistan in Dubai only added to the sense of a sport in a state of general flux. Elsewhere cricket continued to eat itself as the ECB, BCCI and ACB announced a deeply controversial plan to divvy up and parcel out international cricket more profitably among themselves in future. And the cricketing year ended on a note of terrible sadness as Phillip Hughes (pictured), a hugely popular 25-year-old of prodigious batting talent, died three days after being hit on the back of the neck by a bouncer while batting at the SCG. His death was a shattering moment for Australia, cricket and sport in general. In Sochi the Winter Olympics passed off well enough. Team GB continued British sport\u2019s well-funded ascent in the marginal, equipment-heavy Olympic disciplines, returning with its best medal haul since 1924. Elsewhere perhaps the moment of the games was the heartbreaking fall suffered by 15-year-old Russian ice skater and poster girl for the games Yulia Lipnitskaya. While the award for weirdest post-Sochi cheating story involving a celebrity musician goes to Vanessa Mae, whose presence in the women\u2019s giant slalom drew headlines and, ultimately, the revelation that the violinist\u2019s qualifying races had been fiddled to ensure she made it there, drawing a four-year competitive ban.     Yulia Lipnitskaya of Russia falls while competing in the figure skating ladies\u2019 short program at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. Photograph: Matthew Stockman/Getty    The Commonwealth Games pegged itself out across 11 well-attended days in Glasgow: England topped the medals table, Usain Bolt anchored Jamaica\u2019s sprint relay gold in a tartan tam o\u2019shanter and the star of the games was 16-year-old, 1.3-metre gymnast Claudia Fragapane, who came from nowhere to win four gold medals with a peculiar mix of street-dance waggling and high technique. In 2014 the men who always dominate tennis dominated tennis a little less, with a slight tweak to the usual grand-slam roster as the likeable powerhouse Stanislas Wawrinka won the Australian Open and the 14th seed Marin Cilic entered from far left-field to win the US Open. On the women\u2019s tour Serena Williams continues to creep up through the foothills of all-time greatdom, passing 200 weeks combined as world No 1 and adding another US Open to her swag-bag of slams. The vast carbon-guzzling micro-planet that is Formula One continued to circle the globe dispensing its week-long jolly of billionaire\u2019s gadabout and high-grade engineering. Lewis Hamilton won the driver\u2019s title for the second time, putting in a display of sustained excellence behind the wheel of his Mercedes and even managing to smile nicely afterwards. Ireland won rugby union\u2019s Six Nations, a tournament that saw the world\u2019s favourite celebrity genius fly-half Brian O\u2019Driscoll retire, Scotland lose 51-3 to Wales and England continue to play like a brilliantly lumbering parody of England playing rugby. In cycling, Italy\u2019s Vincenzo Nibali won the 101st Tour de France, having led the race for 18 days out of 21. Ronnie O\u2019Sullivan, who often looks like he could beat the opposition on one leg, beat the opposition on one leg by winning the UK Snooker Championship with a broken ankle, while also knocking in a lucrative 147 break. Meanwhile, in the world of sport-related scandal and gerrymandering Fifa continues to lead the way here as they do on the pitch: Michael Garcia\u2019s report into corruption surrounding the award of the 2018 and 2022 World cups to Russia and Qatar rumbles on like a distant storm (a storm full of corruption, favours, free handbags and untraced bank transfers).

Yeah, I know, that\u2019s what everyone asks: Dior in ... Tokyo? Not Paris? Huh? And then they shake their heads in a fashion-people-are-crazy kind of a way. No. There is method in this madness, and shrewdness in this extravagance. Dior\u2019s Tokyo pre-fall event represents an emerging strategy by the great Parisian fashion houses to retain status by detaching themselves from the decline of France, and reposition themselves as global brands. The phenomenon of the catwalk show on tour \u2013 just a week earlier, Chanel staged one in Salzburg, Austria, and has previously shown in Dubai \u2013 is a\u00a0ploy by which the aristocracy of the fashion industry, who for generations ruled the seas of style unchallenged, intend to maintain their supremacy in a globalised economy.      Photograph: Chung Sung-Jun/Getty Images for Dior    The most striking part of the Tokyo show was that the Dior collection was not Japanese in any obvious way. There were no wide sleeves or obi belts to be seen. Instead, it was steeped in the essence of Tokyo as a modern, even futuristic, city; one that has produced some of fashion\u2019s greatest innovators. \u201cBeneath the surface softness, Christian Dior\u2019s work was very architectural,\u201d Raf Simons, Dior\u2019s creative director, told me the day before the show. \u201cThere is a strong connection there with Yohji Yamamoto, Rei Kawakubo, Issey Miyake. When I\u00a0examine pieces in the Dior archives, it is astonishing how architectural the construction is, for such a feminine look.\u201d Sequinned silver turtleneck sweaters were worn under sleeveless wool dresses with sculpted hips, a\u00a0supremely glamorous version of the tight \u201cbase layer\u201d as a strategy for cosy but sleek cold-weather urban dressing, a look hugely popular in Japan. (Uniqlo, temple of heat-tech turtleneck sweaters, has a 10-storey flagship in Tokyo\u2019s Ginza district.) Coats had an anorak-shine that was weatherproof and flashy; wide-legged trousers were worn with cosy Fair Isle knits. The show was held in Kokugikan, the national sumo wrestling stadium. Simons chose it for the scale \u2013 it seats 10,000, so with an audience of 1,200 it felt so huge that one almost forgot the roof was there, and could imagine the snow to be real. The stadium venue reminded me of something else, though: Will and Kate meeting Jay Z and Beyonc\u00e9 at the Barclays Center in Manhattan a few days previously. This, for Dior, was almost a state visit to Japan. And \u2013 like Kate and Wills meeting the Carters \u2013 one that cast the royal visitors in a flatteringly modern, pop-cultural-savvy light. The Tokyo event follows a Dior catwalk show in Brooklyn back in May, and so far this strategy seems to be working: figures released last month showed a 13% rise in revenues for the most recent quarter, to \u20ac417m (\u00a3331m).     The Christian Dior Cruise 2015 show in Brooklyn. Photograph: JP Yim/Getty Images    Social media and streetstyle have done much to democratise the traditional fashion-week circuit. A small-scale designer in London, New York, Paris or Milan who can get influencers interested can create real buzz without cash. But he or she cannot stage a multimillion-pound event in Tokyo. In this way \u2013 just as the super-rich have left the rest of the world\u2019s population behind \u2013 the most powerful luxury houses have created a new superstratum of international glamour, with which smaller names cannot hope to compete. Each house has its own strategy. Chanel uses its annual M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art show to display the artistry of the haute couture ateliers \u2013 the finesse of the most accomplished embroiderers in the world, the humbling exactitude of ateliers that make only buttons, or specialise in the placement and stitching of different types of feathers. If knowledge is power, M\u00e9tiers d\u2019Art is Chanel\u2019s opportunity to parade their golden key. For Christian Dior, on the other hand, the message is more about demonstrating relevance. This collection \u201cisn\u2019t about being inside a\u00a0boutique, or a cocktail party, it\u2019s about being in the world,\u201d Simons said.\u00a0\u201cThis is a dialogue.

Our initial research into serving the US market has convinced us that in order to succeed we need to begin exploring order fulfilment and potentially even manufacturing in the US. This mission seems like the perfect opportunity to begin making these connections and establish ourselves at the forefront of a major market shift.\u201d Michael Whiteside, director  Studio Connections, London Designer and manufacturer of high performance audio products.     Studio connections. Photograph: Studio connections.    \u201cIt would be groundbreaking if we got through to the final ten on the trade mission. We\u2019re hardly known in the States so this would be phenomenal. The US is a huge potential marketplace for our products, and it could create a change in the size of the business. This trade mission will facilitate this through introductions to a wide range of opportunities and expertise. We would expect to learn about the best way to market and distribute our products in the US and meet people who can give advice on how to establish a network of dealers and distributors.\u201d David Strang, managing director Wicked Vision, Wimbledon Manufacturer of boomerangs and flying toys. \u201cWe would like to become a quintessential British success story and are keen to fly the flag for Wicked and for all British businesses looking to export. We aim to become industry leaders on a global scale and we really feel that entering the US market would springboard our business. Our ambition is to establish a strong foothold in the US market where we feel that there is a huge gap in the market for Wicked that is currently unexplored. After conquering the US, we would love to come back and help other small businesses to achieve the same thing. We are well connected to share our experiences and our successes with other UK-based SMEs.\u201d Doug King, managing director Precision Dippings, Bristol Manufacturer of rubber dipped products for the medical, veterinary and armed forces. \u201cSince launching in 2012, there has been a significant demand for [our waterproof protector product] Bloccs in several streams of the UK wound care market including mobility and outdoor sports. As a result, our products are now carried by Boots, Lloyds Pharmacy and Amazon in the UK. To replicate this success in the US, we\u2019d need to export through channels that give us direct control. As a small business we face significant challenges in forging these channels, specifically in identifying the best export, distribution and sales partners. The Small Business Trade Mission would give us a first-hand insight into the mechanisms which drive the US logistics industry and help raise our profile.\u201d Amanda Barlow, managing director  Spiezia Organics \u2013 Made for Life, Truro, Cornwall Organic skincare brand \u201cActually going out to Atlanta and meeting potential partners and advisers, and presenting the products would be an amazing opportunity for us. It would be hugely beneficial in terms of fast-tracking our objectives and business plan for the growth and development of Spiezia. The ability to experience a supported and mentored visit to Atlanta would ensure that we could really trial our products and services within the US. We believe that the trip would influence potential stakeholders to work with us. The result would increase company turnover and jobs, and ensure that awareness of our Spiezia - Made for Life brand developed rapidly, elevating our stance and opening up opportunities to grow.\u201d Virginie Charles-Dear, founder ToucanBox, London Subscription service offering activity boxes for children aged three to eight.     ToucanBox. Photograph: Toucan    \u201cWe\u2019re looking to expand the business outside of the UK and one of the natural locations for us to expand into is the US. It would be a good opportunity to meet people there, especially on the logistics side as we have lots of questions that we\u2019d like to be answered such as should we build an operation in the US from here or should we find partners out there to help? I also think that the trade mission would provide a good networking opportunity as we\u2019d meet other relevant businesses.\u201d Jordan Daykin  UK Building Products Plasterboard fixings manufacturer. \u201cIn America they build nearly all of their houses out of timber framed buildings / plasterboard walls. This means there is a huge market for our plasterboard fixings for anyone wanting to hang curtain rails all the way through to television brackets / radiators. We would gain the opportunity to export to the US and explore the markets further.\u201d Tim Rhodes, director  Aquaforno, Englefield, West Berkshire Portable outdoor cooking stove and wood-fired pizza oven manufacturer. \u201cWe are currently a small team, but we do have ambition and clarity, and know that we have a product that transcends many US market sectors. However, we don\u2019t have any form of traction in our best potential market. The timing of the trade mission is uncanny as the Hearth, Patio and Barbeque Association (HPBA) is holding its annual exposition in Nashville during the week of the mission, meaning that many of the best contacts in the US from manufacturers to dealers and distributors, will be little more than an hour away. The support and assistance that the mission could lend would bolster our confidence in the knowledge that we would be approaching these contacts in the right way and would be better equipped to meet the expectations of the North American industrial and retail sectors.\u201d Peter Wilkes, managing director  Vale Brothers, Walsall, West Midlands Manufacturer of equestrian products including grooming brushes and accessories. \u201cThe US has two almost separate equestrian markets, Western riding and English style riding. We have numerous contacts in the English style market, but none in the Western market, which is actually larger. We anticipate both ranch and competition horses to be our target market. The trade mission would give us a focal point to invite stakeholders in the US market to. The emphasis on British manufacture is always respected in overseas equestrian products. We would hope that the mission could open valuable doors giving us the opportunity to showcase our product to industry decision makers.\u201d Antonia Burrell, chief executive  Antonia Burrell Holistic Skincare, London Holistic skincare brand, stocked in retailers such as Whole Foods, Harvey Nichols and Harrods. \u201cGoing on the trade mission would allow my business to expand and operate and export at the rate I plan to. America is a very exciting market for us; it\u2019s so diverse and that\u2019s what we are about - reaching out to different markets within a market. The US is so vast \u2013 I\u2019ve spent six months of this year researching the market. The way I\u2019d approach the US would be to PR there first, but again it\u2019s so big; I know you\u2019ve got to be targeted and target different states one at a time.\u201d John Wood, chief executive  Plastic Castle, Newcastle-under-Lyme Manufacturer of a shock absorbing foam replacement component for sports and personal protective equipment. \u201cThe trade mission would provide access to markets that are a specific target but would otherwise be inaccessible at this moment in time because of the cost. If I wanted to go and meet four or five different customers, it would cost about \u00a34,000 and that\u2019s a lot of money. Plus going with The Guardian gives us kudos. The trip provides an opportunity for Plastic Castle to show the product in situ through simple tests to many customers rather than sending examples or samples, and the potential customers can see how the product fits into their product range and meet the people that will be delivering their solution. Such a trade mission would provide a platform for Plastic Castle to showcase this unique technology to potential customers at a much faster speed and in person. The power of this introduction can never be understated.\u201d Alex Epstein, founder and creator  Concoction, Manchester Customised haircare brand inspired by the art and science of cocktail mixology.

We\u2019re a business that\u2019s just starting to export already \u2013 we\u2019ve launched in Australia and recently in Sephora in Dubai. The US is an important market for us and the mission would be a helping hand to getting established over there. Concoction has lots to gain from securing a place on the mission. It would be an opportunity to carry out vital market research and introduce potential retailers and distributors to our products; we have a strong brand and proposition that presents a great fit for them in the US.\u201d Lynne Sanders, founder and managing director  Cosmetics a la Carte, London Make-up, primer and skincare brand with a boutique at London\u2019s Knightsbridge and also sold through online and mail order. \u201cWe\u2019ve been approached so many times before by American retailers, particularly in California but it\u2019s not that easy to export to the US \u2013 we\u2019d like a hand in knowing someone who knows the rules and regulations. As a manufacturer, we would be keen to forge links with experts in legal and regulatory aspects of importing and retailing in the US, and potential co-producers for white-label products under US-specific branding or celebrity/makeup artist association. Participation in the trade mission would enable networking, learning and collaboration to engage the US market and strengthen further existing business activities in the UK and Europe.\u201d Emma Shipley, owner and designer Emma J Shipley, Hackney Womenswear and accessories brand, targeting luxury department stores and boutiques worldwide. \u201cIt would huge for me and my business if we were selected for the trade mission. If successful, it would be our first business trip to the US and it would be a great opportunity to travel out there with the best of British brands. I\u2019m keen to learn more about the US market first-hand, and discover the potential for our business. We believe there is a market for us, but we would like to gain some experience and direct feedback. It will also be important to get feedback on the product, and whether there are any specific considerations or alterations that should be made when designing for the US. We have heard that direct contact is very important in the US - and in our experience, many of the stores do not travel outside of the country so it will be crucial to start making contacts and building a network that we can foster and grow in the future.\u201d Charles Ebubedike, chief executive Clinova Pharmaceutical company focused on developing, manufacturing and marketing consumer healthcare products such as oral rehydration salts brand O.R.S \u201cWe feel that taking part in the mission will provide an amazing opportunity to be able to launch our products into the American marketplace and meet with key influencers. As a business we are extremely driven to succeed and make O.R.S a global brand as displayed by our progress to date in the UK and having launched into various markets such as Malta, UAE, Ireland, Kuwait, Iraq, Chile and shortly Canada, Kenya, South Africa and Portugal. This drive means that we will make the most of this opportunity.\u201d UPS and the Guardian Small Business Network will be taking ten small businesses on a trade mission to Atlanta in March 2015.

With the country beginning three days of mourning, the army\u2019s chief of staff, Raheel Sharif, headed to Kabul for talks with the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, over tackling the senior Tehreek-e-Taliban members hiding on the Afghanistan side of the border. His top prioritywill almost certainly be to secure Afghanistan\u2019s cooperation in capturing Mullah Fazlullah, the Pakistan Taliban\u2019s leader. Responding to revulsion in Pakistan at the the atrocity, which left 132 schoolchildren dead, the prime minister approved an end to the death penalty moratorium, which was introduced in 2008, for terror-related cases. The move came after he chaired a meeting in Peshawar to discuss how to respond to the attack. The moratorium applied only to civilians, and a soldier was executed in 2012. Hanging remains on the statute book and judges have continued to pass sentence, leaving about 8,000 people on death row. The prime minister also echoed army commanders\u2019 vows to step up military action against Taliban strongholds in the federally administered tribal areas along the border with Afghanistan. Some of the dead were buried overnight, but most of the funerals were to be held on Wednesday. Nine members of the school\u2019s staff were also killed. Another 121 students and three staff members were wounded. The school is run by the army, and many of the parents are military personnel. The father of one of the children, Akhtar Hussain, a labourer who said he had worked for years in Dubai to provide for his family, told the Associated Press: \u201cThey finished in minutes what I had lived my whole life for, my son.\u201d As he buried 14-year-old Fahad, he said: \u201cThat innocent one is now gone in the grave, and I can\u2019t wait to join him. I can\u2019t live anymore.\u201d As outrage and horror were expressed around the world, it remains to be seen whether the massacre will mark a turning-point in Pakistan\u2019s ambiguous approach to militant extremists. Pakistan\u2019s intelligence agency, the ISI, has at times denounced the Pakistan Taliban while supporting its Afghan counterpart in an effort to offset growing Indian influence in Kabul. It has also supported violent Kashmiri separatist groups responsible for terrorist attacks in India. The speed with which the army\u2019s chief of staff decided to visit Kabul is significant, raising the question of whether Pakistan is finally prepared to work with the new Afghan president, not only to tackle Pakistan Taliban members hiding out in Kunar and Nuristan provinces, but also Afghan Taliban operating from the Pakistan side of the border. Seven members of the Pakistan Taliban wearing suicide vests scaled the school wall on Tuesday morning before opening fire on students and teachers. The siege lasted about eight hours, with commandos killing some of the attackers, while others blew themselves up. Students said that female teachers were doused in petrol and burned alive. Journalists allowed entry to the school on Wednesday reported seeing broken glass, rubble, children\u2019s shoes and pools of blood in an auditorium where the army said about 100 of the victims had been killed. An army spokesman, Maj Gen Asim Bajwa, who showed journalists round the school, said the body of the principal, Tahira Qazi, had been found among the debris.

The brutal attack on a prestigious army school killed 148, mostly students, in a bloody eight-hour siege that horrified even a country numbed by years of bombings, assassinations and suicide assaults. Facing a wave of anger and grief, Nawaz Sharif lifted a moratorium on the death penalty for terror-related cases, and announced a dramatic shift in government policy towards extremist groups. \u201cWe announce that there will be no differentiation between \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 Taliban,\u201d he said, referring to the Pakistani military\u2019s long history of clandestine support for those militant groups it believes support its own strategic objectives. These have mostly been groups Islamabad sees as offsetting Indian influence, from violent separatist groups in Kashmir, to the Taliban in Afghanistan. \u201cWe have resolved to continue the war against terrorism till the last terrorist is eliminated,\u201d he told a select group of politicians summoned to Peshawar, the site of the attack. \u201c[The country] must never forget these scenes.\u201d Sharif also echoed army commanders\u2019 vows to step up military action against strongholds along the porous mountain border with Afghanistan. With the country beginning three days of mourning, the army\u2019s chief of staff, Raheel Sharif, headed to Kabul for talks with the Afghan president, Ashraf Ghani, over tackling senior members of the Pakistani Taliban, based in the country\u2019s lawless east. His top priority will almost certainly be to secure Afghanistan\u2019s cooperation in capturing Mullah Fazlullah, the group\u2019s leader. The tragedy that prompted the visit gave it urgency and gravity, but the irony of Pakistan\u2019s request will be lost on few in the region. For years Kabul has begged Pakistan to root out the Afghan Taliban leadership hiding inside its border, including its leader Mullah Omar. Instead they have been tolerated, and sometimes supported, Afghan intelligence officials say. In recent years though, the extremist violence that has tormented Afghanistan so long has become increasingly familiar across the border. The school assault was unprecedented in its bloody sadism towards children, but comes after a string of other high-profile attacks, including on the international airport in the port city of Karachi. Seven members of the Pakistan Taliban, or Tehrik-e Taliban Pakistan (TTP), scaled the school wall on Tuesday morning, some wearing suicide vests. Inside they opened fire on students and teachers, including dozens attending a first aid training session in a large auditorium, leaving the rows of seats slick with blood and the walls pockmarked with bullets. The siege lasted about eight hours, with commandos killing some of the attackers, while others blew themselves up. Some of the dead were buried on Tuesday, but most of the funerals were to be held on Wednesday. The father of one of the children, Akhtar Hussain, a labourer who said he had worked for years in Dubai to provide for his family, told the Associated Press: \u201cThey finished in minutes what I had lived my whole life for, my son.\u201d As he buried 14-year-old Fahad, he said: \u201cThat innocent one is now gone in the grave, and I can\u2019t wait to join him. I can\u2019t live any more.\u201d Analysts have long argued that the toll of insurgent attacks on Pakistani society and the army itself would eventually prompt a shift in attitudes inside the military, whose secretive ISI intelligence agency is widely believed to manage relations with extremist groups. But the sweeping crackdown Kabul wants has so far not materialised, and Afghanistan has been reluctant to chase Pakistani militants while its own enemies are left in relative peace, drawing the two governments into a cycle of bloodshed and destruction. That was reinforced on Wednesday, when insurgents attacked a bank in Afghanistan\u2019s Helmand province, just as funeral rites for Tuesday\u2019s victims were getting under way. At least 10 people were killed, Reuters reported. Ghani, Afghanistan\u2019s new president, wants to reset ties with Islamabad, and appears convinced that collaboration with Pakistan is the only path to peace for either nation. \u201cThe time has arrived for Afghanistan and Pakistan to act together against terrorism and extremism with honesty and effectiveness,\u201d Ghani said in a statement after the latest meeting, which also included the ISI chief, General Raheel. Neither side disclosed the content of the meeting, but Pakistan said it had shared intelligence with Ghani. \u201cWe are hoping that we will see strong action from the Afghan side in the coming days,\u201d the Pakistani army spokesman Major General Asim Saleem Bajwa said, adding that the new leadership in Kabul had shown it was willing to act. However, Ghani is also a fierce nationalist, and is unlikely to agree any kind of long-term assistance tracking Pakistani Taliban in his country unless it is matched by a genuine crackdown on Afghan fighters sheltering in Pakistan. It remains to be seen if Pakistan\u2019s military leadership shares the prime minister\u2019s resolve, or if the civilian government will be able to crack down on groups who have carved out important roles for themselves providing services in a poor country with a weak state. Their ambiguous position was on display at one of the funerals attended by the Guardian, where men with FIF placards mingled among the crowd.

All three organisations are proscribed by the UN\u2019s terrorism sanction committee. On Tuesday Hafiz Saeed, the leader of JuD and a man subject to a $10m US bounty, took to the airwaves to largely exonerate the TTP of their crimes.

This, though, was surely their finest moment. For much of the year, Treve, the brilliant winner of the 2013 Arc, had seemed to be a diminishing shadow of her three-year-old self, but Criquette Head-Maarek never lost faith and coaxed the filly back to her best to become the first dual winner for 36 years. Her \u201cPapa\u201d, Alec Head, bred Treve at the family stud. \u201cI am in a dream, in a dream,\u201d he said afterwards. \u201cI have trained several Arc winners, but Treve is the best of them.\u201d 2) Sire De Grugy wins at Cheltenham, 12 March  If the days are gone when cheaply bought horses from unheralded yards could win feature races at Cheltenham \u2013 and, on the whole, they probably are - then Sire De Grugy was a glorious exception to prove the rule. Trained by Gary Moore, a grafter\u2019s grafter, and ridden by his son Jamie, brother of the multi-millionaire Flat jockey Ryan, Sire De Grugy\u2019s win in the Queen Mother Champion Chase cleared the weighing room as Moore\u2019s colleagues emerged to applaud both horse and rider back to the winner\u2019s enclosure. It was the first Festival victory for both trainer and jockey, and in all likelihood the last as well, unless Sire De Grugy can follow up in three months\u2019 time. 3) Noble Mission wins the Champion Stakes, 18 October  A famous and talented sibling can be a burden for any athlete to bear, and Frankel\u2019s younger brother spent much of his career reminding everyone that a flawless pedigree can only take you so far. He got lucky when it mattered, though, as heavy rain before Champions Day not only reduced the field for the feature race, but also left the ground ideal for a mud-loving front-runner. Noble Mission refused to yield in a duel with Al Kazeem through the final quarter-mile, and guaranteed an ecstatic welcome into the winner\u2019s enclosure for his trainer Lady Cecil, the widow of Sir Henry, who trained Frankel. Britain\u2019s most valuable raceday needed an abiding memory, and Noble Mission arrived to save the day. 4) Toast Of New York finishes second in the Breeders\u2019 Cup Classic, 1 November  As unlikely a story as any in racing this year, or any year. Jamie Osborne, bashed-up jump jockey turned trainer, sends many more horses to lowly Wolverhampton than he does to Ascot, Epsom and Newmarket put together, but he was a nose away from becoming the first British trainer to win the Classic, America\u2019s most valuable race, on dirt. After a compelling three-way battle down the straight, Toast Of New York, a brave bull of a horse, should probably have got the race in the stewards\u2019 room, but he is due to get another go at Bayern, the winner, in the most valuable race of them all, the Dubai World Cup, in March. 5) The Cheltenham Gold Cup, 14 March  All 23 minutes of it. It was thrilling enough on the track, as the race changed completely after the last fence when Silviniaco Conti, who led over it, faded badly as Lord Windermere charged down the outside to short-head On His Own. But there is nothing like a good stewards\u2019 inquiry to drag out the drama, and this was a knife-edge belter. It took the officials 15 minutes before they decided to leave the result unaltered. Cue delight for Jim Culloty, successful three times in the Gold Cup as a jockey on Best Mate and now as a trainer too, and despair \u2013 but, sportingly, no appeal \u2013 in the Willie Mullins camp. He must wait to join the elite club of trainers who have won the Grand National, Champion Hurdle and Gold Cup. 6) Pineau De Re wins the Grand National, 5 April The biggest yards tend to divvy up most of Cheltenham\u2019s main events these days, but the Grand National remains a defiantly different beast. Dr Richard Newland has space for just 12 horses at his stable near Worcester, but one of the dozen was good enough, and fortunate enough, to emerge in front at the end of the first National with a million-pound prize fund. Leighton Aspell, the winning jockey, had a story to tell too, having U-turned out of retirement back in 2007 after 18 months because he missed the buzz of the weighing room too much. Cheltenham is for National Hunt\u2019s mega-corporations, but Aintree, happily, will always be a place that gives everyone a chance. 7) Estimate tests positive for morphine, 23 July Of all the horses in all the yards in Newmarket that could have munched on a batch of contaminated feed in mid-June, one of them had to be Estimate. Runners from several well-known stables tested positive for morphine this summer, apparently thanks to poppy seeds in a rogue batch of foodstuff, but only Estimate allowed news organisations to link the head of state with a Class A drug and it was not a chance that any were about to miss. Estimate gave the Queen one of the greatest moments of her many decades on the turf when successful in the Ascot Gold Cup in 2013, but was disqualified from second place in this year\u2019s race, costing her owner nearly \u00a3100,000 and no end of uncomfortable headlines. 8) Roger Varian wins his first Classic, 13 September  And if it is not the first of many, it will be a major surprise. Varian has been quietly impressive, and progressive, ever since taking over the licence at Kremlin House Stables in Newmarket in 2011 from the late Michael Jarvis, who would be proud of the way in which his former assistant has maintained his record of understated excellence. Varian had a Group One winner in his first season and took another significant step forward when Kingston Hill, who was second in the Derby, landed the St Leger at Doncaster. Richard Hannon, who inherited a championship-winning stable from his father, also Richard, landed a Classic at the first attempt in May when Night Of Thunder took the 2,000 Guineas, and it will be a surprise if Varian is not a title contender too in the near future. 9) Sheikh Mohammed spends big, 7-9 October It takes more than the wealth of a mere king to compete at the top of Flat racing these days. Most of the major players are billionaires several times over with immense egos to match, who use the major bloodstock auctions as a chance to invite their rivals to feel the size of their wad. The al-Thani family from Qatar have been moving into thoroughbreds in a big way in recent years, but with the bruises from the Godolphin doping scandal now starting to fade, Sheikh Mohammed sent out a message at this year\u2019s most exclusive sale in Newmarket that the big boss is back in the hood. The Sheikh splashed out on nearly 40 of the most choicely bred yearlings and is clearly not going to shuffle quietly from the stage. The next few years will see plenty of ego-wrestling in the world\u2019s biggest races. 10) Births. To racing: a right, 3 December  The subject of racing\u2019s financial structure is, even for most keen followers of the turf, about as dull as a January morning in Reykjavik, but one of the more obscure announcements in George Osborne\u2019s Autumn Statement could prove to be highly significant for a sport which needs to grow up and look after itself. The racing right, which will have plenty of support in parliament whatever the result of May\u2019s general election, is supposed to allow racing to sell itself to the general public via the money they lose from betting on it, and could yet prove to be the most significant development since betting shops were legalised in the early 1960s. A sport which dates back to the late 1600s could yet be about the join the 21st century. \u2022 This article was amended on 5 January 2015.

After two weeks of intense negotiation, governments settled on a draft text that will hopefully lead to a successful global climate deal in Paris next December. While opinions vary regarding the success or failure of the outcome, there is another story emerging outside the negotiation room. This year\u2019s conference represented a highly-significant shift in the positive momentum to act on climate change. While negotiators engaged in contentious debates, businesses, non-governmental organisations and local authorities stepped forward to present their own climate initiatives and committed to more action on the ground. In this shift, renewable energy took centre stage. According to the Nazca Climate Action portal (named after Peru\u2019s famous geoglyphs), 319 cities and 261 companies are taking action on climate change. Of the 913 total actions recorded so far, 402 relate to energy efficiency and 242 relate to renewable energy.  Private sector initiatives \u2013 such as RE100 and the Global Investor Statement on Climate Change \u2013 have also emerged to encourage businesses and investors to phase out fossil fuels in favour of renewable energy. National governments are following suit. Peru plans to generate 60% of its electricity from renewable sources by 2024; Chile doubled its total renewable power capacity in 2014; Germany and Sweden will be carbon-free by 2050. The list goes on, including 144 countries with renewable energy targets, 50 countries supporting a total phase-out of carbon emissions by 2050 and 100 countries supporting zero emissions by 2100.  This action, and the hope it generates for an attainable solution to climate change, is being partly fuelled by the increasingly strong business case for renewable energy. Renewable energy is now the most cost-competitive source of power in many parts of the world.     Part of the London Array, the world\u2019s largest windfarm. Photograph: Thomas Trutschel/Photothek via Getty Images    In Dubai, solar-generated electricity reached a record-low price of six cents per kilowatt hour at an auction in November, cheaper than gas and coal. Similar low prices were achieved for solar power in Brazil in October. Research by the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena) shows that a doubling of the world\u2019s share of renewable energy by 2030, from about 18% in 2010 to 36%, would help avoid the worst effects of climate change and would be cheaper than not doing so.  When considering factors like the cost of ill health and environmental damage due to pollution, switching to renewable energy could save up to $740bn (\u00a3476bn) per year by 2030. If these costs were factored into energy prices, renewable energy and energy efficiency measures would be cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. Beyond cost, renewable energy improves public health and security, creates jobs, and boosts economic growth. Irena research finds that renewable energy jobs reached 6.5m globally in 2013 (the coal sector employed 7m people in the same year) and if steps are taken to double the share of renewable energy, this number could top 16m by 2030.  The momentum and action on renewable energy initiatives was not completely missed by negotiators in Lima. A carbon-free future is now formally part of the negotiations with the need to phase out fossil fuels considered one of the options in the draft negotiating text. While this is a good first step, the emerging momentum must be injected further into the political discourse to fuel the agenda on climate action and spur a rapid transition to a low carbon future. Putting a price on carbon to create a level playing field for clean energy solutions will be an important driver of that agenda. To accelerate the scale-up of renewables to the level required to avoid the worst effects of climate change, we need urgent, bold steps, from leaders willing to take the short-term hits from those who would rather carry on with business as usual. This needs to happen at global and local levels, engaging everyone from governments and corporations to investors and individuals. Vested interests and short-term thinking must be overcome. It will be a battle. But it is a battle we simply cannot afford to lose. \u2022 Adnan Z Amin is director general of the International Renewable Energy Agency (Irena)", "title": "The switch to renewable power is a battle we cannot afford to lose | Adnan Z.

In a sign of just how small and tight-knit the Estonian community is, the country\u2019s tech-savvy president Toomas Hendrik Ilves retweeted the message himself.      Cathy Wang\u2019s tweet   This was all so that Wang, a Canadian-Taiwanese user experience designer, could file her Estonian corporate taxes from the United Arab Emirates. As the owner of a business based in Tallinn at the time, the 32-year-old qualified for an Estonian ID card used to access everyday services online. In an online world that is more connected that ever before, the tiny eastern European country Estonia \u2013 or E-stonia as it has been dubbed \u2013 has breaking geographical boundaries with online technology for years. The ID card, issued to every Estonian at the age of 15, is supported via an IT platform called X-road and gives citizens access to around online 4,000 services \u2013 allowing them to manage their banking, register businesses, apply for child benefits, pay for parking tickets, and even check their medical records on their smart phones. It is used by 90% of residents, with about a third of Estonians using it to vote online. Now, foreigners like Wang are set to gain extended access to some services with Tallinn\u2019s new initiative \u2013 e-residency \u2013 giving people across the world access to Estonia\u2019s public and private online facilities.  The concept has been heralded as the first of its kind to bridge the \u201cdigital borders\u201d of a country, giving \u201cdigital citizens\u201d in other countries new rights in Estonia.  How does it work? On 21 October, Estonia\u2019s parliament unanimously voted to extend national digital e-residency rights to foreigners by the end of the year. With this e-residency programme, the least populous country in Europe, of 1.3 million people, intends to attract around 10 million \u201cdigital citizens\u201d by 2025. Estonians say their open and online culture \u2013 77% of the population has internet access \u2013 is behind this experiment on a state level, and there has been little controversy over the move. After all, this is the country which created Skype. From Tallinn\u2019s point of view, it hopes that foreign citizens will be encouraged to open an online business in the Estonian domain. Authorities say with their online system, applications can be processed in as little as 18 minutes.         An advert promoting Estonia\u2019s ID card    \u201cThe primary goal of the e-residency initiative has been straightforward: to make life and business easier for our international partners and non-resident foreigners who have a relation to Estonia \u2013 who invest, work or study here and do trade with us,\u201d says Siim Sikkut, who works in the government\u2019s strategy unit and is one of the drivers behind the scheme. Digital identity for non-residents will have nothing to do with constitutional rights or actual citizenship \u2013 it\u2019s about everyday matters. Access will come in the form of an ID card with a microchip and no photo, used with two-step authentication and a USB card reader.  \u201cGeneral banking, government dealings, company management, contracts, medical visits; non-residents will have secure access to online services and ability to digitally sign in legally binding manner just like Estonians do,\u201d says Sikkut.  Who will use it? More than 13,000 people from a range of backgrounds have signed up to be beta testers of the new scheme.  Azael Salazar Guajardo is from Mexico but is based in Ireland, and has an international company organising Latin dance events in Estonia. \u201cIt\u2019s where my daughter was born and lives, but I only moved to Europe two years ago,\u201d he says. \u201cA digital identity could help me a lot to manage business.\u201d Some are world nomads who see the advantages of e-residency. Aditya Nag is an Indian citizen who is living and working in the US. \u201cDoing business via an Indian identity is hard \u2013 I can\u2019t go the local government offices, fill out forms, and so on. Nor am I a citizen of the United States, and navigating the system here requires local knowledge or a competent attorney. I could have a company based in Europe, and be living anywhere. The future of the world will look like this.\u201d  Others, like Oleg Antipanov, are tired of the bureaucracy in their home countries. \u201cRussia has a lot of strange requirements for business. Here if you want to open a bank account you must show them pictures of your office and have a landline, even though some of us work remotely. Plus, after the crisis in Ukraine the pressure only got worse.\u201d  I could have a company based in Europe, and be living anywhere. The future of the world will look like this.  Small and medium enterprises are among the main beneficiaries of a system which says it will cut support service costs and red tape.  Ruth Chamberlain says she will be applying as soon as possible so that she can launch Investly, a business funding platform currently based in the UK, in Estonia. To do that she will have to visit the police or border guards in Estonia at the end of the year, undergo a background check and wait for two weeks before collecting the card, which costs \u20ac50 (around \u00a340), in person. However, Estonia is in the process of developing a system whereby this process can be available in embassies in the future, so e-residents would not need to set foot in the country to apply.  \u201cOur UK lenders would become e-residents, too, taking advantage of digital signatures and secure authentication,\u201d says Camberlain\u2019s Estonian colleague Siim Maivelthe, a 24-year-old from Haapsalu. \u201cIt will save time on signing documents for everyone.\u201d \u201cYou have to go where you have the best means of doing something. The UK has a lot of capital and highly talented people, but Estonia has the infrastructure,\u201d he says. Expansion So far, Estonia has had trouble keeping business talents from taking their skills abroad. Cathy Wang says she left Estonia because she was at the point when her business was expanding and she needed to tap into a bigger talent pool than the small Estonian startup culture offered.  \u201cThat matters a lot more than free public WiFi or easy-to-use government websites,\u201d journalist Mark Adomanis wrote in a recent opinion piece for Business News Europe portal. \u201cEstonia\u2019s model hasn\u2019t been attractive enough to prevent Estonians from pursuing their futures abroad.\u201d  At the moment I really don\u2019t see how it could benefit foreigners  Wang says she will be applying for e-residency, although she admits she doesn\u2019t know much about it, and is not yet convinced it will give her access to more benefits.  Wang says Estonia tends to underplay its developments, and has not properly explained how the new measures will help foreigners to access services in Estonia. She remembers discovering that she could suddenly use public transport (of trams and buses) in Tallinn for free via her ID card, but couldn\u2019t find any information online or on TV about the new roll-out. \u201cIf the government were a company, I see the benefits of getting even more data, although at the moment I really don\u2019t see how it could benefit foreigners.\u201d  In the UK, concerns about immigration and euroscepticism have dominated the political agenda, but Siim Sikkut says Estonia\u2019s outlook on both is more realistic. \u201cEstonian government and society have always understood that as small economy, we have to be open to the world - especially in trade and investment. Thus, any measures that improve the business climate are well-regarded and sought for.\u201d Privacy Critics have expressed concerns about the level of centralised data the Estonian government holds on those with ID cards. But Tallinn is keen to reassure people that privacy is paramount as they continue to expand e-services.  \u201cIf people can\u2019t trust e-services, they will never use them.  \u201cWe have to protect everyone\u2019s privacy,\u201d said Andrus Ansip, former Estonian prime minister and the European Commission\u2019s vice president for the continent\u2019s digital future, during a speech in October. \u201cTrust is a basic principle. If people can\u2019t trust e-services, they will never use them.\u201d Kaspar Korjus, a 26-year-old project manager on the scheme, who studied in the UK, admits that the project is still evolving, but believes it is positive that Tallinn seeks to be technologically innovative.  \u201cIt\u2019s most definitely an experimental development,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m bringing more of a start-up ideology to the government side.\u201d Ansip\u2019s role suggests this Estonian logic looks set to become more influential.  \u201cIt seems obvious that everyone else should be able to use these services,\u201d says Korjus. \u201cThe inspiration is from the negative side of how, in 25 years of the internet existing, places still don\u2019t do business internationally seamlessly. How can the internet not be ready yet?  In 25 years of the internet existing, places still don\u2019t do business internationally seamlessly. How can the internet not be ready yet?  \u201cThere\u2019s also so much fraud,\u201d adds Korjus. \u201cI was flat-hunting in France this summer and the first three turned out to be scams. I had to go to France to sort it out. This new initiative for Estonia is about trust, authentication and a simpler way of life. You can make a signature online. It\u2019s about very basic things.\u201d \u2022 This article was amended on 9 January 2015.

John Cage crowned her \u201cthat beautiful Persian girl\u201d. But the work of Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian had a different source, not in Warhol\u2019s Factory or Matthattan\u2019s Studio 54 nightclub but beneath the crystalline high-domed hall of the Shah Cheragh mosque in Shiraz, southern Iran. There she had experienced in 1966 a transformative encounter she compared to \u201cwalking into a diamond at the centre of the sun\u201d. The first museum survey of Farmanfarmaian\u2019s work isolates the past 40 years from an illustrious and lustrous career. Not only does it showcase a wealth of material, it highlights recent forays into moving sculpture and painterly works on paper that suggest fresh potential in an artist who is now 90. Infinite Possibility - Mirror Works and Drawings 1974-2014 is presented at the Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art in Porto this winter. Curated by the museum\u2019s director, Suzanne Cotter, the period of her career covered by the show reflects Farmanfarmaian\u2019s complete adoption of abstract geometry, a genre she made her own in the 1970s by translating it into three dimensions via mirrored sculptures and reliefs. The show presents the artist, who signs her works simply as \u201cMonir\u201d, as a prolific and interdisciplinary figure. Passing visitors to Serralves will be drawn in by the aesthetic majesty of the riches on display; on the surface alone, the dazzling lustre of this period of Monir\u2019s work is hard to resist. But beyond the glittering surface lies grit: in her practice as an abstract artist, Farmanfarmaian was and remains a pioneer both as an Iranian and as a woman - the most celebrated, and perhaps the only, contemporary artist working in mirror mosaic. Seeing Farmanfarmaian\u2019s work exhibited at Doha\u2019s The Third Line gallery in 2013 prompted Cotter to bring both Monir\u2019s sculptures and sketches to Porto. The artist later thanked Cotter in an interview with Artforum, the international magazine, for \u201cbeing the first to notice that my drawings were something different and deserved a special focus\u201d. Cotter wants the sketches to be seen as abstract compositions in their own right, not merely as preparation for three-dimensional works. Most of material included in Infinite Possibility comes from Monir\u2019s personal collection and has not been previously shown in public. As with many artists of her time, both she and her work were marked by Iran\u2019s political circumstances and a swathe of her oeuvre was lost in the throes of the 1979 Iranian revolution. Indeed, the works on paper were originally born out of necessity while the artist was deprived of her Tehran studio for a decade after leaving once again for New York when the revolution broke out. In her dedicated workshop, which reopened in Tehran in 2004, Monir works alongside artisans and craftsmen trained in traditional Persian decorative arts and construction including aineh-kari (mirror mosaics) and khatam-kari (inlaid marquetry). After some initial persuasion of the artisans in the 1970s, with some reluctant to take orders from a woman, many of the original craftsmen are dedicated to Monir and remain in her atelier today. In many senses, Monir works in the spirit of old masters. Her Tehran workshop recalls the studios of 17th-century European painters but also that of the collaborative Persian kitabkhana, which defined the artistic output of the early modern period in Iran. The kitabkhana (literally, \u2018the house of books\u2019) was the atelier of artists and craftsmen working in the service of the Persian court in the 1600s. Designs on paper were circulated around craftsmen from different disciplines, including potters, architects, and illuminators working on the borders of manuscripts \u2013 so that the same patterns appeared in different media. As with the kitabkhana, Monir\u2019s designs on paper have also informed textiles, sculpture and interior design throughout her career. Monir also has taken both sculptural and architectural commissions from a dedicated pool of patrons. Her large-scale mirror mosaics have iced everything from the Senate building in Tehran to the Dag Hammarskj\u00f6ld tower in New York. An early version of one of her Mirror Ball (1974) spheres sat on Warhol\u2019s desk: its sparkling siblings are lined up at Serralves in a silent disco.     Monir in her salon, Tehran 1975, as seen in the Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art catalogue.  Photograph: The Third Line, Dubai    Within Infinite Possibility is an example of her geometric vision in a domestic context. At the end of the exhibition are double doors of frosted glass that she originally fashioned for her New York apartment in the 1980s. A glowing portal, they throw grey light onto the surrounding walls through interconnected shapes scattered on their translucent surface. Monir\u2019s work fuses the heritage of traditional Iranian craft, particularly that of architectural decoration, with the western philosophies of minimalism and abstraction that informed her friends and contemporaries like Frank Stella and Robert Morris. Geometric, pattern-based abstraction has appeared in Islamic art for thousands of years. A similar aesthetic boomed in western art during the 1960s, as geometric minimalism became a popular art movement as a measured, rational cousin to the volatility and physicality of abstract expressionism. In both instances, geometric art retains a connection with scientific and mathematic thought, be it the late ninth-century Persian polymath Omar Khayyam or the modern geometer. The axiomatic coordinates of Farmanfarmaian\u2019s sculptures allows them to tessellate into the \u201cinfinite possibilities\u201d that she envisages. An animation in Bahman Kirostami\u2019s Monir, a documentary film about the artist which had its premier at the Serravles exhibition, shows the six elements of her Convertible Series (Group 8) from 2010, splitting and re-connecting into a kaleidoscopic myriad of combinations. Although Monir\u2019s work resonates with this global dialogue of sixties\u2019 minimalism, her mirror sculptures are not only dimensional but also display a unique animate quality. It was an idea sparked from watching the changing hues play across the glass interior of the Shah Cheragh mosque as people circulated within. Surfaces of her Families (2011-2013) \u2013 groups of up to six variations on a single shape, grandly showcased in the second half of Infinite Possibility \u2013 are similarly faceted so that \u201cevery colour moves\u201d, as the artist explains in the Kirostami documentary: the experience changes each time a visitor is reflected in the work\u2019s surface. The monumental, rotating Square (2014) signals a move into kinetics, where twisting quadrangles are stacked on top of each other, their surface reduced from the signature scattering of mirrored pieces into a single veneer of polished steel. Considerations of Monir\u2019s oeuvre have often searched for spiritual symbolism. This results not just from her connections with traditional craft but from the influence of religious architecture seen in the mosque niches of her grand Murquanas (2012) or the origami-esque Nomadic Tent Design (1978). And with the mathematical foundations of repetition and progression, many have deconstructed her works to find a connection to Sufi numerology. But the artist shakes off such claims in Kirostami\u2019s Monir, where she describes her motivation as purely secular and formalistic. There are no attempts to calculate the infinities of existence, she says: \u201cIt is just the hexagon and line, [there is] no philosophy behind it.\u201d Her method of working is simultaneously intuitive and calculated. In another scene from Monir, which takes place in her workshop, the artist grazes a ruler across a sheet of squared tracing paper, taking a pencil to shade in a grid of lozenges, whilst muttering a chant of \u201chere, here, and here\u201d. There are echoes of automatism in the impulsiveness of her drawing, at odds with the mathematical perfection of her sculpture. In her drawings, so generously laid out at Serralves, scribbled half circles are scattered like confetti over frames of geometric line. Within nets of triangles, rectangles and hexagons, Monir has inserted shards of mirrored glass, working across mediums whilst still employing her artistic vocabulary and compositional principles. Within the Serralves retrospective, Monir\u2019s work begins to occupy a third space, the intersection of an imagined Venn diagram between spheres of sculpture, architecture, painting and draughtsmanship. Works mounted on the walls take their cue from her education as a fine artist on canvass under the tutelage of the American modernist painter Milton Avery in the 1950s. In her most recent drawings, delicate petals and blooms have begun to creep in, making flowerbeds within her famous hexagons and undulating semi-circles. These motifs mark a return to softer elements plucked from the beginning of her artistic career, where she created still lives of flowers, department store illustrations and monotype prints \u2013 an endeavour which won her a medal at the 1958 Venice Biennale. Her always untitled sketches provide a greater scope for her experimentally. As the fine, calligraphic line used to conjure the blossoms increasingly intermingles with the graphic solidity of shape, the designs on paper would present a sculptural impracticality. One begins to realise that these drawings are, as Cotter says, more than potential brainstorms for large-scale works; they are drawings for drawing\u2019s sake. The textures within her works on paper explore the infinite possibilities that drive her practice even further than before, and are shown in compelling independence at this exhibition.  After having made art for more than 70 years, Monir Shahroudy Farmanfarmaian is still very much a practitioner. After Porto, the exhibition will be travelling to Monir\u2019s second home, with a showing at the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York opening in March. The author\u2019s visit to the exhibit was supported by the Serralves Museum of Contemporary Art.

The Airbus boss had been expecting a call to his office in Toulouse. It was Tim Clark, chief executive of Dubai-based airline Emirates, the biggest buyer of the planemaker\u2019s A380 \u201csuperjumbo\u201d. Clark was angry. He wanted to know why Airbus finance director Harald Wilhelm had just raised the prospect of the death of the A380. The aircraft cost $25bn (\u00a316bn) to develop, but it has struggled to chalk up the large orders Airbus had envisioned, at $440m each. So far, it has just 318 orders, compared with the 1,200 that Airbus thought airlines needed in that size category \u2013 it carries around 550 passengers \u2013 when it began marketing in 2000. Wilhelm sparked panic among Airbus customers and shareholders when he told analysts it would break even on the aircraft up until 2018, \u201cif we would do something on the product, or even if we would discontinue the product\u201d. The indiscretion let slip an internal debate at Airbus about the future of the world\u2019s largest jetliner. However, it was the first time the Franco-German manufacturer had publicly admitted it was contemplating pulling the rug on the programme. \u201cI am not particularly happy, as you can imagine,\u201d Clark fumed. \u201cWe are on the hook for this plane. I get pretty miffed when we have put so much at stake.\u201d Emirates has 55 of the giant planes in service and has placed orders for a further 85. The carrier accounts for 40% of the total orders for the aircraft, so any squeak from Clark will reverberate around Toulouse. Airbus has attempted to soothe fears about killing off its marquee plane by saying it was more likely to modify the aircraft and launch a model with more fuel-efficient engines, known as the A380Neo (new engine option), or a bigger \u201cstretch\u201d version. \u201cThe entire Airbus top management continues to believe strongly in the market prospects for the A380, but any investment requires a sound business case, which we will continue to study.\u201d Clark said if Airbus did press ahead with the engine upgrade, which could improve fuel efficiency by up to 15%, Emirates would eventually replace all 140 of its superjumbos with the upgraded version. Since the plane\u2019s first commercial flight with Singapore Airlines in 2007, Airbus has struggled to sell the A380. The global economic downturn hit airlines hard, forcing many out of business. Those that survived have turned to using smaller, twin-jet models that are more fuel efficient and can fly to more airports. One industry source said: \u201cWe still haven\u2019t come out of recession and for companies to put major assets like this on the balance sheet is a big ask.\u201d The A380 works best when flown on popular routes, or from capacity-constrained airports, such as Heathrow. But many airlines have struggled to make the investment profitable. Alexandre de Juniac, chief executive of Air France-KLM, aims to cancel the last two of a dozen A380s the airline has on order and swap them for smaller models. He said recently: \u201cIt\u2019s an excellent plane but it only works for the right destinations.\u201d This year looks like it will be the first since the A380 entered service without a new airline customer. The only buyer has been a leasing company that has yet to line up a single carrier to take any of the 20 planes it ordered. James Hogan, chief executive of Etihad, this month ruled out further A380 purchases as he took delivery of the airline\u2019s first \u201csuperjumbo\u201d. His frank assessment that Etihad would not be affected by the ending of A380 production added weight to fears that Airbus has struggled to find any more buyers. Hogan said: \u201cWhen you are taking 10 aircraft, whether Airbus continues the production line or not isn\u2019t an issue.\u201d Airbus is suing Japan\u2019s Skymark Airlines after cancelling an order for six A380s amid fears that it would not receive payment from the airline, while Virgin Atlantic and Air Austral are among the carriers increasingly unlikely to proceed with orders. Clark is baffled by the way rival airlines use the A380, noting the odd seating configurations that some use. Emirates is using the plane as its main jet because air travel is forecast to double in the next 10 years to 7bn passengers annually. So it is convinced that airports and airlines will need huge jets like the A380 to cope with the surge in demand. \u201cIt\u2019s a great aircraft,\u201d Clark told Airlineratings.com. \u201cIf airlines don\u2019t believe they can fill an A380, their business model is wrong.\u201d He said if a new model was built it would be as economical to fly as the Boeing 777X long-haul jet, which is being introduced in 2018. \u201cWe will buy 140 of the A380Neos,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as I am around, I am going to continue to fight the battle for the A380. The world needs [this aircraft].\u201d He described the plane as a \u201cpassenger magnet\u201d and reckons the five that Emirates operates each day between Dubai and Heathrow are 95% full. While the Dubai carrier is loath to see the A380 cancelled, perhaps even more is at stake for Britain\u2019s economy. Any move to kill off the \u201cqueen of the skies\u201d is sure to cause anguish at Airbus\u2019s two main British plants. All of the wings for its planes are designed in Filton, Bristol, and assembled at Broughton in north Wales. Broughton\u2019s new north factory is one of the biggest in Britain and contains a huge, automated rivet gun which is five storeys high. It takes this giant industrial stapler 10 days to punch 750,000 rivets into precise locations on both wings. It would take more than a month for two teams of 20 people on each wing to do the same job. The wings are the most complicated and most important part of the plane and there are thousands of well-paid, highly skilled British jobs that rely on the work. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot hanging on the future of this programme for Britain,\u201d an industry source said. However, insiders suggested that Wilhelm\u2019s gaffe and Clark\u2019s angry response had refocused Airbus\u2019s top team on sorting out the A380, which may give the programme a shot in the arm. The Emirates chief urged the manufacturer to step up its A380 marketing efforts. He also criticised Airbus for focusing too heavily on an upgrade of its best-selling A320 short-haul plane. \u201cWhat is happening over there?\u201d he fumed. \u201cI would like a first-hand understanding on where it is going.\u201d Whatever Airbus decides, some believe the A380 is already destined for the history books. Richard Aboulafia, aviation analyst at Teal Group and a long-time critic of the giant jetliner, said the fresh crop of wide bodied, twin-engine planes coming to the market signalled the death of the A380. \u201cI don\u2019t think it will last for more than a few years into the next decade,\u201d Aboulafia said. \u201cThe quicker Airbus lets go, the quicker it can devote its marketing efforts to other products.\u201d A380 FACTFILE \u25a0 The Airbus A380 made its first flight on 27 April 2005 and entered commercial service in October 2007 with Singapore Airlines. \u25a0 It is the world\u2019s biggest jetliner at 73m long, 24.45m high and with a wingspan of almost 80m. \u25a0 Each of the A380\u2019s giant wings, which are designed and made in Britain, can hold up to 125 tonnes of fuel. This gives it a flight range of 15,700 km, or enough juice to fly non-stop from Dallas to Sydney. \u25a0It takes 3,600 litres of paint to cover the 3,100 sq m (33,000 sq ft) exterior of the aircraft. \u25a0There is 530km of wiring in each A380 aircraft.", "title": "A380\u2019s failure to take off puts future of the \u2018queen of the skies\u2019 in doubt", "sentences": ["It was Tim Clark, chief executive of Dubai-based airline Emirates, the biggest buyer of the planemaker\u2019s A380 \u201csuperjumbo\u201d.", "The world needs [this aircraft].\u201d He described the plane as a \u201cpassenger magnet\u201d and reckons the five that Emirates operates each day between Dubai and Heathrow are 95% full.", "While the Dubai carrier is loath to see the A380 cancelled, perhaps even more is at stake for Britain\u2019s economy."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-28T09:02:10Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/cities/2014/dec/30/which-city-has-the-biggest-new-years-eve-fireworks", "tags": ["Cities", "London", "Sydney", "Dubai", "New year", "Life and style", "UK news", "World news", "Australia news"], "article": "It costs \u00a31.8m and lasts just 11 minutes \u2013 but London\u2019s increasingly famous New Year\u2019s Eve fireworks display is by no means the most extravagant or expensive. Right now in Dubai, Sydney, Paris, Edinburgh, Rio and other cities across the world, teams dedicated to creating these whizzing, banging spectaculars are getting ready to mark 1 January 2015 with tons of gunpowder.  Indeed, enormous fireworks displays have become the ultimate status symbol for moneyed cities. They aren\u2019t just about doing something visually extraordinary: their purpose is to invite the world\u2019s eyes to admire your city looking at its most magical.  \u201cPictures of London at its best are beamed around the world reminding people how important it is,\u201d says Edward Lister, the Mayor of London\u2019s chief of staff. He says the fireworks display ensures the capital is regarded as one of the world\u2019s \u201ctop\u201d cities. Since its first event 11 years ago, the city\u2019s fireworks display is now so popular that this year, for the first time, it has been ticketed, to limit the number of people trying to squeeze on to the Southbank to 100,000. Last year half a million tried. \u201cThere is only enough room for 100,000 people to really enjoy the display \u2013 that\u2019s the reality,\u201d says Jim Donald of Jack Morton Worldwide, the company hired by Greater London Authority to organise the event. Donald says the positive PR the city gets from the display is \u201cimmeasurable\u201d, and claims it significantly boosts profits for hotels, restaurants and bars.     Fireworks explode from the Burj Khalifa, the world\u2019s tallest tower, in Dubai on January 1, 2014. Photograph: AFP/Getty Images    The event uses 400 different types of firework to create 10,000 explosions. These are fired from the London Eye, three barges and 14 pontoons.  Darryl Fleming of Titanium Fireworks, the event\u2019s pyrotechnic designer, says he starts choreographing it in in September when the soundtrack \u2013 \u201ca mash-up of the year\u2019s big tunes\u201d - is finished. \u201cThe music dictates what fireworks we use. If it\u2019s something erratic, I\u2019ll go for Scrabbly Comets, or if it\u2019s slow and evocative I\u2019ll go for something more ethereal. There\u2019s a Brocade Waterfall firework that\u2019s very stunning. I\u2019d fire shells above that to empower the audience.\u201d Fleming and his team start physically constructing the display on 27 December and work right up to the wire. \u201cWe can\u2019t get to the Eye until it closes at 5.30pm on New Year\u2019s Eve,\u201d he says. \u201cThen we\u2019ve got three and a half hours to rig 1,200 fireworks. That\u2019s the most nerve-wracking bit for me.\u201d The firing system is controlled by GPS: at midnight, a satellite sends a signal to the system to start firing. \u201cWe turn everything on 15 minutes before midnight, and then you just have to wait. This is one of those jobs where you can\u2019t have a bad day at the office.\u201d While massive and complicated, however, London\u2019s fireworks display is still something of an up-and-comer. The tradition for huge spectaculars arguably began with Sydney\u2019s Millennium display. There, the firing system is operated by software on 18 computers and a data signal that is synchronised with the display\u2019s soundtrack. When the music starts to play to the audience, the firing locations receive this data signal and it triggers the explosion of 11,000 aerial shells and 40,000 comets and mines off the Harbour Bridge, Opera House and several barges. The cost? Australian $7.2m (\u00a33.79m). Its producer Aneurin Coffey argues that the price tag is offset by the A$133m it injects into Australia\u2019s economy each year. There\u2019s also a strong branding imperative: because Sydney is the first city to welcome the new year, images of its display are the first to be featured on news channels all over the world.  Keeping it \u201cfresh\u201d is paramount, says Fortunato Foti of Foti Fireworks, who has been designing the display since 1997. \u201cWe\u2019ll only use about six effects we\u2019ve used previously,\u201d he says.      Fireworks are readied before being loaded on to barges in Rio de Janeiro.

London is planning to use a new Chinese firework this year called the Happy Smiley Face. \u201cWithout giving too much away, it will go off during a piece of music that\u2019s particularly evocative of the age,\u201d says Fleming. China\u2019s pre-eminence in firework production is actually somewhat ironic, considering that despite being a global leader in firework production, the country has banned New Year\u2019s Eve displays, citing air pollution. State newswire Xinhua is urging families to use \u201cflowers and electronic substitutes\u201d instead. Although there isn\u2019t really an arms race between cities for the newest fireworks \u2013 development tends to focus on improvement by making colours brighter and shapes more geometric \u2013 it is competitive.  \u201cHugely competitive,\u201d says Chris Pearce, managing director of Jubilee Fireworks, the 2013 champions of the World Pyro Olympics. \u201cNurturing talent takes a long time, this isn\u2019t an industry you can easily walk into.\u201d Pearce thinks the best NYE displays are in London, Sydney, Dubai and Paris. \u201cTaipei was on that roll call of cities for a while, but fell off because they weren\u2019t doing anything more creative than anyone else.\u201d Coffey and Donald both confess to keeping an eye on what the other cities are doing \u2013 and they even speak to their counterparts in Rio, Edinburgh, Dubai, Paris and New York. \u201cWe all have different ambitions,\u201d says Donald. \u201cLondon is very lucky, in that we have a unique backdrop to work with. That\u2019s a point of difference. Rio is huge \u2013 mile upon mile of barges to fire the fireworks from \u2013 but it has no iconic landmark to give it context. Also, you can\u2019t compete with the number of fireworks Dubai fires from the Burj Khalifa \u2013 it\u2019s monstrous.\u201d      Fireworks light up the New Year over Sydney Harbour, Australia. Photograph: Damian Shaw/EPA    In fact, with its last New Year\u2019s Eve celebration, Dubai broke the Guinness record for the world\u2019s largest pyrotechnic display, setting off 500,000 fireworks in six minutes. The event cost $6m (\u00a33.86m), making it also the world\u2019s most expensive display, pipping Sydney, London, Edinburgh and Rio to top spot. And when it\u2019s all over? For Donald, the planning for New Year\u2019s Eve 2015 starts with a full debrief on 6 January. \u201cEvery year you just want to get better and better,\u201d he says. \u201cIt never gets boring.\u201d", "title": "Bangs for their bucks: which city has the biggest New Year's Eve fireworks?", "sentences": ["Right now in Dubai, Sydney, Paris, Edinburgh, Rio and other cities across the world, teams dedicated to creating these whizzing, banging spectaculars are getting ready to mark 1 January 2015 with tons of gunpowder.", "Fireworks explode from the Burj Khalifa, the world\u2019s tallest tower, in Dubai on January 1, 2014.", "\u201cNurturing talent takes a long time, this isn\u2019t an industry you can easily walk into.\u201d Pearce thinks the best NYE displays are in London, Sydney, Dubai and Paris.", "\u201cTaipei was on that roll call of cities for a while, but fell off because they weren\u2019t doing anything more creative than anyone else.\u201d Coffey and Donald both confess to keeping an eye on what the other cities are doing \u2013 and they even speak to their counterparts in Rio, Edinburgh, Dubai, Paris and New York.", "Also, you can\u2019t compete with the number of fireworks Dubai fires from the Burj Khalifa \u2013 it\u2019s monstrous.\u201d      Fireworks light up the New Year over Sydney Harbour, Australia.", "Photograph: Damian Shaw/EPA    In fact, with its last New Year\u2019s Eve celebration, Dubai broke the Guinness record for the world\u2019s largest pyrotechnic display, setting off 500,000 fireworks in six minutes."], "publicationDate": "2014-12-30T12:26:47Z"}, {"webUrl": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/dec/31/heathrow-airport-dubai-world-busiest", "tags": ["Heathrow airport", "Air transport", "Dubai", "UK news", "Heathrow"], "article": "Heathrow has lost its crown as the busiest airport in the world for international passenger traffic.
